It provides infor mation on its research programs and productivity , dissem ination of research findings through publications in international journals, invited lectures and session chairmanship in national and international conferences, invited seminars at academic, research and clinical departments worldwide, as well as offered poster and oral presentations at national and international conferences. The report also provides information on the Division's involvement in teaching and training of undergraduate students, graduate students at the Master's and PhD level , as well as postdoctoral fellows in the field of cancer epidemiology. The information presented here focuses on the work done by Dr. Franco and his staff and trainees, as well as his collaborative work with other faculty members who are affiliated with the program. Over the years we assembled a multidisciplinary team with expertise in epidemiology, microbiology, gynecology, pathology, dentistry, psychology, biostatistics, and immunology. Publications and presentations were not obtained from these other faculty memb ers since for the most part the ones relevant to this Division were done in collaboration with Dr. Franco and are therefore already included in th is report . Cancer Research Society Division of Epidemiology - Report of Activities, 1995 -2019 8 JULY 5, 2019 | 1. INTRODUCTION In 1986, the Cancer Research Society (CRS) provided an endowment of $1.5 M for the creation of the CRS Division of Epidemiology at McGill University . The first Director of the Division was Dr. Gerry Hill ( 1988 -1989) . In January 1990, this Division became part of the back -then newly created Department of Oncology, which also incorporated the Divisions of Cancer Research, Clinical Oncology, Radiation Oncology and Palliative Care. Between 1990 and 1994 , Drs. Brian Leyland -Jones and John Bailar were the Interim Director s of the Division until 1995 when Dr. Eduardo Franco w as appointed as permanent Director . In May 1992, thanks to an endow ment from the Bronfman family, the Gerald Bronfman Centre for Clinical Research in Oncology at 546 Pine Avenue West was officially opened. This building not only became the focal point for oncology clinical trials at McGill and the location of the Department's administrative offices, it also became home to the CRS Divisi on of Epidemiology. The Division occupie d a suite of offices on the first floor and basement of the Gerald Bronfman Centre , for the Director, his administrative and research staff as well as graduate students and fellows pursuing training in cancer epidemiology. In February 2017, the department was relocated to 5100 de Maisonneuve Blvd West, 7th floor, suite 720, and was rena med as the Gerald Bronfman Department of Oncology . The CRS Division of Epidemiology is also known as the Division of Cancer Epidemiology within the Department of Oncology, and the Cancer Epidemiology Unit within the McGill Department of Epidemiology , Biostatistics , and Occupational Health. Its mission is five fold: To conduct epidemiologic research on the etiology and prognosis of cancers of global public health importance with an emphasis on proposing preventive strategies. To provide advanced training in cancer epidemiology and prevention to graduate students and health professionals. To provide epidemiologic oversight and expertise to clinical collaborators in oncology . To provide advice to governmental and non -governmental organizations involved in cancer control policy . To advise pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies in developing cost-effective agents and tools for cancer prevention and screening . Over the last thirty years, the Division has focused its cancer epidemiology research programs in eight areas: 1. Cervical cancer and that human papillomavirus (HPV) -associated malignancies 2. Upper aero -digestive tract cancers 3. Infections and inflammation in cancer etiology and prognosis 4. Childhood malignancies (Wilms' tumour & other ) 5. Prostate cancer 6. Other cancers: endometri um, esophag us, bladder, lung, breast 7. Screening methods, modelling 8. HIV epidemiology Cancer Research Society Division of Epidemiology - Report of Activities, 1995 -2019 9 JULY 5, 2019 | 2. PROMINENCE OF THE RESEARCH PROGRAM Refer to section 5 in which we list the various research projects , as well as the s tudent s and fellows associated with each. 2.1. Cervical cancer research Our division is involved with many productive research tracks but our cervical cancer prevention research program stands out because of its long-term history as well as national and international prominence . Figure 1 below illustrates the various components of cervical cancer prevention activities. Figure 1 . Cervical cancer prevention activities as components of a single process Our cervical cancer research program at McGill is the most productive in Canada and one of the top four in North America. Our research has provided much of the epidemiologic basis for the demonstration that HPV infection is the cause of cervical cancer. Ou r research has also proved the benefits of HPV vaccination to prevent cervical cancer and of new molecular technologies to improve cervical cancer screening. Because of the prominence of the Division's program, Dr. Franco has an extremely busy agenda as a guest speaker in national and international conferences and as an advisor to agencies such as NIH, CDC, WHO, PAHO, and IARC . He is also a frequent advisor to governments , industry , and teams involved with the health economics and health technology related to cervical cancer prevention. Some of our most prominent studies and activities are described below. Dr. Franco brought to the Division the Ludwig -McGill cohort study of HPV infection and cervical neoplasia (seed funding provided by the Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research and subsequently funded by NIH, CIHR, and NCIC). This long -term molecular epidemiologic investigation has been Cancer Research Society Division of Epidemiology - Report of Activities, 1995 -2019 10 JULY 5, 2019 | extreme ly productive, with 48 original papers, all of which are published in high -impact journals, such as JAMA, JNCI, J Infect Dis, Int J Can cer, Cancer Epidemiol Biom Prev and others, and has been highly cited (3040 citations, average of 63.3 per article) . It provided a great training platform to 12 MSc and 10 PhD candidates as well as 4 postdoctoral fellows. It was among the first to measure the incidence and clearance of HPV infections over time and to show the role of persistent HPV infection with oncogenic v iral genotypes in cervical carcinogenesis. It was also the first study to unveil the role of HLA polymorphisms in mediating viral persistence. Table 1. Ludwig -McGill Study: Extraordinary value of a professional partnership Figure 2. Number of citations to Ludwig -McGill Study papers Cancer Research Society Division of Epidemiology - Report of Activities, 1995 -2019 11 JULY 5, 2019 | Figure 3. Celebrating the 25th Anniversary of the Ludwig -McGill Cohort The Division has also conducted cohort studies of HPV infection among university students in Montreal and case-control studies of biomarkers of cervical cancer risk. Findings from these studies have been featured in prominent medical journals. One of these findings, the role of a p53 codon 72 polymorphism , resulted from our collaboration with McGill's Greg Mat lashewski, and has inspired dozens of subsequent similar studies and review articles. Our study of HPV transmission among university couples (HITCH cohort) is the first such investigation worldwide and the initial findings were used by health economists to analyze the cost -effectiveness of male HPV vaccination. So far, HITCH has produced 15 publications and will continue to be a valuable resource for producing several scientific and knowledge translation dividends. As the momen tum shifted to the HPV hypothesis in cervical cancer causation , the biotechnology sector began to develop tests for HPV DNA that could be used in cervical cancer screening. The fear of malpractice litigation in the US favored parallel use of this new test to compensate for the high false -negative rate of Pap smears. As a prelude to our own trials of HPV testing, the division contributed elegant demonstrations to show that the claims by the biotech industry that there were major gains in sensitivity were bia sed (in one of the only statistical papers in the history of the Amer J Obstet Gynecol , 1999 ). We were also the first to show that clinical trials of HPV testing compared with Pap cytology had to compensate for verification bias in colposcopy referrals to be able to reach valid conclusions (in a 2000 article in Cancer Epidemiol Biom Prev describing a pioneer trial done in Newfoundland and in a 2003 JNCI Monograph paper). Several subsequent trials began to use the approach we proposed. In 2002 , we launched the Canadian Cervical Cancer Screening Trial (CCCaST), a CIHR -funded randomized controlled trial of over 11,000 women in Montreal and Newfoundland that was the first to compare HPV testing directly to Pap cytology. The design and initial findings from this RCT, the first in North America, have appeared in the IJC and in the NEJM and are assisting the formulation of forthcoming guidelines in cervical cancer screening. A second generation study expanding on the findings from CCCaST was conducted in British Co lumbia (a $6.5 million study funded by CIHR) based on a design developed by the division (Dr. Franco is a coinvestigator in the latter study). The CCCaST trial's results have formed the basis for a change in paradigm in cervical cancer screening in Canada. Provinces such as Quebec, Ontario, British Columbia, and Newfoundland are beginning to reformulate their cervical cancer screening guidelines to include HPV DNA t esting as a primary technology. Cancer Research Society Division of Epidemiology - Report of Activities, 1995 -2019 12 JULY 5, 2019 | Around 1995, when the pharmaceutical giants Merck and GSK (then SmithKline Beecham) began to invest in developing HPV vaccines these companies sought our advice in their research and development. We have since collaborated with GSK in the design and analys is of their phase II trial of a bivalent (HPV types 16 and 18) vaccine . This trial's design and sample size were planned as per the results of the aforementioned Ludwig -McGill cohort study. This collaboration has resulted so far in 4 publications, two of w hich were published in the Lancet (2004 and 2006) . The Lancet editorial board elected the 2006 article among the most influential achievements in medicine in 2007. Most recently as we began to examine the possible impact of HPV vaccination on the prevale nce of cervical precancerous lesions in the population, we realized that a change in screening paradigm (HPV DNA testing followed by Pap cytology to triage those who were HPV positive) could fulfill the dual mission of being an adequate screening strategy as well as serving the role of post - vaccination surveillance . We have published a few articles on the merits of this strategy (e.g., Vaccine 2008, Arch Med Res 2009 , J Clin Virol 2016 ) and have devoted a special issue \"Emerging Paradigms in Cervical Cancer Screening\" in Preventive Medicine in 2017. Dr. Franco has been invited to lecture internationally dozens of times on this topic . A pragmatic phase of our research focus ed on opportunitie s for prevention using novel approaches with high translational potential. For that, w e launched two RCT of HPV prevention via a microbicidal gel (carrageenan), one for women (CATCH trial , launched in January 2013 ) and one for men who have sex with men (LI MIT-HPV trial , launched in February 2016 ). We began another RCT (TRAP -HPV study ) in January 2014 to assess the value of HPV vaccination in reducing heterosexual HPV transmission. We also launch ed in June 2015 a cervical self -sampling screening study (CASSI S trial) with the goal of validating a technique to increase cervical cancer screening coverage to remote areas (e.g., aboriginal populations or urban women who fail to attend screening). As illustrated in Figure 4, the CASSIS study resulted in two spin-off studies that aim to investigate host biomarkers (HPV DNA methylation) and p16/Ki67 dual cytology . Figure 4. CASSIS sub -studies: STAIN -IT and MARKER Cancer Research Society Division of Epidemiology - Report of Activities, 1995 -2019 13 JULY 5, 2019 | 2.2. Research on other cancer s and public health themes The division has been successful in other areas as well . Our studies of the etiology and prognosis of head and neck cancers and of childhood cancers have unveiled findings that would not have been possible if it were not for our tendency to innovate in study design. Our study of the possible harms from a needle exchange program in Mont real aimed at curbing HIV transmission among IV drug users introduced novel strategies of data analysis that enhance the validity of observational studies of controversial associations. Our research on diagnostic delays in oral cancer and childhood cancers have pointed the way for provincial policies at curbing regional disparities and in identifying gaps in deploying technical resources in oncology. Our research program in prostate cancer etiology and prevention has turned out important findings concerning the protective role of aspirin and other NSAIDs. We have also shown that, contrary to medical belief, endometrial polyps are not true cancer precursors and have also conducted a study th at showed the considerable reduction in complications using robotic surgery relative to conventional laparotomy or laparoscopic surgery.

Illustrative time line of RCTs 2.3. Additional academic activities From 1997 until 2004, the Division produced a regular newsletter containing summaries of the cancer epidemiology and prevention literature on a quarterly basis to assist the CRS with its mail - out funding campaigns. These layperson summ aries, called \"Facts and Stats in Cancer Epidemiology and Prevention\" were also regularly featured on the CRS website for many years. The \"Facts and Stats\" series was regularly provided to the CRS during that time period. A total of 26 quarterly issues wer e written by the Division staff and students, each with two summaries of key articles that had appeared in the medical literature and that were of broad interest to the population. The series was discontinued in 2004 because the internet became then a read y source of credible cancer information for patients and professionals. Our interns, graduate students, and postdoctoral fellows have the opportunity to present their own research work or discuss a published manuscript on a given topic during our one-hour \"Monthly Staff Meetings\" . At the beginning of each meeting , the Division's Director notifies the whole team about current accomplishments and upcoming events. Following this, an informal presentation is given by one team member (or several team members working on a common project) that will be useful to the presenter (s) (i.e., develop presentation skills and receive feedback) and the whole team. Our additional one-hour \"Weekly Academic M eetings \" serves a variety of purposes , ma inly keeping all team members updated on what everyone is doing . Each member is allotted five minutes to describe his/her work assignments and highlight what he/she has done in the previous week or plan to do in the upcoming week(s), leading to more collab oration among team members and encouraging senior members to mentor junior members. Our team is also annually present at the McGill Epidemiology, Biostatistics and Occupational Health Research \"Meet & Greet\" event; an opportunity for faculty and students to meet and share information about potentially available research opportunities.

Current research and a cademic staff As of June 2019 , the Division currently has 21 research and academ ic staff, as shown below. Figure 7. Organizational flowchart of the Division Cancer Research Society Division of Epidemiology - Report of Activities, 1995 -2019 16 JULY 5, 2019 | 3.2. Current adjunct and associate faculty A total of 13 associate or adjunct faculty are affiliated with the Division . Due to financial constraints it has not been possible to greatly expand the Division with full time faculty via tenure - stream appointments. However, in 2007 Dr. Agnihotram Ramanakumar joined the Division as a Research Biostatistician and was appointed as Assistant Professor in January 2011. The addition of faculty members with joint part -time appointments as well as adjunct and associate faculty has enriched the academic life of the Division. Associate and adjunct faculty members come from McGill and Un iversit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al as well as from academic institutions across Canada and in the United States. Several of the adjunct and associate faculty are former graduate students and postdoctoral fellows who have secured research positions at McGill or elsewhere (Paul Allison, Ann Burchell, Salaheddin Mahmud, Helen Trottier, Joseph Tota, etc.).

TRAINING AND EDUCATION Since Dr. Franco joined McGill and the CRS Division in 1995 , he has supervised 52 graduate students and 15 post-doctoral fellows at McGill (refer to detailed listing below), most of whom have successfully defended their MSc or PhD theses , and four of which received the Dean's Honour List award. One of his PhD students (Marie -Helene Mayrand) received the Principal's dissertation award of 2007, which is McGill's highest accolade for theses (only one is given every year). Our trainees have gone on to successful academic and research positions nationally and internationally and achieved associate or full professorship status. Examples follow: Canadian institutions: McGill University (Paul Pintos), University of Toronto (Ann Burchell), University of Manitoba (Salah Mahmud), Queen's University (Harriet Richardson) , University of Alberta (Ghislain Lugoma), Public Health Agency of Canada (Tory Atwood, Rhea Ferguson, Candace Sirjoosingh). U.S. institutions: Harvard University (Susan Brogly), Albert Einstein College of Medicine (Nicolas Schlecht, Abdissa Negassa), Uni versity of Chicago (Nader Sadeghi). University of Sao Paulo (Luciana Tomita, Rosario Latorre), University of Rio Grande do Sul (Bernadete Nonnenmacher). The division has regularly hosted guest researchers on sabbatical from B razil and Portugal who spend from 1 to 12 months during the summer and fall months at our McGill unit. 4.1.

Courses (See Appendix 1 for a list of courses taught by Dr. Franco) The CRS Division of Epidemiology is responsible for the teaching of cancer epidemiology and prevention to McGill students at the undergraduate and graduate level and for training the next generation of cancer epidemiology researchers. Since 1995, Dr. Franco has taught the only graduate -level cancer epidemiology and prevention course in Montreal, a popular 2 -credit ( 3-credit as of 2018) offering that attracts 15 -25 students every year. He began to teach in 2009 a new course on best practices in publishing clinical research, expanding on his editorial board service and experience in teaching such a course interna tionally. He also guest lectures in several undergraduate and graduate courses in cancer biology and clinical oncology every year at McGill. Left: A day in graduate course EPIB 671 . Right: Another day in 2019 . Dr. Franco is frequently invited to give short courses on cancer epidemiology and scientific publishing. He has taught such courses in Canada, Brazil, Chile, Venezuela, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Portugal, Thailand, and in the US.

On the 17th of September, 2018, our research nurses have relocated their practice from 1550 de Maisonneuve Blvd West, 2nd floor, H3G 1N2 to 5100 de Maisonneuve Blvd West Suite 740 (Room C), H4A 3T2 . Since then, recruitment for our three on -going studies ( CATCH , LIMIT -HPV , and TRAP -HPV) has taken place at this new location within our current headquarters of the Gerald Bronfman Department of Oncology , Division of Cancer Epidemiology . This was made possible through the generous support of the CRS. We took this opportunity to dedicate the Research Nurses' Office in honour of Dr. Pierre -Paul Tellier, our clinical collaborator on all three on -going studie s and on previous ones as well.
