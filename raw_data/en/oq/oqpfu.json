It is done by deliberately paying attention to the heart, and allowing its energy to flow to another person. The process of becoming a healer is nearly the same as the process of becoming healthy. As you learn and practice the basic skills, you will become healthier, and more calm. Warren Grossman's method is learned by an experiential curriculum. Students learn by doing.
