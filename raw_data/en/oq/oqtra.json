If you're a business owner and would like to be featured in this column, email [john.castelluccio@patch.com](mailto:john.castelluccio@patch.com). This week we're chatting with Amanda Bavaro, who recently opened up [Mind and Body Integration Therapies](http://mbintegration.com/home.html). The new health and wellness spa is located at 1 Roosevelt Ave. - Q: Tell us a little bit about your new business and your background. - A: Mind and Body Integration Therapies was opened in April 2012. My goal was to maximize one's own potential mentally, physically and spiritually by using different bodywork modalities. These modalities include deep tissue massage, Swedish massage, crystal healing, crystal massage, Reiki, meditation, magnified healing and more. I feel as though most people only focus on one of the three important parts within themselves. By combining all of these techniques one can activate the feeling of a healthy well-balanced self. I've been practicing esthetics and massage therapy for over five years. Three years ago I started my Reiki healing journey and I've never looked back! I love energy work so much I'm always learning more to add to my credentials. Recently I became a magnified healer this year! I enjoy not only making people's bodies feel better, but also helping them feel better emotionally and spiritually. - Q: What led you to want to open up shop in Peabody? - A: It actually came to me! I went to for treatment and one day the owner Pete van Twuyver told me he needed a massage therapist. I've known this for a while, but at first I didn't know if I wanted to do it. It was an unknown territory to me, working for myself, so I was a little hesitant! In the end, I thought I'd go for it. I love what I do, I love Peabody and the clients that come in are fantastic! One of the best decisions I've ever made. - Q: What's your take on the local business climate in the city? - A: I think Peabody is a great place to own a small business. I feel in this day and age people are becoming more drawn to small and local businesses. - Q: What else are you involved with locally? - A: . - Q: And lastly, what's one piece of advice you would give to someone contemplating opening their first business? - A: Don't stress it! You're going to make mistakes, but it is all worth it in the end because you are doing what you love.
