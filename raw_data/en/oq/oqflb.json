Shin](/Expert/82734993-Justin-Y-Shin)Acupuncturist San Francisco, CA It is important to know that acupuncture alone cannot provide weight loss.

[Long Vi Vuong](/Expert/82456011-Long-Vi-Vuong)Acupuncturist San Diego, CA This is a hard question to answer. Weight loss is used to address this. Diet, exercise, and with consistent acupuncture sessions. Two pounds a week is ideal and is the healthiest to lose weight without accumulating stretch marks. An acupuncturist will be able to explain all this, once he/she gives you an overall evaluation. [Natalie Ramsey](/Expert/3662693-Natalie-Elizabeth-Ramsey)Acupuncturist Montclair, New Jersey Having a past career in sports medicine and personal training, I can honestly say that eating correctly is 70% of the battle and exercise is 30%. Acupuncture can help by improving circulation of blood and energy, improving organ function to help detox the body and give you more energy, and by balancing hormones, which will improve your mood, sleep and energy. [Ginger Nguyen](/Expert/81227125-Ginger-Nguyen)Acupuncturist Redmond, WA Hi there! Thanks for your question! To be honest, I believe that your best approach is getting a day to day nutrition plan that helps you slowly and permanently change your dietary habits, an accountability partner and supplements/dietary advice to help reduce sugar swings and cravings and resolve any digestive problems. In my experience, acupuncture is very reliable for pain conditions but not as effective for weight loss. It doesn't reduce calories from ones diet or remove glucose from the blood or change macro intake (ratio between carbs-proteins-fats). I believe that acupuncture 1-2x a week may help anxiety or minor digestive discomfort related to the weight loss journey but it doesn't effectively and directly cause weight loss. Hope that helps!

[BoDanielle Park](/Expert/81227213-BoDanielle-Park)Acupuncturist Duluth, Georgia I would say 10 sessions for once a week. [Dr. Carol Revak](/Expert/2293443-Carol-Revak)Acupuncturist Tucson, AZ There are a variety of different acupuncture protocols used for weight loss. A popular one recommends 2 to 3 sessions a week for 4-6 weeks. However, it is possible that you could reach your weight loss goal in fewer treatments. After your weight goal is achieved, sometimes it is helpful to return for maintenance sessions at 1 or 2 per month.

Acupuncture works very good for weight control. 2. How many session usually depends on how the patient responds. In other words, If you don't respond the first 2-3 sessions, then it's no value to continue. 3. Usually 1 treatment should bring approximately 2-3 pounds of weight down. David 1.

David [Phranque Wright](/Expert/81225847-Phranque-Wright)Acupuncturist Chicago, IL There is no magic number for acupuncture treatments vs weight loss (or any other condition, really). The bulk of your weight loss regiment will be the diet and exercise portion. The acupuncture will help your metabolism, your digestion and your overall health and mental wellness, but it is not the object that will be reducing the weight. So, go as often as you like to see how it helps you along on your path. Stick to a good healthy diet and lifestyle and you'll reach your goals in an appropriate manner. You are in charge here, it is the work you do to reach your goal that will get you there - the acupuncture is only a tool to keep you overall balanced.

[Michelle Lee](/Expert/81891321-Michelle-Lee)Acupuncturist SMYRNA, GA Depends on where you are with your current weight. Diet and exercise are equally important to the acupuncture sessions to achieve optimal results. From my experience, 10-15 sessions alone are necessary to change the metabolism of a client. [Ms. Ellen D. Leonard](/Expert/1434534-Ellen-D-Leonard)Acupuncturist Grants Pass, OR I'm not sure I can answer your question. There are ear points that can help with cravings and psychological ups and downs, but the patient must also be actively involved via changes in diet that are healthful and can be maintained - i.e., not a \"diet\" per se, but rather a life change. Also, as we get older, exercise plays an ever bigger role in our ability to shed the pounds. Good luck! Your goal is admirable and attainable!! Good luck! Your goal is admirable and attainable!! [Daisy Dong](/Expert/1916920-Daisy-Dong)Acupuncturist Denver, CO It depends on many factors: the total overweight lbs, individual determination, family history of obesity, and so on. [Jeannette Kerns](/Expert/81227064-Jeannette-Kerns)Acupuncturist Saint Cloud, florida That's a tough question. A weight loss protocol in my clinic begins with lab work. The first step is to determine the cause of weight gain. If it's lack of diet and exercise, all the acupuncture in the world will fail to help a patient achieve the desired results, and step one would be to incorporate some food therapy and nutrition as well as an exercise program. If patients are already eating well, getting enough sleep, and exercising, then I'd run lab work to see if hormones are the issue. Hormones and stress are often the root cause. 12 sessions to sort all that out is about right. [Jeff Rippey](/Expert/81225813-Jeff-Rippey)Acupuncturist Saint Joseph, MO How many treatments is this going to take? - is a common question practitioners of Chinese medicine often receive. The answer can vary depending on what is being treated, how long that condition has been present, how well any given patient adopts diet/lifestyle suggestions and, to be honest, how skilled/experienced the practitioner happens to be. It sounds like you've already taken the first big step by addressing your diet. Assuming no underlying health/metabolic issues, I'd think something in the range of 7-10 acupuncture treatments spaced at one treatment per week would probably assist in getting you where you want to be weight wise. For the best results, make sure you're seeing an NCCAOM board certified acupuncturist. To find someone local to you, go to NCCAOM.org and click the \"Find a Practitioner\" link.
