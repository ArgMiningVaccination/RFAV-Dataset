The Continuous Update Project on breast cancer survivors is an extension of the Continuous Update Project (CUP) on diet, nutrition, physical activity, and cancer prevention. The current protocol for the Continuous Update on breast cancer survivors should ensure consistency of approach to the evidence used in the literature reviews for the WCRF/AICR Second Expert Report for cancer incidence and in the CU P. The starting points for this protocol are: The convention for conducting systematic reviews developed by WCRF International for the Second Expert Report.1 The recommendations of the Cancer Survivors Protocol Development Committee (Appendix 1) The protocol developed by the SLR group on cancer survivors for the Second Expert Report (SLR centre: University of Bristol) (Appendix 2) The peer-reviewed protocol will represent the agreed plan for the Continuous Update on breast cancer survivors. Should departure from the agreed plan be considered necessary at a later stage, this must be agreed by the WCRF/AICR Secretariat and the reasons documented.

BACKGROUND The Panel of Experts for the 2007 WCRF-AICR report concluded that the available evidence from clinical trials on nutrition and physical activity and cancer prognosis was limited, and did not support specific recommendations for cancer survivors1,2. The Panel recommended that all cancer survivors should receive nutritional care from an appropriately trained professional and if able to do so, and unless otherwise advised, cancer survivors should aim to follow the recommendations for diet, healthy weight and physical activity for cancer prevention. Advances in early detection and treatment have increased breast cancer survival considerably. With the increasing numbers of long-term survivors, research specific to cancer prognosis, new breast cancer events, quality of life and mortality is of considerable public health importance. In Europe, the five-year relative survival of women diagnosed with breast cancer in 1995-1999 is estimated to be above 82% in Northern Europe, France, Italy and Switzerland, and around 77% in the United Kingdom. In Eastern European countries, five-year relative survival is around 73% or lower3. In United States, the overall five-year relative survival for 1999-2006 has been estimated as 89% and for localized disease, the estimated five-year relative survival is 98% 4. Recent studies suggest that diet and exercise interventions may be of benefit in ameliorating adverse sequelae of cancer and its treatment, as well as cancer-specific survival and overall survival after breast cancer. 5-7 The objective of this project is to identify and summarize the available information from published epidemiologic research on lifestyle and several health outcomes among women with a history of breast cancer. This review differs to the Search Literature Review for the 2007 WCRF/AICR report in two main aspects: it will be focused on studies in breast cancer survivors and it will include not only clinical trials but also follow-up studies in breast cancer survivors. RESEARCH QUESTION. The research topic is: The associations between food, nutrition, dietary patterns, weight control, nutrition-related complementary medicine and physical activity with mortality, breast cancer recurrence, second cancers, long-term treatment side effects and quality of life in breast cancer survivors. 1.

SEARCH STRATEGY The search strategy will be: a) Search for all studies relating to breast cancer prognosis (mortality, breast cancer recurrence, second cancers, long-term treatment side effects and quality of life): Steps 1 to 5 were used by the SLR on breast cancer (Milan centre) to identify breast cancers. Steps 7 to 15 developed at the UK Cochrane Centre and used by the SLR on cancer survivors (Bristol University). The Imperial College CUP team expanded the search with step 16 neoplasms/rehabilitation/ to identify other dimensions. b) Search for all studies relating to food, nutrition, body fatness, complementary medicine, dietary supplements and physical activity: The CUP review team will use the search strategy developed by medical librarians and tested during the SLR for the WCRF/AICR 2nd Expert Report. The search was additionally reviewed and implemented for Ovid by a librarian at Imperial College (Appendix 3). The search strategy retrieves foods, macronutrients, micronutrients from diet and supplements, dietary supplements, herbs, breast feeding, anthropometric characteristics and physical activity. 4. SELECTION OF ARTICLES Only articles that match the inclusion criteria will be updated in the database. 4.1 Inclusion criteria The articles that will be included in the systematic review: Investigate the associations between food, nutrition, weight control, nutrition-related complementary medicine, physical activity and mortality, breast cancer recurrence, second cancers, long-term treatment side effects and quality of life in survivors of primary breast cancer. The study population are pre- or post-menopausal women with diagnosis of in situ or invasive breast cancer. Present results of primary analysis, secondary analysis or ancillary analyses of randomized controlled trials, or follow-up studies in breast cancer survivors. If the study is a randomized trial, the trial should include at least 50 participants and the length of follow-up should be at least six months Report a measure of the effect/association of the intervention/exposure on the outcomes relevant to this review. !(! The intervention/exposures investigated are those relevant to the WCRF/AICR 2nd Expert Report (food, nutrition, weight control, physical activity) and nutrition-related complementary medicine. Present results for any of the following outcomes: o Breast cancer mortality o Overall mortality o Any other mortality cause o Disease free survival (as defined by the authors in the identified articles) o Cancer recurrence o Second primary breast cancer o Other second primary cancer o Weight change o Quality of life (if the study is a randomized clinical trial, length of follow-up should be at least six months) o Development of comorbidities (e.g. fractures, cardiovascular disease, diabetes) o Long-term treatment related effects (e.g. lymphoedema, fatigue, osteoporosis). o Side-effect of diet-related modifications, physical activity interventions, nutrition-related complementary medicine, micronutrient supplementation or other dietary supplementation. Are original articles published in peer-reviewed journals. Are published in English language!!!!* * The search in this review will not be restricted by language. However, for feasibility reasons, only articles in English language will be included. Approximately 9% of clinical trials indexed in EMBASE are in languages other than English and from these about 2% are in Chinese language. Articles in non-English language relevant to this review can be identified when the title and abstract are translated to English, and when the translation provides enough information to decide if the article is relevant or not to the review. The references and abstracts of relevant studies published in languages other than English will be stored in a Reference Manager database. The WCRF Secretariat and the Expert Panel will decide what articles published in non-English language should be translated to English. !)! 4.2 Exclusion criteria The articles to be excluded from the review are: Pooled analysis and meta-analysis (these will be used as support for interpretation, but the data will not be included in the database.) Comments, reviews, conference abstracts. 5. EXPOSURES/INTERVENTIONS. The methods of exposure assessment will be extracted and whether the method has been validated, the number of items in the questionnaires and the number of assessments. The duration of the exposure/intervention will be recorded as well as the time between exposure assessment/intervention and outcome assessment. 5.1 Labels of exposure/interventions. During data extraction, interventions/exposures will be labelled using the exposure codes listed in the Guidelines for the search literature reviews of the 2007 WCRF/AICR expert Report1. The interventions/exposures are allocated under the main headings and subheadings listed in Appendix 4. For example, diet modifications -e.g. diets rich in fruit and vegetables and low in fats- will be coded under \"Dietary patterns\" and combinations of micronutrients in supplements will be coded under \"Dietary Constituents\". An additional main heading for \"Nutrition-related complementary and alternative Medicine\" has been added for this review (code 9 in Appendix 4) with the following subheadings: Traditional medicine, Naturopathy, Phytotherapy, Homeopathy. Biomarkers of exposure will be extracted under the heading of the corresponding exposure, Biomarkers for which there is no evidence on appropriate validity and repeatability will not be included in the review (List of biomarkers is in Appendix 5). 5.2 Timeframe of exposure assessment. The timeframe of exposure assessment in observational studies will be recorded as follows: -Exposure assessment refers to a period before primary breast cancer diagnosis (childhood, adolescence, adulthood). -Exposure assessment refers to the period during therapy for primary breast cancer. -Exposure assessment refers to a period after primary breast cancer diagnosis. 6. OUTCOME !*!The outcomes relevant to this review are: Mortality o All cause mortality o Breast cancer mortality o Other causes of deaths Disease free survival (as defined by the authors in the identified articles) Cancer recurrence Second primary breast cancer Other second primary cancer Weight change Quality of life [psychological well being (e.g. fatigue, depression) and function (including performance status) but not spirituality]. Treatment side effects such as lymphoedema, fatigue. Development of comorbidities. This includes bone health (e.g. fractures, cardiovascular disease, diabetes). Side-effect of diet-related modifications, physical activity interventions, nutrition-related complementary medicine, micronutrient supplementation or other dietary supplementation. There will not be specific search for markers of tumor biology (e.g. proliferation rate, apoptosis, circulating cancer cells) because they are not relevant outcomes of the review. Results on markers of tumor biology will be extracted under \"Notes\" only from articles that provide results on the relevant outcomes. 7. DATABASES The databases to be searched are: a) Medline. b) Cochrane Library: - CDSR (Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews): includes all Cochrane Reviews (and protocols) prepared by Cochrane Review Groups in The Cochrane Collaboration. - CENTRAL (The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials): is comprised of a merge of relevant records retrieved from MEDLINE, relevant records retrieved from EMBASE, all Review Groups' Specialised Registers and the hand search results register. c) EMBASE !\"+!8. HAND SEARCHING FOR CITED REFERENCES For feasibility reasons, journals will not be hand searched. The CUP team will review the references of meta-analyses, reviews and pooling projects identified during the search. 9. REFERENCE MANAGER FILES Reference Manager files are generated in the continuous update containing the references of the initial searches in all databases. 1) One of the customized fields (User Def 1) is named 'inclusion' and this field is marked 'included', 'excluded' for each paper, thereby indicating which papers are deemed potentially relevant based on an assessment of the title and abstract. 2) One of the customized fields (User Def 2) is named 'reasons' and this field should include the reason for exclusion for each paper. 3) The study identifier should be entered under the field titled 'label'. 4) One of the customized fields (User Def 3) is named \"study design\". This field indicates the study design of each paper: Randomized controlled trials excluding interventions during cancer treatment. Randomized controlled trials during cancer treatment. Group Intervention trials Observational studies where exposure refers to the period before breast cancer diagnosis Observational studies where exposure refers to the period from diagnosis through adjuvant treatment. Observational studies where exposure refers to the period after breast cancer diagnosis after adjuvant treatment. The Reference Management databases will be converted to EndNote and sent to WCRF Secretariat as part of the report. 10. RETRIEVING ARTICLES The references of articles retrieved in the searches in the different databases will be merged by the database manager into a Reference Manager (RefMan) database. !\"\"!Animal and in vitro studies will be excluded with the following stop terms: transgenic, mice, hamster, rat, dog, cat, in vitro. (This procedure was tested by the SLR team Leeds during the SLR for the 2007 WCRF/AICR expert report.) Non-relevant exposures under the Mesh term \"Complementary medicine\" will be excluded using the following stop terms: Acupuncture Therapy, Anthroposophy , Auriculotherapy, Holistic Health, Mind-Body Manipulations, Sensory Art Therapies, Speleotherapy, Spiritual Therapies, Shamanism, Aromatherapy , Eclecticism, Historical. The database manager will identify and eliminate duplicates in the RefMan database using as key terms the first author name, publication year, journal name, volume, starting page number of the article. Automatic searches for duplicates in Ref Man are not recommended because the references retrieved in each database may be exported differently. The reviewer will assess relevant articles on the Reference Manager database upon reading of titles and abstracts. The complete papers of relevant and potentially relevant references and of references that cannot be excluded upon reading the title and abstracts will be reviewed. A second assessment will be done after review of the complete papers. The assessments of inclusion of articles will be done in duplicate by two independent reviewers for articles published in 2009 and 2010. If there is full agreement in the selection, 10% of the remaining articles will be double assessed for inclusion. This decision is based on feasibility of the project with the existing resources. The WCRF secretariat and the Expert Panel will be consulted on this before changes to the protocol are implemented. 11. LABELLING OF ARTICLES For consistency with the previous data collected during the SLR process for the Second Expert Report, the CUP review team will use the same labelling of articles: the unique identifier for a particular reference will be constructed using S to indicate \"survivors\" and a 2-letter code to represent the cancer site (e.g. BR for breast cancer), followed by a 5-digit number that will be allocated in sequence. 12. DATA EXTRACTION Data extraction will be performed by the reviewer using a screen extraction form designed by the database manager of the CUP. Extractions will be double checked by a second reviewer for 10% of the extracted articles by the first reviewer. !\"#!The data will be extracted to the WCRF database located in a protected server at Imperial College London. The structure of the existing database will be adapted to the scope of the search on breast cancer survivors before the start of the search. Further modifications of the database structure may be needed during the search. 12. 1. Information to be extracted. The list of study variables for observational and intervention studies in the CUP database is in Appendix 6. For this review, new variables will be added: -Study type: Intervention study Follow-up study on breast cancer survivors -Characteristics of primary breast cancer: Distribution of \"in situ\" and invasive breast cancer in the study population Proportion of cases in which primary breast cancer was detected by screening. Distribution of the study population by stage at diagnosis Distribution by estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), human epithelial growth factor receptor 2 (Her2) status Distribution by cancer subtype defined by immunohistochemical analysis or gene expression profiling (e.g. Luminal A, Luminal B, etc as given in the manuscript) Distribution of the study population by treatment for primary breast cancer (surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, hormonal therapy specifying if tamoxifen, aromatase inhibitors, monoclonal antibodies such as herceptin, other treatments, unknown). 12.2 Choice of Result The results for all relevant exposures and outcomes will be extracted. In epidemiologic studies, authors often present a series of models, e.g. unadjusted, age-adjusted, multivariable adjusted models. Sometimes authors do additional adjustments for factors likely to be in the causal pathway (\"mechanistic models\"). The extracted results will be labeled depending on the model as: not adjusted, intermediately adjusted, \"fully\" adjusted, or mechanistic model. \"Fully\" adjusted models and \"mechanistic\" models will be extracted in this review. A \"fully\" adjusted model will be considered the most adjusted model in the paper that is not a \"mechanistic model\". If only an unadjusted or an age-adjusted model is given in the paper, this should be extracted. !\"$!The reviewer should indicate a \"best model\" for inclusion in reports and meta-analyses. Usually, the \"fully\" adjusted model will be considered the \"best model\". In there is a \"mechanistic model\", the \"best model\" for analysis will be the \"fully\" adjusted and not the \"mechanistic\" model. The results for subgroup and stratified analyses will be extracted and the models labelled as indicated before. The \"best model\" for analysis will be indicated by the reviewer. The authors of the papers will not be contacted during the process of data extraction. Only the data provided in the article will be extracted to the database. 12.3 Multiple articles Data should be extracted for each individual article, even if there is more than one article from any one study, unless the information is identical. The most appropriate set of data on a particular exposure will be selected among the articles published on a study to ensure there is no duplication of data from the same study in an analysis. 12.4 Quality control Inclusion assessment will be done in duplicate for articles published in 2009 and 2010. If there is concordance in the selection between the two reviewers, the quality control of the selection procedure will be done by a second reviewer on only 10% of the papers excluded by the first reviewer. This is due to limited resources (section 9 \" Retrieving Articles\"). Any disagreement between reviewers will be solved with the principal investigator at Imperial College. In case of doubt about the study selection, the WCRF Secretariat will be contacted for advice. When discrepancies are detected, the protocol will be revised to add more clarifications. Data extraction will be checked by a second reviewer. Only 10% of the data extraction will be reviewed. If there are discrepancies, another 10% of the extracted information will be checked. 12.5 Gene-nutrient interaction No attempt was made to critically appraise or analyse the studies that reported gene-nutrient interactions in the 2007 WCRF/AICR second expert report1. The results of relevant studies on gene-environment interactions will be described in a narrative review 13. ASSESSMENT OF STUDY QUALITY AND SUSCEPTIBILITY TO BIAS. The evaluation of randomized controlled trials will be based in the checklist proposed by the Cochrane Collaboration (http://www.cochrane-handbook.org/). !\"%!The dimensions of quality and susceptibility to bias in the check lists are: Selection bias: Systematic differences between baseline characteristics of the groups that are compared. Performance bias: Systematic differences between groups in the care that is provided, or in exposure to factors other than the interventions of interest. Attrition bias: Systematic differences between groups in withdrawals from a study. Detection bias: Systematic differences between groups in how outcomes are determined. Reporting bias: Systematic differences between reported and unreported findings. The items will receive score 1 point if susceptibility to bias is low and 0 if susceptibility to bias is considered high. The total score of the article will be the sum of the item scores (details in Appendix 7). Numerous tools have been proposed for evaluation of methodological quality of observational epidemiological studies but there is no agreed \"gold standard\" 8. We will assess the quality of observational studies using the Newcastle-Ottawa quality assessment scale, which is simpler to use and has been used in recently published meta-analysis (http://www.ohri.ca/programs/clinical_epidemiology/oxford.asp). The dimensions included are: Selection of study population (ascertainment of exposure is included in this dimension). Comparability: control for confounding Outcome: ascertainment and follow-up We will exclude the item \"representativeness of the study population\" as criteria of study quality, because it does not affect the study internal validity 8. The characteristic of the study population will be extracted and could be use for further analysis. Studies will not be excluded on the basis of study quality. The assessment of study quality will be used to inform narrative reviews and for sensitivity and meta-regression analyses. Scores of study quality or susceptibility to bias will be included in tables of study characteristics in the reports. 15. DATA ANALYSIS Meta-analyses and narrative reviews will complement each other. 15.1 When to do a meta-analysis !\"&!A meta-analysis for a particular exposure/intervention and outcome will be conducted when three or more trials or observational studies that can be combined have been published. If meta-analyses are not possible, the results will be summarized in a narrative review. Special care will be taken to avoid including more than once the results of the same study (e.g. previous analyses and re-analyses after a longer follow-up). 15. 2 Methods The methods that will be used to do meta-analyses will be the same methods used for the Second Expert Report1. Meta-analyses will be conducted separately by study type, outcome and timeframe of exposure (before diagnosis, during treatment, after treatment).The best model (most often the \"fully\" adjusted measure of association or effect) from each analysis will be used. In trials with multiple intervention arms and intervention of different types (e.g. one multivitamin supplement and one dietary counselling intervention), each arm will be compared with the usual treatment group (or specific placebo group) and analyzed separately. Consequently, some studies may contribute data to more than one analysis. When multiple interventions in a trial are of the same type, the results of each arm will be compared first with the results of the control data arm separately. If the results of each arm are consistent in size and direction of effect, the data from the interventions arms will be treated as one group. This method will avoid the control groups being included twice in the same meta-analysis2. Factorial trials will be analyzed by assuming no interaction between interventions. In meta-analysis of two categories (or ''high-low'' comparisons), summary RR estimates with their corresponding 95% CIs will be derived using fixed and random effect models 9. A difference in the point estimate in fixed and random effect analysis must indicate that results from smaller studies differ from those of larger studies. To estimate the dose-response relationship, category-specific risk estimates will be transformed into estimates of the relative risk (RR) associated with a unit of increase in exposure by use of the method of generalised least-squares for trend estimation10. When exposure levels are reported as means or medians for each category of exposure, these values will be used directly in the dose-response meta-analyses. If the exposure is given as an interval, the mid-point of the interval will be assigned to each closed-ended category of exposure. The median will be assigned to each open-ended category. The !\"'!median will be calculated assuming a normal distribution for exposure11. When categorical and continuous results are provided, the continuous results will be used in the dose-response meta-analysis. The relative risk estimates for each unit of increase of the exposure from each study will be combined by use of fixed and random-effect meta-analysis9. Forest plots will be examined as usual method of assessing and displaying heterogeneity between studies. Heterogeneity will be tested using the Q statistic. The amount of heterogeneity in each meta-analysis will be quantified with the I2 statisticc12. Influence-analyses to assess the effect of each study on the summary size effect estimates13. Publication and small study bias will be examined in funnel plots. If the number of studies allows it, the sources of heterogeneity will be explored with the use of meta-regression. Possible variables to be examined are breast cancer subtype, geographic area where the study was conducted, publication year, stage of disease, duration of follow-up, timeframe of exposure assessment. Other variables that may be considered as source of heterogeneity are characterisation of the exposure (FFQ, recall, diary, self-reported or measured anthropometry etc.) and adjustment for confounders. In clinical trials, variables to be considered are whether the outcome was the primary or secondary outcome or an ancillary analysis. The interpretation of these analyses should be cautious. If a considerable number of study characteristics are considered as possible explanations for heterogeneity in a meta-analysis containing only a small number of studies, then there is a high probability that one or more will be found to explain heterogeneity, even in the absence of real associations. The analysis will be done using STATA version 9.2 (College Station, TX, USA). 15.3 Missing values Failure to include all available evidence in the meta-analyses will reduce precision of summary estimates and may also lead to bias if propensity to report results in sufficient detail is associated with the magnitude and/or direction of associations. Published standard procedures 14 will be used to calculate missing information (Appendix 8). 16. REPORTS Content of the report: 1. Changes to the agreed protocol 2. Narrative summary of the results of the search and the data analysis !\"(!3. Results of the search. Flow chart showing number of records downloaded, number of papers thought potentially relevant after reading titles and abstracts and number of included relevant papers. The reasons for excluding papers should also be described. For each intervention, number of trials by outcome. For each exposure, number of studies by study type and outcome. 4. Tabulation of study characteristics Information on the characteristics (e.g. population, exposure/intervention, outcome, study design) and results of the study (e.g. direction and magnitude) of the new studies should be summarised in tables using the same format as for the SLR for the Second Expert Report1. The tables will include the scores of study quality. The tables for randomization controlled trials will be ordered by exposure as follows: Food-related interventions Micronutrient supplementation Physical activity-related interventions Nutrition-related complementary medicine. Combination of interventions The tables of study characteristic of clinical trials will include the following information: Trial reference, year Characteristics of study population (age, race/ethnicity, BMI, menopausal status, BRCA1-2 carrier) Characteristics of the tumour (stage, subtype, hormone receptor status) Treatment at time of intervention (after, during, unclear) Randomization, blinding Intervention, duration Follow-up time Number of events and total number of participants in intervention and control arms Percentage of missing outcome data Outcome Results and whether these are primary endpoints or secondary endpoints; final or interim analysis; ad-hoc analysis; based on intention-to treat analysis or treated; Matching criteria, adjustment factors in the analysis Quality score !\")!The tables for observational studies will be ordered by exposure and exposure assessment timeframe (before breast cancer diagnosis, during treatment or after treatment). The tables will contain the following information: Study reference, year Study design Characteristics of study population (age, ethnicity, BMI, menopausal status, use of HRT before cancer diagnosis) Number of cases and study size Whether exposure from foods or supplements, levels or increment Outcome Results Adjustment factors in the analysis Quality score 5. Description of results of assessment of quality and risk of bias of included studies Tabulation of results for individual items of the check lists. 6. Results of meta-analysis The results of meta-analysis will be displayed in tables and forest plots. The characteristic of excluded studies and reasons for exclusions will be tabulated.

Appendix 1: The recommendations of the Cancer Survivors Protocol Development Committee Population characteristics and subject eligibility to consider Inclusion criteria In situ cancer Record histological type; DCIS/LCIS/other; Report separately from invasive cancer if possible Historical studies Historical studies with data before treatment were considered valuable. DG said that an assessment of heterogeneity would be useful to determine whether historical studies reported different results from more recent studies. Stage of diagnosis - Include all studies with data from diagnosis onwards Exclusion criteria Male breast cancer eg mammographic density Pre-cancerous conditions - Exclude for breast cancer o May be important for other cancers Studies that report on a combination of different cancers ie. Breast and other cancers, without separate analyses on breast cancer survivors o Record these papers as they may be used in the future but do not include in this analysis Information to extract if reported in papers Stage at diagnosis o Include information on stage and grade of cancer Hormone receptor status o Extract information on hormone receptor status Treatment status o To include type of treatment. Need to develop broad groupings e.g. hormone therapy, radiotherapy, chemotherapy (adjuvant and neoadjuvant) and surgery, and combinations. o Duration of treatment and timing in relation to exposure assessment How cancer was detected (eg, screening) o People attending screening may be different and how cancer is detected affects prognosis so these details should be extracted. BRCA1, BRCA2 and molecular subtypes Menopausal status Age Country study carried out in o BMI range was considered important as heavier women might have different effects; therefore studies in Asia might get effect at lower BMI Pre-diagnosis factors o Include HRT use, diabetes status and treatment Study designs to include (exclude everything else) Follow up of cases from case-control studies Follow up of cases from cohort studies Cancer survivor cohorts (explicitly designed) Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) Exposures To include List of exposures used in previous SLRs (including body size measures and change in BMI) Supplements of substances found in diet e.g. vitamins (to include high dose vitamins) and soy Biomarkers of dietary intake Physical activity Metabolic biomarkers o These biomarkers might be important for interpretation of the data so extract these if reported in included papers eg IGF To exclude Herbal products Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) o There are a lot of agents tested in small populations. It was decided to restrict the products to those than are found in ordinary diets. o These products need to be taken into account in analyses so information on use of such products should be extracted if reported in papers. Nutrition support (e.g. enteral/parenteral nutrition) o Exclude as an exposure but extract if papers report on nutrition support as it may be a modifier Timing of exposure to include Pre-diagnosis Post-diagnosis Multiple time points o Extract information on timing of exposure in relation to time before/after diagnosis Endpoints/outcomes to include All-cause or cancer (all types) mortality Breast-cancer specific mortality Disease-free survival o It was questioned how we would define this. It was decided that anything survival related that could be understood in papers should be extracted. o Recurrence-free survival Recurrence New primary cancer (breast or other) o Breast cancer survivors are at increased risk of second primary breast and other cancers. This is important information; however will be unlikely to be able to analyse by specific cancers. Quality of life outcomes o Include only intervention studies with attention control/comparison groups that follow-up participants for at least 6 months.

Sources of support World Cancer Research Fund 4. Objectives To investigate whether dietary modification and exercise have a role in the management of, and ultimately survival from, cancer. 5. Background In 1996 there were over 10 million new cases of cancer worldwide and just over 7 million cancer deaths (WHO, 1997). Traditionally, cancer has been labelled as a disease of developed countries. Data suggests, however, there is also an increasing prevalence of the disease in economically developing countries, in particular in urban areas. These figures suggest that cancer is a matter for public health concern worldwide (WHO, 1997). The role of diet and exercise in the prevention of cancer has been extensively studied. The literature in this field was reviewed by a recent WCRF / AICR report: Food, nutrition and the Prevention of Cancer: a global perspective (WCRF and AICR, 1997). By comparison, there is considerably less scientific research on the role diet and exercise may play in the treatment of cancer. This means that there is greater uncertainty, for both health professionals and cancer survivors, surrounding decisions to include dietary modifications and / or exercise interventions as part of a holistic approach to cancer management (AICR, 2002a; AICR, 2002b). The role of biologically active components of the diet at various stages of the carcinogenic process is summarized in the WCRF/AICR report (WCRF and AICR, 1997). This, together with the reported evidence from epidemiological studies, has lead to a series of recommendations for changes in diet and activity levels to reduce primary cancer risk (AICR, 2002a). For cancer survivors the guidelines are less clear: the AICR state that '...most experts seem to agree that cancer survivors should consider research results regarding risk reduction for primary cancers as being relevant to their situation' (AICR, 2002a). A systematic review of the literature is needed to further clarify this2statement and the association between diet, exercise and cancer survival. To address this we intend to carry out two reviews: Review 1: Systematic review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) investigating the effect of dietary modification and exercise intervention on cancer survival Review 2: Finding and updating the most recent epidemiological reviews on the association between diet, exercise and cancer survival for each cancer site. Review 1: Systematic review of randomised control trials investigating the effect of dietary modification and exercise intervention on cancer survival. 1. Criteria For Considering Studies For This Review Type of studies All randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Type of participants Males and females of any age with a diagnosis of cancer. Study selection criteria Dietary modifications as a result of dietary life-style changes, dietary education, micronutrient supplementation and complementary medicine. Diet and life-style modifications consequent on the disease or its treatment will NOT be included. These include peri- and post-operative dietary modifications together with calorie enhancement for cancer cachexia. All exercise interventions will be included. Dietary modifications and exercise interventions will be included regardless of their duration or the route of dietary intake used. All concomitant interventions will be included. Types of outcomes survival / all-cause mortality cancer mortality primary cancer recurrence second primary cancer quality of life side effects 2. Search strategy All search strategies will be generated with the consultation of a medical librarian. The searches will not be limited to English. We will attempt to get translations of all non-English papers, which appear relevant. A second party will not independently verify translations. As far as possible, translators will be 'blinded' to the exact nature of the study. Only literature published in peer review journals will be included in the review (i.e. no 'grey literature' will be searched). Searching will be carried out using the following sources and time-periods: The Cochrane Library (2003, Issue 2). Searches will include: DARE (Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects); CDSR (Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews); HTA (Health Technology Assessment) and CENTRAL (The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. MEDLINE (2000-present). Medline has already been systematically searched - using a highly sensitive search strategy developed by Carol Lefebvre and colleagues at the UK Cochrane Centre (Dickersin K et al, 1994) - to identify all RCTs up to and including the year31999. The identified RCTs are listed in the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (found in the Cochrane Library, listed above as a source to search). For this reason we intend to only search Medline from 2000-2003. EMBASE (1980 - present) ISI Web of Science (1981 - present) BIOSIS (Previews) (1985 - present) AMED (Allied and Complementary Medicine Database) (1981 - present) Follow-up of references from relevant papers Personal communication with experts Search strategy for MEDLINE This search strategy will be adapted for use in all other databases. a) Searching for all studies relating to cancer and survival 1 exp neoplasms/ 2 cancer$.tw. 3 neoplasm$.tw. 8 recurrence/ 9 recur$.tw. 10 quality of life/ or quality of life.tw. or 11 rate/ 13 (manag$ adj3 cancer$).tw 14 or/5-13 15 4 and 14 b) Searching for all studies relating to dietary modification 16 exp \"food and beverages\"/ 17 potassium, dietary/ 37 iron, dietary/ 38 or/16-37 c) Searching for all studies relating to exercise modification 39 exp Exercise Movement Techniques/ 40 exp d) for randomised control trials - developed by Carol Lefebvre at the UK Cochrane Centre (Dickersin K et al, 1994) 49 randomized controlled trial.pt. 50 controlled clinical trial.pt. 51 RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS.sh. 52 RANDOM ALLOCATION.sh. 53 DOUBLE BLIND METHOD.sh. 54 SINGLE-BLIND METHOD.sh. 55 or/49-54 56 (ANIMAL not HUMAN).sh. 57 55 not 56 58 CLINICAL TRIAL.pt. 59 exp TRIALS/ 65 RESEARCH DESIGN.sh. 66 or/58-65 67 66 not 56 68 67 not 57 69 57 or 68 e) Selecting all RCTs on cancer survival that involve dietary or exercise modification 70 15 and 69 and (38 or 48)53. Methods of the review Data Collection An 'In/Out' form (appendix 1) will be used to assess each study's inclusion (or otherwise) into the review. The inclusion of studies will be assessed independently by two assessors and differences between reviewer's results will be resolved by discussion and, when necessary, in consultation with a third reviewer. A 'Data Extraction' form will be specifically designed for the review (appendix 2). Data abstraction will be performed independently by two researchers and differences between reviewer's results will be resolved by returning to the relevant literature, discussion and, when necessary, consultation with a third reviewer. Data will be collected on the following: Target group Cancer type Intervention type and details of how many arms Study Location Period of intervention Control group Compliance Experimental and control arm participant comparison (number, male:female ratio, age, ethnicity, non-compliance, number analysed for outcome measures Details of any switches in treatment condition Outcomes (whether analysed on intention to treat basis, comparisons between experimental and control arm) Quality of the trial (selection bias, performance and detection bias, losses to follow up) Data Analysis Where appropriate differences in outcomes comparing treatment and control groups will be combined across studies using standard methods for meta-analysis. Fixed (common) effect methods will be used. Forest plots will be used to display results and to examine possible heterogeneity between studies. In addition to standard tests for heterogeneity I2 statistics will be used measure the amount of heterogeneity (Higgins et al, 2002). In the presence of heterogeneity we will compare results from fixed effect and random effects analyses. Funnel plots will be used to explore \"small study effects\" (the tendency for smaller studies in a meta- analysis to show larger treatment effects) (Sterne et al, 2000). If funnel plot asymmetry is observed careful consideration will be given as to its causes as well as the possible impact, on the overall estimate of treatment effect, from any meta-analysis performed (Sterne et al, 2001a). Where there is sufficient data, sensitivity analyses will be carried out to investigate the impact, on the summary estimate of effect, of excluding studies with inadequate or unclear allocation concealment, trials in which blinding was not adequate and /or trials in which methods for dealing with loss-to- follow-up were not adequate. (The quality assessment section of the data extraction form will assess these characteristics). A preliminary search of the literature suggests that is highly unlikely that there will be enough studies for dose-response graphs to be plotted or for meta-regression analyses to be done. The design of RCTs means that confounding should not be an issue and so confounding will not be considered. All analysis will be undertaken using the statistical package Stata (version 8) in which a comprehensive set of user-written commands is available for meta-analysis (Sterne et al, 2001b).6Review 2 Finding and updating the most recent epidemiological reviews on the association between diet, exercise and cancer survival for each cancer site. 1.

Since the date of the last review will be different for each type of cancer it is necessary to create individual search strategies for each cancer site. The searches will be limited according to the date of the last review. If no review exists on a particular cancer site then the databases will be searched from all years. The search strategy listed below is for breast cancer. However, similar strategies will be created for each cancer site and adapted for use in all other databases.

Methods of the review Data Collection Where possible the most up-to-date review will be used to obtain initial data for each cancer site. Inclusion (or otherwise) of epidemiological studies published since the latest review will be assessed using an in/out form. The inclusion of studies will be assessed independently by two assessors and differences between reviewer's results will be resolved by discussion and, when necessary, in consultation with a third reviewer. Data abstraction forms will be specifically designed. Data abstraction will be performed independently by two researchers and differences between reviewer's results will be resolved by returning to the relevant literature, discussion and, when necessary, consultation with a third reviewer.11Data Analysis Observational studies, unlike RCTs, are susceptible to confounding and selection bias: as a result the findings from observational studies may be distorted. Simply increasing study numbers in observational studies will not necessarily reduce bias and confounding. In fact, smaller studies may be able to better characterise potential confounding factors and, therefore, give a more accurate picture than larger observational studies. For these reasons the general methods of meta-analysis - combining data and weighting studies according to their statistical size (the larger the study the greater the weight) - have been suggested inappropriate with regards observational studies (Egger et al, 2001). Meta-analysis of observational studies will, therefore, not be undertaken in this review. However, whilst meta-analysis is inappropriate a systematic review of the data is both plausible and appropriate. Where possible analysis will first focus on converting the results from each study into a suitable standard format to allow easy comparisons of results between studies. These results will then be tabulated and where appropriate 'Forest Plots' generated to give a graphical display of comparable results, together with their 95% confidence intervals, from each study. Any heterogeneity between study findings will then be investigated using sensitivity analysis to test the stability of findings across different study designs, approaches to exposure ascertainment and to selection of study participants. Using these methods, as outlined by Egger and colleagues (Egger et al, 2001), we will avoid generating spurious results and misleading conclusions which are otherwise a common problem when reviewing data from a number of observational studies which differ in study design. Furthermore, it will assist considerably in deciding what future RCTs may be usefully initiated. As already stated above confounding is an important consideration in observational studies and as part of the data collection we will note how confounding has been dealt with. All analysis will be undertaken using the statistical package STATA, version 8.12References AICR. Dietary Options for Cancer Survivors. Washington: American Institute of Cancer Research; 2002a AICR.

Tables of included and excluded biomarkers proposed by the SLR centre Bristol (SLR prostate cancer, cancer survivors). Extracted from: Food, Nutrition, Physical Activity and the Prevention of Cancer: A Global Perspective Systematic Literature Review - Support Resource SLR Prostate Cancer (pp 1185-1186) The reviewers of the SLR centre Bristol used two chapters (Willet: Nutritional epidemiology (Chapter 9), 1998; Margetts and Nelson: Design concepts in nutritional epidemiology (Chapter 7), 1997) to guide their decisions. If there was no info, the biomarker was excluded. If one of the chapters stated the biomarker was useful, the data on validity were checked. Biomarkers with a correlation >0.20 were included. If the chapters stated that there were no good biomarkers for a nutrient or that the biomarker was valid for certain range of intake only, the biomarker was excluded. It was assumed that if biomarkers measured in plasma were valid, this would also be true for serum and vice versa. The reviewers of the SLR centre Bristol have been more inclusive with respect to the validation required for biomarkers of important nutrients and have therefore added serum/plasma (more details below). They have also included biomarkers where validity is not possible: this happens in the case of toxins and phytochemicals where dietary data are sparse. Various contaminants, such as cadmium, lead, PCBs in the serum are also included now although validity data are not available. The level of these chemicals in human tissues is often the only available measure of ingestion. AIII-2 Measured in Include Exclude Copper, Copper/zinc Triglycerides acids, Monounsaturated fatty acids, Polyunsaturated fatty acids Lipids (as nutrients), Total fat (as nutrients), Total protein Urine 4-pyridoxic acid (vit B6) in 24-h urine Nitrosamines Xanthurenic 24-h fatty acids Glutathione peroxidase AIII-3 Measured in Include Exclude Plasma Vit D Vit E: alpha-tocopherol, gamma DHA fatty Alkaline phosphatase Minerals: Zinc, Copper, caeruloplasmin Other dietary Cholesterol, LDL, HDL Adipose fatty DHA (Docosahexaenoic) Hair Copper, Iron Cadmium Toenails or fingernails Selenium Cadmium, zinc AIII-4 Reasons for exclusion and inclusion of biomarkers proposed by the SLR centre Bristol. Extracted from: Food, Nutrition, Physical Activity and the Prevention of Cancer: A Global Perspective Systematic Literature Review - Support Resource SLR Prostate Cancer (pp 1187-1189) (Source: Willet: Nutritional epidemiology (Chapter 9), 1998; Margetts and Nelson: Design concepts in nutritional epidemiology (Chapter 7), 1997) Exposure Measured in Valid? Reason (Willett) Reason (Margetts / Nelson) Retinol Plasma/serum Yes Can be measured adequately, but limited interpretability in well-nourished population (p 190). Main biochemical marker of vit A intake is serum retinol (p 194) although in western countries dietary intake of this vitamin is only a very minor determinant of its plasma levels. Retinol-Binding protein Serum Yes Retinol levels are highly correlated to RBP(p192). May be measure of physiologically available form. Not if certain disease processes exist (p 192). Beta-carotene Plasma Yes Yes (p 194) although blood levels much more responsive to supplemental beta-carotene than beta-carotene from food sources (p 193) Yes (p 197) Alpha-carotene Beta-cryptoxanthin Lutein+zeaxanthin Lycopene Plasma Yes Yes (p 194) There is some evidence for interaction between carotenoids during intestinal absorption, which may complicate relationship between intake and blood levels (p 198) Vit E Plasma Yes Yes (p 196) NB. Strong confounding with serum cholesterol and total lipid concentrations (p 196). Plasma, red and white blood cells. Yes, if used for vit E supplements. Yes, although if used for diet, associations are only moderate (p199) AIII-5 Exposure Measured in Valid? Reason (Willett) Reason (Margetts / Nelson) Vit D: D25 (OH)D Plasma Serum Yes Yes (P 198/199) NB. Seasonal variation exists, especially in elderly populations, decreasing in winter and rising during summer (p 198) Sunshine exposure is most important determinant; level is better marker of dietary intake in subjects with low sun exposure Both can be used to measure vit D status, but the higher plasma concentration and lesser metabolic control of d25 makes this, by far, the better option (p 198). Vit D: 1.25 (OH)2D No No. Influenced by calcium and phosphate levels and parathyroid hormone (p 199). Vit D: Alkaline phosphatase activity Serum No No. Is indirect measure of vit D status and is susceptible to other disease processes (p 199) No info Vit C Plasma Leukocyte Serum Yes Yes (p 200). Leukocyte may be preferred for long-term intake and plasma and serum reflects more recent intake (p 201) Yes (p 209), vit C exhibits the strongest and most significant correlation between intake and biochemical indices. Known confounders are: gender, smoking Vitamin B6 Plasma Yes Yes response to supplementation shows response in PLP. PLP better measure of short term rather than long term Recent studies show that there is unlikely to be a strong correlation between dietary intake and plasma pyridoxal phosphate levels (PPL) PLP and 4 Pyridoxic acid Urinary Yes Urinary B6 may be more responsive to recent dietary intake than plasma PLP. Random samples of urine 4 -pyridoxic acid correlate well with 24 hour collections Folacin (folate) Serum Erythrocyte Yes Yes good correlation with dietary folate in both serum and erythrocytes Used for assessing folate status Table 7.11p Magnesium Serum Yes Yes stronger correlation with supplement users than with dietary Mg Iron Serum Hair/nails No No No, short-term variability is very high (p 208). No, remains to be determined Iron: Ferritin Serum Yes Meat intake predicts serum ferritin level (p 208) No marker of iron intake is satisfactory (p. 192) AIII-6 Exposure Measured in Valid? Reason (Willett) Reason (Margetts / Nelson) Copper : Superoxide dismutase Erythrocyte Yes Among four men fed a copper deficient diet for 4 months, erythrocyte S.O.D declined for all 4. Copper repletion restored S.O.D levels Copper Plasma/serum No No (p 211): large number of lifestyle factors/pathologic conditions probably alter blood copper concentrations (smoking, infections) Copper Hair No No evidence (212) and data suggests influenced by external contamination No. Copper-dependent enzyme superoxide dismutase in erythrocytes and copper-protein complex caeroplasmin in serum have been shown to be associated with copper intake, but these markers may be influenced by nondietary factors (p 193) Selenium Blood components Toenails Yes Yes. Erythrocyte is probably superior to serum as measure of long-term intake (p 206). Lower influence of environment in countries where wearing shoes is norm (toenails). Selenium status is reduced by smoking, also in older persons (p 207); Relationship of selenium with disease may be modified by other antioxidants (vit E and C) Yes (p 193). Relationship between selenium intake and biomarkers is reasonably good. Urine: reasonable marker, plasma reflects intake provided that the range of variation is large. Red cell and glutathione perioxidase are markers of longer-term intakes. Hair and toenails are alternative possibilities, although contamination of hair samples with shampoo must be controlled for Glutathione perioxidase Plasma Serum Erythrocytes Blood No Is poor measure of selenium intake among persons with moderate and high exposure (p 206) AIII-7 Exposure Measured in Valid? Reason (Willett) Reason (Margetts / Nelson) Zinc Metallothionein levels Any No No No (p 212) May be marker of short-term intake (p 213) No biochemical marker is a good indicator of zinc intake (p 192/193). This is, in general terms, also true for other trace metal nutrients such as copper, manganese, chromium, etc Lipids: total fats Any No No (p 213) No, there are no markers of total fat intake (p 215) Cholesterol, LDL Lipoprotein levels Serum No No, but may be useful to predict dietary changes but not for dietary intake (p 215) No, relationship dietary cholesterol and lipoprotein levels of cholesterol are complex and appears to vary across range of intake (p218) Linoleic acid Plasma Adipose tissue No Yes Plasma linoleic acid can discriminate between groups with relatively large differences in intake but performs less well on an individual basis (p 220) Yes (p 220) No consistent relation between dietary linoleic acid intake and plasma linoleic acid (p 220). Across the range of fatty acids in the diet, fatty acids levels in blood and other tissue (adipose tissue) reflect the dietary levels. NB levels are not comparable across tissues Marine omega-3 fatty acids (EPA, DHA) Serum Plasma Adipose tissue Yes Yes (p 222/223), although dose-response relation remains to be determined Monounsat fatty acids (oleic acid) Plasma Adipose tissue No No No, plasma levels are poor predictors of oleic acid intake, but adipose tissue may weakly reflect oleic acid intake (p. 224). Validity is too low Polyunsat fatty acids Adipose tissue Yes Yes (p 220) No info AIII-8 Exposure Measured in Valid? Reason (Willett) Reason (Margetts / Nelson) Saturated fatty acids (Palmitic acid, stearic acids) Adipose tissue Plasma Yes No Yes, long term sat fatty acid intake may be reflected in adipose tissue levels (p 224) No, levels of palmitic and stearic acids in plasma do not provide a simple index of intake (p 224). No info Trans-fatty acids Adipose tissue Yes Yes (p 225) No info Protein Any No No (p 226) No info Nitrogen Urine Yes Yes, but several 24-h samples are needed to provide a stable estimate of nitrogen intake (p 227) Nitrogen excretion increases with body size and exercise and decreased caloric intake Yes (p 219) One assumes that subjects are in nitrogen Balance AIII-9 Data on validity and reliability of included biomarkers Extracted from: Food, Nutrition, Physical Activity and the Prevention of Cancer: A Global Perspective Systematic Literature Review - Support Resource SLR Prostate Cancer (pp 1187-1189) Nutrient Biologic tissue Val./reproduc Retinol Plasma Validity 0.17 Borderline Correlation between pre-formed vit A intake and plasma retinol.

The median exposure for open ended-categories will be estimated by using the method of Chene and Thompson11 assuming a normal or lognormal distribution. However, if the number of groups is too small to calculate a distribution, the midpoint will be assigned to the lowest category. The upper bound plus the mid-range of the precedent category will be assigned to the highest category.
