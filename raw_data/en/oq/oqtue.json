We recruited 200 healthy homemakers to conduct a prospective observation study in Northern Taiwan. We measured heart rate (HR), systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic BP (DBP), peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR), and indoor air pollutants four times per year for each participant between 2008 and 2018. Moreover, a questionnaire related to essential oil usage, home characteristics, and health status was filled out with each participant. The association between essential oil usage and cardiopulmonary health was determined using mixed-effects models. The mixed-effects models showed a significant association between essential oil usage and adverse cardiopulmonary effects including increased HR and BP and decreased % predicted PEFR among participants with heavy use of essential oils. No significant association between essential oils usage and adverse cardiopulmonary effects was observed among participants without essential oils usage or participants with mild use of essential oils (less than one hour per day). We concluded that exposure to indoor air pollution related to essential oils was associated with adverse cardiopulmonary effects among participants with essential oil usage more than one hour per day.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2022-04-15", "cleaned_text": "Long-Term Exposure to Essential Oils and Cardiopulmonary Health from a Population-Based Study [https://doi.org/10.3390/atmos13040631](https://doi.org/10.3390/atmos13040631) [Feature Papers in Air Pollution, Health Effects Indicators, Exposome, Health]( /journal/atmosphere/special_issues/feature_paper_air_health )) Abstract: 1. Introduction [1](#B1-atmosphere-13-00631), [2](#B2-atmosphere-13-00631)]. People's exposure to indoor air in houses, workplaces, public buildings, or transportation exceeds 80% in developed countries [ [3](#B3-atmosphere-13-00631)]. Therefore, indoor air pollution control is an important public health issue around the world. However, indoor air pollution prevention is not always technically feasible. Although technology is advancing, no single physical-chemical technology is capable of controlling all indoor air pollutants in a cost-effective manner [ [4](#B4-atmosphere-13-00631)]. [5](#B5-atmosphere-13-00631)]. The effects of ambient essential oil on stress relief [ [6](#B6-atmosphere-13-00631), [7](#B7-atmosphere-13-00631)], malodor elimination [ [5](#B5-atmosphere-13-00631), [8](#B8-atmosphere-13-00631)], and heart rate (HR) and blood pressure (BP) reduction [ [9](#B9-atmosphere-13-00631)] have been reported in previous studies. However, essential oil is a kind of volatile organic compound (VOC) composed of hundreds of aromatic chemicals [ [10](#B10-atmosphere-13-00631)]. VOCs have been reported to be associated with asthma [ [11](#B11-atmosphere-13-00631)], chronic bronchitis [ [12](#B12-atmosphere-13-00631)], adverse reproductive effects [ [13](#B13-atmosphere-13-00631)], and adverse cardiovascular effects [ [14](#B14-atmosphere-13-00631)]. Moreover, exceeding the threshold of the therapeutic effect of essential oils could be the beginning of the period of the toxic effect [ [15](#B15-atmosphere-13-00631)]. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Participants and Study Design 2.2. BP and HR Monitoring and Recording 2.3. Indoor Air Pollution, Temperature, and Humidity Monitoring and Recording 2.4. Peak Expiratory Flow Rate Measurement 2.5. Statistical Analysis [16](#B16-atmosphere-13-00631)]. The outcome variables were SBP, DBP, HR, and PEFR, while the exposure variables were PM2.5 and TVOCs levels at 1-min (lag 0), 1-h (lag 1), and 2-h (lag 2) mean. Each regression model included fixed effects for age, sex, body mass index, education, family income, air conditioning times per week, window opening times per week, cooking times per week, cleaner using times per week, year and visit order, and random effect for the participant's identification number. The effects of indoor air pollutants on SBP, DBP, HR and % predicted PEFR were expressed as percent changes multiplied by the interquartile range (IQR) changes. 3. Results and Discussion 3.1. Results [Table 1](#atmosphere-13-00631-t001)). [Table 2](#atmosphere-13-00631-t002)shows that the participants with heavy use of essential oils had relatively higher levels of TVOCs and PM2.5 exposure than those with moderate, mild, or no use of essential oils (Scheffe's test, p-value < 0.01). In addition, the participants with heavy use of essential oils had relatively higher SBP, DBP, and HR but relatively lower % predicted PEFR compared with those with moderate, mild, or no use of essential oils (Scheffe's test, p-value < 0.01). No significant difference in temperature or relative humidity among the four groups was observed. [Table 3](#atmosphere-13-00631-t003). Increases in BP and HR and decreases in % predicted PEFR were significantly associated with increased TVOC exposure among all participants. The IQR increases in lag 1 TVOCs (0.79 ppm) accounted for a 4.21% increase in SBP but a 2.92% decrease in % predicted PEFR. Moreover, the IQR increases in lag 2 TVOCs (0.99 ppm) accounted for 7.89%, 3.58%, and 3.22% increases in SBP, DBP, and HR, respectively, as well as a 4.28% decrease in % predicted PEFR. Moreover, we found that lag 1 and lag 2 TVOCs were significantly associated with increased SBP (6.88-10.89%), DBP (3.41-6.54%), and HR (3.44-5.67%) and decreased % predicted PEFR (5.67-9.88%) in participants with heavy use of essential oils. Moreover, the association of TVOC exposure with decreased SBP or HR was observed in participants with mild use of essential oils. There was no significant association between TVOCs and any health measurement among participants with moderate or no use of essential oils. [Table 4](#atmosphere-13-00631-t004)). We first analyzed the association of PM2.5 at lag 0, 1 and 2 with health measurements among all participants. The results showed that PM2.5 at lag 1 was consistently and significantly associated with all health measurements. Then we explored the association between PM2.5 at lag 1 and all health measurements for four groups. We only observed effects of PM2.5 at lag 1 on all health measurements among participants with heavy use of essential oils. 3.2. Discussion [17](#B17-atmosphere-13-00631)]. Theoretically, these substances showed anti-inflammatory and anticancer properties in laboratory studies [ [18](#B18-atmosphere-13-00631), [19](#B19-atmosphere-13-00631), [20](#B20-atmosphere-13-00631)]. However, commercially available essential oils often contain fragrance ingredients and other undescribed or unknown ingredients. Fragrance ingredients are typically a complex mixture of several dozen to several hundred chemicals [ [21](#B21-atmosphere-13-00631)], primarily synthetic compounds [ [22](#B22-atmosphere-13-00631)]. Moreover, fragrances have been recognized as triggers for asthma [ [22](#B22-atmosphere-13-00631)] and adverse health effects, including migraine headaches, asthma attacks, respiratory difficulties, chest discomfort, fast or irregular heartbeat, etc. [ [23](#B23-atmosphere-13-00631), [24](#B24-atmosphere-13-00631), [25](#B25-atmosphere-13-00631)]. Therefore, the increased risk of long-term exposure to essential oils on the health of the human cardiovascular system is still worthy of attention and caution. [14](#B14-atmosphere-13-00631)], the present study once again found that light use (less than one hour per day) of essential oils may help to reduce BP and HR. The main difference between this study and our previous study was the study population. Our past study was aimed at occupational users of essential oils, but the present study was conducted among non-occupational homemakers. Both studies confirmed the effect of light use of essential oils on the cardiovascular system, reported in previous studies. Seo [ [26](#B26-atmosphere-13-00631)] reported an association between essential oil aroma inhalation and a lower BP and pulse rate in female high school students. Sebastian and Kear [ [27](#B27-atmosphere-13-00631)] conducted aromatherapy inhalation to participants before a cardiac rehabilitation session over 8 min using lavender essential oil. BP, radial pulse, and stress levels were measured among participants in aromatherapy and non-aromatherapy sessions. The results showed a reduction in BP following both aromatherapy and non-aromatherapy sessions with no statistical significance between sessions and concluded that aromatherapy may be a useful stress management tool for cardiac rehabilitation patients. Kim et al. [ [28](#B28-atmosphere-13-00631)] investigated VOCs in essential oils and the effects of the inhalation of the essential oils in 10 adult male and female subjects. They observed that the subjects' SBP and HR decreased after inhalation of the essential oils. Accordingly, short-term exposure to essential oils may help to reduce BP and HR for physical relaxation. [29](#B29-atmosphere-13-00631)]. Inhalation exposure to VOCs, O3, PM2.5, etc., can induce pulmonary oxidative stress, inflammation, and autonomic dysfunction in human subjects. Long-term exposure to these air pollutants and recurrent cardiopulmonary inflammation may result in lung function impairment, myocardial infarction, lung cancer, etc. [ [30](#B30-atmosphere-13-00631)]. Therefore, our study findings imply that aromatherapy inhalation should focus not only on the positive effects of essential oils on physical relaxation but also on negative effects of overexposure to essential oils to minimize cardiopulmonary health risk. 4.
