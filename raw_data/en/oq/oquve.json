Verywell Health / Kristin Kempa Whether you're seeking stress relief or relaxation, the use of essential oils may help you experience the benefits of aromatherapy. You can use these oils during a massage, in a warm bath, or simply by smelling the contents of a bottle. But Alison Seponara, MS, LPC, a Pennsylvania-based licensed professional counselor and anxiety healer, says that one of the best ways to use essential oils for anxiety relief and relaxation is with a diffuser. There are a variety of essential oil diffusers on the market, and while they may look different, they're all designed to spread a therapeutic aroma throughout the room. Dispersing the oils in the form of breathable mist, diffusers are a safe and popular alternative to synthetic air fresheners and scented candles. We researched dozens of essential oil diffusers and evaluated them for reviews, safety, design, value, coverage area, capacity, mist output, and additional features. Each essential oil diffuser chosen is determined to be the best based on these factors. A social work and psychotherapy expert on our Medical Expert Board reviewed the claims in this article around the types of essential oil diffusers and how to use them.

Price at time of publication: $34 Key Features Dimensions: 4.3 x 4.3 x 7 inches | Capacity: 300 milliliters | Auto Shutoff: Yes | Run Time: Up to 24 hours | Type: Ultrasonic How We Selected To select the best essential oil diffusers, we interviewed two experts to get their advice on what features to look for and what to avoid. Alison Seponara, MS, LPC, a Pennsylvania-based licensed professional counselor and anxiety healer Tina Wismer, DVM, a veterinarian who specializes in animal poison control Based on their recommendations, we conducted extensive research to find the best diffusers on the market today. We included ultrasonic, evaporative, nebulizing, and heat diffusers in our search, as well as a variety of sizes and timer settings. Finally, we selected products that feature quiet and simple operation. What to Look for in an Essential Oil Diffuser Type Ultrasonic The most common type of essential oil diffuser is an ultrasonic diffuser. This method uses ultrasonic vibrations to break down the mixture of water and essential oils to produce a cool, fine mist that simultaneously humidifies the air. Alison Seponara says she prefers this method of diffusing as it only requires a small amount of essential oil to envelope one's space in a lasting scent. She adds that ultrasonic diffusers are often very easy to operate. Nebulizing As the most powerful, fast-acting mode of defusing, a nebulizing essential oil diffuser uses pressurized air to emit a fine mist\u2014which translates into releasing the oils in their purest form. This method is often utilized for therapeutic benefits due to its potency. On the other hand, nebulizing diffusers do come with a bit more noise, often producing a humming sound. Evaporative Evaporative essential oil diffusers disperse fragrant oil through evaporation. This type of diffuser comes in two styles, both with and without a fan. The traditional evaporative diffuser contains a pad or filter to house the essential oils and an internal fan to circulate the oil particles throughout the room. The simplified version comes without a fan and relies on natural airflow to disperse the fragrance. Evaporative diffusers are generally budget-friendly and are ideal for smaller spaces. Heat As the name suggests, a heat essential oil diffuser heats the oil until the particles evaporate and disperse into the air. The most effective heat diffusers use low levels of heat to slowly and evenly evaporate the oil molecules into the air. The heating source may come in many forms including electricity, a candle, or a lamp ring (similar to a ring light). Each style uses a tray to hold the oil near the heat source. The downside to this method is that heat can change the chemical properties of the essential oil and in some cases, limit the benefits. Timers and Auto Shutoff Timers allow users to run the diffuser for a set amount of continuous or intermittent run time without having to manually start and stop each session. This also helps conserve oil. For those who like to diffuse at night, setting a timer before falling asleep is helpful so that the diffuser doesn't run all night long. Not only is this a waste of oil but it's not recommended to diffuse for extended periods of time. Having an auto-shutoff feature is a must-have for safety reasons along with preserving the longevity of the diffuser. Auto shutoff kicks in when the water tank is low to protect the diffuser from burning out. Size When considering an essential oil diffuser, think about the size of the room you plan to use most for diffusing. For optimal results, the room's size should align with the diffuser's area coverage range. Another key metric to consider is capacity. The larger the reservoir or water tank, the longer the diffuser will run without needing a refill. On the other hand, if you enjoy defusing a different scent each session, you may benefit from a diffuser with a smaller capacity. Noise Level Consider the noise level associated with each type of diffuser. If you're someone who enjoys diffusing at night or while doing work, a silent or whisper-quiet model might be your best bet. For the most part, ultrasonic and heat diffusers are quiet, while nebulizing diffusers tend to produce the most noise of the bunch. Some fans on evaporative diffusers come with a slight soundtrack. Frequently Asked Questions How many drops of essential oil should you put in your diffuser? The general guidance surrounding essential oil quantities for diffusing suggests starting slowly until you get used to a scent and know how your body reacts. The number of drops you put into a diffuser depends on the unit's size. Diffusers under 100 milliliters require three to five drops, a 200-milliliter unit requires six to ten drops, a 300-milliliter unit requires nine to 12 drops, and a 400-milliliter unit requires 12 to 15 drops.If you're using more than one essential oil, divide the total number of drops needed by the different scents. For instance, a 200-milliliter unit may be filled with three drops of lavender essential oil and three drops of bergamot\u2014not six of each. How to clean an essential oil diffuser Before the first scrub down, always check a diffuser's cleaning protocols to ensure its longevity. Get acquainted with the unit's layout\u2014like the placement of the reservoir's drainage outlet\u2014to avoid getting water inside any electrical parts. It's also important to note that while some people like to clean with vinegar, some manufacturers state that doing so will automatically void the warranty of certain models. For optimal performance and longevity of an ultrasonic diffuser, empty and dry out the diffuser's water tank after each use and give it a quick wipe down using a microfiber cloth. For a deeper clean, use the tiniest bit of plant-based dish soap in the water reservoir. Then rinse with water and let the parts air dry. Next, dip a Q-tip in rubbing alcohol and glide over the ultrasonic chip or plate to remove any excess oil. Some people prefer to wipe down the base and lid with a baby wipe.To clean a nebulizing diffuser, use a dropper to add a few milliliters of rubbing alcohol to the reservoir. Turn on the diffuser for anywhere from 5 to 10 minutes. Pour the liquid out and let it air dry. If the diffuser has a quick-change top, simply soak the top in rubbing alcohol for 30 minutes to an hour and let it air dry.For evaporative diffusers, if the pad is reusable, ideally wash it between uses. Clean the tray with warm water and plant-based dish soap using a soft, microfiber cloth. Also, use the cloth to gently dust the fan blades. For a heat or electronic essential oil diffuser, after the unit cools, use this same method to clean the tray and wipe off the heat plate. How long should you run an essential oil diffuser? In general, aromatherapists suggest running an essential oil diffuser for 30 minutes at a time. One of the dangers of leaving it on all day is that the oils can cause sensitivity or allergic reactions in some cases. Seponara says she prefers to diffuse for an hour at a time, which is easy if your diffuser has a timer. She adds that she often runs her diffuser a couple times each day. What essential oils are safe to diffuse around pets? For pet owners, Tina Wismer, DVM explains that in many cases, it's ok to use an essential oil diffuser for short periods of time in a secured area. Wismer is a Senior Director of Toxicology at the ASPCA Animal Poison Control Center. \"With inhalation from using an essential oil diffuser, the concern is more about respiratory irritation than exposure to a specific scent,\" she said.Diffusing should be avoided around cats and dogs with a history of asthma or respiratory problems as well as around birds, which are known to have extremely sensitive respiratory tracts. In addition, small animals like hamsters and guinea pigs may not be able to move away from the aroma and can intake high amounts of vapor.Wismer advises pet owners to \"pet-proof\" each designated diffusing space. If your pet has been in direct contact with essential oils and is experiencing health issues, contact your veterinarian or call APCC's hotline at (888) 426-4435.
