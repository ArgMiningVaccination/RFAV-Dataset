[ KHN: Inside The Tactical Tug Of War Over The Controversial Alzheimer's Drug ](https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/medicare-ruling-aduhelm-controversial-alzheimer-drug-critics/) The drug industry, patient advocates, and congressional Republicans have all attacked federal officials' decision to decline routine Medicare coverage for a controversial Alzheimer's drug. They've gone as far as to accuse them of tacit racism, ageism, and discrimination against the disabled \u2014 and hinted at a lawsuit \u2014 over the decision to pay only for patients taking the drug in a clinical trial. The drug, Aduhelm, with a listed price tag of $28,500 a year, has had few takers in the medical world. Brain doctors are leery of administering the intravenous drug because it appears dangerous and largely ineffective. Many of the nation's most prestigious hospitals \u2014 such as the Cleveland Clinic, Johns Hopkins Hospital, and Massachusetts General in Boston \u2014 have declined to offer it to patients.

Their produce is fresh, green, abundant. Organic options beckon as you walk in the door. So it gnawed at me, a Black woman, when I recently walked into a supermarket in a lower-income L.A. neighborhood and was greeted instead by an array of processed, high-sugar, high-sodium foods \u2014 often offered with a nice discount: Coca-Cola products, five 2-liter bottles for $5; sugary cereals, two for $4; boxed brownie and cake mixes, four for $5. The pandemic had underlined long-standing health disparities of Black and brown communities.

She's mildly allergic and the only pet she had as a child was a hermit crab. But once she learned that specially trained dogs could help her daughters with their medical needs, she was willing to do anything to make it happen. Her oldest daughter, Suraiya, 6, was diagnosed with autism and sensory processing challenges. Soon after, 4-year-old Phoenix was diagnosed with epilepsy. \"Our family is very likely to end up with two service dogs,\" Mahnaz said. \"I think we're probably looking at $10,000 per dog.\" (Hawryluk, 2/16) [ Stat: Senate Narrowly Confirms Robert Califf To Lead The FDA ](https://www.statnews.com/2022/02/15/senate-narrowly-confirms-robert-califf-to-lead-the-fda/) The vote puts an end to one of the most protracted and controversial confirmation processes in the FDA's 115-year history. No candidate for the agency's top job has so narrowly squeaked through the confirmation process. The only candidate that came close was Scott Gottlieb, who led the agency during the Trump administration and was confirmed 57-42. Ultimately, four Democrats voted against Califf's nomination: Joe Manchin (W.Va.), Ed Markey (Mass.), Richard Blumenthal (Conn.), Maggie Hassan (N.H.). So too did Independent Sen. Bernie Sanders (Vt.)

The Senate confirmed Califf on Tuesday despite some concerns over his close ties to the pharmaceutical industry and GOP opposition to his stance on access to birth control. The Senate voted to confirm Califf on a 50-46 vote, split largely along party lines. Six Republicans \u2014 Sens. Roy Blunt, Richard Burr, Susan Collins, Lisa Murkowski, Mitt Romney and Patrick Toomey \u2014 voted alongside Democrats to confirm the Duke University cardiologist.

Returning to the FDA early in President Joe Biden's tenure gives Califf greater ability to place his stamp on the agency than the last time he led it during the final months of the Obama administration. Scott Gottlieb, former President Donald Trump's first FDA commissioner, played an outsized role communicating with lawmakers on Capitol Hill about the agency's priorities.

The longtime Duke cardiologist, who was narrowly confirmed by the Senate Tuesday, inherits an agency that is smack dab in the middle of deliberations over a slew of controversial applications for everything from pediatric Covid-19 vaccines to ALS drugs. Califf likely won't weigh in on the minutiae of those decisions \u2014 it's extremely rare for the FDA commissioner to do so \u2014 but these decisions will have huge consequences for his tenure at the FDA. He will have to explain the decisions to the public, and he will take the blame for any misstep the agency makes.

And she would find a more difficult time finding both a genetic match and one with the HIV-resistant mutation to both cure her cancer and potentially her HIV. This is a natural, but rare mutation,\" said Dr. Yvonne Bryson, an infectious disease physician at UCLA who led the study. (Morrison and Salzman, 2/15) [ The New York Times: A Woman Is Cured Of H.I.V. Using A Novel Treatment ](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/15/health/hiv-cure-cord-blood.html) Cord blood is more widely available than the adult stem cells used in the bone marrow transplants that cured the previous two patients, and it does not need to be matched as closely to the recipient. Most donors in registries are of Caucasian origin, so allowing for only a partial match has the potential to cure dozens of Americans who have both H.I.V. and cancer each year, scientists said. The woman, who also had leukemia, received cord blood to treat her cancer. It came from a partially matched donor, instead of the typical practice of finding a bone marrow donor of similar race and ethnicity to the patient's. She also received blood from a close relative to give her body temporary immune defenses while the transplant took. (Mandavilli, 2/15) [ The Washington Post: A Middle-Aged Woman Is The Third Patient To Be Potentially Cured Of HIV, Scientists Report ](https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2022/02/15/hiv-patient-cure/) A middle-aged, mixed-race woman is the third patient to be potentially cured of HIV, with the virus in long-term remission four years after she received a transplant of stem cells harvested from an infant's umbilical cord blood, scientists said Tuesday. The new case, reported at the annual meeting of the Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infection, is the first time the transplant approach has been successfully reported in a mixed-race woman, an advance that reinforces the exciting concept that an HIV cure may be possible in a wider array of people by using cord blood. (Johnson, 2/15) [ CBS News: Biden Administration Wants $30 Billion More In Federal Funding For COVID-19 Response ](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/biden-covid-19-response-federal-funding/) The issue of additional aid has been the subject of discussions across Washington in recent weeks, and White House press secretary Jen Psaki confirmed the administration is seeking more money to address future needs. \"While we continue to have sufficient funds to respond to the current Omicron surge, in the coming weeks, our goal has always been to ensure that we are well-prepared to stay ahead of the virus,\" Psaki said at a White House briefing on Tuesday.

Two people familiar with the administration's plan confirmed key details on Tuesday: $17.9 billion for vaccines and treatments, $4.9 billion for testing, $3 billion to cover coronavirus care for uninsured people, and $3.7 billion to prepare for future variants. They spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss deliberations between the administration and lawmakers over the supplemental funding.

White House Office of Management and Budget Deputy Director Jason Miller disclosed in an declaration cited late on Monday by the Justice Department that the government would be hurt on several fronts if it cannot enforce the vaccine requirements.

(Kimball, 2/15) [ NPR: When Moms Get Vaccinated During Pregnancy, Babies Get Protection Too, Study Shows ](https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2022/02/15/1080990028/covid-vaccine-pregnancy-babies) Getting vaccinated against COVID-19 during pregnancy may also help protect babies after they're born, according to new research published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Babies whose mothers received two shots of either the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines during pregnancy had a 61% lower risk of being hospitalized with COVID in their first six months of life, the study found. \"The bottom line is that maternal vaccination is a really important way to help protect these young infants,\" said Dr. Dana Meaney-Delman, chief of the CDC's Infant Outcome Monitoring, Research and Prevention branch. She notes that is particularly important because there's no vaccine authorized for babies under 6 months old.

The agency's update could come as early as next week. Dr. Rochelle Walensky, the director of the CDC, is expected to discuss masking guidance Wednesday at a White House Covid-19 Response Team briefing. Nothing has been finalized yet, but the CDC is considering a new benchmark for whether masks are needed, basing it on the level of severe disease and hospitalizations in a given community, two people familiar with the situation said.

Since July 2021, Disney's Florida and California theme parks have required masks in indoor spaces for guests 2 years old and older, regardless of vaccination status. Disney does not require proof of vaccination to enter its parks.

Justices last week declined to hear an emergency request from the more than 100 plaintiffs in a lawsuit filed two weeks ago, which was aimed at striking down Mayor LaToya Cantrell's COVID restrictions in time for Carnival's high days. The sole justice to dissent was Will Crain. Instead, a litany of rules on gatherings in public places will remain in force throughout Carnival season. For now, people attending most indoor events are required to wear masks. They must also show proof of vaccination or a recent negative COVID-19 test if they hope to drink at a bar, dine at a restaurant or party at a nightclub, among other places.

Glenn Youngkin to just-passed legislation on the issue. The legislature passed a bill Monday giving parents and students the ability to opt out of mandates imposed by local school boards. But the legislation would not have taken effect until July 1.

Sen. Ted Cruz is among a group of four Senate Republicans who have signed a letter led by Rep.

The decision from Justice Sabita Singh represented a blow to Wu's vaccination mandate, a policy that has dominated her early tenure in City Hall's fifth-floor corner office, and the latest turn in a COVID-19 fight that has pitted the city's new and progressive mayor against a bloc of decidedly old-school Boston power: a trio of public safety unions.

Vaccine Policy ](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2022-02-15/judge-dismisses-firefighter-group-lawsuit-la-vaccine-policy) A Los Angeles Superior Court judge Tuesday dismissed a lawsuit brought by a group of Los Angeles firefighters over a city requirement that employees be vaccinated against COVID-19. Judge Michael P. Linfield wrote that \"courts have consistently held that government has the power to require vaccinations to protect the public's health and safety.\" He cited several cases, including a 1905 U.S. Supreme Court ruling that compulsory vaccinations are allowed under the Constitution. The city last year made COVID-19 vaccination a requirement of employment, while also granting exemptions for employees based on medical conditions or religious beliefs.

One by one, governors and health officials in California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Massachusetts, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, Oregon and Rhode Island broke ranks and announced an end date for masking requirements in indoor public spaces such as grocery stores and restaurants and, in some cases, schools. They were joined this week by District of Columbia Mayor Muriel Bowser, a Democrat.

Tyson Foods said Tuesday it was ending mask requirements for its vaccinated workers in some facilities. Walmart and Amazon \u2014 the nation's No. 1 and 2 largest private employers respectively \u2014 will no longer require fully vaccinated workers to don masks in stores or warehouses unless required under local or state laws.

Although kids have been least vulnerable to the virus, the rise in severe illness among them as cases surged this winter alarmed health officials who have pleaded with parents to get their children vaccinated. \"We all went into pediatrics to make kids better, so seeing them suffer in the hospital and outside, it's hard,\" said Jenna Holmen, a pediatric infectious disease specialist at UCSF Benioff Children's Hospital Oakland, which was forced to double occupancy in some rooms during the height of the omicron surge.

The vote came over objections from minority Democrats who said the measure was unconstitutional under the landmark Roe v Wade and other Supreme Court decisions the high court could overturn.

(Willingham, 2/15) [ AP: Arkansas Senate Rejects Push For Texas-Styled Abortion Ban ](https://apnews.com/article/us-supreme-court-health-texas-arkansas-asa-hutchinson-3f001b62f8c31ba17f6c29ff8cacc639) Arkansas' majority-Republican Senate rejected a push Tuesday for an abortion ban modeled after Texas' restrictive law, with abortion opponents divided about emulating their neighbor's approach as they await a key ruling from the U.S. Supreme Court. The Senate rejected resolutions that would have allowed lawmakers to take up legislation banning abortion except to save the life of a mother in a medical emergency. Like Texas' ban, the measure would be enforced by private citizens filing lawsuits.

Republican Sen. Wayne Steinhauer had brought a proposal to the Legislature to make Medicaid, a federal-state health insurance program for low-income people, available to people who live below 133% of the federal poverty level.

The Associated Press reported in September that those cases prompted Secretary of Aging Robert Torres to order improvements at the Philadelphia Corporation for Aging, a nonprofit with a state contract to field and respond to calls about elder abuse and neglect in the city.

She called many different places \"home\" over short periods of time when she was 17. She learned at a young age that the public school staff and liaisons she grew up around weren't adequately trained to recognize homeless students. \"I wasn't identified at the school I was at and because of that I didn't qualify for many services until I went to a shelter,\" Marshall, 23, says. \"Even then, the liaison in Philadelphia didn't really have a conversation about what was going on.\" (Beiner, 2/15) [ Philadelphia Inquirer: Plantar Fasciitis, Achilles Tendinitis, Foot Pain Symptoms Rising During COVID-19 Pandemic ](https://www.inquirer.com/health/coronavirus/coronavirus-covid-19-plantar-fasciitis-foot-pain-symptoms-20220215.html) Foot pain has been on the rise during the pandemic, as people working from home kicked off their supportive shoes in favor of flimsy slippers and flip-flops, while others, including Hudson, used the time to become more active, which put new strain on their feet. \"In March 2020 I said ... 'Oh, my goodness, everyone is going to have plantar fasciitis and Achilles tendinitis,\" recalled Laura Virtue-Delayo, the president of the Pennsylvania Podiatric Medical Association. Her prediction panned out: Podiatrists, orthopedic surgeons and physical therapists say they're seeing more cases of plantar fasciitis and Achilles tendinitis \u2014 two common foot-pain conditions \u2014 than ever before.

She didn't identify the countries. The U.S. has donated and shipped 437 million doses abroad so far, more than any other nation, and pledged a total of at least 1.2 billion. President Joe Biden held a virtual summit in September to muster a more coordinated global response, though advocates say that's still lacking.

It is the latest headache to plague the COVAX vaccine-sharing project, co-led by the WHO and aimed at getting shots to the world's neediest people.

The issue could mean political trouble for Prime Minister Fumio Kishida as nearly 30% of the population is aged 65 or older, and so at greater risk from the coronavirus without the protection of the booster.

Vaccinated travelers will also now be randomly selected for testing upon arrival and will not be required to quarantine while they wait for their results. "}
