Ritual purification may also apply to objects and places. Ritual uncleanliness is not identical with ordinary physical impurity, such as dirt stains; nevertheless, [body fluids](/wiki/Body_fluid) are generally considered ritually unclean. Most of these rituals existed long before the [germ theory of disease](/wiki/Germ_theory_of_disease), and figure prominently from the earliest known [religious systems of the Ancient Near East](/wiki/Ancient_Near_Eastern_religion). Some writers connect the rituals to [taboos](/wiki/Taboo). Some have seen benefits of these practices as a point of health and preventing infections especially in areas where humans come in close contact with each other. While these practices came before the idea of the germ theory was public in areas that use daily cleaning, the destruction of infectious agents seems to be dramatic.[ [dubious](/wiki/Wikipedia:Accuracy_dispute#Disputed_statement) ] [[1]](#cite_note-1) Others have described a 'dimension of purity' that is universal in religions that seeks to move humans away from disgust, (at one extreme) and to uplift them towards purity and divinity (at the other extreme). Away from uncleanliness to purity, and away from deviant to moral behavior, (within one's cultural context). [[2]](#cite_note-2) Bah\u00e1\u00ed Faith[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Ritual_purification&action=edit\u00a7ion=1)] In the [Bah\u00e1\u00ed Faith](/wiki/Bah%C3%A1%CA%BC%C3%AD_Faith), ritual ablutions (the washing of the hands and face) should be done before the saying of the [obligatory prayers](/wiki/Obligatory_Bah%C3%A1%CA%BC%C3%AD_prayers), as well as prior to the recitation of the [Greatest Name](/wiki/Bah%C3%A1%CA%BC%C3%AD_symbols#The_Greatest_Name) 95 times. [[3]](#cite_note-smith-ablutions-3) Menstruating women are obliged to pray, but have the (voluntary) alternative of reciting a verse instead; if the latter choice is taken, ablutions are still required before the recital of the special verse. [Bah\u00e1'u'll\u00e1h](/wiki/Bah%C3%A1%27u%27ll%C3%A1h), the founder of the Bah\u00e1\u00ed Faith, prescribed the ablutions in his book of laws, the [Kit\u00e1b-i-Aqdas](/wiki/Kit%C3%A1b-i-Aqdas). [[3]](#cite_note-smith-ablutions-3) These ablutions have a significance beyond washing and should be performed even if one has bathed oneself immediately before reciting the obligatory prayer; fresh ablutions should also be performed for each devotion, unless they are being done at the same time. If no water (or clean water) is available or if an illness would be worsened by the use of water, one may instead repeat the verse \"In the Name of God, the Most Pure, the Most Pure\" five times before the prayer. [[3]](#cite_note-smith-ablutions-3) Apart from this, Bah\u00e1'u'll\u00e1h abolished all forms of ritual impurity of people and things, following B\u00e1b who stressed the importance of cleanliness and spiritual purity. [[4]](#cite_note-smith-purity-4) Buddhism[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Ritual_purification&action=edit\u00a7ion=2)] In [Japanese Buddhism](/wiki/Japanese_Buddhism), a basin is provided at [Buddhist temples](/wiki/Buddhist_temple) for ablutions. It is also used for [tea ceremony](/wiki/Tea_ceremony). This type of ritual cleansing is the custom for guests attending a [tea ceremony](/wiki/Japanese_tea_ceremony) [[5]](#cite_note-MSIK-5) or visiting the grounds of a [Buddhist](/wiki/Buddhism) [temple](/wiki/Temple). [[6]](#cite_note-ZenKyoto133-6) The name originates crouch\" [[7]](#cite_note-Setsuko-7) or \"to bow down\", an act of humility. [[6]](#cite_note-ZenKyoto133-6) Guests attending a tea ceremony crouch and wash their hands in a tsukubai set in the [tea garden](/wiki/Tea_garden) before entering the tearoom. [[7]](#cite_note-Setsuko-7) Tsukubai are usually of stone, and are often provided with a small [ladle](/wiki/Ladle_(spoon)), ready for use. [[7]](#cite_note-Setsuko-7) A supply of water may be provided via a bamboo pipe [[7]](#cite_note-Setsuko-7) called a kakei. The famous tsukubai shown here stands in the grounds of the [Ryan-ji](/wiki/Ry%C5%8Dan-ji) temple in [Kyoto](/wiki/Kyoto), and was donated by the feudal lord [Tokugawa Mitsukuni](/wiki/Tokugawa_Mitsukuni). [[8]](#cite_note-ZenKyoto90-91-8) The [kanji](/wiki/Kanji) written on the surface of the stone are without significance when read alone. If each is read in combination with (kuchi) - the shape of the central bowl - then the characters become , , , which translates literally as \"I only know plenty\" ( = ware = I, = tada = only, = taru = plenty, = shiru = know). [[9]](#cite_note-stonelantern-9) The underlying meaning, variously translated as \"what one has is all one needs\", [[9]](#cite_note-stonelantern-9) or \"learn only to be content\" anti-materialistic teachings of [Buddhism](/wiki/Buddhism). Christianity[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Ritual_purification&action=edit\u00a7ion=3)] The [Bible](/wiki/Bible) has [Eritrean Orthodox](/wiki/Eritrean_Orthodox), places a heavier emphasis on Old Testament teachings, and its followers adhere to certain practices such as observing days of ritual purification. [[10]](#cite_note-10) [[11]](#cite_note-11) Before praying, they [wash their hands and face](/wiki/Ablution_in_Christianity) in order to be clean before and present their best to God. [[12]](#cite_note-Amherst1906-12) [[13]](#cite_note-Dawood2013-13) The [Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church](/wiki/Ethiopian_Orthodox_Tewahedo_Church) prescribes several kinds [hand washing](/wiki/Hand_washing) for example after leaving the latrine, lavatory or bathhouse, or before prayer, or after eating a meal. [[14]](#cite_note-14) The women in the [Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church](/wiki/Ethiopian_Orthodox_Tewahedo_Church) are prohibited from entering the church temple during [menses](/wiki/Menses); and the men do not enter a church the day after they have had intercourse with their wives. [[15]](#cite_note-15) [Baptism](/wiki/Baptism), as a form of ritual purification, occurs in several religions related to Judaism, and most prominently in [Christianity](/wiki/Christianity); Christianity also has other forms of ritual purification. Many Christian churches practice a ceremony of the Washing of Feet, [[16]](#cite_note-common-16) following the example of Jesus in the Gospel. [[17]](#cite_note-17) Some interpret this as an [ordinance](/wiki/Ordinance_(Christian)) which the church is obliged to keep as a commandment, see also [Biblical law in Christianity](/wiki/Biblical_law_in_Christianity). [[16]](#cite_note-common-16) Others interpret it as an example that all should follow. Most denominations that practice the rite will perform it on [Maundy Thursday](/wiki/Maundy_Thursday). Often in these services, the [bishop](/wiki/Bishop) will wash the feet of the clergy, and in [monasteries](/wiki/Monastery) the [Abbot](/wiki/Abbot) will wash the feet of the brethren. Many ancient churches were built with a large fountain in the courtyard. It was the tradition for Christians to wash before entering the church for worship. [[18]](#cite_note-18) This usage is also legislated in the [Rule of St. Benedict](/wiki/Rule_of_St._Benedict), as a result of which, many medieval [monasteries](/wiki/Monasteries) were built with communal lavers for the [monks](/wiki/Monk) or [nuns](/wiki/Nun) to wash up before the [Daily Office](/wiki/Daily_Office). Catholic religious orders of the [Augustinians](/wiki/Augustinians)' and [Benedictines](/wiki/Benedictines)' rules contained ritual purification, [[19]](#cite_note-19) and inspired by [Benedict of Nursia](/wiki/Benedict_of_Nursia) encouragement for the practice of therapeutic bathing; [Benedictine](/wiki/Benedictine) monks played a role in the development and promotion of [spas](/wiki/Spa). [[20]](#cite_note-ASpiritualHistory-20) The principle of washing the hands before celebrating the holy Liturgy began as a practical precaution of cleanness, which was also interpreted symbolically. [[21]](#cite_note-21) \"In the third century there are traces of a custom of washing the hands as a preparation for prayer on the part of all Christians, and from the fourth century onwards it appears to have been usual for the ministers at the [Holy Mass](/wiki/Catholic_mass) or [divine liturgy](/wiki/Divine_liturgy) ceremonially to wash their hands before the more solemn part of the service as a symbol of inward purity.\" [[22]](#cite_note-22) Traditionally, Christianity adhered to the biblical regulation requiring the purification of women after childbirth; this practice, was adapted into a special ritual known as the [churching of women](/wiki/Churching_of_women), for which there exists liturgy in the [Church of England](/wiki/Church_of_England)'s [Book of Common Prayer](/wiki/Book_of_Common_Prayer), but its use is now rare in [Western Christianity](/wiki/Western_Christianity). The churching of women is still performed a fountain used by for ablution before entering a [church](/wiki/Church_(building)). [[23]](#cite_note-Bradley2012-23) [[24]](#cite_note-Solovi68-24) [[25]](#cite_note-Bingham1849-25) These ablutions involve the washing of the hands, face, and feet. [[25]](#cite_note-Bingham1849-25) The cantharus is traditionally located in the [exonarthex](/wiki/Narthex) of the church. [[24]](#cite_note-Solovi68-24) [[26]](#cite_note-Ferguson2013-26) The water emitted by a cantharus is to be running water. [[27]](#cite_note-Lowrie1901-27) The practice of ablutions before prayer and worship in Christianity [symbolizes](/wiki/Christian_symbolism) \"separation form sins of the spirit and surrender to the Lord.\" [[26]](#cite_note-Ferguson2013-26) [Eusebius](/wiki/Eusebius) recorded this practice of canthari located in the courtyards of churches, for the faithful to wash themselves before entering a Christian house of worship. [[25]](#cite_note-Bingham1849-25) The practice has its origins Jewish practice of performing ablutions before entering into the presence of God (cf. [Exodus 30:17-21](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Bible_(King_James)/Exodus#30:17)). [[24]](#cite_note-Solovi68-24) [[23]](#cite_note-Bradley2012-23) Though [cantharus](/wiki/Cantharus_(Christianity)) are not as prevalent in [Western Christianity](/wiki/Western_Christianity), they are found in [Eastern Christian](/wiki/Eastern_Christianity) worshippers sprinkle themselves with [holy water](/wiki/Holy_water) before entering the nave of the Church or approaching the [altar](/wiki/Altar).[ [citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)] In Reformed Christianity, [ritual purity](/wiki/Ritual_purity) is achieved through the Confession of Sins, and Assurance of Forgiveness, and [Sanctification](/wiki/Sanctification). Through the power of the Holy Spirit, believers offer their whole being and labor as a 'living sacrifice'; and cleanliness becomes a way of life (See Romans 12:1, and John 13:5-10 (the Washing of the Feet)). Prior to praying the [canonical hours](/wiki/Canonical_hours) at [seven fixed prayer times](/wiki/Fixed_prayer_times), [Oriental Orthodox Christians](/wiki/Oriental_Orthodox_Christians) [Shehimo](/wiki/Shehimo)). [Christian countries](/wiki/Christian_countries) is due in part to the Biblical toilet etiquette which encourages washing after all instances of defecation. [[30]](#cite_note-30) The [bidet](/wiki/Bidet) is common in predominantly [Catholic countries](/wiki/Catholic_countries) where water is considered essential for [anal cleansing](/wiki/Anal_cleansing), [[31]](#cite_note-31) [[32]](#cite_note-32) and in some traditionally [Orthodox](/wiki/Eastern_Orthodox) and such as [Greece](/wiki/Greece) and [bidet are common. [[33]](#cite_note-33) Hinduism[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Ritual_purification&action=edit\u00a7ion=4)] Various traditions within [Hinduism](/wiki/Hinduism) follow different standards of ritual purity and purification. Within each tradition the more orthodox groups follow stricter rules, but the strictest rules are generally prescribed for [Brahmins](/wiki/Brahmin), especially those engaged in the temple worship. An important part of ritual purification in Hinduism is the bathing of the entire body, particularly in rivers considered holy such as the [Ganges](/wiki/Ganges). It is considered auspicious to perform this method of purification before festivals after a death, in order to maintain purity. Punyahavachanam is a ritual meant to purify one's self and one's home, usually performed before important occasions, like weddings. During the ceremony, mantras are chanted and then consecrated water is sprinkled over all of the participants and the items used. In the ritual known as [abhisheka](/wiki/Abhisheka) (Sanskrit, \"sprinkling; ablution\"), the deity's [murti](/wiki/Murti) or image is ritually bathed with water, curd, milk, honey, ghee, cane sugar, rosewater, etc. Abhisheka is also a special form of [puja](/wiki/Puja_(Hinduism)) prescribed by [Agamic](/wiki/%C4%80gama_(Hinduism)) injunction. The act is also performed in the inauguration of religious and political monarchs and for other special blessings. The murtis of deities must not be touched without cleansing the hands, and one is not supposed to enter a temple without a bath. Stak are [Hindu](/wiki/Hindu) rules of impurity to be followed after the birth of a child (vddhi stak). [[34]](#cite_note-34) Stak involves the practice of keeping socially isolated from relatives and community by abstention of mealtaking with family, engaging in customary religious activities, and leaving the home. A mother must practice stak for 10 to 30 days, depending upon her caste, while the father may become purified immediately after the birth of his child by ritual purification (ritualistic bathing). [[35]](#cite_note-35) There are various kinds of purificatory rituals associated with [death ceremonies](/wiki/Antyesti). After visiting a house where a death has recently occurred, Hindus are expected to take baths. Women take a head bath after completing their four-day [menstrual period](/wiki/Menstrual_taboo). Indigenous American religions[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Ritual_purification&action=edit\u00a7ion=5)] In the traditions of many [Indigenous peoples of the Americas](/wiki/Indigenous_peoples_of_the_Americas), one of the forms of ritual purification is the ablutionary use of a [sauna](/wiki/Sauna), known as a [sweatlodge](/wiki/Sweatlodge), as preparation for a variety of other ceremonies. The burning of [smudge sticks](/wiki/Smudge_stick) is also believed by some indigenous groups to cleanse an area of any evil presence. Some groups like the southeastern tribe, the [Cherokee](/wiki/Cherokee), practiced and, to a lesser degree, still practice [going to water](/w/index.php?title=Going_to_water&action=edit&redlink=1), performed only in moving bodies of water such as rivers or streams. Going to water was practiced by some villages daily (around sunrise) while others would go to water primarily for special occasions, including but not limited to [naming ceremonies](/wiki/Naming_ceremony), [holidays](/wiki/Holidays), and [ball games](/wiki/Ball_games). [[36]](#cite_note-36) Many anthropologists that studied with the Cherokees like James Adair tried to connect these groups to the [Lost Tribes of Israel](/wiki/Lost_Tribes_of_Israel) based on religious practices including going to water, [[37]](#cite_note-37) but this form of [historiography](/wiki/Historiography) is mostly Christian \"wish fulfillment\" rather than respectable anthropology. [Yuquot Whalers' Shrine](/wiki/Yuquot_Whalers%27_Shrine) on [Vancouver Island](/wiki/Vancouver_Island) was ritually for [whaling](/wiki/Whaling). Islam[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Ritual_purification&action=edit\u00a7ion=6)] [Islamic](/wiki/Islam) ritual purification is particularly centred on the preparation for [salah](/wiki/Salah), ritual prayer; theoretically ritual purification would remain valid throughout the day, but is treated as invalid on the occurrence of certain acts, flatulence, sleep, contact with the opposite sex (depending on which school of thought), unconsciousness, and the emission of blood, semen, or [vomit](/wiki/Vomiting). Some schools of thought mandate that ritual purity is necessary for holding the [Quran](/wiki/Quran). Ritual purification takes the form of ablution, [wudu](/wiki/Wudu) and [ghusl](/wiki/Ghusl), depending on the circumstance; the greater form is obligatory by a woman after she ceases menstruation, on a corpse that did not die during battle, and after sexual activity, and is optionally used on other occasions, for example just prior to Friday prayers or entering [ihram](/wiki/Ihram). An alternative [tayammum](/wiki/Tayammum) (\"dry ablution\"), involving clean sand or earth, is used if clean water is not available or if an illness would be worsened by the use of water; this form is invalidated in the same circumstances as the other forms, and also whenever water becomes available and safe to use. The [fard](/wiki/Fard) or \"obligatory activities\" of the lesser form include beginning with the intention to purify oneself, washing of the face, arms, head, and feet. while some [mustahabb](/wiki/Mustahabb) \"recommended activities\" also exist such as [basmala](/wiki/Basmala) recitation, oral hygiene, washing the mouth, nose at the beginning, washing of arms to the elbows and washing of the ears at the end; additionally recitation of the [Shahada](/wiki/Shahada). The greater form (ghusl) is completed by first performing wudu and then ensuring that the entire body is washed. Some minor details of Islamic ritual purification may vary between different [madhhabs](/wiki/Madhhab) \"schools of thought\". Judaism[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Ritual_purification&action=edit\u00a7ion=7)] The [Hebrew Bible](/wiki/Tanakh) mentions a number of situations when ritual purification the ritual in these circumstances consists of immersing the whole body in a special bath (a [mikveh](/wiki/Mikveh)). In addition, the [oral law](/wiki/Oral_Torah) specifies other situations when ritual purification is required, such as after performing [excretory functions](/wiki/Excretion), [meals](/wiki/Meal), and [waking](/wiki/Sleep). In these circumstances, typically only the hands are washed. These regulations were variously observed by the ancient [Israelites](/wiki/Israelites). Purification was required in ancient times, so that ritually impure individuals would not defile God's tabernacle and receive the punishments of death or [kareth](/wiki/Kareth). [[38]](#cite_note-38) Nowadays, in the absence of the [Temple in Jerusalem](/wiki/Temple_in_Jerusalem), many of the Torah's laws about purification have no practical implication and are no longer observed. However, purification from the [niddah](/wiki/Niddah) status is still observed by contemporary [Orthodox Jews](/wiki/Orthodox_Judaism) and (with some modifications and additional leniencies) some [Conservative Jews](/wiki/Conservative_Judaism), as its practical implications are highly relevant: a woman who is impure with this status is forbidden to have sexual contact with her husband. [Tumat met](/wiki/Tumat_met) (\"the impurity of death\"), coming into contact with a human [corpse](/wiki/Corpse), is considered the ultimate impurity. It cannot be purified through mikveh immersion alone, but also requires sprinkling with the ashes of the [red heifer](/wiki/Red_heifer). [[39]](#cite_note-39) Since the red heifer no longer exists, this form of impurity cannot be removed. Currently, all individuals are assumed to possess the impurity of death. [[40]](#cite_note-Shemini-40) This has a few practical implications: it prohibits Jews from entering the site of the Temple, and prohibits eating certain foods (such as [terumah](/wiki/Terumah)) which may only be eaten when pure. Mandaeism[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Ritual_purification&action=edit\u00a7ion=8)] One of the most important ceremonies in Mandaean worship is [baptism](/wiki/Baptism#Mandaean_baptism) ( [masbuta](/wiki/Masbuta)). Unlike in Christianity, baptism is not a one-off event but is performed every Sunday, the Mandaean holy day, as a ritual of purification. Baptism usually involves full immersion in flowing water, and all rivers considered fit for baptism are called [yardena](/wiki/Yardna) (after the [River Jordan](/wiki/Jordan_River)). After emerging from the water, the worshipper is anointed with holy [sesame oil](/wiki/Sesame_oil) ( bread](/wiki/Sacramental_bread#Mandaeism) ( [pihta](/wiki/Pihta)) and water. Other rituals for purification include the [rishama](/wiki/Rishama_(ablution)) and the [tamasha](/wiki/Tamasha_(ablution)) which, unlike masbuta, can be performed without a priest. [[41]](#cite_note-41) The rishama (signing) is performed before prayers and involves washing the face and limbs while reciting specific prayers. It is performed daily, before sunrise, with hair covered and after evacuation of bowels or before religious ceremonies [[42]](#cite_note-MAU-42) (see [wudu](/wiki/Wudu)). The tamasha is a triple immersion in the river without a requirement for a priest. It is performed by women after menstruation or child birth, men and women after sexual activity or nocturnal emission, touching a dead corpse or any other type of defilement [[42]](#cite_note-MAU-42) (see [tevilah](/wiki/Ritual_washing_in_Judaism#Full-body_immersion_(Tvilah))). Ritual purification also applies to fruits, vegetables, pots, pans, utensils, animals for consumption and ceremonial garments ( [rasta](/wiki/Rasta_(Mandaeism))). [[42]](#cite_note-MAU-42) Purification for a dying person is also performed. It includes bathing involving a threefold sprinkling of river water over the person from head to feet. [[42]](#cite_note-MAU-42) Shinto[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Ritual_purification&action=edit\u00a7ion=9)] Ritual cleanliness is a central part of [Shinto](/wiki/Shinto) life. [[43]](#cite_note-43) In Shinto, a common form of ritual purification is [misogi](/wiki/Misogi), [[44]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBocking199793CaliDougill201320-44) [[45]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTENelson1996101Bocking199745CaliDougill201321-45) which involves natural running water, and especially waterfalls. Rather than being entirely naked, men usually wear [Japanese loincloths](/wiki/Fundoshi) and women wear [kimono](/wiki/Kimono), both [ceremonial magic](/wiki/Ceremonial_magic), ' [banishing](/wiki/Banishing)' refers to one or more rituals intended to remove non-physical influences ranging from spirits to negative influences. [[46]](#cite_note-magick-46) Although banishing rituals are often used as components of more complex ceremonies, they can also be performed by themselves. Banishing can be viewed as one of several [techniques of magic](/wiki/Magick_(Aleister_Crowley)#Techniques), closely related to ritual purification and a typical prerequisite for [consecration](/wiki/Consecration) and [invocation](/wiki/Invocation). In the [Hermetic Order of the Golden Ritual of the Pentagram](/wiki/Lesser_Ritual_of_the_Pentagram) (banishing: LBRP; invoking: LIRP) must be learned by the [Neophyte](/wiki/Hermetic_Order_of_the_Golden_Dawn#The_Grades_of_the_Golden_Dawn) before moving on to the next grade ( [Zelator](/wiki/Hermetic_Order_of_the_Golden_Dawn#The_Grades_of_the_Golden_Dawn)). [[47]](#cite_note-47) [[48]](#cite_note-48) For actual workings [Aleister Crowley](/wiki/Aleister_Crowley) recommends a short, general banishing, with a comment that \"in more elaborate ceremonies it is usual to banish everything by name.\" [[46]](#cite_note-magick-46) In [Liber Aleph vel CXI](/wiki/Liber_Aleph), Crowley recommended that a banishing ritual be done at least once daily by [Thelemites](/wiki/Thelema). [[49]](#cite_note-49) In [Wicca](/wiki/Wicca) and various forms of [neopaganism](/wiki/Neopaganism), banishing is performed before [casting a circle](/wiki/Magic_circle) in order to purify the area where the ritual or magick is about to take place. In his books on nocturnal witchcraft, for example, Konstantinos recommends performing banishings regularly, in order to keep the magical workspace free of negativity, and to become proficient in banishing before attempting acts that are much more spiritually taxing on the body, such as magical [spellworking](/wiki/Incantation).

It was probably out of the Jewish rite that the practice developed among early Christians, especially in the east, of washing their hands and feet before going into church. Early Christian basilicas had a fountain for ablutions, known as cantharus or phiala, and usually placed in the centre of the atrium. They are still found in some Eastern Orthodox churches, notably at the monastery of Laura at Mount Athos, where the phiala is an imposing structure in front of the entrance covered by a dome resting on eight pillars. In several Orthodox churches today worshippers take off heir shoes and wash their feet before entering the church just as Muslims do before going into a mosque. - ^ [a](#cite_ref-Solovi68_24-0) [b](#cite_ref-Solovi68_24-1) [c](#cite_ref-Solovi68_24-2)Solovi, Meleti M.

In the Book of Exodus (30, 18-20) Aaron and his sons were required to wash before approaching the altar. Here water is used as a symbol of purification and expiation. But water is also the most common and most indispensable drink. ... So much was the practice a part of the life of the early Church, that in the period after Constantine the \"cantharus\", or water fountain, became a standard fixture in the courtyard before the basilica to permit the faithful to purify themselves before entering the presence of God. - ^ [a](#cite_ref-Bingham1849_25-0) [b](#cite_ref-Bingham1849_25-1) [c](#cite_ref-Bingham1849_25-2)Bingham, Joseph (1840).
