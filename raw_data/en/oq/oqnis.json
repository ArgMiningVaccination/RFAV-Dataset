The ideal practitioner should be someone who appreciates the needs of the clinic and its patients, and who is excited about the practice and the community we live in. Though an openness to focus in pediatrics and hormone management is preferred, it is not mandatory and as a busy small town primary care practice, the resident will see it all. Skills such a s phlebotomy and IV therapy would also be helpful additions to the practice and can be further fostered. The successful candidate will be motivated to care for patients, be detail oriented, and willing to do the research necessary for each patient's treatment plan. This individual should have a likable personality and feel comfortable and confident enough to voice their op inions and offer advice while at the same time recognizing the potential to learn from others. Newberg is a conservative, rural community and the resident should be able to fit into that environment, meet patients where they are at and work with both conv entional and naturopathic tools. They should also acknowledge the value of office staff as well as those in their care to work as a team at all levels. They also should have a good sense of work ethic and responsibility, feeling uncomfortable leaving thin gs undone. Resident must be professional, but also have a good sense of humor. Preceptorship and/or working interview required. TCC offers the resident flexibility, outside rotations with specialists, modalities that range from herbalism to neurofeedback and a fast paced environment filled with laughter and health treating fertility and pregnancy to geriatric populations. The successful candidate will have hobbies and interests outside of work, making them a well -rounded individual with a variety of experi ences. Their love for not only medicine, but the patients themselves, should be evident. They should also possess an appreciation for the Newberg community, and a willingness to participate in some community -focused events. Our new ND should expect a posit ive environment at The Clover Clinic, as well as positive, efficient support staff. We work together to thrive as a team and as individuals. We emphasize personal growth and welcome ideas for the clinic, so the resident will be able to observe and partic ipate in these team meetings. Ideally, we will find our perfect candidate and, with growth and success well rewarded, this candidate will stay within the clinic for another year of residency or as an associate long term. Overall, the work environment is that of a well -oiled machine sprinkled with a bit of fun at lunch and as the day draws to a close. PROGRESSIVE MEDICAL CENTER RESIDENCY PROGRAM Statement of Commitment to Residency Training Progressive Medical Center is committed to creating a GREAT ND Residency program. Our integrated facility will train the residents in functional medicine. Progressive medical is the largest integrated facility in th e Southeast. Progressive typically has 100 New Patients per week and 3 00 Existing Patient visits per week. So the ND Residents will have ample opportunity to be rapidly and significantly involve d in patient care. Under one roof 9 ND' s, 8 MD's, 1 PA, 4 NP's, 4 Dieticians, 1 Dr. Chiropractic , 1 Dr. Acupuncture, 1 Diagnostician, 2 RN's, 3 LPN's (RN's & LPN's staff a 20 chair infusion center) work in an integrated fashion . Each patient sees each t ype practitioner. There are also 100+ (see below) different modalities that can be used to help improve patient outcome. Progressive NutraCare i s an on -site supplement store that has 900 supplement in stock. Most are private labeled as Progressive NutraCare and many are proprietary formulations that have been contract manufactured to our ND's specifications. Dr. Agolli, MD, PhD and ND founded Progr essive Medical 19 years ago. Dr. Agolli's vision is to provide the highest level of integrative care, and the strongest education, to help shift the paradigm of medicine ! The resident will have the opportunity to deal with and help complex patients with chronic illnesses. They have typically been to many other doctors and specialists unsuccessfully. The re sident will have opportunities to complete research projects and travel to at least two seminars a year. Dr. Burdette ND (Director of the Residency Program) has had more than decade of experience directing accredited residency programs. Her teaching background includes designing curriculum for Advanced Medicine Academy, as well as George Washington University . She has also taught for both Allopathic and Natur opathic medical programs and has an active role in the continuing education of clinicians at Progressive Me dical Center. Resident Job description Residents would have the opportunity to shadow not only the practitioners on staff, but also acupuncturists, chiro practors , and dieticians all also on staff. In addition to the ability to shadow, they will als o be doing integrative care. This will be the main part of their job , 80% or higher . Residents will see on average 5 -10 patients a day. We are a very busy c linic, and growing very rapidly. As we grow additional locations will be opened. Our clinic has a heavy emphasis on functional medicine testing. Residents will become proficient with standard laboratory testing as well as specialty testing including stool cultures, food sens itivities, oxidative biomarkers and neurotransmitter testing to name a few. The clinic has an active nutritional IV room servicing on average 30 -40 patients a day. The resident will have the opportunity to work in the IV room as desired . Other areas that will be available to shadow and practice in based on the resident's interest are: Pain management center: TENS u nits, hyperbaric oxygen , prol ozone, chiropractic , acupuncture Cancer center including high dose nutritional IVs as well as I PT with Board Certified O ncologist Lifes tyle centers including a fitness center helping patients incorporate diet and physical activity Dr. Burdette or Dr. Hubbard will meet with residents daily to review charts before visits and then are accessible durin g the day to answer questions for patient care as needed . Dr. Burdette also conduct s weekly training/educational meetin gs at Progressive with all the practitioners. Residents will be required to come to these teaching s ession s which are held as lunch and learn sessi ons (Tuesday 1:30-2:30, Thursday 1 :30-2:30). The resident will also play an active role in development of clinical trials and research project s. Progressive Medical, under Dr. Burdette's guidance, participates in many efforts of translational research. Because of our intensive laboratory testing, there are many opportunities to select conditions, biomarkers, and treatments and track outcomes. Dr. Burdette work s with a number of supplement companies, pharmaceutical companies and others to help them in their translational research efforts. We actively publish, and residents will be encouraged to do the same. We will work to get residents name on various publications to help build their skill set. They will also work with my study coordinator to direct clinical research protocols giving them experience in trial design and management too. In summary, a resident will primarily focused on patient care. They can expect to spend 25 -35 hours a week seeing patients. This is not a residency that focuses residents on paperwork or menial tasks. While there is chart management, that involves paper work, this is not at all the thrust of this position. In addition to patient care, residents will be actively supervised primarily by Dr. Burdette with opportunity to work a host of MDs, DOs, chiropractors, acupuncturist etc. as directed by their interest. They will also be involved in research projects that are germane to their interest and that build their ac ademic pursuit. Educational Goals Increase skills as a primary care physician. By immediately stepping into a busy practice a resident is able to quickly improve their quality of patient care. Having constant access to seasoned integrative physicians augm ents the rate of learning. Increase understanding of translational research. Progressive Medical and Dunwoody Labs are in partnership to increase trials in the area of integrative medicine. The resident will help spearhead translational research efforts with the goal of writing a study design and publishing results. Resident will be encouraged to submit r esearch to AANP research track for the national conference. To increase awareness of integrative facilities and different modalities that can be utilized i n patient care from IV therapies, natural pain management, functional medicine and nutriceutical use. Educational components /residency focus Residency focus will be primary care and chronic illnesses . Our clinic sees a breath of conditions from general fatigue, auto -immune conditions , mental/emotional complaints and cancer care. The focus will be to execute naturopathic medicine principles to a wide array of pathology. Work Schedule The schedule is 8 :30-5:30, with an hour for lunch. This lunch time may be used for training, in which case a lunch and learn format will be adopted. NDs will shadow current physicians for a two week training period and will then be ready to begin their own patient care loa d. Time not seeing patients will be spent working on translational research projects or minimal writing projects related to Naturopathic medicine and patient care. Again, 80% of time will be focused on chronically ill and primary care patient care. Research Opportunities The resident will be involved in ongoing translational research efforts. Because of a close relationship with a lab, we are able to get testing to be donated for data collection. Dr. Burdette is also on the boar d of advisors for Xymo gen and is able to help the resident get product donated as well. The opportunity here for this is immense and will benefit from a motivated individual. Salary and Health Benefits The position is a first and second year residency.
