In this context, I tend to put energy in inverted commas because it is not the energy a physicist might have in mind. It is a much more mystical entity, a form of vitality that is supposed to be essential for life and keep us going. Nobody has been able to define or quantify this \"energy\", it defies scientific measurement and is biologically implausible. These circumstances render Reiki one of the least plausible therapies in the tool kit of alternative medicine. Reiki-healers (they prefer to be called \"masters\") would channel \"energy\" into his or her patient which, in turn, is thought to stimulate the healing process of whatever condition is being treated. In the eyes of those who believe in this sort of thing, Reiki is therefore a true panacea: it can heal everything. The clinical evidence for or against Reiki is fairly clear - as one would expect after realising how 'far out' its underlying concepts are. Numerous studies are available, but most are of very poor quality. Their results tend to suggest that patients experience benefit after having Reiki but they rarely exclude the possibility that this is due to placebo or other non-specific effects. Those that are rigorous show quite clearly that Reiki is a placebo. Our own [ review](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18410352) therefore concluded that \"the evidence is insufficient to suggest that Reiki is an effective treatment for any condition... the value of Reiki remains unproven.\" Since the publication of our article, a number of new investigations have become available. In a brand-new [study](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23337565), for instance, the researchers wanted to explore a Reiki therapy-training program for the care-givers of paediatric patients. A series of Reiki training classes were offered by a Reiki-master. At the completion of the program, interviews were conducted to elicit participant's feedback regarding its effectiveness. Seventeen families agreed to participate and 65% of them attended three Reiki training sessions. They reported that Reiki had benefited their child by improving their comfort (76%), providing relaxation (88%) and pain relief (41%). All caregivers thought that becoming an active participant in their child's care was a major gain. The authors of this investigation conclude that \"a hospital-based Reiki training program for caregivers of hospitalized pediatric patients is feasible and can positively impact patients and their families. More rigorous research regarding the benefits of Reiki in the pediatric population is needed.\" Trials like this one abound in the parallel world of \"energy\" medicine. In my view, such investigations do untold damage: they convince uncritical thinkers that \"energy\" healing is a rational and effective approach - so much so that even [the military is beginning to use it](https://edzardernst.com/2013/01/healing-touch-for-combat-exposed-soldiers/). The flaws in trials as the one above are too obvious to mention. Like most studies in this area, this new investigation proves nothing except the fact that poor quality research will mislead those who believe in its findings. Some might say, so what? If a patient experiences benefit from a bogus yet harmless therapy, why not? I would strongly disagree with this increasingly popular view. Reiki and similarly bizarre forms of \"energy\" healing are well capable of causing harm. Some fanatics might use these placebo-treatments as a true alternative to effective therapies. This would mean that the condition at hand remains untreated which, in a worst case scenario, might even lead to the death of patients. More important, in my view, is an entirely different risk: making people believe in mystic \"energies\" undermines rationality in a much more general sense. If this happens, the harm to society would be incalculable and extends far beyond health care. "}
