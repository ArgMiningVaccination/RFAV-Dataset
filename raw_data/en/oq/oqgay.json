Dartmouth students were in an uproar Wednesday over the plan. \"This was like a bomb,\" said Misha Rosoff, 23, rush chairman at Sigma Alpha Epsilon. \"Everyone sort of , assumed that the trustees would try to get rid of the Greek system, but this came with no warning.\" 1 Officials at the Ivy League school refused to say whether the plan means requiring fraternities and sororities to go co-ed or phasing them out ,Utogeth\u00ad er, but college President James Wright \u00b7 said it will be the biggest change in social life at Dartmouth since women were admitted in 1972. The move, announced in a letter to 1 students Tuesday, is aimed at encour\u00ad aging \"respectful relations between ~ women and men.\" College administra\u00ad tors said they are concerned about problem drinking and the social frag- mentation that sometimes accompa\u00ad ' nies the Greek system.

The details are to be worked out in ___ ____. ___ '' consultation with students and backed with tens of millions of dollars for construction of new housing, din\u00ad ing and social areas to replace the Greek houses. In the end, the Greek system \"as we know it today will not continue,\" Wright said in an interview Wednesday . Something that could become a model for Dartmouth occurred at Middlebury College in Vermont in 1991, Middlebury spokesman Phil Benoit said. The trustees there \"basically said to the Greek system houses, 'It's all right to remain here, but you must open , membership ta both genders,' \" he said. Nearly all complied, he said, though they changed names and affil\u00ad iations.

An international union represen\u00ad tative with a great deal of negotiat\u00ad ing experience said he had never experienced such \"abnorma l bar\u00ad gaining\" as at the UIHC.

By David Espo Associated Press WASHINGTON -Three Republican senators declared Wednesday they would vote to acquit President Clinton of both articles of impeachment -the clearest sign yet, as the trial nears an end, that the charges would fall far short of conviction and possibly even shy of a bare majority. Sens. James Jeffords of Vermont, ~\u00b7 Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania and John Chafee of Rhode Island -mod\u00ad erate lawmakers from the Northeast -were the first Republicans to announce opposition to both articles, perjury and obstruction of justice in the Monica Lewinsky affair. At the same time, a Democratic drive to censure Clinton sputtered under Republican opposition. As a 1 second day of closed-door delibera\u00ad . tiona ended, Sen. Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut said if GOP leaders thwart efforts to force a censure vote, supporters might simply draft a declaration condemning the presi\u00ad dent's behavior and circulate it for senators to sign. ' Jeffords said enough Republicans may vote against the articles of impeachment to keep the fmal roll calls today or Friday short of even 51 votes, although he subsequent ly soft\u00ad ' ened his prediction. \"The pressure is , coming on to get a majority,\" he said. \u00b7 A spokesman for Majority Leader Trent Urtt said there had been no Rescuers search for avalanche survivors CHAMONIX, France -Rescue work\u00ad ers used dogs and sensors Wednesday to search for survivors of avalanches that killed at least 10 people near this popular ski resort.

Twenty people were pulled from the snow alive, Jncludlng two from the United States.

Lott, R-Miss., issued a statement at mid-afternoon declaring that the evidence \"shows that the president has committed per\u00ad jury and obstructed justice. The only question left is, will the Senate vote to find him guilty of committing these high crimes.\" After nearly five months of negoti\u00ad ating between the union and the Iowa state Board of Regents, only two of 18 articles in the formal proposal have been settled, and many members are frustrated ~th the small gains.

Sen. Slade Gorton, R-Wash., has disclosed that he will vote to convict Clinton for obstruction but to acquit for perjury. As the Senate plodded through a second day of closed-door delibera\u00ad tions, Jeffords said Clinton \"gave mis\u00ad leading statements ... did obstruct justice, but his actions in this 'case do not reach the high standard of ilppeachment.\" A short while later, Specter said the charges \"have not been proved\" at the historic month-long trial now drawing to a close. He said he wished Clinton, who refused to be questioned in writing or in person, had submitted to a \"finn examination\" by lawyers in the case. Four animal\u00ad rights groups go to court in Washington, D.C., to try to halt the shoot, as the city hopes to start thinning the deer population on Feb. 15. By Steven Cook The Daily Iowan After a 12-day period of public com\u00ad ment, US. Department of Agriculture officials Wednesday approved a deer\u00ad kill plan that looks much like the orig\u00ad inal, a USDA official said. Meanwhile , four animal-rights groups that had succeeded in stopping the shoot on Jan. 20 filed a motion in federal court in Washington, D.C., late Monday asking for a temporary restraining order to prevent the USDA from resuming the shoot. The fmal environmental assessment concluded that there will be no signifi\u00ad cant impact on the environment due to the shoot. The decision paves the way for the sharpshooting to begin as early as Feb. 15. A hearing on the animal-rights groups' motion for the temporary restraining order is scheduled for Friday at 10 am. speed read USDA Wildlife Biologist Ed Hartin said he read through all 45 comments that the department received, looking for new issues that hadn't been addressed in the new environmental assessment ; he found none, he said. The comment period began on Jan. 28 and ended Monday. \"There were some (comments) opposed to it and some for it,\" he said. \"But there was nothing we felt that wasn't already in the assessment.\" The overall result wasn't surprising , said Dena Jones, of the California \u00ad based Animal Protection Institute, one of the four animal-rights groups. However, the finding that no new issues .were raised did surprise her, she said. \"That's incredible,\" Jones said of Hartin's decision. \"Their science is bad -everything is bad~ That's just amaz\u00ad ing to me.\" She said the new assessment still Reading scores Improve Bears remove McCaskey WASHINGTON- For the first time In almost a decade, American students are starting to read better. the Education Department said Wednesday .PAGE 7A America Alt pilots ordered to end slckout DALLAS -U.S. District Judge Joe Kendall ordered American Airlines' pilots Wednesday to end a sickout that has forced the cancellation of more than 2,000 American flights.

Russell The Daily Iowan A Burlington woman filed a civil 1 suit Wednesday against the state of Iowa for alleged negligence on the part of doctors at the UI Hospitals and Clinics while she 1 was in their care. Frances Ornduff alleges that, after her arrival at the UIHC in May 1994, staff negligence caused her spine to be compressed, ren\u00ad dering her quadriplegic. Also, Ornduff alleges, the UIHC failed to notify her of the change in her con\u00ad dition because they believed she would die before the negligence was discovered. In addition, the suit alleges that, during Ornduff's stay at the UIHC, the hospital staff exposed her to unnecessary levels of radiation and inappropriate medication. When Ornduff was admitted to the UIHC, she was diagnosed with fractures and swelling in the cervi-cal area of the spinal cord. She was examined by attending neurologist Dr. Bernard Zunkeler, according to court documents . The suit alleges that Zunkeler determined that surgery wasn't necessary to correct the condition because he was able to correct the fracture with his hands. After the examination, Ornduff remained at the UIHC under observation . In June 1997, Omduff's personal physician consulted her son, George B. Ornduff Jr., about his mothers' condition .

Clinton St. \"I've always thought there is a market for live music that isn't met,\" Larson said. \"We want to cater to some of those people who wouldn't normally see bands.\" Reaching a different fan base is something that local artists are looking for, said Kevin \"B.F.\" Burt, vocalist for B.F. Burt and the Blues Instigators . \"Having more venues means more people will be exposed to what we do,\" Burt said. A venue such as the Airliner will give the band a chance to play for a younger audience, because the group often plays to older audi\u00ad ences at such venues as Gabe's, 330 E. Washington St. \"There's really a fertile musical climate in Iowa City,\" said Brent Sandy, a trumpeter for the Orquesta de Jazzy Salsa Alto Mafz. \"But only time will tell whether this environment will be good for the Iowa City music scene.\" The former owner of Gunnerz, M. Gunner Grulke, has taken his experience to two Iowa City clubs in the hopes of improving and broadening the music scene. As a booking agent for both the Green Room, 509 S. Gilbert St., and Gabe's, Grulke said he will bring familiar bands back to Iowa City . \"A lot of the things you used to see at Gunnerz, you'll see at the Green Room,\" he said. But even with these additions, there is still room for improve\u00ad ment, Grulke said. \"''d like to see the scene grow even more,\" he said. \"But I think another venue can always be a good sign.\" \"UPSTAI RS\" at the Airliner will begin showcasing bands on Feb. 16; it has plans for such artists as the Orquesta de Jazz , House of Large Sizes, the Thmadoes, Mr. Blandings Dreamhouse and national swing act Jet Set Six. 01 reporter Rebecca Andei'IOII can be 004:013 1 004:014 Media examined an MRI of Omduff's spine and alerted her son that there was severe compression of the spinal cord.

Since 1993, when the Graduate Record Exam computer-based test was first introduced, students have been able to choose which form of the test -paper or com\u00ad puter -they would like to take. Not anymore. April 10 will be the last test date on which students wili be able to take the GRE with pen\u00ad cil and paper, said the Educational Testing Service, which publishes the GRE. From then on, the GRE will only be offered on computer . The types of questions and the test itself will stay the same, but how students take the test and its scoring will be different. \"A paper test is much easier to take, because on the GRE (com\u00ad puter-based) , you are not allowed to skip any questions, and you are not allowed to go back and change your answers,\" said Jake Edie of the Princeton Reuiew. Ul senior David Heaton-Bush, who took the computer GRE in October 1998, said he preferred the computer verison to the pencil\u00ad and-paper form. \"All in all, I would have to say I liked it,\" he said. \"It seemed to be easier and less stressful. If you are comfortable on computers, then I would recommend it.\" But for those not comfortable with computers, Heaton-Bush said, all they need to know, basi\u00ad cally, is how to point the mouse and click -and there is even an optional tutorial to teach students how to do that. It did bother him, though, that he could not go back and check his answers. \"It made me guess a lot more often than I would have POUCE lry A. Grtut, 22, 1104 S.

On the paper version, all the questions are worth the same amount toward the cumulative score. However, on the computer version, the initial questions weigh more heavily on the final score than the final ones do. \"Students have to keep in mind that the GRE (computer version) is an adaptive test, which means it adapts to how well you are doing,\" Edie said. Roman Reshetov, a UI senior, thought about taking the GRE on computer but decided against it because he would not be able to skip around on the test and answer the easier questions first. \"On the written exam, all of the questions count the same. It is an advantage when you are able to answer the questions out of sequence,\" he said. \"I do not think it is fair that they will no longer offer the written test, even if it is not offered as often.\" The computer GRE has been offered all year; the paper-based exam has been given only a few times each year. The test is offered the first three weeks of every month between February and June. Criss Gilbert of Exam Services administers the GRE CBT; so far, he said, most people he has asked have been impressed with the com\u00ad puter version. \"I have not yet had anybody go out of here in tears, which is kind of a routine on the paper test,\" he said. 01 reporter 0111111 O'lttle can be reached at: qulnnegan20aol .com Esbeck, Tipton, preliminary hearing has been set: Gregory D.

II was the first clash in a week, U.S. military officials said. Iraqi planes and anti-aircraft missile batteries didn't target the Western jets, but U.S. and British pilots fired on the air\u00ad defense systems to remove a potential danger, said Navy Lt. Cmdr. Ernest 1 Duplessis, a spokesman for U.S. Central Command in Florida. \"Any time we have a violation of the no\u00ad fly zone, that is a threat,\" Duplessis said. Coalition aircraft included more than half a dozen U.S. Air Force F-15E fighters and A-1 0 jets-with enough firepower to take out tanks -as well as several British GR-1 Tornado fighter-bombers.

It was the apocalypse.\" A search also was under way Wednesday for a 28-year-old British skier who disappeared in an avalanche Tuesday near the French Alps resort of Courchevel. Up to 16 inches of snow fell in parts of the Swiss Alps overnight. The official Iraqi News Agency reported the strikes killed a civilian and injured oth\u00ad ers; U.S. officials said a damage assess\u00ad ment had not been completed. The Western warplanes used precision\u00ad guided missiles and 500-and 1 ,000\u00b7 pound bombs -although U.S. officials didn't say how many-to hit surface-to\u00ad air missile batteries, radar sites and a com\u00b7 munications tower, U.S. defense officials said. The incidents occurred near Tali!, approximately 170 miles southeast of Baghdad, and near An Naja!, about 100 miles south of Baghdad. The Western air\u00ad craft first struck between 1 :30 a.m. and 3:30 a.m. CST and in a second wave at about 10 a.m. CST. U.S. officials said.

How about the one where rape-victim advocacy groups, police, UI officials and people in the community ask rape victims to report the crime. Tell the police, let peo\u00ad ple know that deviant scumbag is out there, fight back, they all seem to tell us. Speak out and make sure people know 80 the rapist can be stopped, they say. But while police and Ul offi\u00b7 cials say these things, )\"ecent actions suggest they would rather the victim shut up. A rape report was recently made to the UI Department of Public Safety about an ~eged rape in Mayflower Residence Hall. When the report was eventually made, one week after the alleged attack happened, it ~e not from the victim but from the vic\u00ad tim's parent. And after the alleged victim recalled the incident for Ul officials, the offi\u00ad cials responded by pointing out inconsisten\u00ad cies and expressing their doubts. Having the authorities thoroughly examine all aspects of an alleged rape is in the best interests of everyone involved. If discrepancies are present, they must be addressed, because no one deserves to be accused of such an awful act. But just as important to remember is how no alleged victim deserves to be discounted so quickly. Authorities should work as quick\u00ad ly as possible to determine the validity of the alleged rape story while simultaneous ly offering the alleged victim respect. Whether the response in this case was appropriate remains to be seen, but what is clear is that the handling of this incident will not help future rape victims come forward. What Public Safety and UI officials have often said in the past is that if someone is raped, they want that person to come for\u00ad ward and report the incident. But their recent actions tell us something different. 'What their recent actions suggest is that, jf and when we do report a rape, it very well may be our butt in the police depart\u00ad ment doing \"some explaining\" and not the scummy butt of the accused rapist. So what kind of mixed message is speak up or shut up? . It's a fact that many rapes go unreport\u00ad ,ed, not only at campuses but within the general population as well. For the vic\u00ad luna, rape is a demoralizing experience, )me that may keep them silent. According to statistics cited by the Rape Victim Advocacy Program, only 16 percent of 'rapes are ever reported. This makes things 'scarier for the rest of us, who may unwit\u00ad tingly encounter the rapist ourselves. risk of being sexually assaulted by someone you know is four times greater than being attacked by a stranger. Just think how awful it would be not to know about the person you are with because an earlier victim kept quiet. The victim may not have told for fear of being further victimized by the authorities or the media implying that the person deserved to be raped because, after all, she was at a party or had been drinking or had been in a short skirt. Or maybe she didn't report it because she was terrified after the rape and, by the time she was composed enough to face what happened, several days had passed. And as we now see, speaking up could result in the victim being doubted. The police would not believe the victim even if she came forward, 80 she holds it in, hoping it will never happen again. Maybe it was similar to the recent case reported by a Mayflower Hall student. The authorities have doubts, because the victim waited to tell, because the victim could not tell until a loved one spoke up and because the victim is telling a story UI officials can't fathom. 'Ib tell or not to tell. Victims know the risks for their lives and for those around them. Victims know that the police and public want to be warned about the rapist -for their safety and for that of the vic\u00ad tim. And now, unfortunately, we know from recent actions that if a victim doesn't walk into Public Safety with that short skirt ripped to shreds after an incident, no one will believe her. Reporting a rape is hard enough for a victim, and knowing that authorities may doubt the story will only make it more dif\u00ad ficult. The public should not get the mes\u00ad sage that police will doubt victims' stories. When rape-victim advocates fight to empower victims to speak up and to alert the public of the threat, the message from the authorities needs to be consistent and clear: that each allegation will be taken seriously and investigated . The UI needs to remind us that report\u00ad ing a rape is the right thing to do and that the authorities are on your side and here to ensure everyone's safety. Rape victims can report a rape, but they must have faith that officials will do what they can to make things safe for all of us. The mixed messages we get and send are numerous, but this is one issue where the communication must be clear. ' Most people would never suspect that the person next to them could be a rapist or that they are about to be victimized. This is espe\u00ad Cially a problem with acquaintance rape.

In a lawsuit filed by Planned Parenthood and a team of doctors fea\u00ad tured on the Web site, a jury found the site's creator, Otis O'Neal Horsley Jr., guilty of threatening doctors who per\u00ad formed abortions. The plaintiffs were awarded $106.5 : million in punitive damages and $500,000 in compensatory damages. What sparked the lawsuit was not the Web site's shocking images or radical message. Such scare tactics are common among zealous anti-abortion advocates . What differentiated this site from oth\u00ad ers like it was the fact that it contained the names and addresses of doctors who practice abortion. The names of the wives and children of the doctors were also included. To be sure, the Nuremberg Files were heinous and inflammatory, clear\u00ad ly displaying bloody fetuses and abor\u00b7 readers \"I don't exercise.\" Jessica Slr1 Ul freshman tion horror stories. If taste and decen\u00ad cy were on trial, the Web site would be guilty as charged. But taste is not the issue. The question was whether language that is not expressly or directly threat\u00ad ening can be deemed illegal based on social context. By viewing words as threats -not by how they are intended but by how they are received -we approach a dangerous precedent. The site made no overt threats, the defendants argued, and was thus pro\u00ad tected as political free speech. The con\u00ad stitutional standard for speech like this is whether it will create imminent lawless action. The speech at issue was offensive but clearly within constitutional limits. The _information in the Nuremberg Files, even Planned Parenthood admit\u00ad ted, contained only shadows of violence -a vague glimpse at the intense hatred \"'\\ ,,. ... Nllausen Ul senior the speakers hold for these doctors. The plaintiffs argued that in the cur\u00ad rent climate of anti-abortion violence and murder, the site aimed to terrorize doctors into submission . The jury was instructed by the judge to determine whether the site could be construed as a threat, regardless of the creators' intentions . This definition of a threat is weak at best. By viewing words as threats -not by how they are intended but by how they are received -we approach a dan\u00ad gerous precedent. Efforts to restrict free speech are to be exercised sparingly, and these restrictions should be as narrow as pos\u00ad sible. What is needed is more speech - not less -to provoke dialogue rather than violence. No matter how much one may dis\u00ad agree with the stances of such groups as the Nuremberg Files creators, there is too great a risk in limiting speech to silence them.

High school seniors show the biggest improvement, but even younger children are catching up, the Education Department said 1 Wednesday. The nation's students had been lagging in reading, even as their math and science scores advanced. ' \"Reading is the starting point for all learning,\" Vice President Al Gore said as he announced reading scores from the 1998 National Assessment of Educationa l Progress, a set of federally man\u00ad dated tests. \"All of the excitement about ' the informatio n superhig hway is 1 for naught if the words on the screen are incomprehensib le,\" ~ ' Gore said. , On the tests, a random group of pupils at three grade levels - ) 'fourth, eighth and 12th -had to , , read and answer questions about works ranging from poetry to a 1 1040EZ income-tax form. , , Many educators point out that, despite improvement , an alarm\u00ad ' ing number of U.S. schoolchildren still cannot read at a basic grade ' 'level. . 1 \"We live in an age drenched in media and information, but many ' 'of our children can't read,\" said ~-- ---.

During the 1970s and '80s, reading scores fluctuated only slightly, unlike the decreases throughout most of the 1990s and this year's inc~ase . Despite a rise in their test scores, poor, central-city and minority children still scored lower on average than other children. And children who spent more time reading with their families and less time watching television still scored better than other students. Such time with young children is the key to rising reading test scores, said Emelie Parker, a first-grade teacher from Falls Church, Va. \"We give our children time to learn how to crawl, to walk, to throw a ball,\" said Parker, a 16- year classroom veteran who has written articles on teaching read-ing. \"We need to give them the time to learn how to read. \"So often a child who has never held a crayon or 8 pencil comes to class and sits next to a child who has read for years.\" In the reading test, pupils at fourth-, eighth-and 12th-grade levels are tested approximately every two to four years through 8 national sample of about 31,000 public and private school stu\u00ad dents.

In the last few years, some facul\u00ad ty members have talked about focusing more on the school's broad\u00ad casting curriculum, Haag said.

In the past year, the journalism school has invested $20,000 in dig\u00ad ital audio equipment.

The amount of video equipment was doubled, at a cost of$30,000.

The Hawkeyes defeated the Golden Gophers 76-73 to strengthen their hopes for a first-round bye In the Big Ten Tournament. The result was a nailbiter of a game, and the Hawkeyes escaped with a 76-73 Big Ten Conference victocy, improving their record to 16-6 and 7-5 in the confer\u00ad ence. \"I looked at (Minnesota coach) Clem (Haskins) after tbe game and just shook my head,\" Iowa coach Tom Davis said. \"It's unbelievable in this league. Right to the wire -if you're lucky.\" Iowa was lucky, sort of. Despite the absence of Jess Settles (back) and a sec\u00ad ond-half hand injury to Sam Okey, the Hawkeyes overcame a five-point deficit late in the game. J.R. Koch and Jacob Jaacks responded to their teammates' injuries, and their play in the game's final six minutes enabled Iowa to win. Koch hit a key $-pointer when Iowa's offense was struggling, cutting Minnesota's lead to 62-60.

'' Amy Herrig is coming to the realization that Iowa might not make the NCAA Tournament after three straight trips. By Eric Petllflll'l The Daily Iowan , For Amy Herrig, the emotions had \u00b7 , to come out. It was just a matter of it , being the right time and situation. In a season billed as a rebuilding ' year for the Iowa women's basketball team, Herrig knew her experiences would be unlike any of those she has had since coming to Iowa in 1995. Throughout the season, the 21- , year-old senior has shared her past experiences with her young team- 1 mates. Only once, however, did she release her repressed feelings and emotions while addreuing her coach\u00ad es and teammates . Herrig's came the Hawkeyes' devastating . , overtime loss to then-No. 3 Purdue ' early last month. Herrig poured in 23 points and pulled down an all-time Big Ten conference record 25 rebounds in the game. As tears swelled her eyes, the Dubuque native spoke about her past successes in the Big Ten and NCAA Tournaments, wishing this year's team could be a part the same great experiences. \"I always refer back to past years because it is so different for me,\" Herrig said. \"I guess I'm not used to change. \"It was just a given that I thought we would (make the NCAAs), because I've been there the past three years, but now I'm coming to the realization that we might not make it.\" Despite the fact that the loss to the Boil4lrmakers started Iowa on a seven-game losing skid, Herrig's emotional speech did have an effect on the rest of the team. \"We all felt bad and started getting choked up,\" freshman forward Beatrice Bullock said. \"I feel bad for her because it's her senior year, but I feel bad for myself, too. \"We're trying our best, but we're just freshmen .\" Brian RayfThe Daily Iowan Iowa senior Amy Herrig Is second In the Big Ten In acor\u00ad See HERRIB, Page 2B lng and fl11t In rebounding this year. By Roger Kuznia The Daily Iowan If you ever wondered what it's like to be in the Army, go to Jerica Watson and Beatrice Bullock's room at Slater Hall. When the Iowa women's basketball team practiced daily at 6:30 in the morning last semester, the two were rudely awakened an hour earlier by a Nickelodeon alarm clock that blared the classic bugle call \"Reveille .\" Loud enough to be heard in the hall\u00ad way, the alarm was hardly music to either players' ears. \"We just hated to hear that,\" Bullock said. Watson, who was responsible for hitting the snooze button, said she didn't eJ\\joy waking that early, but it did help her develop some quickness . \"I did it so fast that it couldn't even get all the way through the song,\" Watson said. Thankfully , from the players' per\u00ad spective, the days of practicing before r had nightmares about oversleep, ing and missing practice. It was stressful. -Iowa freshman Beatrice Bullock, on Iowa's old 6:30 a.m. practice time. '' sun rise are over. It's a tradition that started five years ago for the Hawkeye women's team. Iowa's head coach at the time, C. Vivian Stringer, switched practice times after her husband Bill's death from a heart attack in 1993. Stringer had three young children at the time, including a daughter, Nina, with cere\u00ad bral palsy. By moving practice in the morning, Vivian Stringer was able to care for Nina and her other children in the afternoon . At the start of the spring semester , the Hawkeye s have switched back to practicing in the afternoons from 4 to 6:30 . \"I get excited to go to practice now,\" sophomore . point guard Car a Consuegra said. \"In the mornings, we See PRACTICE TIME.

When a guy hits you like that it's supposed to be a foul.\" The rough play didn't stop fol\u00ad lowing the technical . Less than two minutes later, Kyle Sanden was hit with Minnesota's second \"T\" when he threw the ball at Iowa's Jacob Jaacks. At the time, Minnesota was trailing by five, and Iowa's full\u00ad court press forced Sanden to call a timeout. As time was called, J aacks flicked the ball at Sanden's face, instigating the retaliation. \"I guess he didn't like when I tapped it,\" Jaacks said. \"I didn't think anything of it, and then he hit me with the ball. \"When 1 heard the technical called, I just prayed to God that it wasn't on me.

But as ~ has done so many times this season, Iowa's Kent McCausland hit ;a-pointer at the 2:12 mark to giv~:Iowa a 73-71 lead, which it neve}-relinquished. On the play, Jaacks threw the inbo!tnds pass to McCausland, and Dean Oliver set a key screen to get the shooter open. \"We called (the play) in the hud\u00ad dle,\" McCausland said. \"When I caught it, I told myself to take another split-second look at the rim.\" Koch and Jaacks combined for 10 points in the game's final 6:22, and Jaacks grabbed the last rebound, sealing Iowa's victory. A last-second jump shot by Lewis would not fall, but Wa! a ruled a two-point attempt anyway. Jaacks finished with 12 points and eight rebounds . He also drew praise from Davis for his work guarding the inbounds pass on the full-court press. \"You can't give Jake too much credit,\" Davis said. \"He deserves an awful lot of credit for hew we used the pressure early.\" The Gophers committed 15 first\u00ad half turnovers and drew a pair of technical fouls -one on Haskins, the other on Kyle Sanden. The Hawkeyes took advantage by scor\u00ad ing six pointa immediately after the fouls. Iowa led by seven before Terrance Simmons drained a half\u00ad court shot with no time remaining in the first half. That cut the Haw keyes' halftime lead to 39-35. Iowa scored the first six points of the second half for a 10-point lead, but hot shooting by Lewis and Kevin Clark helped the Gophers tie the game at 57 at the 7:51 mark. \"What a game,\" Haskins said. \"' Wa! proud ot my team.

And if Iowa could win that first round game, a second-round matchup with No. 2 Purdue looms . Iowa gave the Boilermakers one of its biggest scares of the season Jan. 10 when it took them into overtime, only to lose, 71-69. Regardless of Purdue's undefeated conference record (12-0}, Iowa will not be intimidated if there is another match up. \"I really don't think we fear Purdue,\" Lee said. \"We built some confidence against that team.

Lee is one of Herrig's biggest fans and hopes she can finish on a good note as one of the top players in team history. \"She has done a tremendous amount for Iowa women's basketball in her four-year career here,\" Lee said. \"I hope the fans will come out and appreciate what she has done.\" The Hawkeyes will play Minnesota Friday night at 7 p.m. and finish against Northwestern Sunday.

IJerrig frustrated to end career with losing season HI!RRIG Co~inued from Page lB ~rrig, the lone senior on the 11- member squad, was one of many peoC~le aware that patience would be an asset with such a young sup\u00ad porting cast. Bllt what she didn't know was that the season would be so taxing on 'er, emotionally and physically . \"fi's just frustrating to go out wi~ a losing season your senior year,\" she said. \"I've never had to deal with that before. I'm on a to~y different end of the totem poli. \"fm used to being Big Ten (regu\u00ad lar . l!,eason) champs or Big Ten tow:nament champs. It really has\u00ad n't eunk in yet that we are in (nixQ:h) place.\" Ilj Herrig's first three seasons, the-Hawkeyes have won Big Terl 'IbUI')Jament title, two Big Ten reg\u00ad ulai season titles and have made thr. NCAA tournament appear\u00ad anceS, including a trip to the Sweet Si.x1ieen in 1996. I\u00b7 addition to the mental hard\u00ad shiP,~ she has had to endure, this sea4Qn has put an incredible strain on ~e 6-foot-4 center's body. A year after the graduation of Iowa's highly touted 1993 recruit-ing class, Herrig has finally become option No. 1 on offense, and she's finding out what a tough responsibility it is. \"I'm not used to having three to four players on me, pushing me,\" said Herrig, who is averaging a hefty 35.2 minutes per game. \"It's something I've never had to deal with. \"Those 12 points I had (against Penn State on Jan. 31) were the toughest I've ever gotten: Coach Angie Lee knew opposing teams were going to drape Herrig with defenders , but seems to be growing tired of the predictable pattern. \"When we even looked like we were going to throw the ball inside, it was four people on her and one person guarding whoever had the ball,\" Lee said after the Haw keyes' loss to Penn State. \"That's the kind of attention that Amy's been get\u00ad ting: Does Lee think it bothers her? \"Not when you get (double fig\u00ad ures in points and rebounds): the {ourth-year coach said. \"If you can still come up with double-doubles, I ~ess it doesn't bother you that much.\" Herrig has recorded 13 double\u00ad doubles on the season, three more than her nearest competitiors. Indiana's Cindy Kerns and Penn State's Andrea Garner have 10 apiece. After averaging 9.7 points and 5.8 rebounds per game for her career, Herrig has exploded in her final season. The Hawkeye senior is among the conference leaders in scoring and rebounding, averaging 18 points and a monster11 .2 rebounds per game. Her rebounding average ranks first in the Big Ten and lOth in the nation. Herrig bas also forced Iowa's sta\u00ad tisticians to alter the record books. After beginning the season 19th on Iowa's scoring list, Herrig has moved up to ninth all-time with 1,212 points. She has also climbed into fifth place in career rebounds , ahead of Sacramento Monarchs forward Franthea Price, after Sunday's 14-board performance at Indiana. Herrig was one of the most high\u00ad ly recruited players in state history coming out of Dubuque Senior High School in 1995. Her prep coach, Larry Croghan, knew she would be successful at the college level, but wishes he could have seen her potential realized a bit sooner. \"I always felt that if (the Iowa coaches) would have done some things to allow Amy to be more of an offensive factor, the team would have been a lot better,\" Croghan said. Herrig will have to be the offen\u00ad sive force she has been all season long for Iowa to have a chance at the NCAA 'Iburnament in March. The Hawkeyes (9-13, 4-8 Big Ten) almost certainly will need the automatic bid that goes along with a Big Ten 'Iburnament title to get into the field of 64. The conference tournament will be held Feb. 26- March 1 in Indianapolis . Herrig was a part oflowa's 1996- 97 Big Ten 'lburnament title team, and would dearly like to repeat that clutch performance this sea\u00ad son. As of right now, Iowa would enter the tournament as a No. 9 seed, and could face second-ranked Purdue in a second-round match up. \"The Big Ten 'Iburnament is our bread and butter, she said. \"We've had spurts of greatness and any\u00ad thing's possible. A lot of upsets happen at that tournament. \"Needless to say, I'm gonna have everybody prepared .\" Dl sportswriter l!rtc l'tttrln can be reached at ejpeterJOI!Iue. weeo.ulowa.edu New schedule allows women's hoops team to sleep in .\u00b7 PRACTICE TIME CoT!iinued from Page lB ha~to focus to keep our bodies awake and able to concentrate .

The old one sits unused on the shelf. The new clock is not on the buzz mode, but rather the radio acti\u00ad vates to ~ soft music station. \"It doesn't have to scare us awake,\" Peterson said. Bullock experienced her own feelings of fear while she slept last semester. \"I had nightmares about over\u00ad sleeping and missing practice,\" Bullock said. It was stressful: Laura Podolak might have found the best way to avert all fears. She usually went to sleep at 9:30 to make sure to get enough rest. Podolak has since become a dis-ciple of using the snooze button. \"I don't think I needed it then, but I need it now,\" Podolak said. Iowa coach Angie Lee said the afternoon practice sesaions have been a mixed blessing. She sees a marked improvement in all the players' energy level, but it has made the coaches' schedule a little hectic. For instance, when practices were done at 9:30, the asaistant coaches had the rest of the d'y to complete recruiting work and scouting reports. Now, the coaches have to drop everything during the day and then finish what is left after practice, making their job a little tougher. \"When you start prac~ice at 4 in the afternoon, it takes a bite out of that sort of thing,\" Lee said. Lee said the switch to afternoon practices won't have much of an effect on recruiting. Either way, practice time isn't all that ill;lpor\u00ad tant to prospective Haw keyes. \"That was never a case where we lost a recruit (because of morning practices), \" Lee said. Ideally, Lee said she would like to see if she could work something out to get the early afternoon prac\u00ad tice time from 1 to 4, the time slot occupiect by 'the men's basketball tea-.. \u00b7 However, that is a decision to be made down the roacl. For now, Lee wih keep the CWTent late-after\u00ad noon time slot. \"We're going to try this and see what the future brings,\" Lee said. 01 sportswriter Row 1111111 $13 9 5 '-' (includes fried FORES1 Michael McCaskel Wednesday as pr ~bicago Bears folio coaching annour brought league-w \u00b7 }Dent to one of the franchises. , McCaskey , a Yal former business llarvard, was mo chairman of th .. restructuring was \u00b7\u00b7 his mother -m N\"uginia pne outside the family has held I \"I think it took .., J began to look rather than lftrginia !Ul:vtli,AI::iY j this was the lhing to do.\" l The team was , coaching job lmnounced prem conference McGinnis, who . }>ecause there was aFiELD~ ROUSE~ RESTAURANT & NIGHTCLUB ~ JOIN THE BIRTHDAY \u00b7CJ:.UB Stop in on your 21st Birthday, or any 8-Day after that, and get 21 PITCHERS OF BEER (or Soda Pop) FOR ONLY $21.00!!

Carrera/ Associated Press Chicago Bears team president Michael McCaskey speaks to reporters after the team announced that he was moving up to chairman of the board. The Bears later hired Jacksonville defensive coordinator Dick Jauron as coach. Michael McCaskey, 55, who became the Bears' third president in 1983, again apologized Wednesday for the McGinnis fias\u00ad co. \"There was nothing calculated in what happened there. For whatev\u00ad er mistakes that were made, I regret my part, especially the mis\u00ad understandings that developed . I wish we hadn't stumbled that badly,~ he said. \u00b7 \"It's disappointing to foul up like that and to cause grief for other people whom you admire.\" The Bears have stumbled to 4-12 records the last two seasons, and some of their recent player acquisi-tions have been disastrous, none more so than quarterback flop Rick Mirer, who cost them a first-round pick and was released after one season. Michael McCaskey, the oldest of 11 McCaskey children, has come under fire for choices throughout his career. He refused to hire a general manager, did not work out a plan to build a new stadium and saw thousands of no-shows at Soldier Field last season. After winning a Super Bowl championship in 1985 with a team assembled primarily by former general manager Jim Finks, McCaskey's tenure was marked by an eroding talent base, losing sea\u00ad sons and the firing of head coaches Mike Ditka and Dave Wannstedt . Virginia McCaskey said the McGinnis fiasco didn't persuade her family to make the change. And she said the criticism bas been tough at times. \"Any mother, any wife likes to see her loved ones appreciated and supported. But I think maybe Mike has handled it better than I have,\" she said. Michael McCaskey praised Phillips for his contributions to the team over the last 16 years. He said handing over control to a per\u00ad son outside of the family \"was emo\u00ad tional, but it's not agonizing. \"It's emotional because it is so important for us as the McCaskey\u00ad Halas family to be tied to the Bears.~ As part of the restructuring , his father, Ed McCaskey, who will turn 80 in April, stepped down as chair\u00ad man of the board and took the title of chairman emeritus . Phillips, 41, a fanner auditor and tax accountant, joined the Bears in 1983 as the club's con\u00ad troller. He is still the team's chief negotiator of players' contracts but said he will try to hire some\u00ad one for that position soon with the free agency period starting Friday. Phillips learned of his appoint\u00ad ment Monday when summoned to the McCaskey home. He said he would not hire a gen\u00b7 eral manager and that all football decisions would be made by per\u00ad sonnel director Mark Hatley and Jauron. \"I the ture in place can't be successful,\" he said. \"I'm in the process of looking at the entire organization to see what makes sense so that we can be suc\u00ad cessful in the future.\" Johnson, Ewing lead Spree-less Knicks to victory ' NEW YORK (AP) -Larry Johnson scored 18 points, and Patrick Ewing and Charlie Ward ldded 16 apiece as the New York Knicks beat the Washington 'wizards 101-88 Wednesday night.

By '-1 lewllerry Associated Press ATLANTA -The Reconstruction of Mark Wohlers is still a work in progress. The former Atlanta Braves clos\u00ad er, who mysteriously lost the abili\u00ad ty to throw strikes, stepped atop a bullpen mound at Thrner Field on Wednesday, ostensibly to take part in a winter conditioning camp con\u00ad ducted by pitching coach Leo Mazzone. But this was more than just an opportunity for Wohlers to loosen up his arm before spring training begins next week. This was part of the continuing effort to pick up the pieces of his shattered career. John Bazemore/Associated Press Atlanta Braves' Mart Wohlers, who mysteriously lost the ability to throw strikes, stepped atop a bullpen mound at Turner Field on Wednesday. \"f think he did great today,\" Mazzone said after Wohlers threw about 30 pitches from the mound behind the left-field fence. \"Mechanically, he executed what he wanted to do about 60 percent of the time, which is a big upgrade.\" But it's still a long way from Wohlers regaining his status as one of baseball's most feared pitch\u00ad ers-the guy who saved 97 games over three seasons, plus the clinch\u00ad ing game of the 1995 World Series. Several pitches skipped in the diPt; one bouncing so far in front of the\u00b7plate that it hopped over the bapkstop and onto the field. A few ot.ft~r pitches sailed directly into the baek.stop, out of the catcher's reach. Finally, Wohlers honed in on his target. It didn't matter than many . . =\u00b7 .. . of his pitches would have been balls in a game; at least they wound up in the catcher's glove. Therefore, this was a good day. \"We've got to be patient and allow him to get through certain things that ... he's trying to square away,\" Mazzone said. \"We're trying to keep on plugging to put it back together. What avenue that's going to take, I don't really know. \"At times, it comes out like he wants it to. At times, he's off tar\u00ad get. But as long as there are times where it comes out like he wants to, there's no reason why he can't do it more often.\" Wohlers seemed relaxed on the mound, smiling after one of his wayward pitches and chatting with Mazzone about his mechan\u00b7 ics. But the pitcher has no desire to talk about his comeback, brush\u00ad ing off a reporter's interview request with bitterness in his voice, the scars of last season's nightmare still evident. \"I've got nothing to say,\" he said. Wohlers' sudden meltdown has put him in the oompany of Steve Blass and Mitch Williams -other pitchers who lost sight of the strike zone. Last season, Wohlers had a 10.18 ERA in Atlanta, with 33 walks and seven wild pitches in 20 1-3 innings. He tried to regain his form in the minor leagues, but that only made matters worse. At Triple-A Richmond, he was 0-3 with a 20.43 ERA, walking 36 and throwing 17 wild pitches in 12 1-3 innings.

By Raty Miller Associated Press \"COLUMBUS, Ohio -A year ago, Ohio State was in the midst of ils longest losing streak in 99 years \u00b7 of playing men's basketball. Now, ' 'the Buckeyes are second in the Big Ten and heading for the NCAA 'lburnament. ' \"I am very surprised, to be honest \u00b7 ,with you, that we are where we are,\" coach Jim O'Brien said. \"' never 'thought going into this year we .would find ourselves in this position.\" ''f.hat position is 18-6 overall and 18-3 in the Big Ten -and a galaxy 1away from last season's marks of 8- 22 and 1-15 in the conference .

I think Ohio State is a team that will give anybody in our conference a difficult time.\" Many Buckeye fans are in shock. Just a year ago, the 22 losses matched the worst total in school history and the Big Ten record was the worst ever. The team lost a record 17 games in a row during the season and extended its Big Ten losing skid to 20 in a row. Now Ohio State is alone in sec\u00ad ond place and breathing down the neck of Michigan State. After 'fuesday night's dramatic 74-69 win over Michigan -which ran Ohio State's record at its new Value City Arena to 12-1 this year -O'Brien elected not to discuss the postseason. \"All I want them to do is to be focused on the next opponent,\" he said. \"We've had very few -and games remaining in regular season lollt'U: DIU, /ICAA get about bad games -we've had very few bad practices this year.\" Since four starters are back, the only substantive change has been point guard James \"Scoonie\" Penn. Penn, a muscular pinball who is generously listed as 5-foot-10, was the freshman of the year in the Big East three years ago at Boston College under O'Brien. He was the conference tournament MVP two years ago. While O'Brien was jousting with BC's administration over admis\u00b7 sions standards for his recruits, Randy Ayers' star had clearly fall\u00b7 en at Ohio State. Ayers did little as several of his recruits were involved in a series of crimes. On the court, they were the gang that couldn't shoot straight. Ayers was fired in the spring of 1997 and O'Brien, after a lengthy search, was hired to clean up the program. Penn transferred in. O'Brien credits his stout guard - elected a captain before ever playing in an Ohlo State game - Matthew EmmonS/The Delaware Gazette Scoonle Penn has been a big reason tor Ohio State's resurgence this year. for the team's attitude adjustment. Penn was asked before the sea\u00ad son how good the Buckeyes would be, \"and the first thing be blurts out is, 1 think we should be in the NCAA Tournament,\"' O'Brien said with a laugh. \"''m looking at him like, you know, he's nuts. \"His mentality is such that he's played two years and he's been in the tournament two years. That's what you're supposed to do when March comes along -play in the NCAA Thurnament.\" Penn isn't alone, however. Michael Redd became the first freshman to ever lead the Big Ten in scoring a year ago, although it was easy to be a gunner when the games were seldom hanging in the balance. This year, Redd has shown more control and more patience on the floor. :With Daytona win in hand, Earnhardt sets new goals 11 The seven-time Winston Cup champion wants to win \"a whole bunch more races.\" By Mike HaTis Associated Press 1 DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. -Dale ,Earnhardt hasn't had to answer i1ilililli1M11U that awful question this year: \"When are you going to win the Daytona 500?\" ' .Before his stirring victory a year ,ago at Daytona International Speedway, the seven-time Winston P.!!~~~~ ~ ' 1Cu~ champion had to field that ?

But now they want to know how it feels not to have that question asked,\" Earnhardt said, laughing. \"Now they can go along and bug Terry Labonte and Rusty Wallace and some of these other guys who haven't won it. \"It's definitely special to win the baytona \"\"'\"\"'!:..--- ---'\"\"\"\"'~ 500. Now when Earnhardt Darrell (Waltrip) and me are sitting in a rocking chair on the front porch when we're both about 70, he can't say, 'I won it and you didn't.'\" Before he won the Daytona 500, Earnhardt already was among the best in the history of his sport, Sycamore Mall 338-7764 with 71 career victories . Now, besides a record eighth champi\u00ad onship, what else does the 47-year\u00ad old driver have to accomplish? \"I want to win the Daytona 500 again, and I want to win a whole bunch more races,\" he said. Considering he has won just once in his last 92 races, that seems a stretch. But he insists his team can still win. \"We'll go out and work hard to prove that again,\" he said. \"It seems like it's just been a couple of years that we've had some turn of events that hasn't allowed us to be in the top five every race.\" Childress says the team has kept its key personnel, added two engi\u00ad neers and reorganized its shop during the winter in an effort to strengthen its hand. The team owner also pointed to the strong combination of Earnhardt and crew chief Kevin Hamlin. Larry McReynolds began the 1998 season as Earnhardt's crew chief, but their relationship deteri\u00ad orated after the Daytona victory. At midseason , Childress switched crew chiefs, putting McReynolds with Mike Skinner and Hamlin with Earnhardt. \"Both of those combination s seem to be working just fine,\" Childress said. Now it's time to make it work on the track. The next order of business is qualifying for Sunday's race. Earnhardt will start fUth in the second of two 125-mile qualifyin g races today on the 2~:rmile Daytona oval. He has won 11 of these quali\u00ad fiers, including his last nine. In the unique Daytona qualify. ing format, positions 3-30 will be determined by today's races, posi\u00ad tions 31-36 will revert to the remaining fastest drivers from time trials and the rest of the 43- car field will be provisionals .

(AP) -Ty Calderwood scored eight points during a 15-0 stretch run to lead No. 15 Wisconsin to a 57-45 victory over Northwestern Wednesday mght. Calderwood finished with 13 pomts to lead Wisconsin (20-5, 8-4 Big \u00b7Ten). Sean Mason added 12 points and Mark Vershaw 10 for the \u00b7Badgers. Evan Eschmeyer led Northwestern (14-7, 6-5) with 16 points. Danny AJlouche added 11 points for the Wilcicats. After trailing by as many as 14 points early in the second half, the Wildcats rallied to take a 45-42 lead on 'a 3-point basket. by Steve LePore with just under seven minutes remaining. But that would be the last points the Wildcats would score, as they missed their last eight shots and com\u00ad mitted three turnovers down the stretch. Calderwood ignited the Wisconsin rally with a steal and a layup to cut the Northwestern lead to 45-44. Vershaw then hit four straight free throws and Calderwood hit a 3- pointer from the corner to put the Badgers ahead 51- 45. Wisconsin put Calderwood the game away by bitting six of eight free throws. Northwestern shot just 15.8 per\u00ad cent in the first half (3-for-19) as Wisconsin built a 25-16 lead. Mason, after missing his first six shots, hit back-to-back 3-pointers to cap a 14-4 run that put the Badgers ahead 25- 14. Eschmeyer , the Big Ten's second leading scorer with a 21-point aver\u00b7 age, was held without a field goal in the first half. He missed his only two shots, but made all eight of his free throws to account for half of the Wildcats' offense. Wisconsin extended its lead to 30- 16 in the first minute of the second half on a dunk by Maurice Linton and a 3-point.er by Calderwood.

By 1'1111 Dill ... Associated Press LAS VEGAS -Eighteen years after they first met in one of the great welterweight fights of all time, Sugar Ray Leonard and Thomas Hearns got into a bit of a tussle again Wednesday . This time, though, it was just over who would get to sit next to female boxer Mia St. John on the dais at the Las Vegas Hilton. Hearns won the friendly skir\u00ad mish, then he and Leonard turned to their main job at hand -pro\u00ad moting Saturday's welterweight title fight between Oscar De La Hoya and undefeated Ike Quartey as the next great welterweight bout. As much as they tried, though, it just wasn't the same. \"It's hard to top the magnitude of what Ray and myself had,\" Hearns said. \"These guys are in our shadow.\" ~Iverson struggles, 76ers soar By Ke1 Berger Associated Press PHILADELPHIA -Allen Iverson's eyes still light up when he gets the ball in his hands. His expression changes once he releases it. The ball goes up and Iverson winces like a player in a major shooting slump. Still, the Philadelphia 76ers' star point guard is having fun lately. But it has nothing to do with 40-or 50-point games. The surprising 76ers are unbeaten even though Iverson is missing 73-percent of his shots. \"Who knows what will hap\u00ad pen when I play a good game,\" Iverson said. \"Whenever that may be.\" The 76ers, 3-0 for the ftrst time since 1984, are winning with defense and balanced scoring. Even Iverson can't believe it. Since Philadelphia made him the No. 1 pick in the draft in 1996, Iverson has been a raw, relentless scorer. He had little help in his first two seasons, and the 76ers kept losing. While making a push for the rookie of the year award in 1996, he made plenty of ene\u00ad mies when he broke Wilt Chamberlain's record with four straight 40-point games. He scored 50 in Cleveland in the record-breaking game, lea~ a ijoetile crowd with no chqice but to give him a standing ovation. Of coune, the 76ers were well out of t.hc playoff hunt by then, lending credence to ~veraon's reputation as a sup\u00ad posedly selfish' Jj)layer who cared only about his st.ats. Now, he's too busy winning games to worry about numbers. Brt1n Jonei/Associated Press WBC Welterweight champion Olear De La Hoya, left, gestures at a news con\u00b7 ference Wednesday In Las Vegas, with challenger Ike Quartey of Ghana. De La Hoya's defense of his WBC title against Quartey, a former WBA champion, is certainly on paper the best 147-pound title fight in some time, perhaps even stretching back into the era where Leonard, Hearns and Marvelous Marvin Hagler created some mem\u00ad orable bouts. It promises to give De La Hoya his first major test against an undefeated fighter in his prime, and could set the stage for a series of big fights among the smaller Hobbled Heat humbled by injury .. plagued start Pat Riley's Miami Heat are disappointing many with their 1-3 start to the season. By Ste\u00a511 Wine Associated Press MIAMI -The Miami Heat are losing players faster than they can win games, and at this rate, they'll become the first team in Pat Riley's 17-year coaching career to miss the playoffs. The two-time defending Atlantic Division champions were touted during training camp as NBA title contenders. But with two starters sidelined by injuries, the hobbling Heat hardly look like a team ready to step into the void left by the breakup of the Chicago Bulls. A 1-3 start is the worst in Riley's four years at Miami, and the l~e's abbreviated 50-game schedule makes the situation more alarming. \"The season's too short to dig such a deep hole,\" forward P.J. Brown said. \"We need to get out of it real quick. This team has enough here to get the job done. We're a little down right now, but we believe in what we have.\" What the Heat have is a shortage of manpower and firepower . Forward Jamal Mashburn , who appeared on the brink of a breakthrough season, was diagnosed 'fuesday with a deep knee bruise that is expected to side\u00ad line him for four to six weeks, rough\u00ad ly half the season. Guard Voshon Lenard could miss the entire season with a stress fracture in his leg dis\u00ad covered last month. In their absence, All-Stars Tim Hardaway and Alonzo Mourning are trying to carry the offense, with dismal results. Hardaway is shoot\u00ad ing 35 percent, while Mourning is shooting 43 percent with 17 turnovers and three assists. \"'t has been almost 2 112 years since we had this kind of doubt,\" Riley said. \"Since two of our key guys aren't here, we've got to find a game Tony Gulllerrn/Associated Press Miami coach Pat Riley grimaces after one of his players commits a foul In the final seconds of the fourth quarter against Boston Tuesday. we can play that's a little bit different now that's going to be effective.\" ~iley considered acquiring Latrell Sprewell before the season but opted not to make buster deal. p.lll.)

But, though it may be a fight fan's favorite, it comes no where near being the event that Leonard\u00ad Reams was when they met for the first time at Caesars Palace nearly two decades ago. \"We generated far more intrigue, far more interest,\" Leonard said. \"Thomas Hearns was a personality. I was a personality. Everybody knew the power Thomas Hearns had \u00b7and everyone knew what a ring technician I was.\" Leonard and Hearns were brought in by promoter Bob Arum to help generate interest in the fight, which matches two undefeat\u00ad ed fighters who have distinctly dif. ferent styles and have both been champions in the 147-pound class. De La Hoya may be the biggest name in boxing outside of Mike Tyson, but only those in the know have heard much about Quartey, despite his impressive credentials. \"We were concerned about how this fight would sell because of Quartey's relative anonymity,\" Arum said. \"He's from Ghana and doesn't talk much, so people don't know about him.\" D Institute of Higher Learning Friendly Afternoon Place To Study!

Hefner, the band, was recently picked up by the Too Pure label, the same record-push\u00b7 ers responsible for the likes of PJ Harvey, Stereolab and Pram. Smoothly gliding into an ever-narrowing anemative-rock spotlight, Hefner squeezes in its long-awaited debut album. Breaking God's Heart. The ~m utilizes various strong, Loodon\u00ad based folk influences. Hefner focuses its musl\u00b7 cal Intentions on spirited guitar plucking and a high am vtilrr/ but melodic voice, Pf'OVided by leOO singer Darren Hayman. The band comes off sounding a bit tike a mutated, more indus\u00b7 trialized VIOlent Femmes. Hayman's lyrics and vocal tendencies squeal and clearly bring about all the points he wants to make. He puts his signature twists on the subject matter -subUy inter\u00ad twining love and sex into every topic he emits, not unlike the Femmes' Gordon Gano. Hayman uses an appropriate amount of 1.

His storytelling abilities taka nt.merOUS emotional scenes to almost a leYel of hilarity. Wrth song titles such as \"A Hymn for the Service,\" \"The Ubrarian\" and \"Love Inside the Stud Farm,\" he makes seriously sadness-oriented subjects, well, fun. Breaking God's Heart possesses a musi\u00ad cal storyboard that could easily support an entire musicalltheater production. Hefner's debut is not as audibly powerful as an album might need to be to survive in our present musical genre, but it's attractive enough to listen to over and over. Hayman says it best in the track. \"Tactile\": \"I don't want to get lald/1 just want to be held.\" SONGS FROM MY FUNERAL Snake farm Using songs originally put together as far back as 100 years ago, Snaketarm was able to remake them to sound as if they're com\u00ad ing out tomorrow. Snakefarm's debut album, Songs From ~ Funeral, is a superb collection of flavor-filled covers I sure as hell hope they play at my funeral. Anna Domino and husband Michel Delo\u00b7 ry submerge their hands in some of the most traditional folk songs around in what started out as a little experiment that rapidly produced results. The duo began with the simple Idea of recreating some folk songs with large quan\u00ad tities of bass and drumbeats. From there, they concentrated strictly on songs about death and loss. It's a little oft the wall at times. Just imag\u00b7 ine Bob Dylan with huge bass drops and ON THE LIPS Game,\" which is probably true. That is, unless you're a Bulls fan. 3.

The movie's endearing main character Erin, played by the sensational Hope Davis, reveals its peculiar viewpoint. Erin's deeply rooted discontent is marked by a harsh, yet oddly channing cynicism that penneate s the entire film, giving it a comic and sadly truth\u00ad ful resonance. (The universally attrac\u00ad tive theme of destined love is always an 1HEQBAR from 7pm to close A BUCK WI \u00b7 BUY IT Apple Pucker Shots Vodka (well drinks) . tm~IDP, 0 NDU .HAV the less roman\u00ad tic, more realistic approach to uncover\u00ad ing the truth behind love and destiny.) Erin's view of relationships is rigid, unwavering in the faoe of romanticized notions of fate and destiny. It is her lit\u00ad tle quirks that make her charactM so lovable. Often in the movie, she reads from her father's poetry book. It's title, \"Heart Needs Home,\" indirectly com\u00ad menta on Erin's true desire: to believe in all the romanticized ideas that have deceived her thus far in life. She des\u00ad perately wants to encounter love. SulTOunded by people who are in similar life predicaments, such as her widowed and overbearing mother or her friends who are constantly philoso\u00ad phizing on fate, destiny and bue love, Erin is confronted with her own situa- call 319/335-1160 tion. ~ she speaks against their ideal\u00ad ist perspectives, her delicately fierce penoooa resonaiee with truth. Without Erin's consent, her mother places a peraonaJ ad for her daughter. Though reluctant at first, Erin decides to pursue some 6fthe calls she receives. What ensues is a hilarious series of miscued dates featuring inadequate morons and translucent liars. This amusing story line propels the movie forward, though where it is heading is nearly as unoerta.in as love itself. Along with Erin's search for happi\u00ad ness is Alan, played by Alan Gelfant. He is also striving for loving content\u00ad ment, exrept his approach is lees pes\u00ad simistic and more nonchalant. He patiently waits for love to hap\u00ad pen, doing what he can to keep himself happy. Although be seems to be a step ahead of Erin in tenns of self-under-standing, their personalities seem to be a nearly perfect match. The main deficiency of the 6lm is the philosophical breaks throughout the story. The idea that love is mysterioua and elUBive is learned quickly, and the oonstant emphasis upon this does little for the story. But the frustration and philosophi\u00b7 cal gibberish in \"Next Stop, Wonder\u00ad land\" is intelligently and sensitively soothed by the time the film ends. The wonderfully developed charac\u00ad ters, especially Erin, make Next Stop, Wonderland\" an intelligent, amusing and insightful film. It is a ' reireshi.ngly honest and bitingly fun. ny contemplation on relationships, love and destiny that everyone should see, regardless of his or her personal notions on the subject. \u00b7 ;class or toll-free In Iowa and western Illinois t X t t /(.

It wasn't the set nor the theater nor the funding; it was the playwright. Mamet says the men in \"Goldberg Street\" must be, well, men. That put the kibosh on the five women of the QuintEssential The\u00b7 atre Co., which was to make its Off. Broadway debut with a series of brief plays taken from Mamet's 1985 collection of stories and monologues. The 20-something actresses had hoped to hit the boards at Manhat\u00ad tan's Limelight .theater with vintage in-your-face Mamet -lines such as \"You can kiss my ... \" and \"Go to hell!\" But only hours before opening night last month, they learned they had lost their dramatic license. \"ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST\" said the letters on one legal missive representing Mamet's agent. \"David Mamet does not per\u00ad mit any gender changes.\" A Mamet man is a man is a man, after all.

The performers in QuintEssen\u00ad tial, on the other hand, \"feel this is a breach of contract,\" said actress Rebecca Woodland . When they paid for the rights in October 1998, she said, the troupe made it clear they were women. Their lawyer is now threatening to sue two publishing companies that share the rights if the troupe is not compensated for at least $10,000 in production expenses. \"Once you grant the rights to five females, you know that they're going to perform the work,\" attor\u00ad ney John Lonuzzi said Monday. \"In this case, after rights were granted, someone decided they didn't want to go ahead with it.\" Gender-bending is nothing new in drama. Plays in ancient Greece were usu\u00ad ally staged with men playing female roles. Shakespearean characters of both sexes were traditionally played by men or young boys. Proper Elizabethan ladies, after all, dared not appear on the bawdy boards, something illustrated in the current film \"Shakespeare in Love,\" in which Gwyneth Paltrow swad\u00ad dles herself in men's clothes simply so she can act alongside her love, William Shakespeare.

It starred the gender-exploding pop star Madonna. This time, Mamet's lawyers say QuintEssential has gone too far. When asked via his literary agent to comment on the problem, Mamet was mum. His agent didn't return calls made late last week and today. The five women chose Mamet's work because, Woodland said, \"we wanted to produce theater that transcends gender boundaries, that's people-driven, that's about human communication. \" And, Woodland argues, it doesn't matter whether the skits are played by men or women, because they \"have nothing to do with sexual interaction .\" THEATER: \u00b7 \"Picaao lithe Llpln AGile\" will be at Theatre B, Ul Theatre Building, at 8 and 11 p.m. ' Continuing Exhibits Habell Corpus: Public Figura, an open collage wor1<r0om of ideas. drawings, clip\u00ad pings from news & other media, pho\u00ad tographs, words, etc. The public Is welcome to contribute to the exhibit.
