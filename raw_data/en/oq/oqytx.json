s the financial status of the Employee Health Insurance Trust Fund pursuant to A.R.S. \u00a738 -652 (G), which reads: The Department of Administration shall annually report the financial status of the trust account to officers and employees who have paid premiums under one of the insurance plans from which monies were received for deposit in the trust account since the inception of the health and accident coverage program or since submission of the last such report, whichever is later. The Benefit Options program is accounted for in two different funds. The Special Employee Health Fund, also known as F und 3015 or the Health Insurance Trust Fund (HITF) encompasses the medical and dental programs and the appropriated expenditures for ADOA , Human Resources Division, Benefit Services operations. The ERE/Benefits Administration Fund, or Fund 3035, is primarily a \"pass through\" fund for other benefits including vision, life, and disability insurance, and flexible spending accounts. The benefits offered through the program fall into one of two types \u2014 self-funded or fully-insured. For 201 3, the health benefit plan and the dental PPO plan were self- funded, whereas the dental HMO plan, vision plan, life, and disability insurance plans were fully -insured. The State's self -funded medical plan began on October 1, 2004, and consists of both integrated and nonintegrated options for the medical plan with a carved- out pharmacy plan. The integrated option combines the functions of claims review and payment, network access, and medical management, including utilization management, case management and disease management. The non- integrated option is similar, except the medical manageme nt function is carved out to a separate contracted vendor. Plan Year (PY) 2013 was the first year of the self -funded dental PPO plan. Schedules of premiums received and accounted for in F und 3015, distribution by enrollment , incurred and paid medical/drug claims , and expenses related to the medical and dental plans are included within this Annual Report. A lso included is a summary of premiums collected and paid for life insurance, disability insurance, vision insurance, and flexible spending ac counts for Fund 3035. All data provided herein is for PY 2013 (January 1, 201 3 - December 31, 2013). Health Insurance Trust Fund January 1, 201 3 to Annual Report December 31, 201 3 5 Executive Summary During PY 2013 , ADOA offered a comprehensive insurance package through Benefit Options to over 128 ,000 members consisting of active state and university employees, retirees, and their qualified dependents. The benefits offered in the package include medical, pharmaceutical, dental, flexible spending, vision, wellness, life, and disability insurance. Based on the 2013 contribution strategy, the sum of health and dental premiums collected was $810 million with total plan expenses of $804 million , resulting in a net operational gain of $6 million . Health Plan The average plan cost to insure each member was $5, 302 Average active member cost was $ 5,033 Average retiree cost was $8, 773 The m edical claims expense was $505 million of total health plan cost s for 201 3 The leading diagnosis category by cost was the musculoskeletal system o Just over 1 3% of the total medical claims cost Claims showed members are seeking care from physicians or specialist s for the majority of th eir medical needs , indicating appropriate care o 170 emergency room visits per 1,000 members o 221 urgent care visits per 1,000 members o 4,515 physician visits per 1,000 members The pharmacy claims expense was $118 million of total health plan cost for 201 3 The leading therapeutic drug class by cost was diabetes o 11% of the total pharmacy claims cost 1.4 million prescriptions were filled during P Y 2013 o Retirees filled an average of 31 prescriptions per year o Active members averaged 10 per year Wellness Program Administered over 12,6 00 flu vaccines through 635 worksite or public events Administered over 6,4 00 screenings through 150 worksite events 590 referrals to physicians for various health issues Performance Measures Financial guarantees are in place to manage the performance of the cont racted vendors. Most vendors met the majority or all of the agreed -upon performance measures. However, penalties in excess of $301,000 were collected in 201 3 from a few vendors failing to meet agreed upon PY 2012 performance target s in areas such as customer service, claims processing, and disease management clinical improvements . Review The PY 2013 ratio of expenses to premiums of 99% indicates that the ADOA effectively controlled the rise in health care costs through quality benefit design, administrative oversight, strategic planning , auditing, and effective contract management. Detailed evidence o f ADOA 's accomplishments can be reviewed herein. Health Insurance Trust Fund January 1, 201 3 to Annual Report December 31, 201 3 6 Health Insurance T rust Fund S ummary Table 1 i s a cash statement of receipts received and expenses paid during 2013 for PY 2013 and prior plan years . ADOA Health Plan is the self - funded medical program and includes Aetna, Blue Cross Blue Shield of Arizona administered by AmeriBen, C igna, and UnitedHealthcare networks. State and university employees and retirees choose coverage from one of the self -funded networks. BCBS (NAU) is a fully-insured option available only to NAU employees and NAU retirees. The Medicare Part D Retiree Drug Subsidy is available to employers who provide a qualified pharmacy plan to Medicare- eligible retirees. The Early Retiree Reinsurance Program was instituted by the Affordable Care Act as an incentive for employers to continue health coverage for early reti rees. The 2013 expense is reimbursement to the federal government for an overpayment of subsidies received in a prior year. Reserves are monies set aside for the purpose of paying claims that have been incurred but not reported (IBNR) and for a contingency reserve to cover any insufficiencies that may develop, such as actual medical trend exceeding assumed medical trend in rate setting, shifts in plan membership, unexpected catastrophic claims, and changes in provider reimbursement rates that may occur in a given plan year.

If a vendor fails to meet any of the measures within the spec ified performance range, the vendor is required to submit a Corrective Action Plan detailing why the measure was missed and any actions taken to address the issue and improve performance to meet the standard of the measure. A percentage of the vendor's annual payment , or previously agreed upon amount, is then withheld by ADOA as a performance penalt y per the terms of the vendor contract . This percentage is allocated among the more critical measures of the contract. The following is a report of the agreed- upon performance standards both met and missed by contracted vendors during PY 2013 . In each case, performance penalties for measures missed are assessed per the terms of the individual vendor contract.

Audit Services performs systematic evaluations of contract compliance, operational controls, risk management, and the implementation of best practices to support HRD objectives. During PY 2013 , 33 audit projects were completed to ensure the Benefit Options vendors provided contracted services appropriately . The audit schedule for PY 2013 was developed using a combination of contract elements and risk analysis. The 3 3 audit projects resulted in 23 recommendations, 17 of which were fully implemented by the end of the year, and resulted in $143,574.17 of identified recoverable overpayment s. Individual audit objectives were developed with the consideration of dollar value, complexity of operations, changes in personnel or operations, loss exposure, and previous audit results. Table 20 is a summary of the functional areas in which audits were completed and the corresponding audit methodology. Audit Services Summary Functional Area Audit Methodology Vendor operating transactions Statement on Standards for Attestation Engagements No. 16 Audits (\"SSAE 16\") Evaluation of external audit results Vendor execution of benefit design and contract elements Plan Implementations Plan Allowance s/Exclusion s (\"A&E\") Plan Authorizations Claims adjudication compliance Inquiries (i.e., research, plan coverage design, etc.) ADOA accuracy of shared data Dependent Eligibility Audit (DEA) Audit program improvement initiatives Performance Guarantees Quality management standards Vendor Report Card Administrative functions and program -specific improvements Table 20: Audit Services Summary Vendor Operating Transactions All Benefit Options contracted vendors that pay claims are required to provide a copy of an SSAE 16, which is an independently assessed operational annual audit. SSAE 16 audits evaluate the internal control of the vendor's systems utilized to adjudicate claims and identify deficiencies. Audit S ervices reviewed the SSAE 16 reports provided by each of the vendor's external auditors. There were no instances of significant operating failure noted and no corrective action was required. In addition, audits performed by external or third party vendors were evaluated and considered for the development of the audit schedule when there is significant impact on the Benefit Options program and contract compliance (i.e. large medical and/or pharmacy claims audit). Health Insurance Trust Fund January 1, 201 3 to Annual Report December 31, 201 3 33 Vendor Execution of Benefit Design and C ontract Elements Plan implementation audits are completed annually for new, deleted, or revised plan design elements. Implementation audits are designed to measure compliance with new and/or revised plan elements as they are executed at the start of a new plan year. Plan elements may include revisions to language in the plan document, vendor system edits (claim adjudicati on), plan allowances/limitations, internal controls, etc. Audit results for 2013 indicated that , in some cases , claims for compression garments, wigs/hair pieces, and amino acid based formulas were not adjudicated properly . Additionally, some thresholds were not applied to hearing aids and durable medical equipment. E stimated recoverable overpayment s of $13,318.79 were identified. Plan allowance/exception (A&E) audits are designed to evaluate whether the contracted vendors' system s were set up correctly in compliance with Benefit Options' plan design. A&E audit findings for PY 2013 indicated that plan limitations and restrictions were processed accurately and members received the benefits allowed to them as defined in the plan description with the exception of two coverage elements. Chiropractic allowance and excluded biofeedback treatment were erroneously adjudicated. Impact report s identified recoverable overpayments of $2,347.20. Plan authorization reviews are conducted to ensure contracted vendors implement operational changes, language revisions, and claim payment exceptions in an accurate and timely manner. A plan authorization is an agreement between ADOA and the contracted vendor to revise a process or operating standard and may be initiated by either party . Results for 2013 indicated that plan authorizations were correctly implemented and no corrective action was required. Claims adjudication compliance audits are performed to evaluate the cont racted vendors' adherence to regulatory guidelines, current operating standards, contractual elements, vendor performance, and/or plan authorization documents. During PY 2013, an end-stage renal disease (ESRD) audit was conducted to follow up the initial evaluation completed in 2012 of the medical vendors' accuracy of primary and secondary payer status. The follow up audit identified $127,908.18 of recoverable overpayment s. ADOA Accuracy of S hared Data Dependent eligibility audits are performed annually on the Benefit Options program membership. The eligibility audits provide assurance that dependent eligibility is monitored effectively and the risk of claims paid on behalf of ineligible dependents minimized. The r esults of the 2013 eligibility audit indicated 2 ineligible individuals enrolled in the plan and who were receiving benefits erroneously due to system limitations . Additionally, 2 different dependents received benefits due to unreported or untimely filing of qualified life events . Finally, 6 dependent s who received benefits were removed from the plan because the subscribers did not provide documentation supporting their dependent status es.
