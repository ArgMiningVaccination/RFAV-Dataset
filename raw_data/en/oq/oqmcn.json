Refresh the energy in your home or office with an Energy Clearing Ceremony. Energy clearing techniques have been used for thousands of years to clear the subtle energy flow in your home. This is done by using incense, smudging, prayers, energy transmission, and healing sound vibrations. Eric will cleans the energy, balance the ley lines, and instill positive harmonious vibrations in your home or office. Similar to Feng Shui, it is very important to have proper subtle energy flow in your home or office. Keeping a good energy flow creates clarity and ease in your daily living. Oftentimes the energy gets stuck or blocked in your space, similar to how the qi meridians in the body can get stuck and sluggish. These subtle energy blocks in your home can make it challenging to think clearly or maybe even cause certain inharmonious situations in your daily life. What will it do? Experiences may vary, however, most often people experience a deeper sense of peace and lightness in their space after the session. After your clearing, you may notice it is easier to think clearly and be more relaxed and productive. You may also notice how others in your space are calmer, kinder, and easier to be with. Virtual Clearing via video call using Zoom or Whatsapp Eric will guide you through the process as together you go into each room and clear the space.

He did individual ceremonies and chants for each room. Participating in his custom ceremony really improved my sense of wellbeing. I've been a reflexology client of Eric's for 10 years and I had been greatly missing his special healing powers during recent months and was thrilled that Eric was able to clear and enlighten the energy in my condo!\" - J McCormick, USA Schedule your Virtual Clearing [Click HERE](https://app.acuityscheduling.com/schedule.php?owner=17789475&appointmentType=18747809) Schedule your home clearing or Puja [Click Here](https://app.acuityscheduling.com/schedule.php?owner=17789475&appointmentType=category:Visit%20Onsite%20Services) After you schedule your home clearing, you must contact me and we will discuss all the details.
