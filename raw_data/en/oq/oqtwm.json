The following pages contain important information about the university's academic programs and services, and they reflect the dedication of the faculty and staff who will help prepare you for profes- sional and personal success. As the new president of Cal State Northridge, I have witnessed the strength and commitment of this institution to its students and communi- ty. I am impressed by the breadth of the educa- tional opportunities, programs, and services the campus provides. The university has shown remarkable agility throughout its history by embracing change and meeting challenges head on. As a result, CSUN is a leading institution of higher education that gives students the experi- ence they need to achieve their goals and serve the community. I feel privileged to have the opportunity to lead the university into the new millennium. A college education in this era of information and technology is essential. An increasing num- ber of new and returning students, who have recognized the importance of baccalaureate and advanced degrees in today's competitive work environment, choose to study at Cal State Northridge. Many new jobs - including new industries that did not even exist a decade ago - offer exciting career opportunities for our graduates. The university's latest program enhancements underscore the institution's commitment to stu- dents. One of the centerpieces of this mission is the new Student Services Center, opened in fall 1999 and located in the former Administration Building. We have consolidated a wide range of services previously located around campus, including Admissions and Records, Financial Aid, Academic Advisement, the Counseling Center, the Learning Resource Center, Developmental Math, Outreach and Recruitment, and University Financial Services. The Student Services Center is but one example of how we strive to ensure that our programs and services are always focused on students.Similarly, the recent redesign of the Oviatt Library - the intellectual and physical center of our campus - features new landscaping and a sweeping staircase effectively connecting the Library to the Sierra Quad and the rest of the university campus. Also being built are new facilities for the College of Arts, Media, and Communication, the College of Health and Human Develop- ment, Information Technology Resources, and Administration. We are at the threshold of a new era that will give us the opportunity to make significant technological enhancements to serve students of the 21st century. Additional improvements are planned, including informal gathering areas where students, faculty, and staff can come together as a community. These enhancements support the pursuit of excellence by Cal State Northridge's faculty, many of whom are leaders in their fields and produce cutting edge scholarship and instruc- tion. Because of the faculty's shared commit- ment to student achievement, students at Cal State Northridge have many more opportuni- ties to be mentored by faculty and engage in \"hands-on\" research and scholarship than is common at large public universities. We take great pride in the rich and diverse un- versity experiences available to students. In addition to the many cultural activities offered by the campus, more than 225 student organi- zations offer career preparation, recreation, and opportunities for artistic, religious, and political expression. Students are served by an expanded Student Union, a 500-seat Performing Arts Center, and state-of-the-art communications technologies which students can access through personal computer accounts they receive when they enroll. Since its founding in the late 1950s, Cal State Northridge has experienced phenomenal growth as the only four-year institution in the San Fernando Valley and as a leading academic institution in Southern California. We take great pride in the quality of the students we have educated and in the service we provide to them and to the community as a center of learning and cultural life in the Valley We envision a continuation and expansion of these achieve- ments and invite you to become an active part of California State University, Northridge.

HISTORY In the fall of 1956, the San Fernando Valley Campus of the Los Angeles State College of Applied Arts and Sciences was established on the present site of the University. Soon afterward the California Legislature passed Assembly Bill No. 971, which provided that the campus would separate from its parent college July 1, 1958\u2014the founding date of the present University\u2014to become San Fernando Valley State College. At that time it had an enrollment of about 3,300 students with a faculty of 104. On June 1, 1972, the college was renamed California State University, Northridge, by action of the Legislature and the Board of Trustees of The California State University. Today it is the largest residential campus in the CSU system with approximately 10 percent of its enrollment living in dormitories on campus and thousands more in nearby apartments. THE UNIVERSITY. California State University, Northridge, as a community of scholars, has the following educational commitments: This University has a responsibility to preserve, foster, and transmit the cultural and intellectual heritage of our pluralistic, interdependent, and changing world. This University has a responsibility to foster academic freedom by assuring that its members may express their ideas openly and freely. This University has a responsibility to provide a setting in which students may acquire and develop skills of intellectual inquiry and values of human understanding. This University has a responsibility to encourage students to realize their greatest creative potential and make substantial contributions to society as educated persons, skilled professionals, and thoughtful citizens. This University has a responsibility to provide opportunities for students and faculty to challenge their abilities and to examine critically the values of culture and society. This University has a responsibility to cultivate in the student an understanding that the University experience is a segment of a lifelong process of study and learning. This University has a responsibility to provide programs that support the admission, retention, and education of populations that have not had equal educational opportunity, and to provide all students with a meaningful range of services, facilities, and opportunities for personal development. In keeping with these commitments: 1.California State University, Northridge recognizes teaching, research, and public service as its major responsibilities. Of these, undergraduate instruction hasfirst priority. A second major priority is to offer quality graduate and postbaccalaureate instruction and teaching credential programs in areas in which there is particular faculty strength and an important societal need. Research that advances and encourages learning is integral to all instruction and is supported by the University. The University fulfills its major responsibility in public service through its teaching and research. The University also serves its community as a center of culture, science, and technology, and encourages the community to draw on the special talent of its faculty and students. 2.California State University, Northridge recognizes that the primary goals of the instructional program are to increase the ability of the students to learn, to think critically, to express their ideas clearly and cogently, to understand themselves, their culture and their society, both past and present, and to appreciate the multicultural diversity of their world. Students must also demonstrate competency in analytical skills and the methods of intellectual inquiry, and develop an appreciation of aesthetic values. In keeping with these goals and with Trustee policy1the University is committed to providing a foundation in the liberal arts and sciences for all its baccalaureate degrees. The University maintains the quality of this foundation through the high priority placed on the liberal arts and sciences. Upon this foundation of liberal education, the University offers a choice of courses, majors, minors, and professional and career curricula to meet the needs and interests of its students. The professional and applied fields are an important part of this University. The University offers opportunities in disciplines or fields of study which have proven their value, or which promise a significant new value for society, or which serve a substantial public need, or which can achieve and maintain distinction. The University will limit the variety of its offerings to assure that the programs it offers are of the highest quality possible. 3.California State University, Northridge recognizes that education is not restricted to formal learning in a classroom setting.

In considering developments in the applied fields ... each college has the responsibility to insure that excellence in the arts and sciences is already being achieved, and that other developments will not be at the expense of the total college program.''

UNIVERSITY G OVERNANCE AN D ADMINIS TRATION THE CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY The individual California State Colleges were brought together as a system by the Donahoe Higher Education Act of 1960. In 1972 the system became The California State University and Colleges and in 1982 the system became The California State University. The oldest campus\u2014San Jos\u00e9 State University\u2014was founded as a Normal School in 1857 and became the first institution of public higher education in California. The most recently opened campus - California State University, Monterey Bay, began admitting students in the fall of 1995. A new site has been conveyed and a 23r dcampus, CSU Channel Islands, is being formally established in Ventura County. Responsibility for The California State University is vested in the Board of Trustees, consisting of ex officio members, alumni and faculty representatives, and members appointed by the Governor. The Trustees appoint the Chancellor, who is the chief executive officer of the system, and the Presidents, who are the chief executive officers of the respective campuses. The Trustees, the Chancellor and the Presidents develop systemwide policy, with actual implementation at the campus level taking place through broadly based consultative procedures. The Academic Senate of The California State University, made up of elected representatives of the faculty from each campus, recommends academic policy to the Board of Trustees through the Chancellor. Academic excellence has been achieved by The California State University through a distinguished faculty, whose primary responsibility is superior teaching. While each campus in the system has its own unique geographic and curricular character, all campuses, as multipurpose institutions, offer undergraduate and graduate instruction for professional and occupational goals as well as broad liberal education. All of the campuses require for graduation a basic program of General Education requirements, regardless of the type of bachelor's degree or major field selected by the student. The CSU offers more than 1,600 bachelor's and master's degree programs in some 240 subject areas. Many of these programs are offered so that students can complete all upper-division and graduate requirements by part-time, late afternoon and evening study. In addition, a variety of teaching and school service credential programs are available. A limited number of doctoral degrees are offered jointly with the University of California and with private institutions in California. In fall 1998, the system enrolled approximately 350,254 students, taught by more than 19,500 faculty. The system awards more than half of the bachelor's degrees and 30 percent of the master's degrees granted in California. Some 1.84 million persons have been graduated from CSU campuses since 1960.2 0 0 0 - 2 0 0 2 IN T R O DUC T ION: CALIFORNIA STATE UN I V ERSI TY, NOR T HRIDGE 1 3THE CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY TRUSTEES EX OFFICIO TRUSTEES The Honorable Gray Davis State Capitol Governor of California Sacramento 95814 The Honorable Cruz Bustamante State Capitol Lieutenant Governor of Sacramento 95814 California The Honorable Antonio Villaraigosa State Capitol Speaker of the Assembly Sacramento 95814 The Honorable Delaine Eastin 721 Capitol Mall State Superintendent of Public Sacramento 95814 Instruction Dr. Charles B.

ACADEMIC ADVISEMENT CHOOSING A MAJOR Choosing your MAJOR means deciding on your area of academic specialization. Your major will function as your academic home at the university, so you will want to decide on a major as soon as possible (and no later than the beginning of your junior year). Faculty in your major will give you any needed academic advising, and will likely be your best source for letters of reference if you decide to go on to graduate or professional school, or when you are ready to apply for a job. You must formally notify the University of your choice of major, either by declaring your major on your application form or by filing a Change of Major form with Admissions and Records. CSU Northridge offers students a choice of over fifty different undergraduate majors. Most majors will require that you complete at least 45 units of your bachelor's degree in the major field. Some require substantially more units. Factors to consider when you're choosing your major include your own personal interests; your academic strengths; faculty advice; and career or professional goals. Your major will be printed on your transcript and your diploma when you graduate from the University. Freshman and sophomore students who are undecided about their major may enroll in \"undecided\" status.

Until you have obtained such advisement you will not be able to register through TTR. CHOOSING A MINOR Many students decide that they would benefit from a MINOR, a formal program of study in a field other than their major. The name \"minor\" refers to the smaller size and significance of the program as compared with your major. A minor may be required of students in certain majors, but for most students, it is optional. Students who voluntarily choose a minor typically do so either from personal interest in the minor field, or because a minor can provide them with a recognized field of secondary expertise or knowledge that may be attractive to employers and to graduate or professional schools. If you plan to complete a minor, you should choose it as early as possible in your college career so that you can elect General Education classes that may satisfy requirements for both GE and the minor simultaneously. You must formally notify the University when you choose a minor by filing a Change of Minor form with Admissions and Records. The name of your completed minor will be recorded on your transcript when you graduate from the University. CHOOSING CLASSES Prior to the start of each Touch Tone Registration period, students should obtain an appropriate Schedule of Classes and plan a tentative program of study for the coming semester. Students should ensure that they meet all prerequisites and consider all requirements for each course in their program of study. Certain departments and special programs require students to receive advisement before accessing TTR; all students, regardless of major, should review their tentative program with a faculty advisor before registering for classes. Undecided students should consult with an advisor from the Advising Resource Center/EOP. Students participating in the Educational Equity Program should contact the appropriate College-based Equity Program. FACULTY ADVISORS Students should seek a faculty advisor in their major field. Faculty advisors are available in each department prior to registration and at regular intervals during the semester. They are prepared to assist and advise students in the selection of a balanced academic program of courses compatible with their background and future plans. However, the primary responsibility for course registration rests with the student. Students should consult departmental listings in the catalog for further information on academic advisement. FINDING FACULTY Except for emergency absences or approved modifications to the class schedule, faculty members are responsible for meeting all assigned undergraduate and graduate courses in accordance with the University Schedule of Classes. Faculty office hours for appointments are scheduled, announced in class, posted, and on file in departmental offices. PRE-PROFESSIONAL ADVISEMENT Students planning to pursue graduate work should supplement their undergraduate program by anticipating language requirements at graduate schools and by intensive work in areas inside and outside the college of their major that are of special relevance to their intended graduateprogram. Students should consult their advisors to ensure that they make a wise selection of courses. PRE-DENTISTRY: There is no specific pre-dental major at CSU Northridge, but most students accepted into dental school have majored in biology or chemistry. The Dental Admission Test is required, and most students admitted to dental school have a baccalaureate degree. The courses listed below are the minimum requirements for most dental schools. To enroll in the first courses in Biology, Chemistry, English, and Physics, appropriate prerequisites must be met. Check catalog course descriptions for prerequisites.

Website: www.aads.jhu.edu PRE-LAW: Law schools typically do not recommend any particular undergraduate major over any other. Hence, there is no program specifically designated by the University as the only appropriate course of studies to pursue in preparation for the study of law. Some generalizations regarding preparation at the undergraduate level may be made, however. The pre-law student should seek to develop a mastery of the English language, a critical understanding of the values and institutions with which the law deals, and the ability to think creatively and independently. Mastery of the English language encompasses the ability to convey meaning clearly, effectively, and concisely, as well as the ability to grasp the precise meaning of factual statements. Coursework which strengthens writing, reading, speaking, and listening skills is strongly recommended. The pre-law student should study the values and institutions of our society. The economic systems of societies, their political organizations, their social and cultural structures are all valuable areas of inquiry for the pre-law student. An appreciation for the democratic process in western societies is helpful, as is an exposure to the business community. The power to think clearly, carefully, and independently is valuable to the student pursuing legal studies. Skill in research, in analysis of relevant data, in deductive and inductive reasoning, and in reasoning by analogy fosters the law student's power to think creatively. Coursework which demands development of the skill of creative thinking will prove helpful to every law student, regardless of the discipline in which such coursework is pursued. The cultivation of these skills and insights is not the province of any one discipline at the University. Choice of3 0 UNDE R GRA DU A TE P R OGRA MS 2 0 0 0 - 2 0 0 2major should be governed by the student's interests and abilities in light of the comments above suggesting the importance of a broad background. PRE-MEDICINE: Pre-health professional students may select any major in the sciences or humanities provided they include the courses required by the professional schools. The premedical adviser will counsel students planning to the health-professional schools is intense. Undergraduate and postbaccalaureate students are encouraged to seek advice of the appropriate pre-professional adviser throughout enrollment at the University regrading proper preparation for the professional schools. A suggested premedical curriculum for California medical schools is given below. For more information, consult a premedical adviser, study the book \"Medical School Admission Requirements\" published by the Association of American Medical Colleges, 2450 N Street, NW, Washington, DC 20037, and visit the website <http://www.aamc.org>.

BASIC SUBJECTS (SECTION A) provide you with the knowledge and abilities you will find useful in other GE courses, in major and elective courses, and in your pursuits after you graduate. These fundamental courses will teach you how to use the principles of expository writing, how to make public presentations of your own thoughts, how to distinguish correct from faulty reasoning, and how to study and appreciate mathematical ideas and quantitative reasoning. The NATURAL SCIENCES (SECTION B) coursework provides introductions to the biological and physical sciences, on the one hand, and the earth sciences, on the other. You will conduct immediate scientific inquiry in association with a lecture course in science. There is no better way to appreciate the scientific method than to engage in it.

REQUIRED PATTERN OF COURSES The required pattern of General Education consists of 52 units distributed among six areas, A, B, C, D, E, F. Section A: Basic Subjects...........................................12 units Section B: Natural Sciences........................................9 units Section C: Humanities................................................9 units Section D: Social Sciences...........................................9 units Section E: Applied Arts and Sciences......................4 units Section F: Comparative Cultural Studies................9 units Courses acceptable for the various sections in General Education follow. There are certain restrictions governing the applicability of listed courses dependent upon particular students' majors. Except in Section A, listed courses with the same departmental prefix as the student's major, (example: \"art,\" \"chemistry,\" \"history,\" etc.) will not apply to General Education requirements. Thus, an Economics major may not apply Economics 310 in Section D even though that course is listed in that section. On the other hand, a course required in the student's major may apply against General Education as long as it is not in the same department as the major. Thus, Economics 310 may apply in Section D if the student is pursuing an option within Business Administration, even though Economics 310 is a requirement in the Business Administration major. In Section A, listed courses may apply regardless of the student's major. Thus, a Mathematics major may apply Mathematics 150A in both General Education Subsection A.3 and the major. There are modifications to the pattern and the above-stated regulations for the following majors: BIOLOGY MAJORS: The entire GE Section B, Natural Sciences will be met by the completion of the required courses in the Biology major. BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION MAJORS: Courses with a departmental prefix of Business Law, Finance, and/or Marketing may not apply to General Education if the student is a Business Administration major. Business Administration majors may apply ECON 310 and/or 311 to upper division General Education in Section D. BLAW 280 may be used by Business Administration, Accountancy and Business Education majors to meet 3.0units in GE Section E, Applied Arts and Sciences. CHEMISTRY (ENVIRONMENTAL CHEMISTRY OPTION) MAJORS: HSCI 454, 456 or 459 may satisfy 3.0 units of the Section E, Applied Arts and Sciences GE requirement. However, none of these Health Sciences courses meets the Upper Division General Education requirement. CHICANO STUDIES MAJORS: Students with this major may apply listed Chicano Studies courses in General Education.

FACULTY APPROVAL: CLEARANCE FOR GRADUATION Application for Graduation, Graduation Evaluation and Diploma: Undergraduate students must file an Application for Graduation and Diploma with the Office of Admissions and Records before they can be considered for graduation. See information below on how to apply for your Bachelors degree. DEGREE PROGRAMS California State University, Northridge offers the following baccalaureate degree programs: Accountancy........................................................................B.S. .................................................................................B.A. Special Major.......................................................................B.A. Theatre Arts.........................................................................B.A. Urban Studies and Planning.............................................B.A. Women's Studies.................................................................B.A. Refer to specific departments in the Courses of Study section for detailed requirements of each program. HOW TO APPLY FOR YOUR BACHELOR'S DEGREE 1. GET A SIGNED DEPARTMENTAL GRAD CHECK FROM YOUR FACULTY ADVISOR. Make an appointment with your faculty advisor to obtain a signed departmental evaluation (or department grad check) of your major requirements. If you plan to graduate with a minor or a second major, you will also need signed evaluations from your advisors in those programs. This signed form constitutes formal approval of your program by the faculty. Make sure that you get a signed original and a copy of the departmental grad check. 2. TURN IN THE DEPARTMENTAL GRAD CHECK TO ADMISSIONS AND RECORDS. Bring your departmental evaluation to the Office of Admissions and Records along with your Application for Graduation and Diploma. You will be required to pay a filing fee. Deadline dates for filing are published each semester in the Schedule of Classes; note that there is a late fee if you do not file on time. PAYING THE LATE FEE DOES NOT INSURE RECEIVING YOUR GRAD CHECK PRIOR TO YOUR LAST SEMESTER. 3. LOOK FOR YOUR UNIVERSITY GRADUATION EVALUATION IN THE MAIL. You will receive a university graduation evaluation from your Graduation Evaluator showing what courses and other degree requirements you have not yet completed. If you turned in your departmental grad check and paid your fee by the published deadline, the university4 4 UNDE R GRA DU A TE P R OGRA MS 2 0 0 0 - 2 0 0 2graduation evaluation will reach you before the Touch Tone Registration date of your final semester. Call your departmental advisor or your Graduation Evaluator if you have any questions about your evaluation. The Graduation Evaluation reflects units applicable toward degree requirements only. Therefore, this figure may be lower than the cumulative units reflected on other CSU Northridge documents. 4. DECIDE WHETHER TO PARTICIPATE IN THE GRADUATION CEREMONY. You will be invited to the commencement ceremony for the academic year in which you graduate. If you decide to participate in the annual spring commencement ceremony, follow the instructions in the commencement handbook. Note that participation in the ceremony does not mean that you have officially graduated and qualified for your bachelor's degree. If, in your final semester, you don't complete a course or earn a grade as anticipated, you will still need to complete all course and credit requirements required for your degree. Additionally, you will need to change your graduation date at Admissions and Records for the semester or summer of actual completion. 5. GET YOUR DIPLOMA. Your diploma and your letter of congratulations will be mailed to you about three to six weeks after your official graduation date. Note that there are three official graduation dates each calendar year: the final day of the Fall semester; the final day of the Spring semester; and the final day of the last Summer session. These are the only dates on CSU Northridge diplomas. DOUBLE MAJOR A student may complete two majors within a single degree. When a student completes two majors within a single Bachelor of Arts or Bachelor of Science degree, both majors will be recorded on the diploma if the student so requests. Coursework taken to satisfy the requirements for one major may, where appropriate and with department approval, be used to satisfy the requirements of the second major. See Change of Major or Minor in the Enrollment Regulations section (Appendix A) for further information. MINOR Although a minor is not required for a baccalaureate degree, many students elect a minor to strengthen preparation in areas related to the major field or to career choices. Students may, in conjunction with a CSUN bachelor's degree program, elect to complete the requirements for one or more minors which have been approved and are listed in the catalog. A minor departmental evaluation must be presented to the Office of the Graduation Evaluators for each minor desired. Students changing their minors after their minor departmental evaluations have been submitted to the Office of Admissions and Records should be aware that they may be required to complete the minor requirements in effect at the time of change. The completion of a minor will be indicated on the transcript at the time of graduation or thereafter when requirements are met. Interested students should consult an advisor in the department offering the minor of their choice. Students wishing to pursue academic minors should become acquainted with the following guidelines: a) The minimum number of units required in a minor program is 18; the minimum number of upper divisionunits required in a minor program is 8. A minimum of 6 units of upper division work must be taken in residence at CSU Northridge. b) Departments may not offer a major and a minor to the same student, nor more than one minor to the same student unless the department has been granted the approval of the Educational Policies Committee. c) Restrictions against overlapping credit in the General Education program are not applicable to courses in the minor program. d) A minor departmental evaluation must be presented to the Office of Admissions and Records for each minor desired. e) Failure to complete a declared minor program will not delay a student from obtaining a bachelor's degree. f) The minor is recorded on the student's CSU Northridge transcript but is not indicated on the diploma. SECOND BACHELOR'S DEGREE A postbaccalaureate student who holds a recognized bachelor's degree from an accredited institution may pursue a program leading to a second bachelor's degree. The major may not be the same as the previously awarded degree. All students are urged to consult with a department advisor to determine whether a second bachelor's or a graduate program better meets their needs. A. CSU NORTHRIDGE GRADUATES SEEKING SECOND BACHELOR'S DEGREE CSU Northridge graduates must: 1. Complete a minimum of 24 upper-division units in residence at CSU Northridge since completion of the most recent degree, of which at least 12 units must be in the major. Completion of the major may require more than 12 units; 2. Complete the Upper Division Writing Proficiency requirement; 3. Complete all units required in the major.

File an undergraduate application for graduation and diploma. SPECIAL MAJOR The B. A. Special Major is designed to meet the academic needs of students whose educational goals do not fit within the framework of existing majors and cannot be met within the 124 unit minimum by combining existing majors. The following guidelines, established by the Educational Policies Committee will govern the B.A. Special Major. GUIDELINES FOR THE SPECIAL MAJOR PROGRAM: 1. The Special Major cannot be used simply to bypass normal graduation requirements, nor as an alternative to the completion of the degree requirements for a program in which the student is in academic difficulty. 2. Regular matriculated students who meet the following minimum academic requirements may apply for admission to the program: a.) all developmental work must be completed b.) the student must have and maintain a cumulative grade point average of 2.5 3. The Special Major must reflect a carefully structured interdisciplinary program, normally involving three disciplines in recognition of the fact that interdisciplinary educational goals involving only two disciplines can usually be met by combining a major and minor. 4. Minimum requirements for a Special Major will be a program of at least 24 upper division semester units recommended by the student's Special Major Advising Committee prior to the undertaking of the program. 5. One discipline, normally that with the largest number of units specified in the program, is to be designated as the principal area of concentration, and the department offering this discipline will serve as the student's primary advising base. 6. Neither lower division nor upper division courses applied to General Education, or to the requirements in American History and ideals, and state and local government, will be applicable toward minimum requirements of the Special Major. 7. The Special Major will consist of a minimum of 44 and a maximum of 66 semester units. 8. The Special Major is normally not available as a part of a \"double major,\" nor is it available to students pursuing a second bachelor's degree.PROCEDURES FOR APPLYING FOR B.A. SPECIAL MAJOR PROGRAM: 1. Students will formally request admission to a B.A. Special Major program from the Office of Undergraduate Studies, citing academic and professional reasons. Students deemed eligible for a Special Major will be assigned a faculty advisor to prepare an appropriate program of study. 2. A student who has completed 80 semester units will normally not be eligible for the Special Major. However, transfer students with more than 80 semester units, if previously enrolled in a B.A. Special Major program at another (CSU) campus, may, with approval by the Associate Vice President for Undergraduate Studies be admitted to CSU Northridge's B.A. Special Major program. 3. The Coordinator of the Special Major Program will appoint a Special Major Advising Committee made up of the chairs of those departments involved or their designees and schedule a meeting with the applicant and the Committee to determine the Special Major program of studies. Once approved by the chairs of the departments involved, the program becomes the official contract for the student's Special Major. Any substitutions or waivers must be agreed to by both the department involved and the program director. 4. Degree titles posted to transcripts must conform to existing titles for majors, minors and options approved by the faculty. 5. No request for a B.A. Special Major will be approved until student records have been received and evaluated by the Office of Undergraduate Studies. 6. Final approval for admission to the B.A. Special Major program must be obtained from the Associate Vice President for Undergraduate Studies. POLICIE S AND R EGULATIONS For a more detailed discussion of academic policies, consult the Appendixes on Admission, Enrollment, and Student Conduct in the back of this catalog ACADEMIC INTERNSHIP POLICY 1.Academic Internship shall be defined as undergraduate courses in which experience is the predominant teaching- learning mode. This faculty-approved experience shall be in organizations other than the academic departments offering the courses. These courses shall include significant involvement of students and hosts with faculty in planning, processing, and evaluating the learning resulting from these experiences Normally, Academic Internship courses shall be at the upper-division level. Upon justification by the department, however, exceptions may be granted by the Educational Policies Committee (EPC) to allow for lower- division Academic Internship. 2.Academic Internship shall not include Supervised Student Teaching. 3.Academic Internship credit shall not be granted after the fact or for prior life experience. 4.The University and the participating organizations shall adhere to equity and diversity guidelines. 5.Academic Internship shall include the following elements: a. Identified relationship to the academic discipline(s) offering the course. b. Screening or selection procedures for students seeking to enroll in these courses, which shall be designated as restrictive.4 6 UNDE R GRA DU A TE P R OGRA MS 2 0 0 0 - 2 0 0 2c. An orientation to experiential learning concepts. d. A written learning agreement accepted by students, faculty, and host describing the activities, learning processes, and evaluation methods used in the course. e. In addition to activities required by the instructor, a minimum of 120 work hours per semester is expected for a three unit course. Individual courses may require work hours beyond this minimum. f. A mid-semester evaluation of each student and the internship experience by the instructor. g. Facilitation of learning by the instructor throughout the experience, including both a written element: educational journal, reports, and/or portfolios; and a student contact element: seminars or group meetings. h. Academic credit shall be granted upon instructors' determination of students' learning. This process for final determination of academic credit shall be defined in the learning agreement and include contributions by student and host. 6.Departments may not offer Academic Internship under a 499 designation as Independent Study. 7 .All Academic Internship courses shall be given the same number, e.g., 394, 494, 594, in all departments that offer them. 8.Normally, students' performances in Academic Internship shall be evaluated on a Credit/No Credit basis. However, upon justification by the department and approval by EPC, a different basis of grading may be added (e.g., A\u2014F, CR/NC/U). 9.Normally, a student may count no more than 6 units of Academic Internship course credit toward a major. However, upon justification by the department, EPC may allow up to a total of 12 units. A student may count no more than 12 units of academic internship course credit toward a baccalaureate degree. 10.Staffing shall be at an S-factor appropriate to the level of involvement of the course instructor. (S-36 or S-48 must include seminars and regular student contact, while S-78 may focus the instructor's involvement through group meetings and written methods of communication.) STUDENT OUTCOMES ASSESSMENT POLICY Students may be included in outcomes assessment projects. Among the types of assessment methods that might be used are portfolios, capstone seminars, certification examinations, senior papers, or juried performances, productions, recitals and art shows, or research projects, or supervised field experiences. Departments may have, unique to their particular subject(s), other assessment projects of this kind. The project must have curricular value and must be meaningful in the context of the major. Preferably, the project will be adapted from or included in an existing program requirement or course. Students will have a high stake in the outcome of the project which can be, at the initiative of the department and, if necessary, at the approval of the Educational Policies Committee, a graduation requirement or part of a required course. The project will evaluate competence in the major and relevant basic skills. To the extent feasible, the project should be organized to give programs and the University visibility in the community and professional world. Therefore, departments and programs are encouraged to actively seek sources outside of the University, including alumni and employees, for involvement in all stages of assessment.ATTENDANCE IN CLASS A student who is absent from the first two class meetings loses the right to remain on the class roll, UNLESS the instructor is notified that the absence is temporary. The student who has lost the right to remain in the class must formally withdraw from the class, following University procedures and deadlines; otherwise the instructor will assign a grade of \"U\" which counts as a grade of \"F\" in computing grade point averages. If no instructor was assigned to the course in advance, the student must notify the chair of the department that his or her absence from the class will be temporary. ENROLLMENT POLICIES CLASS LEVELS Undergraduate students are classified according to the number of units completed, calculated as follows: STATUS UNITS COMPLETED Freshman.................................... 0-29 Sophomore ................................30-59 Junior..........................................60-89 Senior..........................................90 + MAXIMUM UNIT LOAD Undergraduate students may enroll in a maximum of 15 units during the TTR appointment period and no more than 19 units thereafter. Students wishing to exceed 19 units must take an Extra Unit Card (available in Admissions and Records) to the Chair of the department of their major (or his or her designee) during the Change of Program period, and obtain departmental approval of the overload. Undeclared majors should secure approval from the Advising Resource Center/EOP. If the department approves, the student may then add the additional units by returning the signed Extra Unit Card and following the usual add procedure. Failure to secure the required approval will result in administrative action to reduce the student's program to the approved level. FINAL EXAMINATION POLICY Student achievement shall be evaluated in all courses. Students shall be fully informed of the manner of their evaluation as well as the requirements and assignments at the start of each semester. In lecture courses, no final examination may be scheduled by an instructor prior to the regularly scheduled time. Any student who finds it impossible to take a final examination on the date scheduled must make arrangements in advance with the instructor either to take the examination at another time prior to the deadline for reporting grades, or request that a grade of incomplete be assigned, and must then follow the regulations concerning the removal of the incomplete. No exceptions will be made to these regulations without the written approval of the instructor, the department chair, and the dean of the college in which the course is offered. GRADING SYSTEMS AND POLICIES The University uses a combination of the following grading options: A - F LETTER GRADING: A, A-, B+, B, B-, C+, C, C-, D+, D, D-, F. Grades A, A-, B+, B, B-, C+, C, C-, D+, D, D- indicate passing grades; F indicates failure. Faculty define the grading criteria for all courses, including whether or not the plus/minus system will be used, and present this information in writing to all students enrolled, no later than the second week of classes. Any changes in2 0 0 0 - 2 0 0 2 UNDE R GRA DU A TE P R OGRA MS 4 7grading policies should be provided in writing to students before such changes are implemented. CREDIT/NO CREDIT GRADING: CR, indicating \"passed with credit,\" is given for work equivalent to C or better for undergraduate students and for work equivalent to B or better for postbaccalaureate and graduate students. NC, indicating \"no credit,\" is given for work equivalent to C-, D+, D , D-, or F for undergraduate students and for work equivalent to B-, C+, C, C-, D+, D, D-, or F for postbaccalaureate and graduate students. Restrictions concerning the nontraditional grading option given undergraduate students can be found under the Credit/No Credit Policy that follows. Postbaccalaureate and graduate students should refer to the Grading System discussion under the Graduate Programs section for further information regarding grading options. CREDIT/NO CREDIT POLICY Undergraduate students, not on probation, may elect the Credit/No Credit (CR/NC) option for one or more courses each term, up to a maximum of 18 units applicable to the bachelor's degree. The CR or NC grade will not be considered in computation of the student's grade point average. Students with a catalog year of 1986-87 or after CANNOT apply courses taken on a CR/NC basis toward the satisfaction of ANY of the following degree requirements: THE MAJOR , except those courses offered on a CR/NC basis only, subject to departmental approval. (Note: Additional courses in the discipline of the major beyond those used to satisfy major requirements may not be taken for Credit/No Credit.) THE MINOR , except those courses offered on a CR/NC basis only, subject to departmental approval. GENERAL EDUCATION TITLE 5 REQUIREMENTS PROFESSIONAL COURSES LEADING TO A TEACHING CREDENTIAL , except for student teaching. Students may decide to elect the Credit/No Credit option in courses during the first three weeks of the semester. There will be NO change in the basis of grading after the third week of classes. APPLICATIONS . A maximum of 18 units may be applied toward the bachelor's degree for Credit graded courses taken at CSUN. If 18 or more semester Credit graded units are accepted on transfer from other institutions, no additional Credit-graded CSUN courses may be used to satisfy degree requirements GRADING SYMBOLS:GRADE EFFECTIVE GRADE DEFINITION POINT DATE A Outstanding 4.0 1958 - A- 3.7 1987 - B+ 3.3 1987 - B Very Good 3.0 1958 - B- 2.7 1987 - C+ 2.3 1987 - C Average 2.0 1958 - C- 1.7 1987 - D+ 1.3 1987 - D Barely Passing 1.0 1958 - D- 0.7 1987 - F Failure 0.0 1958 - CR Credit 0.0 1967 - NC No Credit 0.0 1973 - U Unauthorized Incomplete 0.0 1977 -AU Audit 0.0 1958 - 1987 SP Satisfactory Progress 0.0 1973 - I Incomplete 0.0 1958 - W Withdrawal 0.0 1958 - WU Unauthorized Withdrawal 0.0 1958 - 1973 ADMINISTRATIVE GRADING SYMBOLS The following definitions apply to the grades assigned for various categories of enrollment. INCOMPLETE (I). The symbol \"I\" indicates that a portion of required coursework has not been completed and evaluated in the prescribed time period due to unforeseen, but fully justified reasons, that a substantial portion of the course requirement has been completed with a passing grade, and that there is still a possibility of earning credit. The work that is incomplete normally should be of such a nature that it can be completed independently by the student for later evaluation by the instructor. An incomplete shall not be assigned when a student would be required to attend a major portion of the class when it is next offered. It is the responsibility of the student to bring pertinent information to the attention of the instructor and to determine from the instructor the remaining course requirements which must be satisfied to remove the incomplete. A final grade is assigned when the work agreed upon has been completed and evaluated. Unless an approved \" Request for Extension of Time to Remove Incomplete\" form has been filed with Admissions and Records, an \"I\" must normally be made up within one calendar year immediately following the end of the term during which it was assigned. This limitation prevails whether or not the student maintains continuous enrollment. An incomplete will be counted as equivalent to an F (or an NC if applicable) for grade point average computation under the following conditions: If a student fails to complete the assigned work within one calendar year. If an undergraduate student re-enrolls in the course before making up the work during the calendar year. Students who believe they meet the necessary conditions to be assigned an incomplete should secure a Request for an Incomplete form from any academic department office, complete the prescribed information and contract with the instructor of the appropriate course for the assignment of an incomplete. This process should be completed in person prior to the submission of final grades by the instructor. Further information concerning the procedures to be followed to request or remove an incomplete is given on the Request for an Incomplete form. UNAUTHORIZED INCOMPLETE (U) . For purposes of grade point computation, the \"U\" grade is equivalent to an \"F.\" The symbol \"U\" indicates that an enrolled student did not officially withdraw from the course and failed to complete course requirements. It may also be assigned by the instructor when assignments or course activities or both were insufficient to evaluate academic performance using A, B, C, D, or F. SATISFACTORY PROGRESS (SP) . The symbol \"SP\" is used in connection with thesis, project, developmental and similar courses where assigned work frequently extends beyond a single academic term. It indicates that work is in progress and has been evaluated and found to be satisfactory to date, but that the assignment of a precise grade must await4 8 UNDE R GRA DU A TE P R OGRA MS 2 0 0 0 - 2 0 0 2completion of additional work. Enrollment for more units of credit than the total number of units which can be applied to the fulfillment of the student's educational objective is expressly prohibited. Work is to be completed within a stipulated time period. This may not exceed one year except for graduate degree theses for which the time may be up to two years, but may not exceed the overall time limit for completion of all master's degree requirements. Any extension of time limit for graduate courses must receive prior authorization by the Associate Vice President of Graduate Studies, Research and International Programs. WITHDRAWAL (W ). The symbol \"W\" indicates that the student was permitted to drop the course after the twentieth day of instruction with the approval of the instructor and appropriate campus officials. It carries no connotation of quality of student performance and is not used in the calculation of grade point average. (See Change of Program under Changes of Official Enrollment section for further information.) CREDIT (CR) is assigned for work equivalent to A, A-, B+, B, B-, C+, C for undergraduate students; and to A, A-, B+, B for postbaccalaureate and graduate students. CR grades are not included in the calculation of grade point average. NO CREDIT (NC) is assigned for work equivalent to C-, D+, D, D-, or F for undergraduate students; and to B-, C+, C, C-, D+, D, D-, or F for postbaccalaureate and graduate students. NC grades are not included in the calculation of grade point average. The grades of CR/NC are assigned as stated above regardless of the level of the class. HONORS PROGRAMS DEAN'S LIST Students who carry a minimum of twelve graded semester units (CR/NC courses do not apply), and who achieve a grade point average of 3.5 or better, are awarded Dean's List standing for that semester. Students whose minimum unit load includes Extension courses may apply for Dean's List standing if the Extension courses are required for the student's major, and if the Extension courses are taught by members of the CSUN faculty. If a grade change brings a student's grade point average up to 3.5, the student may apply at Admissions and Records to have the honor awarded retroactively. Students working on second undergraduate degrees or graduate degrees are not eligible for Dean's List awards. HONORS AT GRADUATION To receive honors at graduation, a student must: (1)Complete a minimum of 45 units of work in letter- graded courses in this University; (2)Earn a grade point average of 3.50 or above in all work taken in this University; (3)Earn the following grade point average in all undergraduate courses, including transfer work: Summa Cum Laude GPA of 3.90 or above. Magna Cum Laude GPA of 3.75 to 3.89. Cum Laude GPA of 3.50 to 3.74. Honors programs are offered in the Departments of Biology, Business, Economics, English, and Physics, in the College of Business Administration and Economics, with separate programs in Business and Economics, and in General Education. Specific information is available in departmental offices.UNIVERSITY HONORS PROGRAM IN GENERAL EDUCATION SH 441 Phone: (818) 677-6558 Fax: (818) 677-5935 web page: http://www.csun.edu/~honors/ The Honors Program in General Education offers high-achieving CSU Northridge students a diverse, enriched academic experience in General Education that promotes the fullest development of academic potential. SPECIAL SECTIONS OF GENERAL EDUCATION COURSES Honors students enroll in small, restricted sections of courses required for General Education. These courses are taught by outstanding CSU Northridge professors who modify course content and methodology as appropriate for Honors students. EXTRACURRICULAR ACADEMIC ACTIVITIES Students, faculty and mentors share in the excitement and pleasure of being a part of a community of dedicated learners in a series of special events each semester which may include films, plays, book discussions, guest speakers, and field trips. CERTIFICATE Students who complete 15 units of Honors courses and who meet the requirements of the program will be awarded a General Education Honors Certificate. Recognition of participation will be made both on the student's transcript and at the annual university Honors Convocation. REVIEW DAY POLICY Except for classes meeting once a week, the days following the last day of formal instruction and before the beginning of examinations shall be considered review days. No new material shall be introduced, and no quizzes or examinations of any kind shall be administered on these days. Review sessions may be conducted on review days at the regularly scheduled class time with the mutual agreement of the instructor and class. However, if classes do not meet for such reviews, faculty shall be available in their classrooms or offices during the regularly scheduled class and office hours. SCHOLASTIC STATUS Any student who is eligible to enroll in the University is considered to be in good standing. This means that undergraduate students who have maintained satisfactory scholarship with at least a 2.0 CSUN and cumulative Grade Point Average, as well as those who are on probation, are in good standing. Grade Point Average (GPA), used as a measurement of satisfactory scholarship, is calculated by dividing the number of grade points by the number of units attempted for the grades A, A-, B+, B, B-, C+, C, C-, D+, D, D-, F. (CR and NC are not used in this calculation.) Students who are disqualified or under disciplinary suspension are not routinely eligible to enroll and are therefore not considered in good standing. See the Graduate Programs section for definition of Graduate Good Standing. ACADEMIC PROBATION AND DISQUALIFICATION SCHOLASTIC PROBATION: An undergraduate student will be placed on probation if his or her cumulative or CSUN grade point average is below a 2.0. A student will be continued on probation until both the overall and the CSUN grade point average are 2.0 or better, or until he or she is disqualified under one of the provisions of the disqualification regulations. Graduate students should consult the Graduate Programs2 0 0 0 - 2 0 0 2 UNDE R GRA DU A TE P R OGRA MS 4 9section for information concerning Graduate probation provisions. ADMINISTRATIVE ACADEMIC PROBATION: A student may be placed on Administrative Academic probation for withdrawal from a substantial portion of a program in two successive terms, for repeated failure to progress toward a degree, or for failure to comply with an academic requirement or regulation which is routine for all students or for a defined group of students. DISQUALIFICATION: Undergraduate students on probation will be disqualified when: a)they are admitted or readmitted on probation and fail to meet the conditions established at the time of their admission or readmission, or b)they have a cumulative deficiency on either their overall or CSU Northridge record equal to or greater than the floor levels indicated below: Freshman, Sophomore 15 grade points (0-59 units completed) below a 2.00 Juniors 9 grade points (60-89 units completed) below a 2.00 Seniors 6 grade points (90 or more units completed) below a 2.00 Graduate students should consult the Graduate Programs section for information concerning Graduate disqualification provisions. Undergraduate students and second baccalaureate degree candidates are restricted to a maximum of two reinstatement from disqualification. If a student receives a third disqualification he/she may no longer matriculate at CSU Northridge. After a third disqualification, courses may be taken through the CSU Northridge Open University (Extension) but these courses cannot be used to offset grade point deficiencies or meet degree requirements. Because of the structure of the academic year, undergraduate students and second baccalaureate degree candidates who meet the requirements for disqualification at the conclusion of a Fall semester will be placed on \"special probation\" for the Spring semester. Students on special probation will be entitled to take classes as matriculated students for the Spring semester after they establish an Academic Performance Agreement with the Academic Standards Board. The Academic Performance Agreement may extend beyond the Spring semester, but at the conclusion of the agreement, students must be at or above their floor level. Either of the following two situations will turn a special probation to a disqualification for the Spring semester: a.failure to register for the Spring semester; b.failure to establish an Academic Performance Agreement with the Academic Standards Board. Students on special probation who fail to reduce their grade point deficiency to the level specified by their Academic Performance Agreement during the Spring semester will be disqualified at the end of the semester. Undergraduate students and second baccalaureate degree candidates disqualified at the conclusion of a Spring semester will not be entitled to enroll in classes as matriculated students for the Fall semester. Without exception, the following requirement applies to ALL disqualified undergraduate students regardless of circumstances or proximity to degree: undergraduate students interested in returning to the University for asubsequent semester must submit a formal application for readmission and must submit all forms for consideration of reinstatement and transcripts of any college work completed in the interim. Consult the Schedule of Classes for information concerning deadline dates to submit the required readmission materials. For procedures governing reinstatement see \"Readmitted Students\" in the Admission section (Appendix A) of the Catalog. IMPROVING YOUR GRADE POINT AVERAGE ACADEMIC RENEWAL: The Trustees of The California State University have established a program of Academic Renewal whereby students who are having difficulty meeting graduation requirements due to a grade point deficiency may petition to have up to two semesters or three quarters of previous college work discounted from all considerations associated with meeting requirements for the baccalaureate degree. Academic Renewal is intended only to facilitate graduation from CSUN and is not applicable for individuals who already possess a baccalaureate degree or who meet graduation requirements without the approval of a petition for Academic Renewal. CONDITIONS : In order to qualify for Academic Renewal all of the following conditions established by the Trustees must be met: 1.The student must present evidence in the petition that the coursework to be disregarded was substandard and not representative of the student's present scholastic ability and level of performance, due to extenuating circumstances. 2.The student must present evidence that if the petition is denied, it would be necessary for the student to enroll in additional coursework involving one or more additional terms in order to qualify for graduation. The student should include the specific coursework or requirements involved. Normally, students should have completed 90 units prior to filing the petition. 3.Five years must have elapsed since the term or terms to be disregarded were completed. Terms taken at any institution may be disregarded. 4.Since completion of the term(s) to be disregarded, the student must have completed coursework at CSU Northridge of at least one of the following: a.15 semester units with at least a 3.00 GPA. b.30 semester units with at least a 2.50 GPA. c.45 semester units with at least a 2.00 GPA. If and when the petition is granted, the student's permanent academic record will be annotated so that it is readily evident to all users of the record that no work taken during the disregarded term(s), even if satisfactory, will apply toward baccalaureate graduation requirements. However, all work will remain legible on the record to insure a true and complete academic history. A final decision on the petition will be made by the Academic Renewal Review Committee. The committee will review petitions only if all of the basic requirements (indicated above) have been met. Normally, students will be notified of the decision within 60 days after the completed petition is submitted. PROCEDURES: Students must take the following steps to petition for Academic Renewal: (1) Obtain a departmental evaluation and request an Application for Graduation and Diploma, available at the Student Information Center. These will lead to a precise evaluation of their status regarding fulfillment of graduation requirements. (2) Obtain an5 0 UNDE R GRA DU A TE P R OGRA MS 2 0 0 0 - 2 0 0 22 0 0 0 - 2 0 0 2 UNDE R GRA DU A TE P R OGRA MS 5 1 Undergraduate Petition form, available at the Student Information Center. (3) Complete the petition, indicating the specific terms which they are requesting be discounted. In the \"reason\" section of the petition students must make a specific statement concerning each of the four conditions listed above. REPEATING COURSES: The University recognizes that undergraduate students may need to repeat one or more courses in order to fulfill degree requirements and/or enhance previously acquired skills. Students should seek academic advisement before deciding to repeat any course. A maximum of 15 semester units of CSU Northridge coursework may be repeated for the purpose of excluding grades. When a course is repeated for the purpose of excluding a grade, the subsequent enrollment must be on the same basis of grading as the first. Only one repeat per course is permitted for the purpose of improving the grade. The higher of the two grades is counted in the student's grade point average. The lower grade is \"forgiven\" from GPA computation, but both grades appear on the student's permanent record (transcript). Students may not improve grades of courses taken at other institutions by repeating them at CSU Northridge, nor may students improve grades of courses taken at CSU Northridge by repeating them elsewhere. EXCESSIVE ENROLLMENT: If a student enrolls in a course beyond catalog limitations, units earned will not be counted toward the baccalaureate degree. The units attempted and any grade points, however, will be averaged with the student's other grades. For information on the Graduate repeat policy, see the Graduate Programs section of the catalog.G RA DU AT E PR OGRA MSGRADUATE PRO GRAMS GRADUATE STUDIES, RESEARCH AND INTERNATIONAL PROGRAMS Administration Park 706; Phone: (818) 677-2138 Students with a baccalaureate degree who wish to continue their education for personal enrichment or to meet professional needs may do so at CSU Northridge either as a graduate student or as a postbaccalaureate student. For administrative purposes, a graduate student is one who has requested and received formal admission to a specific course of study that will lead to a master's degree in one of the many disciplines available at CSUN. A postbaccalaureate student is one who has not declared a master's degree as an objective but who is nevertheless attending class and participating in academic work at the University. Graduate status is subdivided into Classified and Conditionally Classified standing, depending on whether or not certain University and departmental requirements have been met. These requirements are discussed later in this section of the catalog. Graduate students in either category usually may enroll in 500- and 600-level courses, although in some programs enrollment is limited to the Classified student. Graduate students normally must follow a specific course of instruction identified to them by the department Graduate Coordinator and described for the individual department in the Courses of Study section of this catalog. Postbaccalaureate status is subdivided between Postbaccalaureate Classified and Postbaccalaureate Unclassified. A Postbaccalaureate Classified student is one who has been admitted to a credential program in the School of Education. Students interested in earning a credential should refer to the section of the catalog entitled Credential Programs. A Postbaccalaureate Unclassified student usually attends for professional and/or for personal enrichment only. Such students require permission of the instructor and the department to enroll in courses in the 500/600 series. Schools and departments with a large enrollment of graduate students sometimes restrict admission to undergraduate courses as well.

The entire semester or quarter in which the 60/90 units began will be used in this calculation. Lower division courses or courses taken in extension (except in concurrent enrollment at CSUN in the upper division), after obtaining the bachelor's degree, will be EXCLUDED from the calculation. Students wishing to enroll in the University must follow the instructions supplied by the Office of Admissions and Records in the Admissions section of this catalog. Once applications are received, they will be evaluated at appropriate offices, and students will be advised whether or not they have been accepted into the University. ADMISSION TO THE DEPARTMENT The applications of students meeting University requirements for admission and desiring admission to a master's program will be reviewed in the appropriate department. The department will determine whether or not the student meets requirements for admission to its program. SOME DEPARTMENTS MAY REQUIRE A SEPARATE DEPARTMENTAL APPLICATION. Those students who meet departmental and University requirements will be admitted as either Conditionally Classified or Classified graduate students. CONDITIONALLY CLASSIFIED STATUS Students who do not meet all requirements may, nevertheless, be accepted as CONDITIONALLY CLASSIFIED students, subject to meeting various University and departmental requirements for Classified status. It is important to achieve full Classified standing prior to completing more than 12 units of graduate coursework appearing in the formal program. (NO MORE THAN 12 UNITS OF WORK TAKEN PRIOR TO ATTAINING FULLY CLASSIFIED STATUS WILL BE APPLIED TO A MASTER'S PROGRAM.) CLASSIFIED STATUS To be granted Classified Status, students must have a 3.0 grade point average for all work taken as a Conditionally Classified student and in any courses required by the department for admission to its program. Once the requirements for Classified status have been met, it is the responsibility of the student to notify the department and of the department to notify Graduate Evaluation Services, Graduate Studies, Research and International Programs by filing the \"Request for Classification\" form (OGS 2). To meet the minimum requirements for CLASSIFIED STATUS , the student must fulfill two or more of the following (individual departments may have more stringent standards): 1.A 3.0 grade point average or higher in all work undertaken since admission to the program. 2.Hold a graduate degree from an accredited institution. 3.Score at or above the 50th percentile on one of the three portions of the aptitude test of the Graduate RecordExamination, i.e., verbal, quantitative, or analytic.* (Some Departments may waive the GRE requirement if student's undergraduate CUMULATIVE grade point average is 3.0 or higher.) 4.Score at or above the 50th percentile on some other nationally normed University-approved examination. 5.Attain a satisfactory performance on a departmental admissions assessment approved by the University. In addition to the above, each student must pass the Upper Division Writing Proficiency Exam (UDWPE). Students having met the Upper Division Writing Proficiency Exam (UDWPE) at another CSU campus may submit in writing official notification of a passing score for approval. *Normally, the Graduate Record Examination should be taken prior to registration for graduate work at this institution. Undergraduates should take the examination in their last semester of their senior year. Application blanks for the Graduate Record Examination may be obtained from the Office of Graduate Studies or from Educational Testing Service (ETS), Box 955, Princeton, New Jersey 08540. The completed application must be submitted to the Educational Testing Service at least four weeks prior to the test date. Applications for the Graduate Management Admission Test, required of Business degree majors, are also available in the Office of Graduate Studies or from ETS. INTERDISCIPLINARY STUDIES A student may elect in very unusual circumstances to pursue an MA or MS in an Interdisciplinary Studies Major. This program is developed jointly by the student, faculty from at least two disciplines, and the Associate Vice President for Graduate Studies, Research and International Programs. Admission requirements for the Interdisciplinary Studies Major include being in good academic standing and having at least a 3.0 grade point average in all 400- 500-, and 600-level courses attempted. In addition, the requirements for classified status of the participating departments must be satisfied. More specific information and procedures for developing an Interdisciplinary Studies Major program may be obtained from Graduate Studies, Research and International Programs. EARNING A SECOND MASTER'S DEGREE It is permissible to seek a second master's degree in a field unrelated to the academic discipline of the first master's, but courses taken to meet the requirements for the first master's degree are NOT applicable to the second one. ADVANCEMENT TO CANDIDACY PREREQUISITES Advancement to Candidacy is the next step after achieving Classified Status and signifies approval of a plan of study by the student's major department, the Associate Vice President of Graduate Studies and the Graduate Evaluation Services Office. Prerequisites to Advancement to Candidacy are: 1.Classified status. 2.Approval by the department of a plan for a Thesis, Graduate Project or Artistic Performance, or approval to proceed to a Comprehensive Examination. 3.A 3.0 grade point average or higher in all work undertaken since admission to the program. THE PROGRAM Students are required to prepare a formal program in cooperation with the departmental Graduate Coordinator. The formal program is a statement of the academic requirements students must meet for the master's degree5 6 GRA DU A TE P R OGRA MS 2 0 0 0 - 2 0 0 2and requires approval by the department and the Associate Vice President for Graduate Studies, Research and International Programs. Successful completion of all requirements on the program is prerequisite to receiving the degree. The program is prepared on a form available in the department and should be filed with the Graduate Evaluators in Graduate Evaluation Services, Graduate Studies, Research and International Programs at least a semester prior to which the students expect to receive the degree. Students may modify the program after it has been filed, provided that they have agreement with the Department Graduate Coordinator by submitting a COURSE SUBSTITUTION FORM (OGS 18) to the Graduate Evaluation Services. Modifications are subject to approval by the Associate Vice President for Graduate Studies, Research and International Programs. Modifications must be approved before the final date for change of program in the semester in which students expect to receive the degree. The following University requirements apply to the program: 1.It must be composed of a minimum of 30 units of 400-, 500-, and 600-level work. 2.None of the courses on the program may have been used for any other degree earned in the past. 3.Not less than half and a minimum of 18 of the units in the program must be at the 500/600-level (except for the cooperative degree in Geology where 15 units of 500- level courses are acceptable). 4. No more than 9 units in combination of transfer work, extension work or work completed prior to earning a baccalaureate degree from this University. NOTE: IN FALL 1998 THE MINIMUM NUMBER OF 500/600 LEVEL UNITS APPEARING ON A GRADUATE PROGRAM WILL INCREASE FROM 18 TO 21 UNITS. 4.No more than 9 units of transfer work or extension work may appear in the program. 5.No more than 6 units of independent study may be included in the program, and all independent study arrangements must have prior approval of the instructor of the class and of the department chair. 6.The program must terminate with a culminating experience which will consist of a Thesis, Graduate Project, Artistic Performance or Comprehensive Examination. 7.A 3.0 or higher grade point average is required for all coursework which appears on the program. TRANSFER WORK Credit for work performed in extension or at another accredited institution is subject to the following limitations (as well as Item 4 above): 1.Transfer of work is subject to the approval of the Graduate Advisor of the major department and the Associate Vice President for Graduate Studies, Research and International Programs. An official transcript must be submitted to the graduate evaluator in the Office of Graduate Studies for approval of the specific coursework. 2.Only grade B or better work may be transferred. 3.Work unacceptable for graduate credit in the school where it was taken is not acceptable for graduate credit at CSUN.4.Transfer courses may not have been taken more than 7 years prior to the time of graduation. Some departments may, at their discretion, shorten this time interval. EXTENSION AND CONCURRENT ENROLLMENT COURSES Courses taken prior to admission to a Master's degree program through CSUN's Extension or Concurrent Enrollment programs are subject to the limitations that apply to graduate work taken at other institutions (see Transfer Work section above). Courses taken through Extension or Concurrent Enrollment following admission to a Master's degree program are subject to departmental approval for use on the formal Master's program. CREDIT FOR WORK COMPLETED PRIOR TO EARNING THE BACCALAUREATE DEGREE A maximum of 9 units of credit earned during a student's final undergraduate semester at CSUN may be applied toward a Master's degree subject to departmental approval. Requests for such credit are filed following admission to a CSUN Master's program on a Graduate Petition Form (OGS 1) in Graduate Evaluation Services, Graduate Studies, Research and International Programs. Courses are subject to the following University requirements: 1. They are not used to satisfy the requirements for the bachelor's degree. 2. Only coursework of \"B\" or better will be considered for petitioning. 3. Courses petitioned may not have been taken more than 7 years prior to the time of graduation with the Master's degree. 4. A petition is approved by the Associate Vice President for Graduate Studies, Research and International Programs. 5. In every case, acceptance of a course on a student's formal Master's Program is at the discretion of the Graduate Coordinator and the Vice President of Graduate Studies. FOREIGN LANGUAGE READING EXAMINATION When competency in a foreign language is a departmental requirement, students may demonstrate competency in one of three ways: 1.By passing the Graduate Foreign Language Examination (Princeton Examination). 2.By passing a departmental examination. The examination is given by the Department of Foreign Languages in the fifth week of each semester. Candidates who plan to take this examination should notify the Department of Foreign Languages and Literatures early in the semester, and enroll in one unit of 399 in the appropriate language. 3.By successfully completing a Graduate Reading course, in the appropriate language. This course may be taken without prerequisite if the student has completed two semesters of the language. THE CULMINATING EXPERIENCE Some type of culminating experience is required of every candidate for the master's degree. The culminating experience must be a Thesis, a Graduate Project, an Artistic Performance, or a Comprehensive Examination. The specific type of culminating experience is to be identified on the student's program. In certain instances and with departmental approval, where all regular coursework appearing on the Formal Master's Program is complete, including enrollment in a culminating experience, a student may meet enrollment requirements2 0 0 0 - 2 0 0 2 GRA DU A TE P R OGRA MS 5 7through a SPECIAL MASTER'S REGISTRATION (OGS 5) fee payment. Permission for such enrollment must be obtained from the Graduate Coordinator and must be approved by the Associate Vice President for Graduate Studies, Research and International Programs. Inasmuch as special conditions apply to this form of registration, students are urged to make advance contact with their Graduate Coordinator and/or the Graduate Evaluators in Graduate Evaluation Services, Graduate Studies, Research and International Programs, during the last semester of regular enrollment. Special Master's registration is subject to the \"two-year time limit for completion of thesis/project.\" THE COMPREHENSIVE EXAMINATION Each department that offers a Comprehensive Examination option is required to maintain University-approved guidelines for the administration of the examination. These guidelines are to be available on request to students who plan to take the examination. The following regulations apply to all departments, however: 1.Students become eligible to attempt the examination during the semester in which all other coursework on their Formal Program and other requirements for the degree have been completed. Note, however, that language and statistics requirements must be met prior to taking the examination. In addition, a GRADUATE EVALUATION (OGS 14) must be on file in Graduate Evaluation Services of the Graduate Studies Office. 2.Ordinarily, the examination is given about one month before the end of the semester. Arrangements to enroll and take the examination should be made with the department and Graduate Coordinator. 3.If the examination is not completed in the final semester, students MUST REGISTER AGAIN IN THE SEMESTER IN WHICH THEY PLAN TO COMPLETE THEIR DEGREE. These additional units may not be counted as units toward the master's degree. 4.Students may not take an entire comprehensive examination more than twice. a.Students who fail the examination at the first attempt may be required to take some prescribed courses. If no such work is prescribed, students ARE REQUIRED TO REGISTER FOR THE SEMESTER OR SUMMER SESSION IN WHICH THE SECOND ATTEMPT IS OFFERED. b.Failure of the second attempt at the comprehensive examination disqualifies one from the master's program in that department. c.For purposes of this regulation, t he first attempt is defined as consisting of the complete comprehensive examination as prescribed by the department. The second attempt is defined as consisting of not more than a second examination on the entire program, or, at the discretion of the department, one supplementary examination on any part or parts of the first examination on which the student failed. d .Departments shall file with the Graduate Evaluators in Graduation Evaluation Services, Graduate Studies, Research an International programs office, the result of each examination. e.Once students have enrolled in, and/or attempted the comprehensive examination, and failed it or any part of it, they may not change to the Thesis, Graduate Project, or Artistic Performance option. THESIS, GRADUATE PROJECT, AND ARTISTIC PERFORMANCE The Thesis, Graduate Project, and Artistic Performance options are subject to the following provisions:1.At the time that a thesis committee is formed and a topic selected, students are required to obtain signatures on the Thesis/Graduate Project Planning Form (OGS 9) of those faculty members agreeing to be on the student's committee and to submit this form to the Graduate Evaluators in Graduate Evaluation Services, Graduate Studies, Research and International Programs. 2.Students may not register in more units of 598/698 than appear on the formal master's program. 3.Students must be registered in the semester in which they expect to submit completed work, and in the case of students who plan to complete the thesis, graduate project, or artistic performance in the summer, they must be registered in at least one unit in either summer session. 4.Students may not enroll in more than three units of Thesis, Graduate Project, or Artistic Performance in their first semester of such enrollment. If at the end of that semester the advisory committee agrees that the chosen subject was unsatisfactory for a valid thesis, graduate project, or artistic performance but that the effort was at least at a \"B'' level, the student will be given a grade of CR. Only under these conditions may the student then elect the Comprehensive Exam. The change to Comprehensive Exam requires a Course Substitution Form (OGS 18) to the student's program along with a Graduate Petition Form (OGS 1) indicating justification for the change signed by the Graduate Coordinator in the student's department and submitted to the Graduate Evaluators, for approval of the Vice President of Graduate Studies, Research and International Program. This justification should reflect the fact that the thesis subject was approved at the time the formal master's program was signed. 5.Should students fail in the entire thesis, graduate project, or artistic performance, or in any part of it, they will be disqualified from the master's program in the department and not be allowed the comprehensive examination option. 6.The thesis, graduate project, and abstract of an artistic performance should be prepared according to Guidelines for the Preparation of Theses and Graduate Projects available in the Graduate Studies, Research and International Programs. A student planning to do a thesis as part of the program should become familiar with the contents of this document in the early stages of the thesis work. 7.The theses/projects/abstracts must be completed within two years from first enrollment in 598/698. In some situations, a student is given an \"SP'' (Satisfactory Progress) grade for work in progress. Students are referred to regulations concerning SP grades in the earlier section of this catalog under \"Definitions of Administrative Grading Symbols.'' APPLICATION FOR THE MASTER'S DEGREE AND DIPLOMA Students must apply for graduation during the semester immediately preceding the semester in which they wish to have the degree conferred. Application is required of all candidates for the degree. Students may obtain an Application for Master's Degree and Diploma (AR9090) for graduation from the Office of Admissions and Records or Graduate Studies, Research and International Programs and in the event that a student changes their completion date to a later time, a Master's Graduation and Diploma Date Change Form (OGS 6) and a processing fee will be assessed.5 8 GRA DU A TE P R OGRA MS 2 0 0 0 - 2 0 0 2TIME LIMIT FOR COMPLETION Students must complete requirements for the degree within seven calendar years from the date they were admitted to a program, unless a lesser time is specified by the department or program committee. Courses that were completed more than seven years prior to the date on which all requirements for the degree are completed cannot be counted to meet unit requirements unless the student can show current knowledge in the content of the outdated courses by written examination for each course in question. A maximum of nine units taken in residency at CSUN may be validated in this manner. The Departmental Graduate Coordinator must certify this competency by way of a memorandum to the Associate Vice President for Graduate Studies, Research and International Programs. Outdated courses taken at another institution MAY NOT be validated. In addition, conversion of the assigned \"SP\" for a thesis/project or abstract, signifying completion of culminating experience must be finalized within two years of the first enrollment in 598/698. CHANGE OF OBJECTIVE Continuing students in either Postbaccalaureate or Graduate status may change their objective and seek admission to a new degree program by filling out a change of objective form that can be obtained from the Office of Admissions and Records. Transfer of previously earned units to the new program must have the approval of the department to which the student applies. A request for a change of objective for a student on academic probation is also subject to the approval of the Associate Vice President for Graduate Studies, Research and International Programs. ACADEMIC PERFORMANCE AND STUDY LOAD Numerous requirements exist that specify the grading policies at CSUN and the academic standards and progress expected of students. These regulations are dictated by Title V of the California Administrative Code, the California State Universities and College System, and the President of California State University, Northridge. GRADING SYSTEM In general, Postbaccalaureate and Graduate students use the traditional A to F grading system and a non-traditional system of Credit, No Credit (CR/NC) as explained in the Regulations section of this catalog, except that: 1.Normal Grading. Credit (CR) is given for A, A-, B+, or B level scholastic performance and No Credit (NC) is given for the equivalent of B-, C+, C, C-, D+, D, D- or F work. Most graduate program courses may not be taken on a Credit/No Credit basis. Exceptions to this rule are Thesis/Graduate Project (598/698) or Comprehensive Examination (597/697) and certain courses in which the evaluation responsibility is shared by agencies in conjunction with faculty (e.g., field study, internship). The student is advised to request Credit/No Credit grading for courses taken for personal interest or enrichment which are unrelated to the degree objective outside the department or discipline of the major. 2.Incompletes. An incomplete (I) must be changed to a grade within one calendar year immediately following the end of the semester in which it was assigned. This limitation exists whether or not students maintain continuous enrollment in the University. If the assigned work that is required to remove theincomplete is not completed by this time, the incomplete will be computed as an F in all subsequent grade point average determinations. 3.Satisfactory Progress. The grade of Satisfactory Progress (SP) is assigned for Thesis/Graduate Project and similar courses where assigned work frequently remains to be completed at the end of the semester in which the grade is given. The SP grade must be converted to a traditional letter grade within two years. Any extension of the time limit must receive prior authorization by submitting a Graduate Petition Form (OGS 1) to the Associate Vice President of Graduate Studies, Research and International Programs for approval. PROBATION AND DISQUALIFICATION Students enrolled in a degree program will be placed on academic probation whenever their grade point average (GPA) falls below 3.0 in all units attempted since admission to the program. To be removed from probation, students must earn sufficient grade points in the following semester of enrollment to raise their GPA to 3.0 or above. Failure to do so will result in disqualification. (Please refer to Grading in the Regulations section of this catalog to determine grade points assigned per unit value of coursework.) If a disqualified graduate student wishes to be considered for readmission to a Master's program, disqualification forms must be submitted for the semester immediately following disqualification notification. Disqualification materials are mailed to students after final grades are posted. The materials are submitted through the departmental Graduate Coordinator to the Associate Vice President of Graduate Studies, Research and International Programs. Students who choose not to file readmission forms for the semester following disqualification will be required to submit both the disqualification materials and a new University application and fee in order to enroll in any future semester. Similar provisions to those stated above apply to Postbaccalaureate, Unclassified and Postbaccalaureate, Credential students, except that the required maintenance GPA's are 2.50 and 2.75 respectively. REPEAT OF COURSES With prior permission of the Graduate Coordinator and/or Department Chair and Associate Vice President of Graduate Studies, Research and International Programs, a graduate student may repeat, for the purpose of improving the grade, up to 6 units of credit in which a grade of \"B-\" or below, or a grade of \"U,\" was achieved. In these cases only the most recent grade will count. Students must submit a C o u r s e Repeat Form (OGS 25) for approval by the third week of the semester in which the course is being repeated and show proof of enrollment at that time. MAXIMUM UNIT LOAD Fifteen units is considered to be a maximum course load in any one semester, but in exceptional cases a graduate student may take more units with the approval of the major department. Postbaccalaureate Unclassified students must obtain approval from the Associate Vice President for Graduate Studies, Research and International Programs. ACADEMIC LEAVE Graduate students in good standing may take a two-semester leave of absence. Though no formal approval is required, it is suggested that students contact their major department and the Graduate Studies, Research International Programs Office for advisement.2 0 0 0 - 2 0 0 2 GRA DU A TE P R OGRA MS 5 9GRADUATION WITH DISTINCTION A student may receive the master's degree with distinction by maintaining a 3.885 or higher grade point average on all Formal Master's Degree program course work ,and satisfying any additional criteria established by the graduate committee of the department or program offering the degree. The notation \"with distinction,'' is posted with the degree on the transcript and will also appear on the diploma.6 0 GRA DU A TE P R OGRA MS 2 0 0 0 - 2 0 0 2C R E D E N T I A L PR OG RA M SGENER AL INFOR MATI ON Credential Email: credprep@csun.edu Website: http://www.csun.edu/~sch_educ/cred/cred.html Public school teaching and service credentials in the state of California are regulated by legislative actions which are subsequently interpreted by appropriate regulatory agencies. With the guidance provided by the California Commission on Teacher Credentialing (CCTC) , the University has developed programs for candidates seeking credentials to serve in a variety of positions in public schools of the State of California. All candidates seeking a credential must meet the credential requirements of the Teacher Licensing Act of 1970 as amended. California State University, Northridge is committed to the concept that continuous screening and evaluation are necessary to ensure that candidates who complete a credential program are well prepared to be effective members of the teaching profession. Thus candidates may expect to be evaluated on possession of basic skills, personal qualifications, and performance factors in addition to completion of required courses. In evaluating these factors the College of Education may determine that a particular candidate does not possess these factors in sufficient quality to permit the candidate to continue in the program. Unsuccessful student teaching assignments will certainly cause the College to question the ability of a candidate. There exists in the College a Selection and Admission Committee and a procedure by which a review of the candidate's qualifications can be initiated and a decision made concerning involuntary withdrawal of the candidate. All rights of candidates are protected including the right to examine all documentation presented in support of withdrawal and to confront witnesses supporting the withdrawal. The decision of this committee is final within the College. (Details are available in the Credential Preparation Office.)CANDIDATES FOR ALL CREDENTIALS MUST MEET LEGAL REQUIREMENTS IN EFFECT AT THE TIME OF APPLICATION FOR THE CREDENTIAL REGARDLESS OF WHEN THE PROGRAM WAS STARTED. COURSE TIME LIMITS Coursework over ten years old will be considered expired unless a lesser time is specified by the academic department. Professional education courses completed more than ten years prior to the date of application for a credential cannot be counted to meet credential requirements. CREDENTIALS AVAILABLE AT CSUN Three basic teaching credentials are available: the Multiple Subject, the Single Subject, and the Preliminary Special Education credential. The Multiple Subject credential authorizes the holder to teach K-12 in any self-contained classroom, such as those commonly found in elementary schools in California. The Single Subject credential authorizes the holder to teach K-12 in a departmentalized classroom, such as those commonly found in a secondary school in California. The Preliminary Special Education program authorizes the holder to teach K-12 exceptional children in a school setting in the following disability areas: deaf and hard of hearing, early childhood, mild/moderate and moderate/severe. Beyond the basic credentials, specialist credential programs, approved by the California Commission on Teacher Credentialing, are available in the following areas: reading and language arts, and resource specialist. In addition, service credential programs have also been approved by the CCTC in the areas of administration, health service (school nurse), communicative disorders (language, speech and hearing services, audiology, and aphasia), school counseling, and school psychology.

CREDENTIAL APPLICATION California State University, Northridge cannot recommend a candidate for a credential unless the candidate has admission to a specific program and has successfully completed the program. CONVICTION RECORDS As a part of the admission process, candidates are advised that CONVICTION RECORDS may prevent a candidate from obtaining a credential. Although a wide variety of convictions will not prevent the issuance of a credential, the Education Code does stipulate that certain conviction records will mandate the denial of a teaching document. Candidates with conviction records are advised to consult with either the Director or Assistant Director of the Credential Preparation Office regarding the nature of the conviction. Candidates with serious problems will be required to secure a Certificate of Clearance from the Commission on Teacher Credentialing prior to admission. ENROLLMENT IN REQUIRED COURSES IN THE PROFESSIONAL EDUCATION SEQUENCE IS LIMITED TO PERSONS WHO HAVE BEEN ADMITTED TO THE TEACHER EDUCATION PROGRAM.

Consult the Credential Preparation Office for details.DETERMINATION OF CANDIDATE COMPETENCE The performance of each candidate for the ECSE Emphasis Credential will be documented by both the on-site supervisor of the practicum placement (for each of two practicum placements) and the designated university supervisor, a faculty member in ECSE. Such documentation will take the form of a) the Infant/Toddler Intervention Competency Checklist for the practicum in Infant/Toddler Intervention; and b) the Preschool Competency Checklist for the practicum in Preschool Special Education. Each competency is rated on a 5 point scale. Each form also contains a section for additional comments. At the end of each practicum assignment, two Checklists will be completed, one by the on-site supervisor and one by the university supervisor, resulting in four checklists completed overall for each candidate. Each practicum student will also be given the opportunity to develop a narrative statement to accompany the supervisor's checklists and comments. Each on-site supervisor will be presented with a copy of the appropriate Competency Checklist at the beginning of the practicum experience. Each will be encouraged to engage in an ongoing review of the candidate's performance throughout the semester-long practicum. University supervisors are familiar with the Competency Checklists, and will encourage ongoing dialogue between the supervisors and the candidate about progress towards the competencies. At minimum, a mid-term evaluation will be conducted, involving both supervisors and the candidate, to provide the candidate with a formal review of their progress and assistance with achieving remaining competencies. At the end of the practicum experience the Competency Checklist will serve as the final evaluation and determine the grade for the experience. In addition to these ratings of candidate performance, each candidate will complete a portfolio addressing each of the identified competencies for submission to ECSE faculty during their final semester in the credential program. This portfolio will be reviewed by a panel of ECSE faculty members as additional evidence of the candidate's attainment of competencies and will also be factored into the candidate's consideration for the credential. Competency Checklists and portfolio comments will be forwarded to the Director of the Credential Preparation Office at CSUN who makes the final recommendation for credentials. CERTIFICATE OF ELIGIBILITY/CREDENTIAL APPLICATION Candidates who are completing their professional education requirements at CSUN may file their credential applications as soon as the final coursework is in progress during the final semester in which requirements are being met. If the candidate verifies employment as a teacher in special education, the candidate will receive a Preliminary Level 1 credential valid for five years during which time the candidate must complete requirements for a Level II credential. If the candidate does not have employment or offer of employment, the candidate will receive a Certificate of Eligibility which can be converted to a Level 1 credential when employment has been obtained. During the time the Certificate of Eligibility is in effect, the clock is stopped and time is not counted toward the five years during which the Level II credential must be obtained.

SPECIALIST INSTRUCTION & SERVICE CREDENTIAL PROGRAMS \"Specialist instruction\" means any specialty requiring advanced preparation or special competence. The minimum requirements for specialist instruction credentials are (a) a valid teaching credential; and (b) such specialized and professional preparation as the Commission may require. Preparation programs which result in concurrent issuance of a specialist credential and a teaching credential are available in certain fields. A services credential permits its holder to perform a specific service in the public schools of California. The programs for the specialist credential and the services credential are described below. CONCURRENT SPECIALIST AND SERVICE PROGRAMS WITH MASTER'S PROGRAMS Many academic departments offer master's programs developed to be taken concurrently with specialist and service credential programs. In no case does a master's program satisfy all of the requirements for a credential or substitute for the credential. Nor does completion of a credential satisfy the requirements for a master's degree. Admission to credential programs is through the Credential Preparation Office; admission to master's programs is through the academic department offering the program. Note that many departments will not accept more than 12 semester units completed prior to admission to a graduate program. Note also that admission to a credential program does not routinely grant admission to a master's program. Likewise admission to a master's program does not grant admission to a credential program. READING AND LANGUAGE ARTS SPECIALIST ADMISSION Admission is based on a variety of factors dependent upon the candidate's personal circumstances as he/she seeks to enter the program. Candidates must have successfully completed a basic teaching credential program and have earned a satisfactory grade point average (2.75 at a time of admission with a 3.0 average for all coursework completed after admission). Prior to application for the specialist credential, the applicant must have three years of teaching experience. The Reading and Language Arts Specialist Credential Program is designed for candidates who wish to specialize in the field of reading/language arts and become effective literacy leaders for California's multicultural population. Candidates completing the Reading and Language Arts Specialist Credential Program will be individuals who are prepared to play a leadership role at the school site, the school district, or the county office of education. The candidate completing the Reading and Language Arts Specialist Credential Program will at the exit level have developed the following skills, attitudes, and knowledge: 1.Ability to assist and support classroom teachers through demonstration teaching and group and individual- specific curriculum planning; and to assess the use of effective teaching strategies for the purpose of assisting teachers in creating aliteracy learning environment. 2.Ability to provide leadership in the selection, adaptation and use of instructional materials, including the textbook selection process. 3.Ability to plan and implement professional development activities, including inservice education programs for teachers, administrators, school board members, parentsand members of the community. 4.Ability to assist teachers in assessing the academic needs, interests, attitudes and achievement of students, including those of linguistically diverse students, and then utilizing the assessment to make decisions about appropriate instruction in reading, writing, speaking and listening. 5.Ability to provide direct services to students and to guide students to attain a level of independent reading and writing that includes comprehension and critical thinking skills. 6.Ability to work with the school, the school district and/or the county office of education to design goals, objectives and learning activities; and to assist in the evaluation of program effectiveness and in making the necessary modifications. ASSESSMENT OF NEEDS Upon entry into the program each candidate will be assessed as to his/her abilities and needs. Assessment will be made through a personal interview with an academic advisor from the field of reading/language arts. The assessment will include the following: 1.Check of the required core of minimum competencies. 2.Comparison of previous coursework taken at other institutions with similar courses offered at CSUN. 3.Preparation of a contract of courses to be completed for the Reading and Language Arts Specialist Credential based on needs revealed by the assessment.

PRELIMINARY ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES CREDENTIAL PROGRAM Legislation has established the Administrative Services Program as a two-stage program: a Preliminary Administrative Services Credential Program and a Professional Administrative Services Credential Program. The program described below leads to the Preliminary C r e d e n t i a l . The Preliminary Administrative Services Credential Program is a graduate program designed for persons who wish to hold an administrative or supervisory position at either a school campus or district-wide level. The services credential with a specialization in administrative services authorizes the holder to serve as a superintendent, associate superintendent, deputy superintendent, principal, assistant principal, supervisor, consultant, coordinator, or in anequivalent or intermediate level administration position. Minimum legal requirements for this credential include all of the following: a. Possession of a valid California teaching credential. b. Minimum of three years of successful full time classroom teaching experience. c. A program of specialized and professional preparation. d. Passage of the California Basic Educational Skills Test (CBEST). ADMISSION Admission is based on a variety of factors including the following: grade point average of 2.50 or better; satisfactory test score on the aptitude test of the Graduate Record Examination or Miller's Analogy if undergraduate GPA is below 3.0; successful completion of the California Basic Educational Skills Test (CBEST); recommendation by a practicing school administrator; possession of a valid California teaching credential. ADMINISTRATIVE FIELD WORK Administrative Fieldwork is the capstone experience in the Administrative credential program. Upon completion of all course work the student is considered for admission to the fieldwork program. Such admission is contingent upon: achieving a \"B\" (3.0) grade point average in all prescribed courses, having the endorsement of the administrator of the school where the student is teaching, and being adjudged a desirable administrative candidate. The \"contract\" which the sponsoring administrator executes with the Educational Leadership and Policies Studies Department commits him/her to providing a definite program of administrative experiences for the student. The evaluation check sheet, also completed by the sponsoring administrator prior to admission to fieldwork, guides the University supervisor in directing the student into experiences which will strengthen his/her weaknesses. Upon successful completion of a full year of administrative fieldwork the student is normally certified as being qualified for an administrative service credential.

For information about required or recommended pre-professional courses contact the Biology Department Office. THE MAJOR : Biology is the study of life, its variety and processes. The discipline is dynamic and its intellectual framework is expanding rapidly. In one direction, the study of organisms is the basis for the understanding of how populations of organisms interact among themselves and with their environment. This includes a consideration of the distribution and abundance of organisms, how they have changed over time, energy flow among organisms and the cycling of inorganic and organic resources. In another direction, the study of biological molecules is the basis for understanding how cells are constructed and how they function, including their metabolism, growth, development and reproduction. LEARNING OUTCOMES : The Biology Department has identified four learning outcomes to be achieved by its students as a result of completing one of its Baccalaureate degree programs. (1) Students should demonstrate knowledge of : a) the structure and metabolism of cells; b) the transmission and expression of genetic information; and c) the immediate and long term (evolutionary) consequences of interactions between organisms and their environment. (2) Students should demonstrate specialized knowledge in one or more disciplines of biology. (3) Students should be aware of and/or capable of using new and existing methods and technologies in these disciplines. (4) Students must demonstrate facility in applying the methods of scientific inquiry, including observation, hypothesis testing, data collection and analysis. CAREERS : Many career opportunities are available to the student majoring in biology. The undergraduate program provides an excellent background for further work in medicine, dentistry, pharmacy, optometry, veterinary medicine, biotechnology, medical technology and graduate programs. It also can serve for direct entry into teaching and a variety of positions in industrial, research and governmental organizations. BACHELOR OF ARTS PROGRAM : The Bachelor of Arts degree is designed for students seeking a broad foundation in biology as part of a liberal education in the arts and sciences. Provided that careful attention is paid to the requirements for advanced (postbaccalaureate) and professional programs, the B.A. degree is appropriate for those students (1) intending to enter a graduate program, (2) seeking a teaching credential (see above), or (3) preparing for dentistry, medicine, optometry, pharmacy or veterinary medicine. The B.A. degree is also suitable for careers in such areas as pharmaceutical sales and medical illustration (see Pre-medical and Pre-professional Information). BACHELOR OF SCIENCE PROGRAM : The Bachelor of Science degree is appropriate for students seeking in-depth training in a particular biological field as preparation for a specific career. It is designed to prepare students for (1) employment in commercial, industrial or governmental operations or laboratories, (2) traineeships required for certification or licensure in designated areas of applied biology and microbiology, or (3) related graduate programs. The B.S. degree is available in five options: Cell and Molecular 2 0 0 0 - 2 0 0 2 BIOLOGY 1 2 5 Biology, Environmental Biology, Microbiology, Biotechnology/Medical Technology, and Marine Biology. The Cell and Molecular Biology Option (Option I) with a Bachelor of Science degree will prepare students for work in private or government laboratories where modern cellular and molecular techniques are used. This option also prepares the student for advanced graduate study. The Environmental Biology Option (Option II) with a Bachelor of Science degree prepares graduates for employment in positions such as ecologist, systems ecologist, or wildlife preserve manager; for positions with the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Bureau of Land Management, National or State Parks and other government agencies and private organizations; or for consulting positions in formulating environmental impact reports. A modified version of this option is appropriate for students seeking a teaching credential. This option also prepares the student for advanced graduate study. The Microbiology Option (Option III) with a Bachelor of Science degree will prepare students for employment in microbiological labs, both government and private, and satisfies the recommended curricula of the American Society for Microbiology, the Society of Industrial Microbiologists, and the California Department of Health Services. This option also prepares the student for advanced graduate study. The Biotechnology/Medical Technology Option (Option IV) with a Bachelor of Science degree is designed: (1) to meet the State academic requirements for Clinical Laboratory Technology or Medical Technology; or (2) to prepare a student for a career in biotechnology. Students who complete the course sequence for Medical Technology will be prepared to apply for the clinical year of training in Laboratory Technology or to begin a career in industry or government. Students completing the Biotechnology course sequence will be well prepared for an entry-level biotechnology position in industry or government or for graduate programs in biotechnology. Students choosing either track of this option should consult an advisor as soon as possible concerning the proper course sequence to be followed and other requirements in each field. The Marine Biology Option (Option V) with a Bachelor of Science degree prepares graduates for advanced graduate study and for employment in the marine sciences.

THE MAJOR: The Department of Finance, Real Estate and Insurance, in conjunction with the other departments in the College of Business Administration and Economics, offers curricula leading to a Bachelor of Science Degree in Business Administration with an option in either Finance or Real Estate. The study of finance consists of three interrelated areas: (1) capital markets, which deals with securities markets and financial intermediaries; (2) investments, which concerns the decisions of individual and business investors; and (3) financial management, which focuses on the actual management of firms. The major in Finance emphasizes both theoretical and practical approaches to these areas. As part of the curriculum, the Department offers elective courses in futures and options, real estate, insurance, international finance, and in a special section of Finance 437, The Student Portfolio Management Class, where a small number of students manage a stock portfolio for the University Corporation. The Real Estate major provides an introductory survey of the field of real estate and specialized courses in real estate law, real estate appraisal, and real estate finance. Instructional emphasis is placed on both theoretical and practical aspects of the field and prepares students for a variety of real estate careers. Courses in finance offered by the Department supplement the four Real Estate major courses. A double major in Finance and Real Estate may also be taken. C A R E E R S : The major in Finance helps prepare our graduates for a wide range of career opportunities in all industries and sectors of the economy. Among the finance career fields are financial services, financial budget analysis, investments, and insurance. The students graduating with a major in Finance receive among the highest average starting salaries of business graduates. Students completing the major in Real Estate will have most of the educational requirements for the California real estate broker's license and the State real estate appraiser's license. While the Real Estate major is designed for students with career interests in the various functional fields of real estate \u2014 brokerage, appraisal, finance, investment, development and asset management, as well as service areas such as escrow andtitle insurance, the skills with which students in the major will become familiar are applicable in virtually all business fields.

ACADEMIC ADVISEMENT: All department faculty will be available during their scheduled office hours to advise students. Department faculty will be available during registration periods for program advisement. The Department of Management supports the concept of international education and encourages students to investigate opportunities for overseas study. Certain courses taken at CSU International Program Study Centers in foreign countries are equivalent to courses in the Department of Management and may be used to fulfill some of the requirements for degree options offered by the Department and/or certain general education requirements.

THE MAJOR: In cooperation with other departments in the College of Business and Economics, the Department of Management offers curricula leading to a Bachelor of Science degree in Business Administration with an option in management. The Management Department also participates in the Business Minor, available to all university undergraduate students, and in the Master of Business Administration program. The field of management encompasses all of the processes, skills, and techniques necessary to accomplish organizational goals with and through other people. These include such primary functions as planning, organizing, leading, staffing and controlling. The manager's responsibility is to carry out these functions effectively and efficiently while balancing the needs of all his or her constituencies including customers, employees, owners, and other organizational members. For these reasons the role and responsibilities of managers are often complex and challenging, requiring a broad understanding of the organization's internal and external environment. All organizations, whether private or public, manufacturing or service, for profit or in the social sector, are increasingly in need of effective managers and group leaders at all levels. With the rise of professionalism and the decline of traditional hierarchical structures, the responsibilities for management and leadership are increasingly being shared by all organizational members. This need will only increase with the advances in technology that are progressively eliminating routine work and requiring each individual to add value to the organization of which they are a part, and to society as a whole. The Management Major gives students an opportunity to explore how they can improve their own abilities to work with others and to build the skill and knowledge base needed to be effective managers and professionals. CAREERS: The Management Major prepares students for responsible positions in a wide variety of fields and organizations. These include: Supervisory Management Human Resource Management Strategic Planning Project Management Retail Management Training and Development Management Consulting Team Management Administration REQUIREMENTS FOR THE BACHELOR OF SCIENCE DEGREE IN BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION OPTION: MANAGEMENT SPECIAL GRADE REQUIREMENTS: Transfer students should be aware that no grade lower than \"C\" will be accepted on transfer from another institution to satisfy Department or College of Business Administration and Economics requirements.

Munn, Robert Yost THE MAJOR: In cooperation with the other departments in the College of Business Administration and Economics, the Marketing Department offers curricula leading to a Bachelor of Science Degree in Business Administration with an option in marketing. The Marketing Department also offers a Minor in Marketing. Marketing is an extremely broad field encompassing a range of business activities that have been estimated to account for approximately 45% of gross national product. It involves such matters as the search for new product opportunities, product development and management, distribution, advertising and promotion, sales, sales management, and post-sale activities. People employed in advertising (agencies, clients, broadcast and print media), research firms, wholesalers, retailers and transportation firms of every kind are part of the marketing segment of our economy. Every firm, whether it is a manufacturer, retailer, wholesaler or service provider, needs marketing people to discover, measure, and analyze markets; develop and manage products; create and manage advertising, promotion, and sales; establish coherent pricing policies; and maintain positive customer relations. The Marketing Major gives our students the opportunity to gain quantitative and qualitative skills in the field. Moreover, there is sufficient flexibility in our program to allow our students to seek additional courses to fit their needs and interests in areas outside of marketing. CAREERS: The Marketing Major prepares our students for careers in a wide variety of fields. These include: Advertising International Marketing Marketing Management Marketing Research Retailing Sales and Sales ManagementREQUIREMENTS FOR THE BACHELOR OF SCIENCE DEGREE IN BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION SPECIAL GRADE REQUIREMENTS Transfer students should be aware that no grade lower than \"C\" will be accepted on transfer from another institution to satisfy Department of College of Business Administration and Economics requirements.

THE MAJOR: Communicating well and understanding the communication process are essential to professional success in many fields: law, business, teaching, advertising, sales, and government among them. People communicate to influence, to persuade, and to express. Learning to communicate effectively is one important reason for majoring in Communication Studies--but it's not the only reason. Studying the communication process helps us understand how the human mind works. Analyzing the messages in advertisements, television programs, and political speeches helps us understand our society. Studying communication in everyday relationships, groups, and organizations shows us how these systems are created and maintained. Comparing American communication patterns with those of other societies prepares us to become global citizens. Communication Studies asks how, why and with what consequences people communicate. Communication Studies majors acquire knowledge and methods that apply to both their private and public lives. By becoming competent communicators, they gain valuable tools for lifelong learning. CAREERS: There are communication needs in every job, but the following fields seem to attract the majority of our majors in the 1990's: public relations, advertising, social and human services, international relations and negotiations, media, arts and entertainment, law, government, health care, and education.REQUIREMENTS IN MAJOR FOR BACHELOR OF ARTS DEGREE OPTION I: DEPARTMENT CORE REQUIREMENTS (15 UNITS) COMS 301 Performance, Language, and Cultural Studies................................ 3 COMS 321 Rhetorical Discourse..................................... 3 COMS 327 Rhetorical Studies.......................................... 3 COMS 351 Communication Theory .............................. 3 COMS 356 Intercultural Communication...................... 3 COMMUNICATION PRACTICES (3 UNITS) Select 3 units from the following: COMS 303 Narrative in Performance............................ 3 COMS 309 Advanced Public Speaking.......................... 3 COMS 325 Legal Argumentation ................................... 3 COMS 430 Rhetorical Criticism...................................... 3 COMMUNICATION CONTEXTS (3 UNITS) Select 3 units from the following: COMS 443 Rhetoric in Business..................................... 3 COMS 451 Interpersonal Communication .................. 3 COMS 453 Organizational Communication................ 3 COMS 454 Communication and Technology.............. 3 COMMUNICATION AND MEANING (3 UNITS) Select 3 units from the following: COMS 320 Communicative Functions of Language.... 3 COMS 350 Nonverbal Communication......................... 3 COMS 404 Theories of Literature in Performance....... 3 COMS 420 Language and Symbolic Processes............. 3 COMMUNICATION AND CULTURE (3 UNITS) Select 3 units from the following: COMS 345 Perspectives in American Rhetoric............. 3 COMS 360 Communication and the Sexes.................... 3 COMS 435 Rhetoric of Women....................................... 3 ELECTIVES (15 UNITS) Select 15 units of upper division courses in Communication Studies and/or from approved electives in other departments.

The department is accredited by the California Commission on Teacher Credentialing for the Clinical-Rehabilitative Services Credential (Language, Speech and Hearing Services, and Audiology) and the Special Class Authorization (Aphasic). It also is accredited by the National Council on Accreditation in Teacher Education. SPEECH-LANGUAGE PATHOLOGY ADVISORS: Edward P. Hall, Ruth Harris, Christine Strike-Roussos, Judith Trost- Cardamone, Elizabeth WeberAUDIOLOGY Sinclair ACADEMIC ADVISEMENT :Communicative Disorders majors at both the undergraduate and graduate levels are assigned a faculty advisor. Mandatory advisement takes place once a semester during preregistration activities, and more frequent contact between student and advisor is encouraged. Prospective and new students at both the undergraduate and graduate levels should attend an informal monthly orientation meeting as soon as possible for basic information on the fields of Speech-Language Pathology and Audiology, and assistance in formulating academic and career plans. Consult Department for time and place. An advisor also should be consulted regarding fulfillment of related coursework for professional licensure and certification requirements, which may include courses involving biology, human anatomy and physiology, the exceptional child, growth and development of children, mental hygiene, remedial reading, psychology, physics, mathematics, and others. THE MAJOR: The Communication Disorders and Sciences major involves studies in the disciplines of speech and hearing sciences, audiology, and speech-language pathology. The undergraduate and graduate programs offer an emphasis in either audiology or speech-language pathology. The masters degree is the professional entry-level requirement for employment as an audiologist or speech- language pathologist. Completion of the baccalaureate and masters degree programs enables students to satisfy the academic requirements for: License in all states to practice in medical, rehabilitative, or private practice settings; Education credentials in all states for employment in public schools; and Professional certification by the American Speech- Language-Hearing Association. The department's curriculum is conducted through classroom instruction and experiential learning, including intensive student participation in the clinical programs of the CSUN Language, Speech and Hearing Center. Advanced graduate students obtain additional clinical experience through placement in the department's affiliated medical centers, professional practices, and public schools. CAREERS: Graduates with the masters degree find varied career opportunities as speech-language pathologists and as audiologists serving the needs of communicatively disabled persons across the age span. Employment opportunities continue to grow due to the general population's longer life span and advances in technology and health. Program alumni find employment in California's and the nation's medical centers, skilled nursing and other rehabilitative facilities, community speech and hearing centers, medical offices, public and private schools, and private practices. In recent years, approximately one-tenth of the speech- language pathologists and one-fifth of the audiologists educated in California and licensed within the state are alumni of California State University, Northridge.REQUIREMENTS FOR THE BACHELOR OF ARTS DEGREE REQUIREMENTS FOR ADMISSION TO THE UNDERGRADUATE MAJOR Undergraduate instruction is divided between a Pre-Clinical and a Clinical Phase. There are no pre-admission requirements for the department's Pre-Clinical Phase. All entering undergraduate and post-baccalaureate undeclared majors are regarded as Pre-Clinical Phase students. Once junior-level or higher academic standing is achieved, Pre- Clinical Phase students must complete CD340, 345, 360, and 442, or the equivalent at another institution, in order to apply for Clinical Privileges at the CSUN Language, Speech and Hearing Center as part of the Clinical Phase of instruction. Application for the Clinical Phase is made during the semester in which the Pre-clinical Phase courses are in progress of completion. Please note the following: Satisfactory completion of the Pre- clinical Phase courses includes a grade of B or better in each of the four classes. Enrollment in clinical courses (e.g., CD465, 475, 469A, 469B, or 469O) is not permitted without department approval of Clinical Privileges. Evaluation for admission to Clinical Privileges includes a faculty assessment of academic and clinical potential, supported by letters of recommendation, academic transcripts, and satisfactory completion of the Pre-clinical Phase courses. Once admitted to Clinical Privileges, the student is regarded as a Clinical Phase student and should consult an academic advisor regarding the area of major emphasis (speech- language pathology or audiology), proper course sequencing, and prerequisites for advanced courses. If a student is denied admission to Clinical Privileges or if such privileges have been suspended or revoked, it is possible to complete the baccalaureate degree as a non-clinical major by substitution for all client-contact courses with permission of the faculty advisor and department chair. Instructions, due dates, and application forms for Clinical Privileges are found in the department office. Clinical Phase students are advised that Clinical Privileges may be suspended or revoked at any time by the department for failure to attain a grade of B or better in all clinical courses (e.g., CD465 et seq., 475 et seq., 469A, 469B, 469O, 668, 672AB), for violations of ethical conduct or state licensure regarding client care, for academic probation beyond one semester, or for failure to adhere to the regulations and policies of the CSUN Language, Speech and Hearing Center or of the department. Further information on Pre-Clinical and Clinical Phase components of the department's programs is offered during scheduled monthly student orientation sessions.

For example, if a student has taken MATH 140 (for GE section A.3: Mathematics), BIOL 100 (100L) Introductory Biology and lab (for GE Section B.1: Biological and Physical Sciences), and SPAN 101 Elementary Spanish I (for GE Section F.2 or F.3: Foreign Language), the department's own lower division requirements will have been met. TITLE 5 REQUIREMENTS (6 UNITS) TOTAL UNITS REQUIRED FOR DEGREE: 124 In addition to the 52 units required in General Education, the department major requires 42 upper division units for the speech-language pathology option and 41 upper division units for the audiology option. Please note that some of the department's lower division requirements may also satisfy GE requirements. In addition to degree requirements, the undergraduate course of study must fulfill requirements for successful application to graduate school, as well as provide some of the introductory, required courses for professional certification, state licensure and credentialing. For this reason, students considering the major should consult an academic advisor at the earliest opportunity to discuss the course of study and plan a program. Department majors are required to meet with their academic advisors at least once each term prior to course registration. REQUIREMENTS FOR THE MASTER OF SCIENCE DEGREE REQUIREMENTS FOR ADMISSION TO THE PROGRAM Potential graduate students must apply simultaneously and separately to the University and to the department. Those who meet both the University's and the department's minimum requirements will be considered by the department in a competitive process for admission to the department as Conditionally Classified or Classified Graduate students.2 0 0 0 - 2 0 0 2 C OMMUNI C AT I ON DI S ORDERS & SCIENCES 1 9 9 Graduate applicants who meet the University minimum requirements but do not meet the department's minimum requirements may elect to enroll in undergraduate prerequisite courses in a Post-Baccalaureate Unclassified status (PBU). The PBU enrollment is intended to assist students in meeting the minimum admission requirements of prerequisite courses for the department's graduate programs (see below). Courses in the masters degree program itself generally are restricted to graduate students in Classified or Conditionally Classified Graduate status. Students with a baccalaureate degree in a major other than Communication Disorders and Sciences need not pursue a second baccalaureate degree in this field, but may do so if they wish. Students having a baccalaureate degree in Communication Disorders and Sciences, or equivalent, may not pursue a second baccalaureate degree in the department. Potential PBU students should discuss options with a department advisor. An applicant to the department's graduate program who currently is in PBU status will need to apply only to the department for admission once the minimum admission requirements have been fulfilled. APPLICATION MATERIALS. Department materials and detailed instructions for application to the graduate programs may be obtained from the department office. The department requires that applicants must use the department application form and the forms for letters of recommendation. Completed department application materials must be returned directly to the department. MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS FOR CONSIDERATION FOR DEPARTMENT ADMISSION The following requirements must be met: 1.Completion of a BA degree; 2.Completion of 30 units of approved undergraduate courses in Communicative Disorders, including the specific course prerequisites described below; 3.Submission of the department graduate application; 4.Submission of three letters of recommendation on departmental forms; 5.Submission of scores on the Graduate Record Examination (GRE) or Miller Analogies Test (MAT); and 6.Passing score on the CSU Upper Division Writing Proficiency Exam. It is understood that some of the required courses may be in progress at the time of application, but would be completed before the anticipated starting date. Students with an undergraduate degree in Communication Disorders and Sciences from a university other than CSUN may have minimal deficiencies in meeting the above requirements, and may be considered for admittance a Conditionally Classified Graduate students. For example, an applicant with a baccalaureate degree from an institution outside of California is not expected to pass the CSU Upper Division Writing Proficiency Examination at the time of application. In this case, if admitted, the applicant would complete this state-mandated requirement during the first semester of graduate studies as a condition of admission. Eligibility should be discussed with a department academic advisor. The following undergraduate coursework is prerequisite for admission to Classified Graduate status:EMPHASIS IN SPEECH-LANGUAGE PATHOLOGY: 1.Twelve (12) semester units of basic coursework, including CD 340, 345, 360, 442 or the equivalent. 2.Four (4) semester units in observation and diagnostic methods, including CD 469A, 469O, or equivalent; 3.Nine (9) semester units of coursework in the management of communicative disorders, including CD 450, 451, 462 or equivalent, 4.Three (3) semester units of courses in basic audiometry or auditory rehabilitation, such as CD 445, 446 or equivalent; and 5.Two (2) semester units of clinical practice in speech- language pathology, such as CD 465 or the equivalent. EMPHASIS IN AUDIOLOGY: 1.Twelve (12) semester units of basic coursework, including CD340, 345, 360, and 442, or equivalent; 2.Four (4) semester units in observation and diagnostic methods, including CD 469A, 469O, or equivalent; 3.Six (6) semester units of coursework in the management of communication disorders, including CD 451 and 462, or equivalent; 4.Six (6) semester units of coursework in basic audiometry and auditory rehabilitation, including CD 445 and 446, or the equivalent; and, 5.Two (2) semester units of clinical practice, including CD 475. SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS: The Clinical Rehabilitative Services Credential and Special Class Authorization (Aphasic) require a masters degree. Applicants for the department's credential programs must successfully gain simultaneous admission to Classified or Conditionally Classified Graduate status. PBU status is not regarded as matriculation in the department's master's degree programs or credential programs. Student application for admission to the department's graduate programs also automatically includes application for admission to the department's Clinical Phase and the awarding of Clinical Privileges at the CSUN Language, Speech and Hearing Center. An offer of admission to Classified or Conditionally Classified Graduate status is assumed to include an offer of clinical privileges unless otherwise expressed by the department's admission letter. Retention of clinical privileges for graduate students follows the same policy guidelines as for undergraduate students. PBU students must apply for the Clinical Phase and Clinical Privileges under the same guidelines as undergraduate s t u d e n t s . REQUIREMENTS FOR THE M.S. DEGREE: Once admitted to the department's graduate programs, a student must attain Classified Graduate status, submit a department-approved plan of study (i.e., the \"Master's Degree Contract\") to the Graduate School for review and approval, satisfactorily complete all courses on the plan, and pass a final, comprehensive examination. It is noted that for state licensure, professional certification, and state education credentials, additional graduate courses are taken as part of the course of study. A thesis option is available that fulfills a portion of the final, comprehensive examination requirement. Students interested in writing a thesis must consult the department's graduate coordinator for option criteria prior to submission of a department-approved \"Master's Degree Contract.\"2 0 0 C OMMUNI C AT I ON DI S ORDERS & SCIENCES 2 0 0 0 - 2 0 0 2REQUIRED COURSES (30 UNITS) 15 units in the core curriculum for all majors: CD 501 Interviewing and Counseling in Communicative Disorders........................... 3 CD 502 Research in Communicative Disorders........... 3 CD 552 Language Disorders II....................................... 3 CD 558 Neuroanatomy and Neurophysiology of Speech, Language and Hearing.............. 3 CD 674 Pediatric Audiology........................................... 3 SPEECH-LANGUAGE PATHOLOGY EMPHASIS (15 UNITS) CD 660 Structural-Organic Disorders of Speech and Swallowing............................................. 3 CD 659 Aphasia, Apraxia and Dysarthria.................... 3 CD 661 Advanced Study of Voice, Fluency, and Phonological Disorders................................ 3 CD 662 Seminar in Developmental Language Disorders........................................................ 3 CD 663 Neurogenic Disorders of Swallowing and Cognition........................................................ 3 AUDIOLOGY EMPHASIS (15 UNITS) CD 660 Structural-Organic Disorders of Speech and Swallowing..................................................... 3 CD 670A Electrophysiology of the Audio-Vestibular System............................. 3 CD 670B Electrophysiology of the Audio-Vestibular System............................. 3 CD 671 Seminar in Amplification for the Hearing-Impaired......................................... 3 CD 675 Pathologies of the Auditory System................ 3 COMPREHENSIVE EXAM/ THESIS Successful completion of a comprehensive written examination covering speech and hearing science, speech- language pathology, and audiology; student must register for CD 697, or Successful completion of an acceptable thesis and its oral defense, along with successful completion of a comprehensive written examination in areas of speech and hearing sciences, speech-language pathology, and audiology in the areas not covered by the thesis topic.

In every aspect of science, art, business and entertainment, computer applications abound. For students who think logically, enjoy solving problems and are persistent, Computer Science is a good study choice. Our department's pragmatic approach to computer science offers hands-on design experience as well as theoretical knowledge. That's an advantage on the job because graduates have experience in design, implementation, and testing. We teach logical thinking and creative problem-solving skills and we emphasize communication, both written and spoken. Good communication is vital in working with clients and helping them understand how the software works. Classes often incorporate a team approach, requiring clear communication among members as they solve a problem and explain their solution to others. Classes are small, averaging 25 students. They are taught by faculty members, not graduate students. The faculty works on such fascinating topics as virtual reality, high-speed networks, parallel computing and Internet technology. Students work alongside them in the department labs, most of which have been recently equipped with state-of-the-art computers. Students gain extra experience in the ACM Student Club (part of a national organization), which run Saturday workshops and social activities. A strong scholarship program is available. The Computer Science Program is accredited by the Computer Science Accreditation Commission of the Computing Science Accreditation Board. CAREERS: A computer science major can have a career as a software engineer, designing, implementing, testing and maintaining large software systems. Careers are available in such specialties as computer graphics, computer security, robotics, expert systems, distributed systems and networking. Many companies employ computer science majors as computer systems and networking. Many companies employ computer science majors as computer systems administrators. The degree can lead to a career in almost any industry, including aerospace, manufacturing, banking, health and education. PROGRAMS OFFERED The undergraduate program, leading to a B.S. in computer science, provides a broad knowledge of computing. It consists of core courses in programming languages, computer system organization and operating systems, data structures, computation theory, computer logic, and societal implications in computing. The freshman year program includes courses in mathematical analysis, algorithms and programming, computer architecture and assembly language, symboliclogic, and data structures and program design. Sophomores take courses in linear algebra, computer organization, programming language concepts, files and data bases, and fundamental mathematical concepts. As juniors, students take courses in digital systems; combinatorial algorithms; automata, languages, and computation; operating systems and system architecture; and program design techniques, along with a course in either probability or statistics. With the help of an advisor, seniors formulate a Concentrated Studies Package related to their career objectives. They also take a course in societal issues in computing and a course in numerical analysis or methods. Students who hold a recognized bachelor's degree from an accredited institution may apply for the Second Bachelor's degree program. A minor in computer science calls for 32 units of study, including courses in computer architecture and assembly language, algorithms and programming, data structure and program design, computer organization, and programming language concepts, along with a choice of electives. Students in the MS program complete 30 units of graduate work, including a 6 units thesis or graduate project. The core of the graduate program comprises advanced course in computation theory, algorithms and data structures, system architecture, and software engineering. The electives may be chosen to either form a concentration in an area of specialization or to provide a broadly based program of study, whichever is more consistent with the selected thesis or graduate project. ACADEMIC ADVISEMENT Each student meets with a faculty advisor during the Sophomore year and plans a concentrated studies program appropriate to the student's personal career objectives. For information regarding the assignment of an advisor, please contact the Department Office. Prior to the formation of their Graduate Committees, graduate students are advised by the Graduate Coordinator. After the formation of their Graduate Committees, graduate students are advised by the Committee Chair. All areas of specialization, courses and Comp. 698 must be approved in advance by the Committee Chair. ENGINEERING/COMPUTER SCIENCE SCHOLARSHIP INFORMATION The College of Engineering and Computer Science administers a substantial undergraduate scholarship program, disbursing approximately $40,000 each year to high-achieving engineering and computer science students.

Johnson, Robert Krol, Viken Tchakerian, Nancy Virts, Ben T. Yu. EMERITUS: Keith D. Evans, Clarence L. Ham, Jora Minasian DEGREE OFFERED: Bachelor of Arts Degree in Economics ACADEMIC ADVISEMENT: Faculty members are available for advisement during scheduled office hours. B.A. MISSION STATEMENT: The mission of the B.A. in Economics, and the Economics faculty, is to teach, research andstudy economics, and to make available informed economicanalysis. The Department will foster pure and applied researchin economics and offer courses that will: introduce students to the methods of economic reasoning; offer a foundation of analytical thinking and knowledge of economics that prepares economics and business students for successful careers; prepare students for future employment in the field of economics; and prepare students for further education in economics and related disciplines. THE MAJOR: The Economics Department offers curricula leading to a Bachelor of Arts in Economics degree and participates incourse offerings for the Bachelor of Science in BusinessAdministration and Bachelor of Science in Accountancydegrees. As Economics majors, students study analytical models of particular markets and of the economy as a whole. Theyexamine how scarcity affects the incentives that individuals andbusinesses face in a market economy, and the impact of changesin those incentives. The study of scarcity and incentives enableseconomics graduates to predict likely changes in technology,regulation, and the market in general and how those changeswill impact them and their firms. In addition, the analyticalprecision of economics helps students develop critical-thinkingskills that are highly valued in the job market. Economics also teaches written and oral communications skills. While these skills may be obtained in many majors, theEconomics major at CSUN has made them a priority. Everyupper division Economics class at CSUN requires a substantialwritten component. Many classes also require oralpresentation of class projects. THE ECONOMICS HONORS PROGRAM: The Economics Honors program is designed to offer academically talented students avariety of opportunities to enrich their academic and personallives throughout their educational experience here at CaliforniaState University, Northridge. The program is open only tostudents who are declared majors in the Bachelor of Arts inEconomics degree program, meet all Honors Programadmission criteria, and are selected by the Economics HonorsProgram Admissions Committee. Students accepted into theprogram are offered a variety of benefits including honors designated economics courses, mentorship program, closerworking relationship with faculty members, and a specialHonors designation on their final graduation transcripts. Students interested in the program can obtain more information at the Economics Department Office, (818) 677-2462, or with the coordinator of the EconomicsHonors Program. CAREERS: Students obtaining a Bachelor of Arts Degree in Economics have diverse career goals.

Information about the Department of Computer Science islisted in a separate section within this catalog. DEGREE PROGRAMS IN ENGINEERING Undergraduate Bachelor of Science in Civil EngineeringBachelor of Science in Computer EngineeringBachelor of Science in Electrical EngineeringBachelor of Science in Manufacturing Systems EngineeringBachelor of Science in Mechanical EngineeringBachelor of Science in Engineering (no option) Graduate Master of Science in Engineering with options in: Applied MechanicsAutomation EngineeringElectrical EngineeringEngineering ManagementMaterials Engineering Mechanical EngineeringStructural Engineering The course requirements for the general Bachelor of Science in Engineering are listed below. The requirements of theother Bachelor of Science degree programs and the Masterof Science in Engineering programs are detailed under thevarious departmental listings that follow. The Bachelor of Science degrees in Civil Engineering, Electrical Engineering, Engineering (no option), andMechanical Engineering are accredited by the AccreditationBoard for Engineering and Technology (ABET). UNDERGRADUATE PROGRAMS IN ENGINEERING The undergraduate engineering programs at California StateUniversity, Northridge, prepare graduates for lifelong careersin the field that will allow them to make productivecontributions to society and to find personal satisfaction intheir work. To accomplish this overall objective, graduates ofthe engineering programs will have the following qualities: 1) An understanding of fundamental engineering principles, analysis and design; 2) An awareness of engineering practices in industry and emerging technologies; 3) The ability to communicate well, both orally and in writing, and the ability to work as a productivemember of an interdisciplinary team; 4) An understanding of the impact of engineering in a societal context; and 5) A sense of exploration and the ability to maintain life long learning. These goals determine the content of each undergraduate engineering program. Students majoring in engineering can choose from five separate programs in specific engineering disciplines: civilengineering, computer engineering, electrical engineering,manufacturing systems engineering, and mechanicalengineering. In addition, students can take a general majorin engineering, which provides greater breadth but lessspecialization. All degree programs, except computerengineering, have common course requirements for the firsttwo years. Students who are not sure which field ofengineering they want to select for their careers can start atNorthridge as a major in engineering and transfer later toone of the five discipline-specific majors. All engineering curricula at Northridge are designed to prepare graduates who will have the following qualities: * an ability to apply knowledge of mathematics, science and engineering, * an ability to design and conduct experiments, as well as to analyze and interpret data, * an ability to to design a system, component, or process to meet desired needs, * an ability to function on multi-disciplinary teams,* an ability to identify formulate, and solve engineering problems, * an understanding of professional and ethical responsibility, * an ability to communicate effectively, * the broad education necessary to understand the impact of engineering solutions in a global, andsocietal context,2000-2002 ENG INEERING AND COMPUTER SCIENCE 271* a recognition of the need for, and an ability to engage in life-long learning, * a knowledge of contemporary issues, and * an ability to use the techniques, skills, and modern engineering tools necessary for engineering practice. All engineering programs begin with courses in fundamentals of mathematics, science, engineering andcomputer science. Sophomore and junior courses in allengineering fields provide a combination of fundamentaltheory and design practice. This combination providesstudents with the fundamentals required for a lifelongprofessional career while making them ready for productivework from their first day on the job. Students take a programof general education, which prepares them to view thebroader consequences of their engineering designs. Inaddition, students have opportunities for practice in writtenand oral communication in both their general educationcourses and in the courses in their major. Excellentcommunication skills are an essential ingredient of asuccessful engineer. Senior courses in engineering emphasize advanced concepts and include a capstone design course. In that design coursestudents apply all their previous engineering education to thedesign of a real engineering project. Students analyze notonly the technical aspects of the design but also its economicand social implications. The results of the design projectinclude the actual construction of the component or system aswell as written and oral presentations of the design work. Thecapstone design course provides students an experience thatis as close as possible to an industrial design project as thefinal step in their engineering education. ENGINEERING/COMPUTER SCIENCE SCHOLARSHIP INFORMATION The College of Engineering and Computer Science administers a substantial undergraduate scholarshipprogram, disbursing over $40,000 each year to high-achievingengineering and computer science students. Some of thescholarships given by industry are from Litton Industries,Teradyne, Xircom, Sterling Software, Lockheed Martin, andthe Raytheon Solid State Microwave Laboratory.

In keeping withthese goals, we aim to develop in them an understandingthat a successful professional career is one that addressesthe needs of society and requires a lifetime of learning andleadership. THE MAJOR: Civil Engineers design the infrastructure of our world, from bridges and freeways to sewer systems andlibraries. Their work touches nearly every facet of our society'severy-day lives, including but not limited to -- structures, watersupply, waste management, materials, construction,geotechnical, the environment, and transportation. Their workis vital, particularly in Southern California, whereenvironmental, transportation and water issues are of majorimportance and where structural problems, especially relatedto earthquakes, demand sound engineering solutions. Civil Engineering majors at Cal State Northridge receive a solid, broad-based education. During the first two years andinto the third year, all Engineering majors complete a commonengineering core curriculum. Among the many topic areas inthe core curriculum are mathematics, physics, chemistry,computer programming, engineering materials, electricalcircuits, engineering mechanics, thermodynamics, engineeringeconomy, and numerical analysis. The junior and senior years in Civil Engineering are built upon the common engineering core curriculum. These two yearsinclude instruction in structures, mechanical vibrations,hydraulics, soil mechanics, surveying, computer-aided designand graphics, engineering mechanics, concrete and steel design,statistics, program administration, and senior design. Inaddition, students select electives in topic areas ranging fromhydrology, geotechnical, engineering management to moreadvanced work in structures. Civil Engineering students take classes and work in the following facilities: the Applied Mechanics Laboratory, where students apply engineering techniques to the static and dynamic behavior of mechanical systems; the Civil Engineering Senior Design Laboratory, used in a two-semester course that simulates a professional civilengineering environment; the Geotechnical Laboratory, where students look at the behavior of soil as an engineering material; the Structural Analysis Research Center, where students have the opportunity to work with qualified faculty on suchdiverse projects as dams, buildings, towers, and evenspacecraft. Besides these facilities, students use Los Angeles itself as a laboratory; studying buildings, spacecraft, dams, and otherstructures. With the broad-based education students receive at Cal State Northridge, it is highly recommended that students preparethemselves to take the EIT (Engineering in Training), now commonly referred to as the FE (Fundamentals in Engineering)Exam, before they graduate from this institution. This is anational exam, eight hours in length, covering the basic topicsthat comprise the common core in engineering. the EIT or FEexam is the first of two exams that are required in order tobecome a registered engineer in the State of California. To sit forthe second exam, additional work experience is required beyondthe bachelor's degree. In today's society, it is almost imperativethat students, preparing for the Civil Engineering profession,become registered. Cal State Northridge has an excellentreputation of solidly preparing students toward this goal. Civil Engineering students have opportunities to participate in student chapters of professional societies such as ASCE(American Society of Civil Engineers) and AWMA (Air andWaste Management Association), as well as interdisciplinarystudent organizations in the College, such as Tau Beta Pi, theSociety of Women Engineers, the National Society for BlackEngineers, and the Society for Hispanic Professional Engineers. The Civil Engineering program is accredited by ABET (Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology). As partof the accreditation process, ABET requires a minimum of 32semester units of mathematics and basic sciences, 48 semesterunits of engineering science, and 16 semester units ofEngineering design. The major automatically meets the ABETmathematics and engineering science requirements. Althoughthe number of design units has been relaxed with the newEngineering Criteria 2000, design must be present throughoutthe curriculum. Design units for specific courses are given inthe COURSE LIST below. CAREERS: Civil Engineering is the oldest of the engineering disciplines, responsible for projects dating back more than5,000 years. Rebuilding and expanding the civil engineeringinfrastructure of the United States -- including roads, bridges,rail networks, sewage treatment plants, deep-water ports, andmunicipal water systems -- is one of the technology areas thathas been targeted for rapid development by the NationalScience Foundation in the 21st Century. Most practicing Civil Engineers are employed in the areas of structural engineering, transportation engineering,environmental engineering, water resources engineering,geotechnical engineering, construction engineering, orsurveying. Many of these areas, such as structural engineering,encompass the design of such seemingly diverse items asspacecraft and office buildings. Although the majority of Civil Engineers are employed in private industry, many are involved in consulting or own their ownfirms, and a significant number are employed in the governmentsector, where they are involved in the provision of highways andother public works for state and local government. The degree can be used as a stepping-stone to graduate work in engineering, law, business, or even medicine. Many CivilEngineering graduates return to Cal State Northridge to earntheir M.S. degree in the Applied Mechanics or StructuralEngineering programs.

MISSION STATEMENT: To successfully guide our students in their: achievement of the educational objectives articulated for all undergraduate engineering programs at CaliforniaState University, Northridge, and acquisition and development of the specialized knowledge and skills essential to their professionalcompetence in the design, implementation, andmanagement of contemporary manufacturing andproduction methods and systems. THE MAJOR: Manufacturing Systems Engineers turn ideas into reality. They play key roles in the creation of almost every singleproduct that you see or use, from clothing to computers, fromautomobiles to space shuttles, from frozen foods to toys. Thechallenges of creating and using new materials to meet futureneeds, the challenges of relieving human drudgery byautomating dangerous and onerous production processes, thechallenges of forming and leading teams of engineering experts . . . all are examples of a few of the numerous opportunities forwhich the Manufacturing Systems Engineering programprepares its students. Manufacturing Systems Engineering majors at Cal State Northridge receive a solid, broad-based education. Among themany topic areas in the basic curriculum are mathematics,physics, chemistry, computer programming, engineeringmaterials, electrical circuits, engineering mechanics,thermodynamics, engineering economy, and numerical analysis. In the junior year, students begin their studies of the more advanced topics required to achieve professional status as aManufacturing Systems Engineer. Courses are designed toensure student intellectual growth in the following five state-of-the-art areas: the design and manufacture of products, the design of manufacturing systems, materials and manufacturing processes, the management of production processes and resources, and measurement and inferences regarding manufacturing process variables. Individual and team assignments on projects and in laboratories provide students with numerous opportunities todevelop their technical, design, leadership, communication,management, and team skills. The curriculum is designed tomeet applicable ABET (Accreditation Board for Engineeringand Technology) requirements. In addition to the William F. MacDonald Laboratory, where engineering majors are introduced to computer-aided design,and the Richard M. Pickett Laboratory, where engineeringmajors are introduced to engineering materials, students in theManufacturing Systems Engineering program have theopportunity to work in four state-of-the-art laboratories: the Automation Engineering Laboratory, with computer workstations, microcomputers, robots, computer-controlled milling machines and lathes, and the sophisticated design and graphics software and networksessential to the success of computer integratedmanufacturing. the Manufacturing Systems Laboratory, with networked computers and peripherals, and work space forManufacturing Systems Engineering majors and forsenior design projects. the Advanced Corrosion Laboratory, equipped to perform detailed studies and investigations of theprocess of corrosion and the corrosive behavior ofmaterials in different environments. Both undergraduateand graduate students have opportunities to participatein the numerous ongoing faculty research projectsconducted in this laboratory. the Advanced Materials Laboratory, equipped to perform detailed studies and investigations of the structure andproperties of advanced materials such as composites.Undergraduate and graduate students also haveopportunities of participate in many active facultyresearch projects conducted in this laboratory. In senior design, Manufacturing Systems Engineering students also use the real world as their basic laboratory, by executingreal projects in local industry. Recent projects have includeddesign and development of a CD-ROM counter, design of animproved packaging process for industrial adhesives andpolymers, planning and design of a facility for electronicsmanufacturing, plant layout design for the production of amedical patient monitor, development of CAD and rapidprototyping models for a new product, development of a radio-controlled robot, and development of an ISO-9000 qualityassurance system. Small classes are taught by a group of dedicated professors who among them hold several outstanding teaching andfaculty awards, are nationally and internationally recognizedfor their technical publications and work in engineeringprofessional organizations, and have many years of actualengineering and management experience in industry to sharewith their students. Manufacturing Systems Engineering students have opportunities to participate in student chapters of professionalsocieties such as SAMPE (Society for the Advancement ofMaterial and Process Engineering) and SME (Society ofManufacturing Engineers), as well as interdisciplinary studentorganizations in the College, such as Tau Beta Pi, the Society ofWomen Engineers, the National Society for Black Engineers,and the Society for Hispanic Professional Engineers. CAREERS: Manufacturing Systems Engineering is the most rapidly-growing discipline area in the engineering profession.Four of the seven technology areas that have been identified forrapid development by the National Science Foundation--Advanced Manufacturing Technologies, Advanced Materialsand Processing, Biotechnology, and Health Care DeliverySystems-- are particularly well-suited for the talents of theManufacturing Systems Engineer. Employment opportunitiesabound in the metropolitan Los Angeles area, the leadingmanufacturing region in the United States. On the job, Manufacturing Systems Engineers develop new facilities, create computer models and images of products andprocesses, manage the production process, conductproductivity studies, test products and evaluate materials,trouble-shoot on the factory floor, and work hand-in-hand withdesign engineers. Because their background is broad and thetypes of work are so varied, these engineers find opportunities284 CIVIL & MANUFACTURING ENGINEERING - MANUFACTURING SYSTEMS 2000-2002 in fields besides manufacturing, applying their skills and knowledge in such diverse environments as hospitals,entertainment firms, and consulting firms. ManyManufacturing Systems Engineers are noted for starting theirown companies or pursuing Engineering Management careerpaths in large companies. Although most Manufacturing Systems Engineers are employed in private industry, others pursue careers withgovernment agencies or educational institutions. The degreecan be used as a stepping-stone to graduate work inengineering, law, business, or even medicine. ManyManufacturing Systems Engineering graduates return to CalState Northridge to earn their M.S. degree in the AutomationEngineering, Engineering Management, or MaterialsEngineering programs.

DEPARTMENT PROGRAMS The Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) Department at Cal State Northridge offers the following programs: Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering Bachelor of Science in Computer EngineeringM.S. Engineering with Option in Electrical Engineering THE MAJOR: \"Nowadays the world is lit by lightning,\" the playwright Tennessee Williams wrote. But electrical andcomputer engineers prove him wrong every day. From city lights to satellites, from semiconductors to telephone switching systems to audio equipment, the work depends onelectricity and the engineers who design and develop ways toharness its power. Electrical Engineering majors at Cal State Northridge receive a solid, broad-based education. Among the many topic areas inthe basic curriculum are mathematics, physics, chemistry,computer programming, engineering materials, electricalcircuits, engineering mechanics, thermodynamics, engineeringeconomy, and numerical analysis. At the Senior level, studentsare required to take an approved concentration in one of theelectrical engineering options: biomedical engineering,communications, digital systems design, control systems,electronics, microwave and antenna engineering, and powersystems. (Note: The digital systems design option in the EE program emphasizes hardware; those interested in software design aswell should consider the Computer Engineering degree.) The Computer Engineering (CompE) program bridges the curriculum gap between Computer Science and ElectricalEngineering. Computer Engineers deal with the hardware andsoftware aspects of computer system design and development.The CompE curriculum contains components of both theComputer Science and Electrical Engineering programs. Computer Engineering majors receive a broad knowledge in the basic curriculum. Among the many topics are:mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology, electrical circuits,engineering economy, algorithms, programming, and computerorganization. Computer Engineering students will takecoursework in a number of areas (i.e. computer architecture,digital design) from both the software and hardware points ofview, allowing them to get a broader, more complete exposureto the subject. Additionally, these curricula will be unified inthe one year senior design project course bringing together theexisting Electrical Engineering and Computer Science programs.The ECE department has 16 labs associated with its EE classes. In the labs, students work alongside professors who may bedesigning medical instrumentation for health care, designingmicrocontroller based applications, developing pager andsatellite communications systems, or working on innovations inelectrical power systems. All students in the EE or CompE programs take part in the department's senior design program, modeled on industrywork groups that students will encounter on the job. Likeprofessional engineers, students design and develop a project,from conception through manufacture. In the process, theygain valuable experience in working as a team, dealing withpersonalities as well as technical areas. Senior design projects have included a national intercollegiate competition in designing a micromouse and training it to runthrough a 10' square maze. Other projects include developing asophisticated stereo system, control system for satellite trackingantenna, television tuner, fabrication of hybrid circuit, etc. The School of Engineering and Computer Science offers an Honors Cooperative Program that allows juniors and seniors tocomplete their studies while holding down jobs as engineers. A student chapter of the national professional society, the Institute for Electrical and Electronics Engineers, meets oncampus. Other active organizations include Tau Beta Pi, thestudent engineering society; the Society for Women Engineers;the National Society for Black Engineers; and the Society forHispanic Professional Engineers. The Electrical Engineering program is accredited by ABET (Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology.) CAREERS: The department's practical approach to engineering offers hand's on design experience as well as theoreticalknowledge. That's an advantage on the job because graduatesactually have experience in constructing projects as well asdesigning them. Students who enjoy using math and science creatively to solve real-world problems will find rewarding careers as electricaland computer engineers.

Fox, C. T. Lin, Tom Mincer, Stewart Prince, Robert G. Ryan, SidneyH. Schwartz. EMERITUS FACULTY : Charles F. Sanders, Lester Nypan, William J. Rivers THE MAJOR : Mechanical Engineering is the design, analysis, and testing of useful devices, processes, vehicles, machines, andsystems that are primarily thermal, fluid, and/or mechanical innature. Mathematics is an important tool for those tasks, so amath aptitude is very important. So is a practical orientation.The program assumes that students have adequate high schoolpreparation in science, math, and English. The faculty andstudents are represented by diverse backgrounds. Mechanical Engineering majors at Northridge receive a solid, broad-based education during the first three years. That isfollowed by a specialized Mechanical Engineering \"seniorprogram\" taken during the senior year. The freshmen andsophomore years include courses in mathematics, chemistry,physics, computer programming, engineering skills,engineering materials, engineering mechanics, and electricalsystems. For ME students the junior year courses includeengineering economics, engineering dynamics, strength ofmaterials, thermodynamics, fluid mechanics, heat transfer,mechanical engineering design, and the numerical analysis ofengineering systems. The Mechanical Engineering senior year is composed of a group of five required courses and four or five semi-electivecourses that are related to the student's area of specializationwithin Mechanical Engineering. Those required courses aresystem dynamics, mechatronics, thermodynamics, and twosemesters of senior design. The current recommended areas ofspecialization are: aerospace engineering, automotiveengineering, controls engineering, electro-mechanicalengineering, environmental engineering, mechanical design,power engineering, and thermofluid systems. The Mechanical Engineering Department takes a practical approach to engineering, offering hands-on design experience aswell as theoretical knowledge. That's an advantage on the jobbecause our graduates have had experience constructingprojects, not just analyzing and designing them. A key to thispractical training is the department's senior design program,which is modeled on the industry work groups that studentswill encounter on the job. Like professional engineers, ourstudents design and develop a project, from conception throughmanufacture. In the process, they gain valuable experience inworking as a team, dealing with personalities as well as technicalproblems. Past senior design projects have included: humanpowered vehicles, solar powered vehicles, super mileagevehicles, reduced(half) size Baja (off-road) race cars, reduced(half) size Indianapolis-style race cars, hybrid electricautomobiles, a methanol powered automobile, a compressednatural gas powered truck, payload maximized model aircraft,and cleanup systems for petroleum polluted soil and water. Department laboratory facilities, contained in seven labs with a total floor space of over 20,000 square feet, include: a general purpose lab used as an automobile design andtesting facility; fully instrumented and computerized engine and vehicle performance and emissions test facilities including anautomobile environmental test chamber, a chassisdynamometer and several engine dynamometers; a state-of-the-art computer controlled parts manufacturing facility together with a student manualmachine shop; two wind tunnels, one for testing models at up to 200 mph and the other a Mach 2 plus supersonic windtunnel; a small rocket engine test stand in an explosion-proof test cell; a thermofluid systems lab used for heat transfer and fluid flow experiments; a controls lab used for studying automatic system control, which involves devices such as the automobilecruise control; and the Design Analysis and Simulation lab which is a computer lab containing more than 25 state-of-the-artPCs and work stations. Through student chapters of two national organizations, the Society of Automotive Engineers and the American Society ofMechanical Engineers, students can get to know more aboutthe field and each other outside of class. The mechanical engineering program is accredited by ABET, the Accrediting Board for Engineering and Technology. CAREERS : Mechanical engineers are the technical experts who design and develop such things as automobiles, engines,aircraft and space vehicles, power plants, heating and coolingsystems, gas and steam turbines, servomechanisms,transmissions, robots and manufacturing production lines.They use scientific knowledge to create new and useful designsand to harness various types of energy, such as chemical,nuclear, or thermal. Mechanical engineering is the broadest engineering speciality. A company that uses engineers at all is likely to hire somemechanical engineers. Those companies include power-generating stations, public utility companies, transportationcompanies, construction firms, airlines, missile and spacecraftcompanies, electronics companies, and the manufacturingcompanies that produce all forms of machinery, vehicles,aircraft, appliances, and many other products used by industryand/or consumers. Most Mechanical Engineering graduates become practicing engineers in industry as described above. Others, however,choose to pursue careers with government agencies oreducational institutions. The degree can also be a stepping-stone to law school for a career as a patent lawyer, or tobusiness school for careers in technical management,marketing, or sales, or even to medical school. DEPARTMENT PROGRAMS The Mechanical Engineering (ME) Department at Cal State Northridge offers Programs leading to the following two degrees: Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering (BSME) Master of Science in Engineering (MSE), Option: Mechanical Engineering302 MECHANICAL ENG INEERING 2000-2002 REQUIREMENTS FOR THE BACHELOR OF SCIENCE IN MECHANICAL ENGINEERING (BSME) DEGREE HIGH SCHOOL PREPARATION It must be emphasized that this program is based upon an expectation of adequate high school preparation in science,mathematics, and English. High school courses shouldinclude algebra, plane geometry, trigonometry, chemistry, orphysics (both desirable), and four years of English. Studentswho have not had an adequate background of pre-engineering work in high school may be required to takesome additional work in their first year and may not be ableto complete an engineering program in eight semesters.Entering beginning engineering students must take the EntryLevel Mathematics Test and the Mathematics, Chemistry, andEnglish Placement Tests before registration in basic courseswill be permitted. It is recommended that students take thesetests before they begin their studies at CSUN. PRE-REGISTRATION TESTING REQUIREMENTS The campus requires most beginning students to take theEntry Level Mathematics Exam (ELM) and the EnglishPlacement Test (EPT) prior to enrolling in their courses.Refer to the section of this catalog entitled Appendices-Admission for further details on these exams. In addition tothese general university requirements, students entering theMechanical Engineering program may also need thefollowing exams: 1. Mathematics Placement Test (MPT) is required prior to enrollment in Math 150A. Students who have passed or areexempt from the ELM should take this exam prior toenrolling in their classes so they may be placed in theappropriate mathematics course. A minimum score of 24 isrequired to enroll in Math 150A. Students with scores of 3, 4,or 5 on the AP Calculus AB or BC are exempt from the MPT. 2. Chemistry Placement Test (CPT) is required with a minimum score of 40 prior to enrolling in Chemistry 101.Students who do not receive this score must completeChemistry 105 with a grade of \"C\" or better before takingChemistry 101. An advisor will review the details of these examinations with each student before they enroll in their courses. SPECIAL GRADE REQUIREMENTS All students must pass the English Placement Test with a score of 151 or higher to enroll in any engineering courses atthe 200 level. All students must complete the lower division writing requirement before enrolling in any 300-level engineeringcourses. All students must attempt the upper division writing proficiency examination before enrolling in any 400-levelengineering courses. Senior year courses cannot be taken unless the student has previously completed, or is concurrently completing, allfreshman, sophomore, and junior year requirements. A grade of \"C-\" or better is required in all courses in the major.

The minor ingeography is described below. The M.A. program providesadvanced training leading to further graduate work ingeography, or to employment in teaching, industry, orgovernment. The Department of Geography supports the concept of international education and encourages students toinvestigate opportunities for overseas study. Certaincourses taken at CSU International Programs Study Centersin foreign countries are equivalent to courses in theDepartment of Geography and may be used to fulfill someof the requirements for degree options offered by theDepartment and/or certain general education requirements.Students should consult the International Programs Bulletinavailable in the Office of International and ExchangePrograms, a departmental advisor, or the campusInternational Programs Advisor for more information. THE MAJOR Geography studies the areal and developmental patterns inthe physical and human environment. Given thisperspective, geographers are especially interested inexplaining the processes and interrelationships which createthese patterns. Consequently, the subject matter of thediscipline is wide ranging and includes many aspects ofculture and environment.

ACADEMIC ADVISEMENT : Geology majors, both undergraduate and graduate, must be advised each semester before beingpermitted to enroll in classes through Touch ToneRegistration (TTR). Undergraduate students must see Dr.Pedone and graduate students must see Dr. Tabidian foradvisement. THE MAJOR: Geology is a multidisciplinary science that applies the concepts of biology, chemistry, physics, mathematics,and engineering to the natural world around us. The richvariety of its fields of study includes oceanography,paleontology, geophysics, geochemistry, hydrogeology,engineering geology, and more. That is what makesgeology an exciting and challenging major for students withbroad scientific interests and a love for our natural systems,environment, and our planet's history. Geology majors gain basic scientific observational, reasoning, and communication skills and an understanding of geologicalconcepts and history. This blend of interpretive scientificability and historical perspective gives geologists animportant role in society. They apply their skills andknowledge to solve complex problems related to humaninteraction with natural systems, hazards, and resources andto communicate solutions and options to the public. LEARNING OUTCOMES: Undergraduate majors will receive instruction of sufficient breadth, depth, and currency toprepare them for successful appointment to entry-levelprofessional work or graduate school. At the time ofgraduation, they will have learned a) background knowledgeof earth materials, processes, and history; b) skills in standardgeological laboratory and field data-gathering and data-analysis methods; c) how to identify geologic problems anddevelop testable hypotheses that would aid in their solutionin both independent and collaborative modes; and d) how topresent polished summaries, both written and oral, of theirgeological discoveries. CAREERS: Many job opportunities are available to geology graduates with a bachelor's degree. Opportunities existmainly in private industry in engineering geology(evaluating sites for homes, commercial buildings,highways, tunnels, etc.), environmental geology(environmental impact studies, evaluation and remediationof contaminated sites), and hydrogeology (development andquality control of ground water resources). Geologists are also employed in the discovery andextraction of earth resources, such as oil, gas, coal, and metallic and non-metallic resources. Besides private industry, all levels of government-city, county, state, and federal-employ geologists for regulatoryand oversight (inspection and monitoring) activities. A degree in geology or earth science (offered in conjunction with the Geography Department) is excellent backgroundfor teaching physical science at the secondary school leveland (for those with the M.S. degree) at the communitycollege level. The B.S. degree also offers excellent preparation for graduate school, either at Cal State Northridge or at othernationwide universities. Graduate study prepares studentsfor those careers listed above and for governmental researchjobs and university teaching and research. DEPARTMENT PROGRAMS : The Department offers the B.S. and M.S. in Geology and a minor in Geology. For the B.S.degree, four options are available: Geology (Option I),Geophysics (Option II), Environmental Geology (Option III),and Secondary Teaching (Option IV). An Earth Science B.A.degree is offered in conjunction with the Department ofGeography (see the Earth Science section of this Catalog).The major in geology is designed for students who (1) desirea liberal arts education with emphasis on geology; (2) wishto prepare for graduate work in geology, geophysics,environmental geology, or related fields; (3) wish to pursuecareers in geology, geophysics, environmental geology, orrelated fields; or (4) wish to teach geological sciences orphysical science in secondary schools. Students planning aprofessional career in geology or earth science shouldprepare for graduate study; a Master's degree is normallyrequired for professional advancement. The geology major assumes a high school background in chemistry and mathematics (algebra through trigonometry).A satisfactory score on the Chemistry Placement Test isrequired as prerequisite to CHEM 101, 101L. Satisfactoryscores on the Entry Level Mathematics Exam andMathematics Placement Test are required as prerequisite toMATH 255A or 150A and to PHYS 100A, 100AL. Studentsnot having this preparation will need additional coursework in deficient subject areas. The objectives of the Master of Science program in geology are: (1) to train individuals with the competence required bythe geological profession for employment in industry andgovernment agencies; (2) to enable promising students toattain a level of knowledge and research ability required foradmission to a Ph.D. program at other universities; (3) toprovide an M.S. program with basic course work andresearch requirements for students planning to teachgeology at the community college level. A minor in Geology is designed for students interested in the Earth, but with a major in another department.Biologists, engineers, mathematicians, and physicists arefinding employment in environmental and energy-relatedindustries. For these majors, the Geology minor broadensthe individual's background and competence in the earthsciences.

Additionaladvisement is available by appointment throughout thesemester. Individual advisors are assigned to all majors; it isrecommended that during the first semester as a major, eachstudent request assignment to an advisor. This request shouldbe initiated in the department office. LIBERAL STUDIES AND CHILD DEVELOPMENT ADVISEMENT : Interdisciplinary Students: Tami Abourezk, Terry GRADUATE ADVISOR : Graduate Coordinator: Tommie White. Advisors are assigned in accordance with student's specialinterest area. DEGREES OFFERED : B.S. and M.S. THE MAJOR : The word kinesiology comes from the Greek, kinesis , which means \"to move\". Kinesiology is the study of the artand science of human movement. At California StateUniversity, Northridge, the discipline of Kinesiology isdedicated to the study of human movement as it relates tosport, dance, and exercise. CAREERS : Kinesiology has many practical applications and leads to a variety of rewarding careers such as teachingphysical education or dance, teaching physical education,coaching, serving as a consultant in the commercial healthand fitness industry, working in a clinical health setting,athletic training, or working independently as a personaltrainer. Many kinesiology majors become involved inscientific research or go on to advanced study in medicine,chiropractic, physical therapy, nursing, exercise physiology,biomechanics, motor learning and behavior, motorprograms for special populations, sports psychology orpedagogy. Some graduates become coaches for professionalteams or work in business environments dealing with sportsmanagement and marketing. Others pursue careers indance therapy or professional dance, or physical activitiesfor individuals with disabilities. The current societal interest in wellness and fitness programs and the 1996 Surgeon General's Report onPhysical Activity and Health has led both individuals andcorporations to stress preventive as well as interventivecare. Because kinesiology students understand the role ofmovement in wellness, they have become important toinnovations toward better health.Graduates of kinesiology programs work with people in all stages of life - with children and with seniors, with the ablebodied and those with disabilities, with elite performers andthose of ordinary capability. DEPARTMENT PROGRAMS : Undergraduate students may select one of the following options: (1) Physical Education, (2)Exercise Science, (3) Athletic Training, (4) Dance, or (5)General Studies. Graduate Study - The Department offers a program that leads to a Master of Science Degree. The Department of Kinesiology supports the concept of international education and encourages students toinvestigate opportunities for overseas study. Certain coursestaken at CSU International Program Study Centers inforeign countries are equivalent to courses in theDepartment of Kinesiology and may be used to fulfill someof the requirements for degree options offered by theDepartment and/or certain general education requirements.Students should consult the International Programs Bulletinavailable in the Office of International and ExchangePrograms, a departmental advisor, or the campusInternational Programs Advisor for more information.

Testingas well as instruction and supervised practice areincluded in the KIN 250 and 242 and 244 classes. Furtherinformation is available in the Kinesiology StudentHandbook and at the Kinesiology main office. Studentsmay repeat exams in efforts to improve their scores. Successful completion of a professional activities course in the major program at an accredited college oruniversity with a grade of C or better will be creditedwith a 2.0 score unless the student achieves a higherscore on a movement proficiency examination at CSUN. Students with outstanding skill in sports other than those listed above may request the substitution of thatsport in one of the three sport groups. It is theresponsibility of the student to provide the KinesiologyDepartment with evidence of proficiency. Aerobics,personal training, power lifting and other fitness-relatedcategories will not satisfy this requirement because theydo not fit into the sports category and therefore may not be considered for substitution credit.

Bishop COLLEGE OF HUMANITIES Program Office: Jerome Richfield Hall 240 Administrative Coordinator: Guadalupe DiazPhone: Sare, and Tsuji PROGRAM COMMITTEE : Naomi Bishop, George Dunne, Arlinda Eaton, Janice Eckmier, Sharon Klein, Joe Lewis, Evelyn McClave, Gerald Resendez, SueSears, Gerry Simila, James Sobredo, Ann Watkins DEGREE OFFERED : B. A. THE MAJOR : The Liberal Studies program is a broad undergraduate liberal arts major leading to the B.A. degree.It is an interdisciplinary major with a balance of studies inthe language arts, natural sciences, mathematics, socialsciences, humanities, visual arts, and performing arts.Courses are drawn from course offerings by departmentsthroughout the university. There are three Liberal Studies degree options, two for stu- dents preparing to be elementary teachers and one for stu- dents who seek a general liberal arts program. OPTIONONE---PRE-CREDENTIAL OPTION, is designed for stu-dents who anticipate a career in elementary school teachingand plan to seek a post-baccalaureate teaching credential.OPTION TWO - INTEGRATED TEACHER EDUCATIONPROGRAM, is a structured cohort program that begins inthe freshman year and prepares students for careers in ele- mentary school or special education teaching. This option integrates mastery of subject matter and pedagogy through-out the four years leading to a BA degree in Liberal Studiesawarded simultaneously with either a Multiple SubjectCredential (CLAD Emphasis) or a Level I PreliminaryEducation Specialist Credential (Mild/ModerateDisabilities). Students must be eligible for GE writing and mathematics in order to be accepted into the Integrated Pro- gram. Students will remain with their cohort throughouttheir four-year program of study, which includes summerclasses. OPTION THREE---GENERAL STUDIES, isdesigned for students interested in a broad liberal arts edu-cation with studies in many subject areas rather than con-centrating on one field of study. Students selecting Option Three may be interested in pursuing careers in business, law, government, social services, non-profit services, arts,and many other careers. All Options are comprehensivemajors and incorporate nearly all requirements for the B.A.degree. While students in other majors complete the univer-sity requirements for GENERAL EDUCATION and TITLE Voutside the major, Liberal Studies majors incorporate theirGENERAL EDUCATION and TITLE V requirements as part of the major. The Liberal Studies Program supports the concept of inter- national education and encourages students to investigate opportunities for overseas study. Certain courses taken at CSU International Program Study Centers in foreign coun-tries are equivalent to courses in the Liberal StudiesProgram and may be used to fulfill some of the require- ments for the major. Students should consult theInternational Program Bulletin available in the Office ofInternational and Exchange Program, a Liberal Studies advi-sor, or the campus International Program Advisor for moreinformation. CAREERS : Options One and Two are designed for students interested in teaching children in Grades K through 6.Students taking Option One will need to seek a post- baccalaureate teaching credential after completing their B.A.degree in Liberal Studies. Students taking Option Two will earn their credential at the same time as their Liberal StudiesB.A. degree and will be ready to enter a school classroomupon graduation. Students in Option Two have the choice of either a Preliminary Multiple Subject Credential (CLADEmphasis) for elementary classroom teaching or a Level IPreliminary Education Specialist Credential with aspecialization in Mild/Moderate Disabilities for teachingspecial education students. Option Two is designed for students who are certain about their career choice whenthey begin college, have college-ready skills in writing andmathematics, and are able to remain in an intensivecohorted program for four years plus some summers. Option Three: General Studies leads to a variety of career options such as business, government, human services andalmost any career requiring a liberal arts degree. Studentsin Option Three often pursue graduate degrees in Law, Public Administration, Business Administration, and withsupplemental courses, Medicine. Students interested inOption Three should discuss academic and career planning with their Liberal Studies Advisor. ACADEMIC ADVISEMENT : Advisement is a critical part of the Liberal Studies Program. In order to complete the major inthe most efficient manner, students should see an advisorearly in their programs. Transfer students from communitycolleges and other universities should seek advisementbefore they transfer. CSUN students should see an advisoras soon as they begin to consider a Liberal Studies major. APPOINTMENTS NEEDED: Advisors are generally available by appointment only. Please call (818) 667-3300 to schedule anappointment. Walk-in appointments and telephoneconsultations are reserved for emergencies. APPROVAL OF TRANSFER COURSES AND COURSE SUBSTITUTIONS: Students must obtain approval from an advisor in order to substitute courses from other universitiesor community colleges for courses in the major or tosubstitute a CSUN course for those prescribed in the major.Please see an advisor before selecting a course not alreadyapproved for the major. FILING FOR GRADUATION: See an advisor at least three semesters before you plan to graduate. A graduationchecklist is available from the Liberal Studies office. OPTION ONE: PRE-CREDENTIAL LIBERAL STUDIES Option One is designed for students interested in careers as elementary school teachers. Traditionally, elementaryschool teachers function in self-contained classrooms andteach a variety of subjects. The Liberal Studies major pro-vides students with a broad undergraduate education toprepare them to teach \"multiple subjects,\" a term used byteacher credential programs. Therefore, students take cours-es in the language arts, natural sciences, mathematics, social408 LIBERAL STUDIES 2000-2002sciences, humanities, visual arts, and performing arts. By the end of the degree program students have a founda-tion of basic knowledge in all of these areas of study. COMPLETING THE ELEMENTARY SUBJECT MATTER PREPARATION PROGRAM FOR ELEMENTARY SCHOOL TEACH-ING Students interested in teaching at the elementary school level and qualifying for student teaching or earning a pre-liminary teaching credential from the State of Californiamust demonstrate subject matter competence in the areas typically taught during the elementary school years. Students may demonstrate their subject matter competenceby either completing an approved Elementary SubjectMatter Preparation Program, like the California StateUniversity, Northridge Liberal Studies Program'sElementary Subject Matter Preparation Program, or by pass-ing a standard test known as the Multiple SubjectsAssessment for Teachers (MSAT) test given by the State of California. To complete the California State University, Northridge Elementary Subject Matter Preparation Programyou must complete all the requirements for the B.A. degreein Liberal Studies and meet a set of additional requirements.Only completing the requirements for the B.A. will not meetthe requirements of the Elementary Subject MatterPreparation Program. Please see an advisor for information on the requirements necessary to complete the California State University, Northridge Elementary Subject MatterPreparation Program. OPTION TWO: INTEGRATED TEACHER EDUCATION PROGRAM Students enter the Integrated Teacher Education Program (ITEP) in their freshman semester and remain with this stu- dent cohort throughout the entire degree program. The pro- gram is carefully designed as an approved ElementarySubject Matter Preparation Program. It fulfills the GeneralEducation and Title V requirements for a baccalaureatedegree from CSUN. Students must complete all require-ments for the B.A. degree as well as meet assessmentrequirements for determining subject matter competence in order to receive certification of subject matter competency as required by the California Commission on TeacherCredentialing. Completing the requirements for the B.A.alone will not result in subject matter certification. The ITEP is also designed to meet the requirements for a Multiple Subject Preliminary Credential (CLAD Emphasis) ora Level I Preliminary Education Specialist Credential(Mild/Moderate Disabilities). Students who successfullycomplete the assessment requirements for subject mattercompetency and meet all additional requirements for the cre- dential will be recommended for a preliminary credential. Students in ITEP should consult with their advisor for infor- mation on all requirements in the program. Students who are unable to remain with the cohort may remain a Liberal Studies major by changing to Option One orThree . COURSE REQUIREMENTS All Liberal Studies Options incorporate the requirements for GENERAL EDUCATION, TITLE V, and LOWER DIVISIONWRITING REQUIREMENT.

THE MAJOR : Linguistics studies human language, seeking to define the nature of human language, to establish itsrelationship to human thought, to discover what distinguisheshuman language from other forms of communication -- human and non-human, to understand how children develop alanguage and acquire additional ones, to understand the waysin which languages may differ from one another, and todescribe how human beings use language, in context, to engagein all the activities also deemed \"human.\" The Linguistics Major is presently an Upper Division Major; there are no Lower Division required courses. Students areencouraged to complete their Lower Division GE work and topursue study in languages other than their native language inpreparation for their work in Linguistics. Entering freshmenwho are interested in Linguistics should consult with theCoordinator/Advisor.

Students choosing theOptional Major in philosophy are especially urged toconsult the Academic Advisor in order to plan a sequence ofcourses suited to their intellectual interests and goals. THE MAJOR: The characteristic activity of philosophy, from its beginning to the present day, has been reasoned reflectionabout ourselves, our world, the good life, and our relationswith one another. Philosophy deals with issues offundamental human importance: e.g., the scope and limitsof human knowledge, the nature of reality and truth, what itmeans to be a person, the relation of mind to body, thesources of value and obligation, the evaluation of socialinstitutions and practices, and the nature of logic and correctreasoning. The philosophy major is designed to acquaintstudents with the distinctive nature of philosophical activityand to help them think critically about such matters offundamental philosophical concern. CAREERS: Teaching at a university or college is the long-term career goal of most students who wish to pursue philosophyas a profession, and the skills and training one receives as aphilosophy student are valuable in many other careers aswell. A degree in philosophy can be evidence toprospective employers that one is capable of creative andanalytic thinking and is proficient in reasoning, problem-solving, and written and verbal communication. Philosophystudents have successfully transferred their philosophicbackgrounds and skills to many fields, including business,law, politics, theology, secondary education, social workand counseling, the health professions, computertechnology, journalism, editing and publishing, andgovernment service. A major or minor in philosophy can beespecially useful to students seeking entry into professionalprograms in these areas and many others. (Philosophymajors tend to do well on such pre-professional tests as theGraduate Record Exam and the Law School AdmissionsTest.) The study of philosophy can also be intenselysatisfying for its own sake: it enhances ones ability to enjoyand pursue a lifetime of learning, self-expression, andexchange and debate of ideas concerning ourselves and themeaning of our existence.REQUIREMENTS FOR THE BACHELOR OF ARTS DEGREE STANDARD MAJOR (39-40 UNITS) The Standard Major includes the following basic and advanced programs.

PROCEDURE FOR THE ESTABLISHMENT OR ABOLISHMENT OF A STUDENT BODY FEE The law governing The California State University providesthat fees defined as mandatory, such as a student body association fee and a student body center fee, may be established. A student body association fee must be established upon a favorable vote of two-thirds of thestudents voting in an election held for this purpose(Education Code, Section 89300). A student body center fee may be established only after a fee referendum is heldwhich approves by a two-thirds vote the establishment ofthe fee (Education Code, Section 89304). The student body fee was established at CSUN by student referendum on May 5,1958. The campus president may adjust the student body association fee only after the fee adjustment has beenapproved by a majority of students voting in a referendum established for that purpose (Education Code, Section89300). The required fee shall be subject to referendum atany time upon the presentation of a petition to the campuspresident containing the signatures of 10% of the regularlyenrolled students at the University. Once bonds are issued,authority to set and adjust student body center fees is governed by provisions of the State University RevenueBond Act of 1947: Education Code, Sections 90012, 90027,and 90068. Student body fees support a variety of cultural and recreational programs, childcare centers,a nd specialstudent support programs. The process to establish and adjust other mandatory fees requires consideration by the campus fee advisorycommittee. A student referendum also is required. Thecampus president may use alternate consultationmechanisms if he/she determines that a referendum is notthe best mechanism to achieve appropriate and meaningfulconsultation. Results of the referendum and the feecommittee review are advisory to the campus president. Thepresident may request the chancellor to establish themandatory fee. Authority to adjust fees after considerationby the campus fee advisory committee and the completionof a student referendum is delegated to the president. AVERAGE ANNUAL COST OF EDUCATION AND SOURCES OF FUNDS PER FULL-TIME EQUIVALENT STUDENT The 23 campuses and the Chancellor's Office of TheCalifornia State University are financed primarily throughfunding provided by the taxpayers of California. The totalstate appropriation to the CSU for 1999/2000 (includingcapital outlay funding in the amount of $260,033,000) is$2,252,941,000. However, the total cost of education for CSUis $3,015,710,000, which must provide support for a projected279,403 full-time equivalent students (FTES). The number offull-time equivalent students is determined by dividing thetotal academic student load by 15 units per term (the figureused here to define a full-time student's academic load). The total cost of education in the CSU is defined as the expenditures for current operations, including paymentsmade to the students in the form of financial aid, and all fullyreimbursed programs contained in state appropriations, butexcluding capital outlay appropriations and lottery funds.The average cost of education is determined by dividing thetotal cost by the total FTES. The average cost is furtherdifferentiated into three categories: State Support (the stateappropriation, excluding capital outlay), Student Fee Support,and Support from Other Sources (including federal funds). Thus, excluding costs that relate to capital outlay, the average cost of education per FTE student is $10,793. Of this amount,the average student fee support per FTE is $1,830. (The StateUniversity Fee, application fee, and nonresident tuition areincluded in the average costs paid by the students; individualstudents may pay less or more than $1,830, depending onwhether they are part-time, full-time, resident, or nonresidentstudents.)

Every act of theft or the issuance of a worthless document is a burden that falls upon the whole community, if in no otherway, imposing an expense to the general public. This burdenis magnified in the educational community where everyadditional expense is a real sacrifice to those involved ineducation. Moreover, such actions are an antithesis to what isexpected of a campus community. Since it would be less thanrealistic to assume that these acts would not occur oncampus, it is necessary that the educational community adoptthose practices which society has developed to protect itself. California State University, Northridge shall employ those measures available to it under California laws andUniversity policy to prosecute for theft and the issuance ofworthless documents. Such measures include the utilizationof Section 1719 of the California Civil Code (AB 1226) whichpermits the recipient of a bad check to recover the amountowing upon such check plus three times its face value up toa limit of $500 in a court of competent jurisdiction.

Theprovisions of Sections 89538 to 89540, inclusive, shall beapplicable to any state university or college employeedismissed pursuant to this section. The chief administrativeofficer of each such institution shall submit periodic reportsas to the nature and disposition of cases acted uponpursuant to this section to his governing board. ACADEMIC DISHONESTY The maintenance of academic integrity and qualityeducation is the responsibility of each student within thisuniversity and the California State University system.Cheating or plagiarism in connection with an academicprogram at a campus is listed in Section 41301, Title 5,California Code of Regulations, as an offense for which astudent may be expelled, suspended, or given a less severedisciplinary sanction. Academic dishonesty is an especially serious offense and diminishes the quality of scholarship and defrauds thosewho depend upon the integrity of the campus programs.Such dishonesty includes: A. CHEATING Intentionally using or attempting to use unauthorizedmaterials, information, or study aids in any academicexercise. Comments: 1. Faculty members are encouraged to state in advance their policies and procedures concerning examinationsand other academic exercises as well as the use beforeexaminations of shared study aids, examination files,and other related materials and forms of assistance. 2. Students completing any examination should assume that external assistance (e.g., books, notes, calculators,conversation with others) is prohibited unlessspecifically authorized by the instructor. 3. Students must not allow others to conduct research or prepare any work for them without advance 552 APPENDICES-NONDISCRIMINATION AND STUDENT CONDUCT 2000-2002authorization from the instructor. This comment includes, but is not limited to, the services ofcommercial term paper companies. 4. Substantial portions of the same academic work may not be submitted for credit in more than one coursewithout authorization. B. FABRICATION Intentional falsification or invention of any informationor citation in an academic exercise. Comments: 1. \"Invented'' information may not be used in any laboratory experiment or other academic exercisewithout notice to and authorization from theinstructor. It would be improper, for example, toanalyze one sample in an experiment and covertly\"invent'' data based on that single experiment forseveral more required analyses. 2. One should acknowledge reliance upon the actual source from which cited information was obtained.For example, a writer should not reproduce aquotation from a book review and indicate that thequotation was obtained from the book itself. 3. Students who attempt to alter and resubmit returned academic work with intent to defraud the facultymember will be in violation of this section. Forexample, a student may not change an answer on areturned exam and then claim that they deserveadditional credit. C. FACILITATING ACADEMIC DISHONESTY Intentionally or knowingly helping or attempting to helpanother to commit an act of academic dishonesty. Comments: For example, one who knowingly allowed another tocopy from his or her paper during an examination wouldbe in violation of this section. D. PLAGIARISM Intentionally or knowingly representing the words, ideas,or work of another as one's own in any academic exercise. Comments: 1. Direct Quotation: Every direct quotation must be identified by quotation marks, or by appropriateindentation or by other means of identification, andmust be promptly cited in a footnote. Proper footnotestyle for any academic department is outlined by theMLA Style Sheet or K. L. Turabian's A Manual for Writers of Term Papers, Theses and Dissertations . These and similar publications are available in the MatadorBookstore and at the reference desk of the OviattLibrary. 2. Paraphrase: Prompt acknowledgment is required when material from another source is paraphrased orsummarized in whole or in part in your own words.To acknowledge a paraphrase properly, one mightstate: \"to paraphrase Locke's comment . . .'' andconclude with a footnote identifying the exactreference. A footnote acknowledging only a directlyquoted statement does not suffice to notify the readerof any preceding or succeeding paraphrased material. 3. Borrowed Facts or Information: Information obtained in one's reading or research which is not commonknowledge among students in the course must beacknowledged. Examples of common knowledgemight include the names of leaders of prominentnations, basic scientific laws, etc.Materials which contribute only to one's general understanding of the subject may be acknowledged inthe bibliography and need not be immediatelyfootnoted. One footnote is usually sufficient toacknowledge indebtedness when a number ofconnected sentences in the paper draw their specialinformation from one source. When direct quotationsare used, however, quotation marks must be insertedand prompt acknowledgment is required. FACULTY POLICY ON ACADEMIC DISHONESTY Evaluation of student performance is the exclusive provinceof the faculty. The faculty have the responsibility to makereasonable efforts to guarantee that work is done by thestudent who is to receive credit for its completion. Morespecifically, examinations should be appropriately proctoredor monitored to prevent students from copying orexchanging information; examinations and answers toexamination questions should be secured in a way thatstudents cannot have prior access to them; the authenticityof quotations and references should be reviewed to assurethe faculty member that proper credit is given for ideas andinformation taken from other sources, etc. Having carried outthese responsibilities if, in the faculty member's opinion, thereis evidence of academic dishonesty on the part of a student, itis the faculty member's responsibility to take action againstthe student as described in the options below. Even if a faculty member does not request disciplinary action against a student, he/she is encouraged to report actsof academic dishonesty to the Office of the Vice Presidentfor Student Affairs because a student may engage in suchbehavior in other classes, departments, or schools. If reportsof alleged academic dishonesty do not reach one centraloffice, repeated acts may go undetected and recidivism willbe difficult or impossible to monitor. Communication withthe Office of the Vice President for Student Affairs may alsoassist the faculty member in determining which option orcombination of options to exercise. Depending upon the severity of the offense and the student's disciplinary history as it relates to acts of academicdishonesty, the faculty member may elect to exercise thefollowing options: 1. Assign a lower or failing grade to an assignment, examination, or the entire course. In cases in which thefaculty member elects to exercise the grade penaltyoption, the faculty member must inform the student ina timely manner that academic dishonesty was a factorin the evaluation. In cases where the sanction for an actof academic dishonesty has been the assignment of agrade penalty without a simultaneous request forformal disciplinary action and in which the studentwishes to challenge the grade penalty assigned, thestudent may file an appeal with the AcademicGrievance and Grade Appeals Board. 2. Request that the Office of the Vice President for Student Affairs notify the student that information related tothe student's alleged act of academic dishonesty withinthat particular class has been forwarded to theAssistant Vice President for Student Life. Suchnotifications are in the form of an admonitory letter andserve to inform the student that the Office of the VicePresident for Student Affairs is aware of the allegedincident and that formal disciplinary action will not betaken. The admonitory letter also apprises the studentof the Student Conduct Code and of sanctions that 2000-2002 APPEN DICES-NONDISCR IMINATION AND STUDENT CONDUCT 553would be levied for violations of that code, and affords the student an opportunity to meet with the AssistantVice President for Student Life to discuss the matter.The admonitory letter shall not be released for anypurpose and shall not become part of the student'spermanent record. 3. Request disciplinary action against the student. Student discipline is exclusively the province of the Office of theVice President for Student Affairs. In such cases, thefaculty member through the department chair andschool dean should submit a formal written report ofthe incident to the Assistant Vice President for StudentLife and request formal disciplinary action. TheAssistant Vice President for Student Life is empoweredto investigate all instances of academic dishonesty. Thecases are resolved either through an appropriate actionaccepted by the student or through a disciplinaryhearing. The faculty member, department chair, andschool dean will be notified of the final disposition ofthe case. In cases where the faculty member choosesboth to impose a grade penalty and requests formalstudent disciplinary action against the student and thestudent wishes to challenge the grade penalty, thestudent may file an appeal with the AcademicGrievance and Grade Appeals Board only after thestudent disciplinary case has been fully adjudicated bythe Assistant Vice President for Student Life. PENALTIES Section 41301, Title 5, California Code of Regulations,aspublished in the University Catalog, provides that a studentmay be expelled, suspended, placed on probation or given alesser sanction for a proven violation of the StudentConduct Code. Among the violations listed in Section 41301cheating or plagiarism in connection with an academicprogram is specifically included. Disciplinary records of any action of academic dishonesty are retained in the Office of the Vice President for StudentAffairs for at least five years from the date of finaladjudication. These records may be available to prospectiveemployers and other educational institutions, in accordancewith federal and state regulations. In short, a studentcommitting any act of academic dishonesty will run aserious risk of harming his or her future educational oremployment opportunities. (The information in section I, III, and IV are adapted with permission from the brochure on Academic Dishonesty issued by the University of Maryland[1980]. Section II is taken from the Academic Dishonesty Policy approved bythe Faculty Senate, May 13, 1982.) ASSISTANT VICE PRESIDENT FOR STUDENT LIFE Students wishing to report an act of academic dishonestyshould call (818) 677-2391 and ask for the Assistant VicePresident for Student Life. The Assistant Vice President willinvestigate such reports. Information may be providedanonymously; disciplinary action, however, cannot be takenon the basis of anonymous reports alone. ACADEMIC GRIEVANCES AND GRADE APPEALS The University provides procedures for the orderlyprocessing of grievances by students against members of thefaculty, and for the appeal of assigned grades. Establishedby the Faculty Senate, these procedures are contained in theAcademic Grievance and Grade Appeals Board Bylaws. TheBoard is empowered to act upon grievances and appealswhich are properly filed.Academic grievances may be filed when a student feels aggrieved in (non-grade) matters concerning an academicdecision, action or judgment by a faculty member. A gradeappeal may be filed when a student believes a grade isbased on error, violation of University rule or policy, refusalby the instructor to report a grade, discrimination or otherimproper conduct towards the student. Grade appeals basedwholly or in part on a subjective or qualitative judgment ofan instructor will not be considered by the Board. Students should attempt to resolve matters informally with the faculty member prior to filing an academic grievance orgrade appeal. Students should also seek the review of theappropriate department chair and school dean or designee.If the matter cannot be resolved in this manner, the studentmay file a formal grievance or grade appeal. The grievanceor appeal must be presented in writing before the end of thesemester following the semester in which the matteroccurred or the grade was assigned. Information and forms for filing an academic grievance or grade appeal may be obtained from the Office of the VicePresident for Student Affairs or by calling (818) 677-2391.

Up to eight semesters of honors courses taken in the last two years of high school can be accepted. Each unit of A in anhonors course will receive a total of 5 points; B, 4 points;and C, 3 points. You can calculate the index by multiplying your grade point average by 800 and adding your total score on the SAT I.Or, if you took the ACT, multiply your grade point averageby 200 and add ten times the ACT composite score. If youare a California high school graduate (or a resident ofCalifornia for tuition purposes), you need a minimum indexof 2900 using the SAT I or 694 using the ACT; the EligibilityIndex Table illustrates several combinations of required testscores and averages. If you neither graduated from a California high school nor are a resident of California for tuition purposes, you need aminimum index of 3502 (SAT I) or 842 (ACT). If your grade point average is 3.00 or above (3.61 for nonresidents), you are exempt from submitting test scores.However, you are urged to take the SAT I or ACT sincecampuses use test results for advising and placementpurposes.

The Office of GeneralCounsel may make a decision on the issue, or it may send thematter back to the campus for further review. Studentsclassified incorrectly as residents or incorrectly granted anexception from nonresident tuition are subject toreclassification as nonresidents and payment of nonresidenttuition in arrears. If incorrect classification results from falseor concealed facts, the student is subject to disciplinepursuant to Section 41301 of Title 5 of the California Code ofRegulations. Resident students who become nonresidents,and nonresident students qualifying for exceptions whosebasis for so qualifying changes, must immediately notify theAdmissions Office. Applications for a change in classificationwith respect to a previous term are not accepted. The student is cautioned that this summation of rules regarding residency determination is by no means acomplete explanation of their meaning. The student shouldalso note that changes may have been made in the rate ofnonresident tuition, in the statutes, and in the regulationsbetween the time this catalog is published and the relevantresidence determination date. HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS PROGRAM Students still enrolled in high school will be considered forenrollment in certain special programs if recommended bythe principal and the appropriate campus department chairand if preparation is equivalent to that required of eligibleCalifornia high school graduates.
