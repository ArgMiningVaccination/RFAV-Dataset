I took my grandmother to church at the age of 5, and at 6, I would preach the word of God to whoever would listen. My whole life I have had psychic visions and intuitive experiences that would guide me throughout my life. In adulthood, I pursued various modalities of energy healing and studied countless tools and techniques acquired through 17+ years as a student of Spirit/God/Divine Awareness. It is through endless hours of meditation and dedication that I have been able to channel all that I teach now. And After years of initiations, one after the other, I have been able to reconnect with my multidimensional Self, Galactic Self, Goddess Self, Angelic Self, and Higher Self, all within this lifetime. I am now dedicated to supporting individuals in reclaiming their Sovereignty and Power and embodying their Soul Divine Essence. As the founder of The Divine Temple Sanctuary and The Mysterious Arts and Sciences of High Alchemy School, I mentor Spiritual Seers who want to overcome energetic blocks, have radical transformation in their lives, heal their traumas, and embody high consciousness. My mission is to help you crack open to a spiritual relationship of your understanding so that you can experience the joy, love, and power that is your birthright!

I knew from the moment I reached out to NamShakti it was time for me to evolve... in so many ways I've become the person I am truly meant to be. I have been through so many transitions while attending The Spiritual Training courses it gave me the means to discover new spiritual insights, a greater awareness, and most importantly recognize the true meaning of life. During the hardest period of my life, NamShakti was there to guide me every step of the way.. She was more than a mentor, practitioner therapist, she was a friend, a sister...I deeply admire and respect her for being a part of my path. With The Spiritual Training courses, I have discovered meditation and that alone has impacted my life drastically. It is a wonderful life- tool that has provided me the opportunity to view life differently.
