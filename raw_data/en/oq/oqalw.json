We do this through coalition building, thought leadership, and conducting science-based analysis. Our Guiding Principles The Energy Futures Initiative advances solutions to the climate crisis through coalition building, thought leadership, science-based analysis, and clear communication on realistic pathways to accelerate the energy transition. Analyze Convene Propose Explain Our Impact I want to thank NASEO, the Energy Futures Initiative, and Secretary Moniz, for heroically stepping up when it became clear that the previous administration didn't plan to meet their obligation.... It's because of you that we know just how much the energy sector, especially clean energy, has grown in recent years.Jennifer Granholm U.S. Secretary of Energy We must put technology innovation at the center of the response to climate change, and without a decade of supercharged innovation we won't get to the goal of reducing the warming of the planet.Ernest J. Moniz. EFI Founder and CEO The work being done by the team at the Energy Futures Initiative on deep decarbonization is incredibly important to what we are working towards in Congress.Rep. Paul Tonko D-NY-20th The climate crisis is the existential issue of our time, and solving it begins by communicating clearly to the widest possible audience the urgency of the challenge\u2014along with identifying solutions we can deploy quickly.David Ellis Vice President of Strategic Communications, EFI Powerful Partnerships EFI brings stakeholders together to preserve and create 21st Century energy jobs, craft policies that accelerate the pace of energy innovation, and open pathways to unlock the trillions of dollars in capital needed to fund the energy transition. Our partners include the Bipartisan Policy Center, ClimateWorks, the Linden Trust for Conservation, S&P Global, Breakthrough Energy, the National Association of State Energy Officials (NASEO), and the AFL-CIO. Join Our Team The Energy Futures Initiative is growing\u2014we are looking for people who embrace science-based solutions to the climate crisis.
