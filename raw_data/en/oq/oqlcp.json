In 2020, all regions around the world will suffer a contractionGrowth projections: rebound may not be recovery Recovery after the crises : After the GFC, a large increase in global and regional GDP growth occurred right away, with only advanced countries experiencing a sluggish bounce back In contrast, the recovery for 2021 is projected to be much less strong , regaining only a fraction of what was lost Countries that experience a larger contraction in 2020 are projected to have larger expansions during 2021 Projected GDP Growth Contraction and Recovery for the Pandemic Crisis Sources: World Bank 2020 Global Economic Prospects, June; World Bank 2020 World Development Indicators; IMF 2020 World Econom ic Outlook The constraints and drivers of recoveryThe inescapable facts shaping therecovery Negative external shock will lingerPre-existing conditions matter Public health concerns will remain paramount oEconomic activity will remain depressed as long as the threat of the disease is present oSmart mitigation strategies can minimize losses , but many government have failed to implement themThe inescapable facts shaping therecovery Public health concerns will remain paramountNegative external shock will lingerPre-existing conditions matter oThe global response has been chaotic and uncoordinated oInternational borders are likely to remain restricted oEconomic activity will stay low and volatile External exposure and the impact of the pandemic shock Negative impact of the shockInitial exposureTrade disruptions lead to lower export receipts...

It can lead to repeated waves of the pandemic It can result in large fiscal deficits without a significant and steady increase in economic activityWhy would the pursuit of a quick recovery be misguided? It may transform emergency measures into regular practice : loss of central bank autonomy, lax financial regulatory policy, industrial policy?Beyond quick recovery, long -term resilience as a goal Human Capital Physical Capital ProductivityWhat does long - term resilience require? Children need to go back to school safely Support vulnerable families High quality public investment Fiscal moderation Policy certainty Avoid unnecessary business closures Facilitate online business practices Conclusion: Leveraging the Crisis to Promote Necessary Reforms Improve access to and quality of public health care Promote digital transformation in schools, businesses, and governmentImprove the coverage and adequacy of social protection Extend financial inclusion to elderly, rural, and poor people Expand labor and business formalization ReformsRecovery from the Pandemic Crisis: Balancing Short -Term Concerns.pdf Thanks "}
