We love it with everything from cold apple juice to smoothies. Another great choice is heating it in a saucepan with warm almond milk until it mixes in before adding a squeeze of honey. Delicious!

We reached out to the Innermost community to get their honest feedback on The Detox Booster. This is what Tracy had to say... One week after using The Detox Booster, I felt great! I noticed an instant glow in my skin, and that my digestive system worked faster to detox my body. I also felt lighter. I was surprised by the instant results and wanted to continue consuming the product to see what consistent use would do for my body. One month after taking The Detox Booster, I noticed that I wasn't as bloated after eating a meal. I maintained the healthy glow I acquired from consuming the product daily. I also felt much lighter, as I did after one week of taking the product; my digestive system seemed to work faster than usual. I generally felt healthier. I didn't experience bloating after eating and I also felt less lethargic which is one of the reasons I opted to using the product in the first place! I feel much lighter and have been able to maintain that feeling, so I can confidently say The Detox Booster has helped me reach my goal. I got the Detox booster on a one off to upgrade my smoothies and try to feel a bit more vitality after feeling run down. I'm so glad I did - not only does it rebalance my digestive system, it helps clear up any brain fog, sets me up for the day and also is the perfect hangover cure after I've indulged too much from the night before. I literally just mix a scoop of it with orange juice and some psyllium husk and it feels like it completely rejuvenates me. I make sure I have it every morning now and wouldn't be without it x Love that the product is plant-based, improve energy levels, high in antioxidants and anti-inflammatory. Also tastes good, easy and convenient to use in a hurry. Highly recommend and I will be ordering on repeat. Thank you. What a perfect description, thanks Michelle! So glad you love the product, we worked very hard on it. I was worried about the colour, but the taste is really good. I'm having it with hot water and sugar, and it is tasty! I've started to feel more energy already. It is very green! Glad you're loving the flavour and benefits. I really like this greens drink, I make it with hot water, almond milk and add a little bit of honey. Its tasted great and is full of goodness Thanks Jane! We're so pleased you love it and that recipe sounds delicious. Found the taste bitter or its own with hot water & honey but tastes much better in a smoothie. Thanks for the feedback Penny!
