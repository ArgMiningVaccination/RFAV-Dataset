Karen works with, rather than on, the natural flow of a person's energy utilising a range of different energies and healing techniques. Her approach works to maximise the health of the body's energy systems to boost, rebalance and clear blockages. Reiki is a Japanese system of healing that increases the flow of energy in the body to promote wellbeing. Reiki is an incredibly relaxing and gentle treatment with the potential for very powerful results. The Honey Healing Method (which supercedes Emotional Realignment Therapy) is a powerful cutting edge energy therapy that works directly with stored emotional energy within a person's body. The process of learning to use Reiki is called an attunement because it is a bit like tuning a radio. It is not something that can be taught out of books but is something that your energy body is tuned to by a Reiki Master so that you can connect to and use the energy. Our meditation sessions aim to take the mystery out of meditation and combine learning specific breathing and meditation practices, guided visualisation and periods of quiet for self-guided meditation. Becoming attuned to Reiki is a wonderful gift of healing to give to yourself. Karen holds Reiki afternoons to give people attuned to all levels of Reiki the chance to give and receive Reiki together.
