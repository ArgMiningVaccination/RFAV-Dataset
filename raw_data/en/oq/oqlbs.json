It is an eight-week, evidence-based, highly experiential course that is currently offered at more than 250 hospitals, universities, and clinical settings in the United States and around the world. MBSR's primary aim is to develop skills that can be flexibly applied in everyday life to stress, pain, and illness. Through experiential learning and discussion during class, as well as through daily mindfulness practice at home, participants learn and refine a range of self-regulatory skills that involve finely tuned attention to thoughts, emotions, and physical sensations. The MBSR Program Involves: - A group Orientation session. Orientations are offered free of charge. The Orientation is required so that you can determine if the MBSR program is a good fit for you, once you have attended an orientation, it is good for any future class with CIM. Orientations are offered in person and virtually (on Zoom). - An eight-week program that meets once per week (on Zoom or In person) for 2.5-3 hours, consisting of: - Instruction and group practice of several formal mindfulness meditation practices: sitting meditation, body scanning, and mindful movement - Instruction and group practice of mindful hatha yoga, a series of gentle stretches and postures. Modifications and chair yoga are offered. - Discussion of the roles of stress, thoughts, and emotions as they may contribute to anxiety and distress, and chronic pain and illness.Daily Home Practice: meditation practice at home with the guidance of audio recordings (mp3) - A Retreat Day in the second half of the course. Who Can Benefit From MBSR? According to the American Academy of Family Physicians, up to two-thirds of all office visits to family doctors are for stress-related symptoms. Depression and anxiety symptoms are often associated with chronic illness and chronic pain and should be addressed as part of the overall management of health problems. MBSR may help reduce medical symptoms and psychological distress as well as the need for clinical services.
