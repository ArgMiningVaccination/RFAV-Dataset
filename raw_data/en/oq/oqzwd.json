St. L. J. (2021): This article was presented at \"Guilty Minds: A Virtual Conference on Mens Rea and Criminal Justice Reform\" at Arizona State University's Sandra Day O'Connor College of Law. It is forthcoming in Arizona State Law Journal Volume 53, Issue 2. The thesis of this article is simple: As long as we maintain the current folk psychological conception of ourselves as intentional and potentially rational creatures, as people and not simply as machines, mental states will inevitably remain central to ascriptions of culpability and responsibility more generally. It is also desirable. Nonetheless, we are in a condition of unprecedented internal challenges to the importance of mental states in the context of mental abnormalities and of external challenges to personhood and agency based on the new behavioral neuroscience and genetics. The latter challengers argue that the central role the criminal law gives to mental states is deeply misguided. All these challenges should fail on conceptual and empirical grounds.

Legal Studies Research Paper No. 375465: The growing influx of neuroscientific evidence in various criminal justice systems has prompted several excellent assessments of the nature and degree of its impact in courtrooms in the United States and other countries. However, there have been few efforts to conduct a comparative analysis of systematic empirical research on the use of neuroscientific evidence in criminal cases, which is this chapter's goal. This review breaks new ground by detailing the critical similarities and differences among all seven empirical studies that researchers have conducted up to 2019. What is the main takeaway? Across most of the studies, neuroscientific evidence was firmly planted in five different countries' criminal justice systems, and defense attorneys primarily used it for purposes of mitigation. Research findings documented the extent of its impact at all phases of the criminal justice system, particularly sentencing. Most studies also reported that the use of such evidence in the courtroom was increasing over time or, if not, it was being more thoroughly discussed. In essence, neuroscientific evidence has a secure foothold in criminal justice that will only become stronger. That said, it is critically important to emphasize the studies' limitations and the nuances behind their results. While the studies employed a common framework and relied on widely accepted legal databases, they also shared deep structural challenges. Empirical research is showing more accurately how neuroscientific evidence is helping criminal justice systems better assess mental states and assign punishments. Yet, the legal system's process of collecting and organizing information needs to advance and modernize.

St. U. College L. J. Med. & L. (Forthcoming): Communicable diseases is as old as mankind. With recent advances in medical sciences and increased human activities, recent years have seen even more resilient infectious diseases. While sciences have made numerous advances in the fight and eradication of such diseases strong contentions still exists on ethics and processes. With innovations around vaccines, the importance of humans and the key stakeholders need to be emphasized. This paper looks at the various theories and ethical implications of vaccine trials and testings and how this might be impacting innovation and the law. It further highlights the importance of proper ethical processes to vaccine trials and how such would not only enhance the process but provide workable methods for future pandemics. It critically analyses some important theoretical frameworks related to vaccine trials and how these tie to protecting not just the human rights of volunteers but future patients and other stakeholders.

Decision analysis promotes these qualities using four steps: (1) determining explicit criteria and measures for evaluation, (2) identifying alternatives to the study, (3) defining the models used to estimate the measures for each alternative, and (4) running the models to produce the estimates and compare the alternatives. In this paper, we describe how decision analysis might be applied by funders and regulators, as well as by others contemplating the use of novel controlled human infection studies for vaccine development and evaluation.

People throughout the UK have debated this issue since the start of the pandemic. When central government, local governments, and devolved administrations all enjoy democratic legitimacy, disputes over who should have the power to impose social distancing rules are almost inevitable. The nature of the British constitution also means that the recent debates about parliamentary insight and social distancing rules were predictable. This paper sheds lights on these debates over who should have the power to impose social distancing rules by drawing on economic theory, particularly the work of Nobel Laureates Hayek (1945) and Ostrom (1990). We review UK policy since March 2020 using this lens and then present policymakers with actionable recommendations. We argue that local rather than national governments should be given authority over whether or not to impose lockdowns and similar measures. We argue that in areas in which local government powers are not unified into a single unit and instead dispersed to different levels (e.g. county and borough councils), power over social distancing rules should be vested in the most junior unit of government. We use economic theory to argue that the legislative branches within each level of government should exercise close and continuous parliamentary oversight of all social distancing rules. In light of this pandemic, the UK might also consider investing resources in acquiring a written constitution that would clearly specify who has power over public health measures such as social distancing rules.

Public L. & Legal Theory Research Paper No. 2021-08: This draft book chapter, prepared as part of a symposium on The 100-Year Life by Linda Gratton and Andrew Scott, reflects on the future of family law in an era of longer lives. Our analysis leads us to conclude that the 100-year life is indeed likely to have an impact on the nature, scope, and definition of family law, but that families will continue to function as the primary setting for intimacy and for caregiving and caretaking, whatever form those families take. Further, the importance to both individual and social welfare of family support throughout life points to a need for reform of current family law doctrine. The impact of longer life on doctrines regulating the relationship of parents and minor children is likely to be modest, but doctrinal and policy reforms will be needed to support individuals in following their preferences for intimacy and security in old age -- as will reforms to the minimal role of the state in promoting security for individuals in different family forms and of differing socioeconomic status. We suggest general goals for law reform and offer specific proposals.

Corp. L. (2021): With the pandemic caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 raging around the world, many countries' economies are at a crucial juncture. The COVID-19 external shock to the economy has the potential to affect corporate governance profoundly. This article explores its possible impact on comparative corporate governance. For an economy to operate successfully, a society must first find a politically sustainable social equilibrium. In many countries, historical crises - such as the Great Depression and World War II - have resulted in a reconfiguration of corporate governance institutions that set the course for generations. While it is not yet clear whether COVID-19 will have a similar effect, it is possible that it will change patterns of what kind of firms are - from an evolutionary perspective - likely to survive, and which ones are not. We argue that to some extent, it will accelerate ongoing trends, whereas in other areas it put corporations on an entirely new course. We observe three trends, namely the need for resilience, a growth of nationalist policies in corporate law, and an increasing orientation toward 'stakeholder' interests. First, firms will have to become resilient to the crisis, and consequently long-term oriented. Corporations that are not operating merely on an arm's length capital market basis but are integrated into a network, generated by core shareholders, state ownership or bank lending may be more likely to survive. In addition, firms are beginning to interact with their workforce differently in their attempts to maintain what could be called 'healthy human capital.' Second, we are likely to see a resurgence of nationalism in corporate governance to ensure that foreign ownership and interconnected supply chains do not put national security at risk. Third, the existing critiques of inequality but also climate change awareness will accelerate the trend toward a broadening of corporate purpose toward 'stakeholderism' and public policy issues. As in the past years, institutional investors acting as 'universal owners' will play a role in shaping this trend.

Moving beyond the existing focus in human rights scholarship on the role of restrictive practices in confinement, the paper broadens and nuances our understanding of confinement by exploring the daily facilitators of confinement in the lives of people with dementia. The paper draws on data from focus groups and interviews with people living with dementia, care partners, aged care workers, and lawyers and advocates about Australian care homes. It argues that microlevel interrelated and compounding factors contribute to human rights abuses of people living with dementia related to limits on freedom of movement and community access of people living with dementia, at times irrespective of the use of restrictive practices. These factors include immobilization and neglect of residents, limited and segregated recreational activities, concerns about duty of care and liability, apprehension of community exclusion, and pathologization and subversion of resistance. It is necessary to challenge the organizational, cultural, economic, and social dynamics that shape day-to-day, microlevel, routine, and compounding factors that remove the agency of people living with dementia and in turn facilitate entrenched and systematic human rights breaches in care homes.

Evidence from the States](https://privpapers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3725713&dgcid=ejournal_htmlemail_public:health:law:policy:ejournal_abstractlink), SSRN: Although infrastructure is a key input into economic growth, systematic evidence on what drives overall spending across time or place is very limited. In this paper, motivated in part by the difficulties in international comparisons, we focus on infrastructure for which we can measure spending consistently over time and space: the US Interstate system. Looking over the period of the build-out of the system from 1956 to 1993, we find that the 75th percentile state spent $8.8 million more per mile than the 25th percentile state, relative to mean spending per mile of $11.5 million (all dollar figures are 2016 dollars). If states spending over the median had limited their expenditure per mile to that of the median state, the Interstate system would have cost about 40 percent less to build. When we limit to choices within policymaker discretion, netting out pre-determined characteristics such as the slope of the terrain, a $3.3 million per mile interquartile range persists. We then show that this cross-state variation exceeds that in other related public and private spending, and examine patterns of correlation that provide evidence of common root causes. We review the evidence that does exist on the root causes of infrastructure spending and test some of these hypotheses in our cross-state setting.

This essay illuminates how the racialization of diseases is reflected in historic and ongoing United States' migration law and policy as well as the global health law regime. By demonstrating the close relationship between often separately treated areas, the essay clarifies underlying currents in global health and migration law and policy that stem from fears of the racialized other.

Safra Center for Ethics (2020): Across the world, the COVID-19 pandemic has been most devastating to already-vulnerable populations. At the same time, it has brought our interconnectedness into sharp focus. Policies chosen in one jurisdiction affect conditions in others, and even regions isolated from each other are linked through third parties. This calls for harmonization of strategies across countries worldwide. However, regions differ sharply in their levels of medical and public health infrastructure, population density, concentrated poverty, patterns of internal migration, access to communication technologies, ability to bid on global markets, protection of privacy and civil liberties, communal tensions, and institutions of social support. Hence, policy responses also need to be carefully tailored to local conditions. This paper considers varied experiences with tackling the pandemic, with particular focus on three regions -- India, Africa, and Latin America -- that are collectively home to forty percent of the world's population. These regions face several challenges to adopting the testing, tracing, and supported isolation (TTSI) roadmap that we have proposed for the United States. We reflect on alternative policy trajectories that can help us transition back to work and social activity while safeguarding human lives worldwide.

This paper focuses on The Health Protection (Coronavirus, Restrictions) (England) Regulations 2020, a statute which was in place in England. In a democratic society, it is essential to make sure legislation complies with the human rights we are entitled to and to hold the legislator accountable if it is not; especially in the case of important rights such as the right to liberty. As a result, the movement restrictions that were hastily put in place should be critically evaluated, in order to ascertain whether this right was overlooked; while public health is a vital consideration, intrusive measures can only ever be justified if individual rights have been taken into consideration.

We examine the current state of research on public opinion about air pollution by reviewing the three largest journal article databases for the entire period until 2018. We only identify 33 relevant articles. They are geographically biased toward a few developed countries, with limited attention paid to developing countries that face a greater level of challenges from air pollution. By conducting a meta-analysis with these articles, we report a few consistent predictors employed in these studies and summarize the findings. We find that education and income consistently appear to increase the public awareness of air pollution and support for air pollution mitigation policies, yet the evidence is less conclusive for less frequently examined variables. Our results call for a new wave of public opinion studies on air pollution that covers a broader geographical area and includes developing countries.

The COVID-19 pandemic offers rare opportunities for the US President-elect to spearhead long-overdue structural changes and revitalise global health leadership. Building trust among global partners will be challenging, given the USA's withdrawal from, and disruption of, international cooperation under the presidency of Donald Trump. The USA will have to lead in a different, more collaborative way. Here, we offer a Global Action Agenda for the Biden Administration.

J. (2020): As COVID-19 plagues the world, countries grapple with a range of measures - such as quarantines, isolation, stay-at-home orders and masks - to limit its spread. In the United States, under the Tenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, states have taken the lead in implementing a variety of public health safety measures to address this contagious and deadly virus. In many instances, citizens have claimed a violation of their individual rights and raised numerous legal challenges. But given that the virus knows no borders, a pivotal question is what role the federal government should play in creating a more uniform response that respects individual rights. This Article addresses the legal and policy questions of enacting a federal pandemic statute. It provides guidance to public health experts and lawmakers should they decide that a national and more coordinated response would be helpful as the United States confronts COVID-19 and other pandemics.

Despite treaty obligations to provide health care to American Indians and Alaska Natives, the federal government has consistently underfunded Indian health facilities. Federal Indian health programming remains piecemeal, often falling victim to Congressional politics for continued funding, requiring inter-Tribal competition for grant and cooperative agreement funding, or requiring Tribal cost sharing. Tragically, but, unsurprisingly given failures in federal Indian health policy, many American Indian and Alaska Native communities have experienced health inequities throughout the pandemic. In several states, American Indians have higher rates of COVID-19 infections as well as worse health outcomes, including higher mortality, than their non-Indian counterparts. By exercising their inherent sovereignty as Tribal Nations, many Tribes have been able to mitigate failings in federal Indian health policy in their COVID-19 response. Unfortunately, reports across Indian country have found instances of state and local governments failing to adequately engage Tribal governments in public health activities, even those implicating Tribal members on Tribal lands, citing lack of Tribal public health authority. Not only is this legally inaccurate, but it also limits Tribal public health response efforts, and infringes on Tribal sovereignty. This issue brief discusses the legal authority for Tribes to serve as public health authorities. First, it describes the inherent authority of Tribes to engage in public health activities. Second, it discusses the recognition of Tribal public health authority across federal law and programs. This issue brief ends by discussing strategies to reinforce Tribal authority in times of public health crisis. January 30, 2021 "}
