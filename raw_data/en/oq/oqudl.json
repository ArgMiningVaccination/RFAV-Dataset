Our practice caters to those looking for total body health and alternative care approaches to achieve a healthier lifestyle. We want to help you prevent and avoid disease, not manage it. It starts and ends with you... we just help you achieve it. We Focus on ALL of You for a BETTER You. We offer a wide range of services to provide you with a holistic approach to health, starting with chiropractic care all the way to personalized nutrition plans and lifestyle advice. We have been serving the Houston community for 21 years and continue to improve. In order to better serve our Houston clientele, we have closed down our second location in Missouri City to ensure all Doctors are on staff in central Houston. WHERE TO FIND US IN HOUSTON... 2211 Norfolk St. #105, Houston, TX 77098 (713) 522-9814 Treatment With Natural Health Houston We focus on nervous and musculoskeletal system disorders and their effect on your overall general health. Our chiropractic services most generally treat pain complaints, including neck pain, back pain, joint pain, and headaches. However, we see patients with a large variety of problems and incorporate natural medicine into our diagnosis. We practice a drug-free and hands-on approach to health. Once we give you a thorough assessment and examination, we will provide a holistic diagnosis followed by a personalized treatment plan. Our goal is to get you better, pain-free, and living a healthier lifestyle. In addition to chiropractic adjustments, we may provide you with recommendations or treatment plans that include therapeutic and rehabilitative exercises, nutritional and supplemental plans, and healthy lifestyle counseling to encourage ongoing healthy habits. We also know injuries from car crashes are very common, especially in Houston traffic. Quickly and effectively treating these injuries (such as whiplash, muscle strains, or disc bulges) is imperative to avoiding lifelong chronic pain and dysfunction. We want to be your front-line care provider, allowing you to be in less pain, and better able to function and sleep, while we help your body heal. We are able to walk you through your treatment plan and get you any MRI or co-management referrals needed. We can treat you with or without you having a lawyer representing your claim.
