The hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis is responsible for maintaining an appropriate level of thyroid hormones that the cells can use to provide for normal metabolism. Just as vital, recent research has uncovered thyroid signaling pathways that regulate the thyroid system on a cellular level. The ubiquitin proteasome system controls the level of deiodinase enzyme, thereby determining T4 to T3 conversion. All this crucial intracellular activity is not measured by thyroid blood tests. This might explain why some people have low body temperatures and symptoms of low thyroid function that may warrant the empirical use of T3. Goals and Objectives: Describe the physiology of thyroid hormone pathways and body temperature Name 3 intracellular signaling pathways that direct the conversion of T4 to T3 Understand the intracellular physiology of thyroid hormones Evidence based review of T3 treatment based on efficacy and safety issues Review recent evidence-based treatments such as exercise, for hypothyroid management Understand the risks of T3 and the safety concerns of the American Thyroid Association regarding the use of T3 10:00 AM - 11:00 AM Session 2: Female Lab Testing Made Easy Carrie Jones, ND, MPH This session will offer an overview of the testing of reproductive hormones and related treatments, particularly with female patients. Female reproductive health is a complex topic and related health issues can involve many different variables. We will discuss the physiol- ogy of reproductive hormones. We will also discuss the pros and cons of serum, saliva and urine testing for these hormones. Providers will learn the best scenarios to use different types of tests. Imbalances in reproductive hormones come in many different forms. Treatments are equally diverse and providers will learn practical treatment options for common dysfunctions with reproductive hormones. Goals and Objectives: Review the physiology of reproductive hormones. Evidence based review of testing methods for reproductive hormones (pros and cons of serum, salvia, urine). Review of evidence-based treatments for female reproductive hormone imbalance with botanical medicine, hormones and nutrition. Includes PCOS, luteal phase defect, PMS, fertility, with clinical pearls. 11:30 AM-12:30 PM Session 3: Restorative Medicine Herbs For Regulating Thyroid Function Kevin Spelman, PhD This session will present current research on botanical medicines aimed at regulating thyroid function. Agents that improve hypothyroid function by increasing iodine uptake and synthesize thyroid hormones will be reviewed, along with agents known to block excessive stimulation of the thyroid in cases of excessive TSH production, or thyroid auto-antibodies. Nutritional and botanical evidence-based treatments for a variety of common thyroid conditions seen in clinical practice will be shared. Lastly, synergism between the adrenal and the thyroid gland, and the \"cross talk\" between all the endocrine organs will be addressed as an important aspect of treating thyroid diseases. Goals and Objectives: Review of thyroid physiology and the HPA axis Scientific review of hormone pathways Review of the research on the role of iodine in hypothyroidism and subclinical hypothyroidism Review of evidence based botanical medicine for thyroid activity 1:45 PM-2:45 PM Session 4: Foundational Principles of Natural Hormone Replacement Therapy Kristy Prouse, MD, FRCSC Prescribing hormones can be intimidating, but by understanding the fundamentals, it is easier to negotiate the complexities. Establishing foundational principles of interpreting test results and prescribing sets the stage for successful management of even the most seemingly challenging patient. Learn how to effectively manage and prescribe for various sex hormone imbalances seen at the difference stages of a woman's reproductive career. Outline/Objectives: Define differences between natural hormones and synthetic hormones. Review steroidogenic pathways. Compare evidence based conventional HRT with natural hormones in terms of clinical efficacy, breast cancer risk, and cardiovascular risk. Recognize the importance of diagnostic testing. 83:15 PM-4:15 PM Session 5: Gut Function \u2014 A Silent Player in Inflammation and Hormone Balance Joe Klassen, ND Dr. Klassen will provide perspective on how gut function ties together different body systems. He will examine studies supporting clinical use of food sensitivity (IgG) testing and explain how that can affect seemingly unrelated systems. The importance of the microbiome in its role as the sterolbiome and how this relates to the metabolism of hormones and xenobiotics will be discussed. An overview of enterohepatic recirculation and how the biliary tree is a sometimes- forgotten member of the digestive system will help connect these concepts. Goals & Objectives: Evidence based review of the role of the microbiome and systemic inflammation Review of research on food allergies, microbiome, and systemic alterations Review factors which damage the microbiome Evidence based review of IgG testing and accuracy Therapeutic recommendations for optimal microbiome 4:15 PM-5:15 PM Session 6: Male Lab Testing Made Easy Carrie Jones, ND, MPH Male lab testing can be downright confusing when attempting to understand the complexities of which hormones to test, for what reasons, and then correlate it with the patient's symptoms. While there are many hormones to evaluate when assessing men's health, this lecture will primarily focus on the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonad (HPG) axis and include (LH), prolactin and PSA. In addition, proper hormone evaluation in serum, saliva, 24-hour urine and dried-spot urine will be discussed including the pros and cons of each. Goals and Objectives: Briefly discuss serum, saliva, 24-hour and dried-spot urine testing and their appropriateness in various hormonal evaluation as it is not one-size-fits-all. Review how testosterone is made and how sperm are produced plus explain the feedback loops and interactions between hormones. Discuss each hormone, how to properly assess it and review causes of low and high levels Saturday, February 9 9:00 AM-10:00 AM Session 7: Neurological Health and Pathophysiology multifactorial; neuroinflammation, oxidation, mitochondrial dysfunction, microbiome imbalance, immune and hormone imbalances and other factors contribute to development of neurological disorders. This course will provide an overview the various neuropathophysiologies which will provide a solid foundation for understanding best treatment protocols. Participants will better understand how to address the etiology each dysfunction in order to help patients prevent or delay neurodegeneration. Goals & Objectives: Evidence based review of natural hormone treatments to delay cognitive decline Review neuro-endocrine connections and the role in cognitive decline Examine the factors that cause neuroinflammation and review the research. Review the pathophysiology of oxidative factors in neurodegeneration. Evidence based assessment of the role of autoimmunity in neurodegeneration. 10:00 AM-11:00 AM Session 8: Fire on the Brain \u2014 A Functional Approach to Reversal of Cognitive Decline Mark Menolascino, MD Learn a new, natural approach to reverse cognitive decline. Go beyond the standard approach for evaluating dementia- Dr. Menolascino will review and disseminate a new program that you can apply in your clinical practice. He will identify evidence-based nutrient, hormone, toxin, microbiome, and genetic markers that are involved in cognitive decline. He will also discuss the team approach for utilizing health coaches and nutritionist in clinical practice for optimal compliance and outcomes. Goals & Objectives: Review recent published research on nutrients, hormones, toxic, microbiome, genetic markers that are involved in cognitive decline. Review the role of neuroinflammation on cognitive function and aging, and steps to reduce inflammation. Review the efficacy of individualized programs for reversing cognitive decline based on nutrition and lifestyle adjustments. 911:30 AM-12:30 PM Session 9: Functional Approach to Treating Neurodegenerative Disorders, Part 1 Terry Wahls, MD As the rates of Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and Multiple Sclerosis continue to rise and become a larger burden to the healthcare system, it becomes increasingly more important to focus on prevention and early detection. Neurodegenerative diseases are infinitely more difficult to treat in advanced stages, and prevention is the most successful approach. Dr. Terry Wahls will share her firsthand experience with both research and treatment, which helped her reverse her own disease course. This course will help attendees learn to identify early signs and symptoms of neurodegenerative diseases, and prescribe appropriate diagnostic lab tests. Case studies and protocols incorporating nutrition, a modified Paleo diet, herbs, exercise and other lifestyle modifications will be presented. Goals and Objectives: Describe the role that deficits in cellular bioenergetics can play in the development and progression of neurodegenerative disorders. Evidence based review of underlying causes of neurodegenerative diseases, including neuroinflammation, oxidation and hormone imbalances. Identify early signs and symptoms of neurodegenerative diseases in primary care patients. Evidence based review of lab tests and other diagnostics to identify underlying causes of individual cases of neurodegenerative disorders. Design and implement personalized treatment plans that address deficits in cellular bioenergetics and other underlying causes of neurodegenerative disorders. 1:45 PM-2:45 PM Session 10: Functional Approach to Treating Neurodegenerative Disorders, Part 2 Terry Wahls, MD (See description above for Part 1) 2:45 PM-3:45 PM Session 11: Herbs for Neurology in Restorative Medicine Kevin Spelman, PhD Neurodegenerative disorders increasingly continue to be a clinical concern in an aging population. Rates of Alzheimer's disease, traumatic brain injury and cognitive disorders are chronic conditions that are on the rise. Pharmaceutical options are ineffective thus far, but botanical medicine holds potential for playing an important role in preventing and delaying progression of these typically chronic and advancing conditions. Dr. Kevin Spelman will share evidence-based and clinically proven herbs which act on neuroinflammation, neurotransmitters, neurodegeneration and neuroimmunomodulation. Herbs such as kava, lion's and passionflower will be reviewed for their anxiolytic, anti- inflammatory, and cognitive supporting properties. Clinical applications, therapeutic dosage, safety, and contraindications will be discussed. Goals and Objectives: The participant will be able to articulate the associated neurotransmitters in sleep disorders, depression and anxiety. A review of the research on molecular pathways and neurotransmitter modulation by botanical medicines and/or their constituents. The participant will be able to discuss botanical modulation of neurotransmitters in sleep, anxiety and depressive disorders. The participant will be able to cite evidence-based details on how botanical medicine can be therapeutically relevant for sleep disorders, anxiety disorders and depression. 4:15 PM-5:15 PM Session 12: Dietary Approach to MS Microbiome and the Gut Brain Immune Axis Terry Wahls, MD This presentation reviews published research on the Wahls Protocol and the Swank Diet for Multiple Sclerosis. Dr. Wahls will review the gut-brain-immune axis and demonstrate how gut microbiota can influence the brain and immune system. The microbiome is influenced by diet, genetics, antibiotic use, environmental toxins and many other factors. Obesity and heart disease are related to an altered gut microbiome. An Imbalanced gut microbiome can be at the root of psychological conditions such as mood disorders, anxiety, and cognitive impairment. Dr. Wahls will review specific dietary and lifestyle adjustments that can positively influence the microbiome. Goals and Objectives: Review published research on the Wahls Protocol and Swank Diet and their outcome on MS symptoms. Review the most current research on the functions of the gut- brain-immune axis.

The Vermont-grown, certified organic lion's mane mushroom provides terpenoids (hericenones and erinacines), which cross the blood-brain barrier. Lion's mane provides neuroprotection by supporting the production of nerve growth factor (NGF) activity, which is responsible for healthy nerves and supports myelin sheath generation. Neuro-Protect Px also contains ashwagandha extract, an adaptogen which also supports brain health and cognition. It reduces anxiety and can boost glutathione activity to help prevent neurodegeneration.www.restorative.com 800-420-5801 www.restorative.comRestorative Formulations Target 1 0.49 0.09 0 0 0 0 Target 2 0.74 0.55 0 0 0 0 Target 3 1.33 2.68 2.19 0.19 0 0 Target 4 0.43 0.93 0.67 0.1 0.02 0 Target 5 5.95 0.48 NA 0.01 0.01 0 Target 6 5.49 0.32 NA 0 0.01 0 Target 7 2.84 0.64 NA NA 0.02 0 Target 8 6.98 NA 0.06 NA NA 0 Target 9 6.29 3.84 0.51 0.15 0.1 0 Target 10 4.86 2.46 0.42 0.04 0.08 0 Target 11 2.37 2.73 0.05 0.1 0 lion's mane are neuroprotective Supports neurotransmitter synthesis including acetylcholine Supports the production of nerve growth factor (NGF) Adaptogenic and neuroprotective Tested against the leading brands of lion' s mane, Neuro-Protect Px was found to have "}
