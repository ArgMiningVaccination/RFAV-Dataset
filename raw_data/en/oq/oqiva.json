The phase 3 study will examine whether AstraZeneca's AZD1222 vaccine can protect against COVID-19 and also prevent infection with SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for the COVID-19 disease. The AZD1222 vaccine study will be conducted by the [Vaccine Trials Unit (VTU](/en/research/divisions/vaccine-infectious-disease-division/research/immunology-and-vaccine-development/seattle-vaccine-trials-unit.html)), a program of Fred Hutch. Visits will occur at Fred Hutch's main campus and a satellite location in Federal Way. The VTU hopes to enroll 500 volunteers who are at risk for COVID-19 and may be disproportionately impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. There are several ways participants 18 and older can enroll at the Fred Hutch site: Participants will: \"Finding an effective vaccine to safely protect the world from COVID-19 is one of the greatest scientific challenges of our generation,\" said [Dr. Julie McElrath](/en/faculty-lab-directory/mcelrath-julie.html), senior vice president and director of Fred Hutch's Vaccine and Infectious Disease Division. \"By combining the clinical research expertise and resources of Fred Hutch and the commitment from diverse populations in Seattle and neighboring areas, we are optimistic that together, we can make a critical contribution to finding a COVID-19 vaccine.\" McElrath, who also holds the Joel D. Meyers Endowed Chair, will be the principal investigator of the Fred Hutch site. The trial is part of the National Institutes of Health's newly established [COVID-19 Prevention Network](https://www.coronaviruspreventionnetwork.org/), formed by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases to respond to the global pandemic and enroll thousands of volunteers to conduct Phase 3 efficacy trials for COVID-19 vaccines and monoclonal antibodies. The network is a part of \"Operation Warp Speed,\" a partnership led by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to invest in and coordinate the development, manufacturing, and distribution of COVID-19 diagnostics, therapeutics, and vaccines. The United Kingdom-based global biopharmaceutical company AstraZeneca is leading the trial as regulatory sponsor. The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, part of the National Institutes of Health, and the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response, are providing funding support for the trial. Fred Hutch researchers are playing a leading role in the international scientific response to the pandemic \u2014 tracking the virus's global spread, developing diagnostic tests and monoclonal antibodies that neutralize the virus, designing and evaluating COVID-19 vaccines in early and late-phase clinical trials, and working to better understand how the human immune system can provide durable protection and prevent future outbreaks.
