The intent of acupuncture therapy is to promote health and alleviate pain and suffering. Acupuncture is the stimulation of special points on the body, usually by the insertion of fine needles. Naturopaths practicing acupuncture view diseases and health disorders as an imbalance in the body's energy, which flows along well-defined pathways called meridians. By inserting very thin acupuncture needles at specific points along these meridians, a well-trained naturopath can normalize the flow of energy and prevent or treat illness by initiating the body's own healing mechanisms. Modern scientific study has confirmed that Acupuncture induces biochemical changes in the body that have beneficial effects and can reduce recovery times by up to 50% compared to conventional western approaches. According to Eastern philosophy, an imbalance or energy or blood flow will lead to disease in the body. Acupuncture needles placed along specific points can improve vitality, blood circulation and restore the natural balance of the body. Energy Meridians Used In Acupuncture Acupuncture is based on the assumption that (Qi) energy (the life force or energy that flows in the body) courses through the channels of the body. Every organ network has a corresponding set of channels/meridians. The acupuncture points are located across these channels, in small depressions in the skin where the channels come closest to the surface. With acupuncture these gates are opened or closed to adjust circulation of Qi in the channels. Thin sterile steel acupuncture needles are inserted in to the acupuncture points of mobilize Qi, moisture and blood, invigorating the function of muscles, nerves, vessels, glands and organs. "}
