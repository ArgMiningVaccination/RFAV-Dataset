Lifestyle vaccines (non- core): Bordetella every 6- 12 months (as dictated by boarding facility) Leptospirosis (4 serovars) yearly Influenza (CIV; H3N8 and H3N2) yearly Lyme (Borrelia) yearly For puppies : Recommended vaccines (core): DA 2P (P) Start at 6 -8 weeks of age Give a booster every 2 -4 weeks until 18 weeks of age and then one year later Rabies One vaccine at 12 -16 weeks of age; booster in 1 year Lifestyle vaccines (non- core): Bordetella For intranasal, start as earl y as 3 weeks of age; repeat in 12 months For oral, start at 8 weeks or older; repeat in 12 months For injectable, start at 8 weeks or older with a booster in 2-4 weeks; repeat in 12 months **Ideally should be give n 10- 14 days prior to boarding** Leptospirosis Start at 12 weeks of age; booster in 2- 4 weeks and then every 12 months; recommend diphenhydramine pretreatment Influenza (both strains ) Start as early as 6 weeks of age; booster in 2 -4 weeks and then yearly Lyme At 12 weeks or older with a booster in 2- 4 weeks and then yearly All dogs that received all their \"puppy shots\" must receive a booster of all of the above vaccines one year a fter t heir last vaccine (1 year and 18 weeks of age). After that they can be treated as adult dogs. Young dogs over six months of age with an unknown vaccination history should receive two doses of DA 2P (P) 2 -4 weeks apart, and have a booster one year later. They need one R abies vaccine at the time of the first vaccination and it must be repeated one year later. Then they can be treated as adult dogs. Sites for injection : - All are given subcutaneous except intranasal and oral Bordetella - Record the site of each vaccinati on given in the animal's chart - Core vaccinations on the right side; non- core (lifestyle) vaccinations on the left side DA 2P (P) right forelimb Rabies right rearlimb Bordetella INTRANASAL !!! Do not inject SQ!!!! ; ORAL - place in -between cheek and teeth Bordetella left forelimb ; reserved for dogs that are unable to receive intranasal or oral vaccine (ex. too aggressive) Leptospirosis left rearlimb CIV left forelimb Lyme left f orelimb If multiple lifestyle vaccines that would be administered in the same location are to be given on the same day, they must be given in different locations (different lymph node region) and recorded in the chart accordingly. Do not give any injections between the shoulder blades as microchips may be located there. Remove labels from the vaccine containers and put the labels in the animal's chart on the vaccine form located on the left side of the patient record. Diphenhydramine is recommended prior to Leptospirosis vaccination (1 mg/pound rounded up to the nearest 25 mg tablet and given orally 1 hour before vaccine OR 2 mg/kg IM 15 minutes prior to vaccination). Meloxicam (0.1 mg/kg PO based on ideal/lean body weight) is recommended when recombinant distemper vaccination is given. Judgement on if a dog can receive this NSAID medication is left up to the veterinarian in charge. UTCVM VACCINATION PROTOCOL FOR CATS For adult cats over 2 years of age (who have received their kitten vaccinations and one year boosters): Recommended vaccines (core): FVRCP every 3 years (yearly if intranasal FVRCP is used ) Rabies every 1 or 3 years depending on vaccine used Lifestyle vaccines (non- core): FeLV yearly Other non- core vaccinations may be considered on a case by case basis ex. Bordetella. For kittens : Recommended vaccines (core): FVRCP start at 6 -9 weeks of age then give one every 3 -4 weeks until 18 weeks old Rabies one vaccine at 12 -16 weeks old FeLV first dose at 9 weeks old and give booster 3- 4 weeks later and then yearly; Kittens should be tested for FeLV/FIV prior to vaccination. All cats who received all of their \"kitten shots\" must receive all of their vaccines again one year later (1 year 18 weeks of age). After that they can be treated as adult cats. For young adult cats with unknown vaccination history : FVRCP (core) give one dose and then give a booster in 3- 4 weeks and another booster one year later Rabies (core) one vaccine and then booster in 1 year FeLV ( core) give one dose and then booster in 3- 4 weeks and another booster one year later and then reassess lifestyle thereafter Sites for injection : - All are given subcutaneously unless an intranasal vaccine (ex. FVRC P) is given - Record all sites of all in jections in the animal's record - Core vaccinations on the right side; non- core vaccinations (lifestyle) on the left side FVRC P right forelimb (at or below the elbow) Rabies right rearlimb (at or below the knee) FeLV left rearlimb (at or below the knee) Distal extremity vaccination recommended by AVMA so that amputation can be done if fibrosarcoma forms. Do not give any injections between the shoulder blades as fibrosarcomas are difficult to remove from this area and microchips may be located there. Remove the label from all vaccine containers and put the label in the animal's chart on the vaccine form located on the left side of the patient record. A single dose of Onsior ( robenacoxib) is recommended to be given orally to cats receiving recombinant vaccinations (Rabies and FeLV). Judgement on ability to receive this NSAID medication is left up to the veterinarian in charge. "}
