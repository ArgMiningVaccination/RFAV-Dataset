Abstract Background: Globally, major depression is the primary cause of disability, where a large part of cases is reported among the working-class. Methods: We conducted comparative cross-sectional study with 8-week observation includes mindfulness meditation, curcumin supplementation and sunlight exposure (MCS program) among mildly depressed office workers of both sexes - 34 in observed group (OG) and 34 in control group (CT). At baseline, day 30, and day 60, participants were compared in terms of (a) vitamin D, (b) brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), (c) interleukin-6 (IL-6), and (d) depression scores using PHQ-9. ELISA were performed for all serum samples. Results: The rates of increase of vitamin D in both day 0, 30 and day 30, 60 intervals were significantly higher in OG (p<0.05). BDNF levels varied extensively between the groups. IL-6 means were significantly lower in OG at day 30 than in CG (p<0.05). Depression scores rate of change demonstrated appreciable fall in day 0, 30 interval and stayed down to day 60 in OG. Significantly, lower depression scores were observed for OG at both day 30 and day 60 (p<0.05). Conclusion: MCS program resulted in significant decreases in depression scores and some of its related biomarkers, thus can be a sustainable and cost-effective approach to alleviating psychological depression among the working- class.
