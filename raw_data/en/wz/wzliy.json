I owe it all to you.\" \"I went to Dr. Reid due to a chronic pain in my right shoulder, that had been getting progressively worse over the last two years. No other treatment had worked and it had gotten to the point that I couldn't raise my arm past my shoulder without severe pain. After just one session with Dr. Reid, I was able to swing my arm over my head with barely a twinge. By the end of the second treatment, it was as if the pain had never existed. I was amazed at how quickly the treatments worked. Two sessions ended two years of pain. It really was amazing. \" "}
