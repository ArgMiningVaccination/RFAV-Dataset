The DASA/Child Welfare Integrated Services Program provides enhanced outreach, case management, transportation, and child care services as part of the client's treatment process. Persons served by DCFS receive priority admission to the program. b) Eligibility Requirements for Referral to the DASA/Child Welfare Integrated Services Program Persons eligible to receive services through the DASA/Child Welfare Integrated Services Program must be family members and persons who are significant to the family (i.e., ongoing members of the household) that have an open case with the Department, or the subjects of a child abuse or neglect investiga tion, or a child for whom the Department is legally responsible. There are no age limitations for persons eligible to receive services from the DASA/Child Welfare Integrated Services Program. c) DASA/Child Welfare Integrated Services Providers Regional directories of DASA treatment providers funded to serve DCFS/POS adult and youth referrals may be accessed through the \"Resource Links\" on the DCFS D-Net, and the \"Features\" tab on the DCFS web page, www. state.il.us/dcfs. Directories are also available from the DCFS Divi sion of Service Intervention. Note: If a DASA/Child Welfare In tegrated Services Program provider is not available in your service area, contact the Division of Service Intervention for assistance in locating a DASA provider or to obtain other treatment options. d) Adult Substance Abuse Screen (CFS 440-5) The CFS 440-5 is not a diagnostic tool. It is a t ool developed for use by Investigation Specialists and follow-up workers to help identify potential alcohol and other drug abuse (AODA) problems to determine if an individual should be referred to a licensed substance abuse tr eatment provider for an AODA assessment. The CFS 440-5 must be completed for all adults in the household or a ny adult acting as the ch ild's caregiver that is relevant to a child abuse and neglect investigation. The CFS 440-5 must also be completed any time there is an indication that substance abuse may be present or whenever the case file lacks documentation th at a screen was completed. The completed CFS 440-5 must be placed in the case file and th e results of the screen entered in the SACWIS Adult Substance Abuse Screening Summary. Procedures 302 - Appendix A (1) SERVICES DELIVERED BY THE DEPARTMENT September 8, 2006 - PT 2006.11 The CFS 440-5 has eight sections. Section I, Observations of the Person Being Screened, lists physical signs that may be exhibited by pers ons abusing alcohol and/or drugs. A \"no\" response to any of the items in Section II, Facts, c oncerning drug or drug related criminal charges; non-drug relate d criminal charges and driving under the influence of alcohol (Section V) charges mu st be verified through LEADS information. A \"no\" response concerning a substance-expo sed infant must be verified through a SACWIS/CANTS check. Response to items in Section IV, Family, should be asked of an adult member of the household, if available. When a family member is not available to respond to the items in Section IV, it shoul d be noted on the form that the questions were asked of the client and not a family member. All sources providing information on the screening form should be noted fo r supervisory review and signature. Note: When Law Enforcement Agencies Data System (LEADS) information indicates issues of drug or alcohol abuse, work ers shall assess the underlying documents supporting the LEADS information. DASA treatment providers will not admit client s with outstanding or unresolved arrest warrants. If the LEADS summary or underlying documents indicates the presence of an outstanding arrest warrant impacting the pa rent or other member of the substance affected family, the worker shall do the fo llowing to resolve the warrant prior to the individual entering AODA treatment. Notify the client's attorn ey or public defender of the outstanding warrant. Instruct the client to surr ender to law enforcement. Work with the court to quash the warrant based on the client's willingness to enter AODA treatment. Notify law enforcement of th e whereabouts of the client. If the screen indicates a need for further assessment, the worker shall complete the referral information in Section VIII of the form, have the client sign a CFS 440-7 , Consent for Disclosure of Information, and complete the SACWIS Adult Substance Abuse Screening Summary documenting th e finding and referral activities. Note: Concurrent with th e completion of the Adult Substance Abuse Screen the Investigation Specialist must initiate the Substance Affected Families Procedures Checklist , CFS 440-11 . Subsection (p) the CFS 440-11 . e) CFS 440-7, Consent for Disclosure of Information - Substance Abuse Assessment and/or Treatment Records of the identity, diagnosis, prognosis or treatment of any patient maintained in connection with performance of any program or activity relate d to alcohol or other drug abuse or dependency educati on, early intervention, interven tion, training, treatment or rehabilitation which is regulated, authorized, or directly or indirectly assisted by any state Procedures 302 - Appendix A (2) SERVICES DELIVERED BY THE DEPARTMENT September 8, 2006 - PT 2006.11 department or agency shall be confidential and only disc losed with consent. See Procedures 431 , Subsection (e) for detailed inform ation concerning substance abuse treatment records. The CFS 440-7 allows the sharing of informati on that is required for DCFS and the courts to evaluate the safety and risk to a child, and to support the cl ient's success in both the child welfare system and AODA treatment. A parent or caretaker may seek treatment without signing the CFS 440-7, but his or her treatment as sessments, attendance and/or progress cannot be recognized by DCFS unless the AODA treatment provider directly reports the information to DCFS. In order to obtain the client's cooperation in signing the CFS 440-7 , it is important that the worker fully explain the types of informa tion that will be exchanged and with whom. It is also essential that the client understa nd that the exchange of this information is required to ensure that DCFS and the court receive accurate information regarding his or her progress, and that the information al so allows both the Department of Human Services and DCFS to assess the strengths and weaknesses of the integrated services program. Clients cannot be referred for services under the DASA/Child Welfare Integrated Services Program if they refuse to sign the CFS 440-7 . In special circumstances, it is possible to obtain AODA treatment informa tion on a non-consenting client. Consult your Regional Counsel if it is necessary to obtain this information through a court order. f) AODA Assessment Referral Workers shall refer clients to a DASA/Child Welfare Integrated Services Program provider for an AODA assessment when the results of the CFS 440-5 indicates that the client may have a potential problem with alc ohol or other drugs. The DASA provider is required to schedule an assessmen t for the client no later than the next working day. Call the provider in the presence of the client so that the client can c onfirm the appointment. Assist the client in keeping the appointm ent by making any necessary transportation or child care arrangements with th e provider. If arrangements cannot be made with the provider, consult with your supe rvisor concerning the use of auxiliary services. Inform the client that he or she w ill be held responsible for follow through with the assessment and any recommended treatment. Forward the completed CFS 440-5, CFS 440-6 , DCFS Referral For Adult Other Drug Treatment Services , and CFS 440-7 via facsimile with any relevant LEADS information to the provider in advance of the client's assessment appointment. Ensure that the client has the provider's name, contact person, address, and telephone number in writing. The provider will notify the re ferring Department or POS wo rker no later than the next working day if the client fails to attend the assessment appointment. Follow-up with the client should occur within two working days for intact and split cases and within one Procedures 302 - Appendix A (3) SERVICES DELIVERED BY THE DEPARTMENT September 8, 2006 - PT 2006.11 week for placement cases. Workers must re initiate the referral to the provider if the client is willing to proceed with the assessment. When a DASA provider does not have the cap acity to provide or refer to treatment services at the necessary level for the client, the provider must establish interim services for the client until appropriate treatment servic es become available. When a client is placed on a waiting list or a pr ovider does not have AODA treat ment capacity, workers or supervisors are required to notify the DCFS Division of Service Intervention of the situation. The Divisions of Service Interv ention should also be notified when other problems or questions arise related to a DASA provider. g) Juvenile Court Assessment Progr am - Cook County Placement Cases The Juvenile Court Assessment Program (JCA P), which is located in the Cook County Juvenile Court Building (312/666-4688), provi des alcohol and drug assessments to persons referred to the program that are no younger than 18 years of age. Assessments are conducted Monday through Friday from 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Appointments are not necessary. Investigation Specialists and caseworkers, DC FS assessment screeners and court personnel may refer persons to JCAP by submitting a completed JCAP Referral/Status Form to the JCAP Intake Specialist. The Intake Specialist will explain the assessment process to the client and have the client sign the CFS 440-7 that has been completed by the client's worker. The JCAP assessor will explain the results of the assessment and the rationale for any treatment recommendations to the clie nt and caseworker upon completion of the assessment. The JCAP assessor will also prov ide a copy of the client's assessment and written narrative summarizing the client's hi story and outcome results to the court, Department or POS worker, DCFS assessm ent screener and DCFS legal staff. If the client is eligible for the IV-E AODA, the Recovery Coach liaison will meet with the client immediately following the assessment to explain the services that are offered by the Recovery Coach. The JCAP assessor will set an intake appointment with a DASA provider within 48 hours of the assessment. JCAP will also forward the client's CFS 440-7 , CFS 440-5 and assessment results to the provider. JCAP w ill follow-up with the provider for thirty days or until the client is admitted to the treatment program. When a client is court-ordered to complete dr ug testing, the client's worker shall escort the client to the testing site. Results of the urinalysis ar e critical to the client's AODA assessment and must be provided to JCAP or DASA provider, whichever is appropriate. h) Client Fails to Enter Treatment Workers must coordinate a joint client visit with the DASA provider within one week after being notified that the client failed to attend an appointment to enter treatment. The Procedures 302 - Appendix A (4) SERVICES DELIVERED BY THE DEPARTMENT September 8, 2006 - PT 2006.11 visit may occur at the client's home, the DCFS office or the office of the POS or DASA provider. If the client's reason for failing to enter treatment appears reasonable, the worker must make alternative arrangemen ts for the client to enter treatment. Workers shall inform clients resistive to cooperating with an AODA assessment and/or treatment recommendations that the Depart ment has the option to do the following: Terminate the client's safety plan and take appropriate actions to ensure the safety of the children (Safety plans are designed to provide short-term control of specific threats to the child's safety and not to serve as a long te rm solution to the problem.); Complete a new risk assessment to determine the effect of the client's continued use of alcohol or drugs on his or her abilit y to supervise, prot ect or care for the children and take appropriate actions to ensure the safety of the children; Seek court ordered intervention requiring the client to cooperate with the AODA assessment and treatment recommendations; Seek involuntary termination of parental rights if the parent fails to demonstrate reasonable progress in correcting the conditions that led to the removal of the child within the time frames required by th e permanency goal of return home. i) AODA Treatment AODA treatment services must ensure the account ability on the part of the clients, the Department and other service providers. 1) Investigation Specialists, caseworkers, th e client and family shall do the following when the client enters AODA treatment: A) Ensure that the client receives the level of service from the AODA provider that is appropriate to the se verity of his or her substance abuse problem.

I) Maintain weekly contact with the c lient during the first six weeks of the client's AODA treatment. Contact with the client after the first six weeks may be no less than monthly. Contacts with children in the home and school and/or day care personnel should be in accordance with Procedures 302.388(f)(8) . J) If it is clinically required, establish the service plan task that the client complete urine toxicology and Breath alyzer testing. The task should be placed under the appropriate problem/ outcome statement and include the frequency of the testing. Coordina te urine toxicology and Breathalyzer testing either through DCFS funded dr ug testing contracts or through the DASA provider. Document all drug test ing results in the client's file and AODA treatment file. Note: Urine toxicology testing is perf ormed in a two-step procedure, initial drug screen and confirmation results. When only the initial drug screen has been completed prior to a court hearing and determined to be positive, notify the court of the initial results. Provide the court with the confirmation results as soon as they are available. If there are delays in receiving the urine toxicology screeni ng or the confirmation reports, notify the DCFS Divisions of Service Intervention. K) File all forms required for treatment, progress reports and correspondence with the DASA provider in the client's case file.

These assessments must not be made solely on the basis of the parent's completion of fixed number of days in treatment. Parent 's must also demonstrate through objective measurable behavior a willingness and readines s for increased visitation, return home of their children and reunification. Workers shall complete the Recovery Matrix - Placement Cases , CFS 440-9, to measure and document parental progress in reco very and readiness for reunification. The matrix is administered prior to the completi on of the 45 day service plan, at 90 days, prior to the first administrative case review or si x months, at nine mont hs, and prior to the second administrative case review or permanen cy hearing if there is a return home goal. Continue to use the 12-month matrix worksheet at three-month intervals as long as the goal remains return home. The CFS 440-9 must be completed with the parent if the parent's location is known and the parent is willing to pa rticipate in the assessment. Workers must use the parent's self repor t, monthly AODA treatment provider reports, urine toxicology testing report s, reports from ot her service provider s, and information obtained from family members when completing the CFS 440-9 . If the parent participated in the completion of the matrix, the parent and the worker must sign the form. The worker should submit the completed form to his or her supervisor for review and signature. The parent receives a copy of the completed form and the original is filed in the assessment section of the case file. Copies of the completed matrix are submitted to the court prior to any scheduled hearings and prior to an admi nistrative case review. Note: The CFS 440-9 cannot be used for intact family cases. A separate matrix, CFS 440-10, has been developed for those cases. Procedures 302 - Appendix A (11) SERVICES DELIVERED BY THE DEPARTMENT September 8, 2006 - PT 2006.11 n) Continuing Care (Aftercare), Recovery and Relapse Prevention An individual's and family's recovery from alcohol and other drug abuse is a lifelong process. However, traditional residentia l, intensive outpatient and AODA outpatient treatment programs are designed as time limited intervention models. Relapse prevention is an ongoing process that involves the substa nce abuser, his or her family, significant others, extended family, friends, coworkers and the treatment team. A client's discharge from treatment can be stressful and it is impor tant that continuing care services begin when treatment has been successfully completed. These services provide the client an opportuni ty to develop new behaviors, practice drug free living and relapse prevention techniques. During the planning and delivery of these services caseworkers shall: Participate with the treatment provider in an interagency staffing two to four weeks prior to the client's discharge from the AODA treatment; Complete the risk assessment in accord ance with the schedule identified in Department CERAP procedures or when necessary; Establish service plan outcomes that are appropriate to the client's presenting problems and needs; Assess and document the client's progress in achieving his or her service plan outcomes prior to each administrative case review ; Develop a continuing care pl an for the client in c onsultation with the AODA provider and the client; Maintain primary casework responsibility for the family following the client's completion of AODA treatment; Maintain contact with the client to monitor his or her compliance with the continuing care plan and to assess the need for subsequent services; Maintain contact with c ontinuing care providers. Engage the client if relapses occur; and Work with the client and his or her family on relapse prevention strategies. o) Case Closing Requirements When making a decision to close an intact or reunified substance affected family case, the worker and his or her supervisor shall staff the case using the following criteria. 1) Risk and Safety Assessments Ongoing risk and safety assessments indica te the absence of a ny threats of harm or sufficiently demonstrate that any thre ats to harm are adequately addressed within the family and/or through extended family or community. Procedures 302 - Appendix A (12) SERVICES DELIVERED BY THE DEPARTMENT September 8, 2006 - PT 2006.11 2) Service Plan Outcomes and Permanency Goal The family has achieved service plan outcomes and permanency goal and there are no new stressors that significantly imp act the stability of the family system and the safety of the children. 3) Family Functioning Workers must consider the following guidelines when assessing the family's ability to meet their cu rrent and future needs. The children show evidence of improved care in the areas of health (i.e., immunizations and well-child examinat ions are current, chronic or acute medical conditions are being treated), s upervision and responsiveness by the parent/caregiver. The risk assessment in dicates that the children are safe and there have been no additional SCR reports within the previous six months. The parent/caregiver has had negative urinalysis reports for the past six months and a LEADS check is free of current drug related or violence charges. Children in the family have access to a specific adult or adults outside the home to which they can call for assistance in the event of inappropriate activities related to substance misuse, violence, inadequate supervision; and an adult or adults within the family or extended family have assumed the responsibility for reporting any alleged in cidents of abuse or neglect to the SCR. The AODA provider confirms that the pa rent/caregiver has fully engaged in the recovery process for the past six m onths or that subs tance abuse issues have been addressed and no longer repres ent a risk to the children. If the parent/caregiver has not successfully completed a substance abuse treatment program, the worker has verified that the physical, emotional and well being needs of the children are being met and that the children are safe. And the conditions in paragraphs one and two above have been met. The parent has shown substantia l progress in assuming parental responsibilities necessary for re unification as documented on the Recovery Matrix . p) Substance Affected Families (SAF) Pro cedures Checklist (Quality Assurance and Record Compliance) The SAF Procedures Checklist , CFS 440-11 , is an inventory form used to document the completion of required screens, forms and tools for substance-affected families. Workers are only required to complete Section I of the form if the CFS 440-5 or CFS 440-8 do not Procedures 302 - Appendix A (13) SERVICES DELIVERED BY THE DEPARTMENT September 8, 2006 - PT 2006.11 result in the adult or adolescent being referred for an AODA assessment or treatment. Document the completion and case entry for th e required form/screen/tool by entering the date in the column of the family member invol ved in the task. The form shall be reviewed and signed by the worker and hi s or her supervisor prior to each administrative case review and submitted with a copy of the client's CFS 497 to the case reviewer. The original form shall be maintained in the case record. q) Services to Substance Affected Youth 1) Eligibility Requirements for Referral to DASA Treatment Services The Department must be involved w ith the youth eith er through an open case or an abuse or neglect investigation. The youth must consent to and maintain consent for the exchange of necessary information between the DAS A provider, DCFS and the court if the youth is 12 years of age or older. The youth's parent or guardian may consent to the exchange of information if the youth is less than 12 years of age.

Note: Document the results of the assessment in a SACWIS contact note and refer the youth for further assessment if required. 4) Referral for AODA Assessment Workers shall refer youth to a DASA/Child Welfare Integrated Services Program provider for an AODA assessment when the results of the CFS 440-8 indicate that the youth may have a potential probl em with alcohol or other drugs. The DASA provider is required to schedule an assessment for the youth no later than the next working day. Call the provider in the presence of the youth so that the youth can confirm the appointment. Inform the youth that he or she will be held responsible for follow through with the assessment and any recommended treatment. Assist the youth in keepi ng the appointment by making any necessary transportation or child care arrangements. Forward the completed CFS 440-8 via facsimile with any relevant LEADS information to the provider in advance of the youth's assessment appointment. Ensure that the youth has the provider's name, contact person, address, and telephone number in writing. The provider will notify the referring Department or POS worker no later than the next working day if the youth fails to attend the assessment appointment. Follow- up with the youth should occur within one week after the missed appointment. Workers must reinitiate the referral to the provider if the youth is willing to proceed with the assessment. When a DASA provider does not have th e capacity to provide or refer to treatment services at the necessary level for the youth, the provider must establish interim services for the youth until appr opriate treatment services become available. When a youth is placed on a waiting list or a provider does not have AODA treatment capacity or problems w ith a DASA/Child Welfare Integrated Procedures 302 - Appendix A (15) SERVICES DELIVERED BY THE DEPARTMENT September 8, 2006 - PT 2006.11 Service provider occurs, workers are re quired to notify the DCFS Division of Service Intervention of the situation. Note: Refer Cook County pregnant and/or parenting youth for a court benchmark hearing and notify the youth's guardian ad li tem of the referral. 5) AODA Treatment A) When a youth receives an AODA assessment and is referred for treatment but fails to enter treatment, the you th's worker shall do the following. i) Contact the youth to determine the reason or reasons why the youth failed to enter treatment. If the yout h is willing to enter treatment, contact AODA provider to reinitiate the treatment referral. ii) If the youth is unwilling to enter treatment, coordinate a meeting with the youth and the DASA provi der within one week after the youth failed to enter treatment. iii) If the youth continues to resist entering treatment, initiate a staffing or family team meeting to discuss the options for engaging the youth in accepting treatment. iv) If the youth is in placement, consider filing a supplemental petition requesting a dispositional order requiring the youth to enter AODA treatment or filing a pe tition under the provis ions of the Illinois Addicted Minor Act (705 ILCS 405/4-1). v) Advise pregnant and/or parenti ng youth of the options available to the Department if they fail to comply with treatment recommendations. Options available to the Department are listed in subsection (f). B) When a youth enters AODA treatment , the youth's worker shall provide the DASA provider the following informa tion to ensure that the provider understands the youth's child welfare i ssues that may affect the outcome of the youth's treatment: i) A copy of the youth's portion of the integrated assessment and service plan within one week of the youth's entering treatment; ii) If the youth's integr ated assessment and serv ice plan are not been completed at the time the youth enters treatment, the information must be provided no later than on e week after they are completed; Procedures 302 - Appendix A (16) SERVICES DELIVERED BY THE DEPARTMENT September 8, 2006 - PT 2006.11 iii) Notification when the youth's case is transferred to another worker or when there are other significa nt case issues such as court hearings, administrative case reviews, removal or return of children to their home, and changes in service plan outcomes. iv) Notification of the youth's paren ting status, the Department's legal relationship with the youth's ch ildren, and the current living arrangements for the children. C) The youth's DCFS or POS workers shal l also do the following while the youth is in treatment. i) Maintain weekly contact with the AODA provider either in-person or by telephone during the first six weeks of the youth's treatment. Contact with the provider may be no less than monthly after the first six weeks. ii) Maintain weekly contact with the youth during th e first six weeks of his or her AODA treatment. Contact with the youth after the first six weeks may be no less than monthly. iii) Monitor the youth's progress through progress and behavior reports provided by the DASA provi der every 30 days while the youth is in treatment. Notif y the DCFS Division of Service Intervention if DASA provider fa ils to provide these reports. iv) Workers must convene interagency staffings with the AODA provider which shall occur at least quarterly; prior to changes in the level of AODA services; prior to a change in child custody; prior to the youth's planned discha rge from treatment; or whenever events occur that might affect child safety, permanency plans or AODA treatment needs. Family meetings can fulfill interagency staffing requirements as long as all persons requir ed to attend the staffi ng are present at the family meeting. v) Ensure that parenting youth re ceive parent training that also addresses the impact of alcohol and other drug abuse on parenting and families. This training can sometimes be provided as part of the client's AODA treatment. D) Continuing Care (Aftercare), Recovery and Relapse Prevention An individual's and family's recovery from alcohol and other drug abuse is a lifelong process. However, tradit ional residential, intensive outpatient Procedures 302 - Appendix A (17) SERVICES DELIVERED BY THE DEPARTMENT September 8, 2006 - PT 2006.11 and AODA outpatient treatment progr ams are designed as time limited intervention models. Relapse prev ention is an ongoing process that involves the substance abuser, his or her family, significant others, extended family, friends, and the treatment team. A youth's discharge from treatment can be stressful and it is important that continuing care services begin when treatment has been successfully completed. These services provide the youth an opportunity to develop new behaviors, practice drug free living and rela pse prevention techniques. During the planning and delivery of these services caseworkers shall: Participate with the treatment provider in an interagency staffing two to four weeks prior to the youth's discharge from the AODA treatment; Complete the risk assessment in accordance with the schedule identified in Department CERAP procedures or when necessary; Develop a continuing care plan for the youth in consultation with the AODA provider and the youth; Maintain primary casework responsibility for the family following the client's completion of AODA treatment; Maintain contact with the youth to monitor his or her compliance with the continuing care plan and to assess the need for subsequent services; Maintain contact with c ontinuing care providers; Engage the youth if relapses occur; and Work with the youth and his or her family on relapse prevention strategies. Procedures 302 - Appendix A (18) SERVICES DELIVERED BY THE DEPARTMENT November 5, 2014 - PT 2014.19 Illinois Department of Children and Family Services Procedures 302.Appendix B - (1) 302.APPENDIX B - SERVICES FOR OLDER CAREGIVERS AND THEIR FAMILIES a) Purpose These p rocedures provide DCFS and POS staff with direction and information that will support the safety and stability of children and youth living with older caregivers ( age 6 5 and older ). The following procedures ensure that older caregivers and the children for whom they care have access to services provided by the Department of Children and Family Services and the Illinois Department on Aging (IDoA). The Illinois Department on Aging (IDoA) was created by the state Legislature in 1973 to improve the quality of life for Illinois' senior citizens by coordinating programs and services enabling older persons to preserve their independence as long as possible. It is the State agency in Illinois a uthorized to receive and dispens e Federal Older Americans Act funds, as well as specific State funds, through Area Agencies on Aging and community- based Service providers. The State of Illinois is divided into thirteen ( 13) Planning and Service Areas (PSAs). There is one Area Agency on Aging designated by the Department on Aging located within each PSA. In Illinois, twelve (12) not -for-profit agencies and one unit of local government (city of Chicago) serve as Area Agencies on Aging. Each Area Agency on Aging is responsible for planning, coordinating, and advocating for the development of a comprehensive and coordinated system of services for senior citizens within the boundaries of the individual PSA. These procedures describe the circumstances for collaboration with the IDoA , and its contracted partners , to support older caregiver families and describe the \"l ifespan approach\" that must be followed when the Department i s: Placing children with older caregivers as the result of a safety plan or at the request of the biological parent with no safety plan in place; Providing Intact Family Services ; Placing children in a foster care placement ; Moving towards achieving Permanency; Contacted for Post Adoption/Adoption Stabilization services; or Providing Extended Family Support Services (EFSP). Early supervisory consultation improves the coordination of services for youth and their older caregivers and can anticipate ag e related challenges to prevent unnecessary disruptions. Ongoing training and education regarding issues affecting older caregivers and the resources available t o older caregiver families through collaboration between the DCFS and IDoA will be provided for all child protection and child welfare staff and is available through the DCFS Office of Training and Professional Development. SERVICES DELIVERED BY THE DEPARTMENT November 5, 2014 - PT 2014.19 Illinois Department of Children and Family Services Procedures 302.Appendix B - (2) b) Background : Illinois Caregiving Communities One in four Illinois households takes on the role of providing care to an older family member or friend , and over 100,000 Illinois grandparents are caring for their grandchildren. The Illinois Department on Aging Family Caregiver Support Program offers services targeted to both of these caregiver populations. Whether caring for an older family member or a grandchild, the caregiving role often evolves over time. What may be a stable and secure placement at t he onset of the placement or permanency can unexpectedly and rapidly change in an older adult population. A sudden illness can turn an independent person into someone who needs assistance on a daily bas is. As an individual ages, their alertness, vigor, physical and cognitive well- being changes . Likewise , the needs of developing children change over time. Understanding issues of aging and what is \"normal\" often changes over time and can be confusing. It is imperative that workers evaluate older caregiver families utilizing a Lifespan approach and work to assess the on- going viability of the placement in terms of safety and stability for both the children and the older caregiver. A lifespan approach looks at the developmental stages of children and pairs knowledge of what a particular child can or cannot do at each stage of their development with the ongoing capability of the older caregiver to meet the child's needs until the child reaches the age of eighteen. c) Definitions \"The Aging Network \" means the network of State agencies, A rea Agencies on A ging, Title VI grantees, and the Administration; organizations that are providers of direct services to older individuals; or are institutions of higher education; and receive funding under the Older America ns Act. \"Back -up Caregiver Plan \" means a supplemental plan through which a parent or guardian plans and arranges for a second person to become responsible for a child's legal, economic, educational and personal safety and well being when the caregiver is no longer able to care for the child . If conceived and executed properly , the back -up plan allows for the child to remain within the family or extended family circle which contributes to the stability of the placement and the well-being of the child . The back -up plan can also allow the child to be placed with a person who is not a family member but who will , with the aid of legal, social, mental health and community services , provide a long- term and nurturing placement. Please refer to Rule 302.40 (d) (2), Department Service Goals . \"Capacity\" means an individual's ability to make an informed decision s uch as capacity to make a will, marry, enter into a contract, vote, drive a car, stand trial in a criminal prosecution, etc. SERVICES DELIVERED BY THE DEPARTMENT November 5, 2014 - PT 2014.19 Illinois Department of Children and Family Services Procedures 302.Appendix B - (3) \"Competence\" refers to the degree of mental soundness necessary to make decisions about a specific issue or to carry out a specific act. All adults are presumed to be competent unless adjudicated otherwise by a court. Legal Competenc e vs. Capacity Although decision- making capacity and competence both describe a person's ability to make decisions, they are not synonymous. Whereas competence is determined by a court of law, decision -making capacity is a clinical assessment. Competenc e is a legal term - to say a person is incompetent indicates that a court has ruled the person unable to make valid decisions and has appointed a guardian to make decisions for the person. In contrast to legal competence, decision -making capacity is assessed by clinicians as an everyday part of clinical care. Decision -making capacity is defined as the ability to understand and appreciate the nature and consequences of decisions . It is important to respect and understand the older caregiver's right to self -determination. This include s the older adult's right to make decisions that may not be in their own best interest . However, i f the se decisions affect the long- term safety and stability of the child , the Department must be involved. It is the responsibility of the Department to make placement decisions and/or changes based on the best interests of the child regardless of the older caregiver's right to self determination. \"Determination of Need\" or \"DON\" is an assessment tool used in the Community Care Program (CCP) and as a pre- admission screening tool to nursing homes to determine if a person needs enough help with their activities of daily living (ADLs) to qualify for assistance or placement. \"Grandparents Raising Grandchildren (GRG) \" means a program through which the Illinois Department on Aging provides assistance to grandparents and other relatives (regardless of their age) who are raising related children. The program assist s relatives who are seeking resources and referrals to support their efforts to provide safe, stable and loving homes for children. The program establishes and funds support groups, legal services, respite, outreach, counseling, and gap filling funds. \"Life span Approach \" means the perspective which must be considered when placing children with older caregivers. This perspective considers changes occurring throughout people's lifetimes. In most people's lives, such things as alertness, vigor, and physical and mental well -being change as aging occurs. Plans made at one point in a family's life may no longer be viable years down the line. A lifespan approach recognizes that older caregivers will experience physical or cognitive changes as they age and that some of these changes may affect older caregivers' abilities to provide a healthy and safe environment not only for themselves but also for the children in thei r care. Further, use of a lifespan approach looks at the developmental stages of children and pairs knowledge of what a particular child can or cannot do at each stage with the SERVICES DELIVERED BY THE DEPARTMENT November 5, 2014 - PT 2014.19 Illinois Department of Children and Family Services Procedures 302.Appendix B - (4) on-going capability of the older caregiver to meet the child's needs until the child reaches the age of majority (18). \"Minor Requiring Authoritative Intervention ( MRAI )\" means any minor under 18 years of age who : is absent from home without the consent of a parent, guardian or custodian; is beyond the control of his or her parent, guardian or custodian, or circumstances which constitute a substantial or immediate danger to the minor's physical safety; after being taken into limited custody (21 days for the first instance and five for the second, third, fourth) and offered interim crisis intervention servi ces, where available, refuses to return home after the minor and his or her parent, guardian or custodian, and cannot agree to an arrangement for an alternative voluntary residential placement or to the continuation of such placement. \"Dependency \" or \"Dependent Child\" means a child who is without proper medical or other remedial care recognized under State law or other care necessary for his or her well being through no fault, neglect or lack of concern by his parents, guardian or custodian, provided that no order may be made terminating parental rights, nor may a minor removed from the custody of his or her parents for longer than 6 months, pursuant to an adjudication as a dependent minor under this subdivision (c), unless it is found to be in his or her best interest by the court automatically closes as provided under section 2-31 of this Act. 705 ILCS 405/2- 4(1) \"Older Individual \" as used in these procedures means , an individual who is 65 years of age or olde r. Note: The Older Americans Act allows for deliver y of services to older caregivers 55 and older who are \"Grandparent or Older Individual Who Is a Relative Caregiver ,\" defined as a grandparent or step grandparent of a child, or a relative of a child by blood, marriage or adoption, who is 55 years of age or older and; lives with the child; and is the primary caregiver of the child \"Service Providers\" means community based- providers, representing a key segment of the Aging Network in Illinois because they provide the programs and direct services to older persons. The success that the Aging Network has had in linking older persons with needed services is one tangible result of cooperation and coordination between the Department on Aging, the Area Agencies on Aging and local service providers. Care Coordination Units (CCUs), created in 1983, function as gatekeepers to the State long- term care system by coordinating and integrating community -based long -term care services available throughout the entire aging network for and on behalf of older persons. SERVICES DELIVERED BY THE DEPARTMENT November 5, 2014 - PT 2014.19 Illinois Department of Children and Family Services Procedures 302.Appendix B - (5) d) DCFS - ID oA Intergovernmental Agreement With th e agreement, IDoA and DCFS delineate their respective roles, responsibilities, and resources associated with ensuring that the parties collaborate to ensure that older caregivers are provided the appropriate needs assessments, services and referrals in order to provide stability for both the caregiver and any child( ren) living in the home. Information shall be shared between the parties in order to ensure stability for children living in the home of an older caregiver and to ensure appropriate services are provided to the older caregiver family. The Agreement faci litates a joint effort between DCFS and IDoA to obtain service s for older caregiver families. Pursuant to the Illinois Children and Family Services Act, 20 ILCS 505/1 et seq. , DCFS is the entity authorized to provide social services to children and their families, to operate children's institutions, and to provide certain other rehabilitative and residential services. IDoA provides a comprehensive and coordinated service system for the State's aging population. As the Agreement applies to older adults who are caregivers to minor children for whom DCFS has, or may have, responsibility for, DCFS is required to do the following: 1) Assure the safety and well -being of the child; 2) Maintain effective communications b etween DCFS/POS staff and IDoA /Aging Network ; 3) Support and offer services to older caregivers when there are concerns about the caregiver's ability to safely care for th e child in their home over time (lifespan approach); 4) Notify older caregivers of the concerns noted and any referrals made to the Aging Network ; 5) Train direct service staff and supervisors on all of the policies and procedures relevant to the Agreement; 6) Implement and maintain a record -keeping system; and 7) Review compliance by Department service providers. e) Reporting Requirements It is the duty of DCFS and IDoA to serve and protect societ y's most vulnerable children , disabled, and elderly. To this end, staff (full time or contractual) of both agencies are required to report to the appropriate hotline whenever incidents of abuse, neglect or exploitation of children , the disabled, or the elderly are suspected. SERVICES DELIVERED BY THE DEPARTMENT November 5, 2014 - PT 2014.19 Illinois Department of Children and Family Services Procedures 302.Appendix B - (6) Suspected incidents abuse, neglect or exploitation to the above populations shall be reported as follows; Suspected incidents of child abuse or neglect shall be reported to DCFS by calling the Child Abuse Hotline at (800) 252-2873 (24/7 statewide ). Suspected incidents of abuse, financial exploitation or neglect of an older person, or persons with disabilities aged 18-59 shall be reported to IDoA by calling the Adult Protective Services Hotline at (866) 800-1409 (24/7 statewide). f) Meeting Service Needs : Upon the initial placement, or as early as possible in the life of the case, if a caregiver is age 65 or older and the use of the lifespan approach suggests that given the age of the child and the age of the caregiver it is not likely that the caregiver will be able to care for the child until the age of 18, the placing or Permanency worker shall conduct a d iligent search in accordance with Administrative Procedures #22, Diligent Search to identify and locate viable relatives to care for the child to the age of 18. The diligent search shall include but not be limited to : non-custodial parents, maternal and paternal relatives , child -centered collaterals (children 4 years and older , if developmentally appropriate, should be asked to help identify their collaterals ), and other adults the child may have a relationship with in their family, school, church, synagogue, mosque, and neighborhood. These efforts shall be documented as required per A dministrative Procedures #22. The Integrated Assessment (IA) Clinical Screener , in partnership with the Permanency worker, within the first 45 days of the case will assess the needs and strengths of all parents/guardians and substitute caregivers. For any parent/guardian or substitute caregiver age 65 or older , the Clinical Screener will assess the caregiver's ability to meet the child/ youth's needs of safety, permanency, and well -being using a l ifespan approach. IA recommendations will be based on the child/ youth's need for placement and stability. Linkage to IDoA resources will also be recommended as needed. When the Permanency w orker or Clinical Screener identify concerns about the older caregiver's capacity to safely care for the child and/or him or herself in the home, the worker shall notify her/his supervisor and contact the IDoA Senior HelpLine (1-800-252-8966) to request a ssistance for the older caregiver . A ssistance may be limited to provision of supports and services available to the older relative caregiver or may involve a comprehensive assessment of the older caregiver by a Care Coordination Unit, an agency contracted wi th IDoA for a specific geographic area. The Permanency worker can refer the older caregiver for an assessment or for adult protective services by calling the Senior HelpLine (1-800-252-8966), provide information and resources for the older caregiver , and participate in staffings regarding the older caregiver 's famil y. With a completed and signed CFS 600- 3 Consent for the Release of Information , the Permanency worker an d supervisor are permitted to share information about the older caregiver's overall functional capacities in their case SERVICES DELIVERED BY THE DEPARTMENT November 5, 2014 - PT 2014.19 Illinois Department of Children and Family Services Procedures 302.Appendix B - (7) planning , including but not limited to , the information gathered for the caregiver section on the CANS and the IA. A signed and completed CFS 600 -3 is NOT required when calling Adult Protective Services to report suspe cted abuse, financial exploitation or neglect of an older person or persons with disabilities . Assistance for older caregivers may be requested by calling the following numbers: Senior HelpLine: (8:30 a.m. - 5 p.m., Monday through Friday) 1-800-252-8966 1-888-206-1327 (TTY) aging.ilsenior@illinois.gov Or as mentioned above, t o report suspected abuse, financial exploitation or neglect of an older person or persons with disabilities aged 18-59: Adult Protective Services Hotline: ( Calls 24/7 statewide) 1-866-800-1409 1-888-206-1327 (TTY). g) Requirements of DCFS / POS Child Protection Specialist s and Permanency Workers 1) DCFS and POS A) Initial Contact Department and POS staff who place children and/or work with older caregiver families shall ensure that the placement is in the best interest of the child and the placement is identified as an older caregiver placement. The Child Protection Specialist or Permanency worker must obtain from the older caregiver a completed and signed CFS 600- 3 Consent for the Release of Information in order to facilitate the exchange of information between DCFS, IDoA , and potential service providers . The DCFS or POS worker shall also give to the older ca regivers the CFS 1050-86, Grandparents and Other Relatives Raising Children pamphlet, which provides information on how to contact the Aging Network for assistance for themselves or those in the home for whom they provide care (e.g. spouse, parent, sibling, or disabled adult children) , including the children placed by DCFS/POS. Each DCFS Regional Office shall maintain a list of resources and provide DCFS and POS workers with instructions regarding how to access them. DCFS and POS workers shall document in a contact note when the y provided older caregiver information regarding services for older caregivers and their families and explain any circumstances under which this information was not provided. SERVICES DELIVERED BY THE DEPARTMENT November 5, 2014 - PT 2014.19 Illinois Department of Children and Family Services Procedures 302.Appendix B - (8) B) Placement Considerations for Children When select ing a placement for children, DCFS and POS Child Protection Specialists and Permanency w orkers must be guided by the caregiver's capacity to meet the unique and diverse needs of each child to be placed and the placement must be in accordance to Procedures 301.60, Placement Selection Criteria . As stated above, all placements are to be made consistent with the best interests of the children . The Department will make diligent efforts to place children in a home that can maintain sibling groups together and meet their long- term needs. When a child is placed in the care of an older caregiver as defined in these procedures, it is critical that the placement be in a safe environment and be able to meet the child's future needs , including achieving the child's permanency goal. The child's worker may need to refer to IDoA for resources for the older caregiver to help them maintain a safe and healthy placement and permanency for the child. Services for the older caregiver obtained through a referral to IDoA, or a change in placemen t, may be required when an older caregiver experiences age- related impairments or challenges that impact their ability to safely care for the child and/or themselves. Age related impairments or challenges include but are not limited to: i) C ognitive impairments due to Alzheimer's or other dementing diseases ; ii) D eteriorating physical health ; iii) Sudden onset of significant health problems; or iv) T he need to become a caregiver to another family member such as a spouse, sibling or parent . C) Meeting Service Needs of Older Caregivers and Children in their Care As stated above, i f at any time following the initial placement of a child/ren with an older caregiver, concern s about the placement arise related to the ongoing ability of the older adult to safely care for the child/ren in the home, the worker shall notify her/his supervisor to determine whether immediate action is needed on behalf of the child and shall contact the IDoA Senior HelpLine (1-800-252-8966) to request assistance for the older caregiver. Assistance may be limited to provision of supports and services available to the older caregiver or may involve a comprehensive assessment of the older caregiver by a Care Coordination Unit, an agency contracted for a specific geographic area with IDoA . The worker can refer the older caregiver for a comprehensive assessment that may trigger an array of services for older adults. SERVICES DELIVERED BY THE DEPARTMENT November 5, 2014 - PT 2014.19 Illinois Department of Children and Family Services Procedures 302.Appendix B - (9) This comprehensive assessment, referred to as a Determination of Need (DON) , utilizes normed and standardized tools to assess older adults across multiple domains including functional and cognitive capabilities, finances and assets. Services are matched to meet the needs determined by the assessment. Identified services are designed to help senior citizens remain living independently in their own homes. The worker and supervisor are responsible for including information about the older care giver's overall functional capacities in their case planning including, but not limited to , the information gathered for the Caregiver section s on the CANS and Integrated Assessment . 2) Referrals from the Aging Network When the State Central Registry (SCR) is called regarding concerns about the older caregiver's continuing capacity to care for the child, it typically results in a referral to the Extended Family Suppor t Program (EFSP); however, a call may result in a child abuse or neglect investigation, information related to a pending investigation , to an open service case, or a Child Welfare Services Referral . Callers may also report if the child is out of the control of the older caregiver or \"MRAI, \" or if the child is a \"dependent child\" as defined in these procedures . EFSP p rovides short -term services to a child residing in the care of a relative for which short -term interventions will stabilize the relative household and allow for continued care of the child in the home . A c hild served by this program may not have a legal relationship with the Department and must be referred for EFSP services through the State Central Register (SCR) , Child Protection, Intact Family Worker, the Post Adoption Unit, or an Aging Network /IDoA caseworker calling SCR to complete a referral in the presence of the older caregiver. However, if SCR is not available and needs to return the call to the Aging Network /IDoA caseworker at a time when the older caregiver is no longer available to be on the call, the SCR call floor worker may take an EFSP referral with the information that the IDoA representative provides when such a referral is appropriate. A) Extended Family Support Program Services Casework interventions provided by the EFSP provider for the child may include the following: i) Crisis intervention and other short -term interventions to address issues within the family that threaten to destabilize the relative household and allow for continued care of the child in that household; SERVICES DELIVERED BY THE DEPARTMENT November 5, 2014 - PT 2014.19 Illinois Department of Children and Family Services Procedures 302.Appendix B - (10) ii) Enable the relative to obtain guardianship of the child through probate court. Facilitation may include assistance obtaining required documents and, when necessary, payment of fees with EFSP emergency cash assistance; iii) Assistance in obtai ning pro- bono legal services. (When pro-bono legal services are not available, legal fees may be paid with EFSP emergency cash assistance allocated to the family.) ; iv) Assist the relative caregiver with registering the child in the local school; v) Advocacy to assist the family in obtaining benefits which may include Medicaid, food stamps, SSI housing supplements, day care, and other benefits for which the family may be eligible; vi) Referral and brokerage of needed services that may include employment, housing, budgeting, mental health and medical services, parenting training, counseling, and therapy; vii) Cash assistance provided through the Extended Family Support Program Emergency Cash Assistance as specified below ; viii) Referrals to the Illinois Department on Aging (IDoA). B) Extended Family Support Program Emergency Cash Assistance Families must have an open EFSP case before the family can access EFSP emergency cash assistance funds. Emergency cash assistance may be used to purchase goods and services that the family requires in order to obtain guardianship or to support stabilization of the child's living arrangement . Goods (hard services) purchased with emergency cash assistance may include beds, dressers, other furniture as required, appliances, and food in emergency situations . Emergency cash may also be used for security deposits and legal services. ( Emergency cash assistance amounts will vary depending on the individual needs of each case; however, it is limited to an average of $500.00 per case per agency .)

BACKGROUND Procedures 300 Appendix G CERAP /Procedures 315 Appendix A CERAP (Current) Safety Plans Safety plans are voluntary, temporary and short term measures designed to control serious and immediate threats to children's safety. They must be adequate to ensure the child's safety and be as minimally disruptive to the child and family as is reasonably possible. Additionally, families can request that a safety plan be modified or terminated at any time. The safety plan will indicate which s afety threat or threats have led to the need for a s afety plan according to the completion of the CERAP. The safety plan will require a written description of what will be done or what actions will be taken to protect children, who will be responsible for implementing the components of the safety plan and how/who will monitor it. It is important that safety plans be developed with the family to control specific threats and that the family understands the mechanism for ending each safety plan. Under no circumstance is a safety plan to serve as the solution to a long- term problem. A family may request at any time to modify or terminate the safety plan. When a safety plan is implemented , it should be documented on a CFS 1441-A , Safety Plan when it is likely that a child could be moderately or severely harmed now or in the very near future. The safety plan must be developed whenever there are protective efforts that would reasonably ensure child safety and permit the child to remain in their caregiver's custody . After the safety plan has been developed, it must be immediately implemented to ensure that all of the designated tasks are completed effectively. The safety plan should contain t imeframes for implementation and continued monitoring . IV. OVERVIEW Public Act 98 -0830 amended Section 21 (f) of the Children and Family Services Act [20 ILCS 505/21] and required the Department or POS caseworker to provide information to each parent, guardian and adult caregiver participating in a safety plan explaining their rights and responsibilities. These updated forms add additional information to the Safety Plan Rights and Respons ibilities forms with the following information : The investigator and caseworker shall implement a safety plan only when DCFS has a basis to take protective custody of a child(ren) and the safety plan is an alternative to protective custody; The investigator and caseworker shall explain to the parent(s)/guardian(s) the safety plan alternatives and that the parent(s)/guardian(s) have a voluntary choice to enter into the safety plan as an alternative to protective custody and to choose the individual(s) respo nsible for supervising or monitoring the safety plan if such person(s) is/are determined to be qualified by DCFS; The investigator and caseworker shall modify the safety plan if the family's circumstances change or if the participants request modification s, including a change in the person(s) preferred by the parent (s)/guardian (s) to supervise or monitor the safety plan or serve as a temporary caregiver ; 3 Terminate the safety plan as soon as the investigator and/or supervisor determine there is no longer a legal basis to take protective custody and provide the parent(s)/guardian(s) with the Safety Plan Termination form; and The Department or POS representative shall ensure that the safety plan is reviewed and approved by their respective supervisor.

Involvement of Law Enforcement SERVICES DELIVERED BY THE DEPARTMENT April 17 , 2017 - P.T. 2017.02 Illinois Department of Ch ildren and Family Services Procedures 302 - Appendix C (2) I. Purpose The purpose of these procedures is to establish requirements and provide instructions for Department and Purchase of Service (POS) staff when children for whom the Department is legally responsible are believed to be the vict ims of human t rafficking . The level of Department involvement will be individualized and in correlation to the assessed safety and risks of the child. The Illinois Safe Children Act (2010) eradicates the pejorative term \"juvenile prostitute\" from Illinois statutes and requires that minors engaged in commercial sexual activities be treated as victims of human trafficking and not as juvenile offenders. The Illinois Safe Children Act also mandates that children be identified and served through IDCFS as minor victims of trafficking with access to all the services and support provided through federal and state law s. Children who are victims of human t rafficking often do not perceive the inherent risks or see themselves as victims. This is especially true for children who are identified as \"high risk.\" Because of the potential dangers to the child, if the child 's worker has reason to believe the child is a victim of human t rafficking, the worker is to consider the event as requiring intensive intervention . II. Definitions \"Coercion\" means threats of serious harm to, or physical restraint of, any person; any scheme, plan or pattern intended to cause a person to believe that failure to perform an act would result in serious harm to, or physical restraint against, any person; or the abuse or threatened abuse of the legal process. \"Commercial Sex Act\" means any sex act on account of which anything of value is given to or received by any person. [U.S.C. \u00a77102(8)] \"Commercial sexual exploitation of a child \" (CSEC) means the use of any person under the age of 18 for sexual purposes in exchange for cash or in-kind f avors; it can occur between a child and a customer, the pimp/trafficker of others (including family members) who profit from children for these purposes. \"Force\" means the use of any form of physical force, including rape, beatings and confinement to cont rol victims. \"Forced labor\" means the obtaining of labor or services of another person through any one of the following prohibited means: (a) force, threats of force, physical restraint, or threats of physical restraint; (b) serious harm or threats of s erious harm; (c) abuse or threatened abuse of the law or legal process; or (d) a scheme, plan, or pattern intended to cause or to believe that, if the person did not perform such labor and services, that the person would suffer serious harm or physical res traint. SERVICES DELIVERED BY THE DEPARTMENT April 17 , 2017 - P.T. 2017.02 Illinois Department of Ch ildren and Family Services Procedures 302 - Appendix C (3) \"Fraud\" means false offers that induce people into trafficking situations. \"Harboring\" means to receive or hold a person in a place without legal authority. \"High Risk Child\" means that the child's safety is severely compromised for one or more of the following reasons: The child is pregnant and/or parenting; The child has severe emotional problems that if not treated will place the child at severe risk ; The child has a developmental disability that impairs the child's ability to care for her or himself ; or The child has a serious alcohol and/or substance problem. \"Involuntary servitude\" means a condition of servitude induced by means of any scheme, plan, or pattern intended to cause a person to believe that, if the person did not enter into or continue in such condition, that a person or another person would suffer serious harm or physical restraint; or, the abuse or threatened abuse of the legal process. \"Labor\" means work of economic or financial value. \"Recruitment\" means the process of enl isting or convincing a person to join with another person for a stated purpose. \"Services\" means a relationship between a victim and an individual in which the victim performs activities under the supervision of or for the benefit of the individual . Commercial sexual activity and sexually - explicit performances are forms of service under this definition. \"Servitude\" means slavery; the condition where a person is forced to perform labor or services, against his or her will, by another person. \"Sexually -explicit performance\" means a live, recorded, broadcast (including Internet) or public act or show intended to arouse or satisfy the sexual desires or appeal to the prurient interests of patrons. \"Sex Trafficking\" means the recruitment, harboring, transportation, provision, or obtaining of a person for the purpose of a commercial sex act. SERVICES DELIVERED BY THE DEPARTMENT April 17 , 2017 - P.T. 2017.02 Illinois Department of Ch ildren and Family Services Procedures 302 - Appendix C (4) III. Identifica tion of Human Trafficking Federal law defines trafficking in persons as: sex trafficking in which a commercial sex act is induced by force, fraud, or coercion, or in which the person induced to perform such act has not attained 18 years of age; or the recruitment, harboring, transportation, provision, obtaining, patronizing or soliciting of a person for labor or services, through the use of force, fraud, or coercion for the purpose of subjection to involuntary servitude, peonage, debt bondage or slavery. [22 U.S.C. \u00a77102(10)] Note : For the purpose of the se procedures , victims of human t rafficking include all youth for whom the Department is legally responsible, including those between the ages of 18-21. Sex trafficking of minors occurs when minors are involved in commercial acts, including prostitution , sexually explicit performance or production of pornography. Sex trafficking cases involving minors do not require force, fraud, or coercion as they do for adults over 18 years. Therefore, any person under 18 years of age engaged in any type of commercial sexual activity is deemed a victim of human t rafficking under Illinois and Federal laws. Trafficki ng victims do not need to be in fact \"locked up\" by their trafficker, and sometimes attend school and participate in other normal activities. It is important to note that although the word \"trafficking\" implies movement, a victim of trafficking may never cross international or state lines. Workers shall utilize the following list of indicators to identify possible human trafficking . It is important to note that not every child who exhibits one of these indicators is a victim of human t rafficking. Alth ough an indicator may warrant concern, none of these indicators stand alone or exist without context. History of running away or current status as a runaway; The child makes references to travel to other cities while on run; The child makes reference to b eing coerced into performing illegal activities ; The child makes reference to having a pimp or \"daddy\"; The child has current signs of physical abuse and/or sexually transmitted diseases; The child seems submissive or fearful; Inexplicable appearance of ex pensive gifts, clothing, manicures, pedicures or other costly items ; Presence of an older boyfriend/ girlfriend ; Withdrawal or lack of interest in previous activities ; Tattoos or branding (could be pimp/trafficker's name); Possession of a cell phone; Postings on social networking sites; Child was located in a hotel/motel; The child has been isolated from sources of support and protection; SERVICES DELIVERED BY THE DEPARTMENT April 17 , 2017 - P.T. 2017.02 Illinois Department of Ch ildren and Family Services Procedures 302 - Appendix C (5) The child makes reference to sexual situations that are beyond age -specific norms; The child engages in sexually provocative behaviors, is promiscuous and/or has unprote cted sex with multiple partners; or The child makes references to terminology of the commercial sex industry. IV. Prevention of Human Trafficking Youth for which the Department is legally responsible are extremely vulnerable to , and are actively targeted by traffickers. Prevention is the key to building the protective factors and resiliencies of the youth living within the child welfare system and to deter the recruitment methods of individuals wanting to exploit them. P roper identification of possible trafficking is critical to ensuring the safety of youth in care. A comprehensive response to possible trafficking will increase the success of removing youth from dangerous and often life threatening situations bef ore actual trafficking occurs. Caseworkers should refer to Section III of th ese procedures, particularly for youth placed in residential facilities or group homes , to identify possible risk factors for human trafficking. If a caseworker suspects a youth is vulnerable to human t rafficking, he/she shall engage the youth with a discussion regarding the risks and realities of human t rafficking. The caseworker must also discuss possible risk with the youth's caregiver and document the discussions with the youth and caregiver in a Contact note . After consultation with supervisor, the consultation, discussions and known risk factors regarding human t rafficking must be documented in a Supervisory note. The note will include a description of known risk factors and actions needed to deter the youth from possible human t rafficking. Additional information regarding prevention of human t rafficking can be obtained via D - Net, under the \"Human Trafficking\" link or by contacting the Statewid e Human Trafficking Coordinator via \"DCFS Human Trafficking\" mailbox on Outlook. V. Reporting Requirements for Caregivers, Workers and Supervisors a) Reporting Requirements for Caregivers Caregivers, including foster parents, relative caregivers, and staff of residential facilities, shall immediately report alleged human t rafficking to: 1) the child's case manager/worker; and 2) the DCFS Child Abuse Hotline (1-800-25- ABUSE) also known as the State Central Register (SCR) in accordance with Department Rules 300, Appendix B , The Al legation System . SERVICES DELIVERED BY THE DEPARTMENT April 17 , 2017 - P.T. 2017.02 Illinois Department of Ch ildren and Family Services Procedures 302 - Appendix C (6) b) Reporting Requirements for Workers When a worker learns that a youth for whom the Department is legall y responsible is a victim of human t rafficking, the worker shall immediately: 1) Notify the DCFS Guardian and the child's Guardian ad Litem; 2) Notify the child's counselor, therapist or mental health professional if applicable; 3) Repo rt the alleged trafficking to SCR in accordance with Department Rules 300, Appendix B (if not already done by caregiver) ; Note: If a report of child abuse/neglect is not accepted by SCR (or the child is 18 or over), the worker will have in- person contact with the child to engage the child, ascertain information and reduce the possibility of the child leaving care. Collateral contacts must also be made with individuals who may be able to provide information regarding the alleged human trafficking (e.g., residential/group home staff or foster family, peers, school personnel, family members, etc); 4) Document in SACWIS via human t rafficking indicator in the chi ld's record (required for the initial report of human t rafficking only); 5) Complete the CFS 119 Unusual Incident Report (UIR) , using code L13 (Human Trafficking of a DCFS Ward) on Part 2 of the CFS 119, to report human t rafficking in accordance with Depa rtment Procedures 331, Unusual Incidents Involving Department Clients, Employees, and Facilities; 6) If the youth is missing from care, refer to Procedures 329 , Locating and Returning Missing, Runaway and Abducted Children, and select the \"Human T rafficki ng/Prostitution\" risk factor on the CFS 1014, Missing Children Recovery Report form, if applicable. The worker shall document all known or suspected information regarding the alleged human t rafficking in a case note including but not limited to : i. When and where the alleged trafficking occurred ; ii. Name(s) , including all \"AKAs,\" and date(s) of birth or age(s) of alleged trafficker(s); iii. Describe the relationship of the trafficker to the youth/how did they come in contact with one another; iv. Methods of contact between the trafficker and the child (internet (specific: email, social networking sites, chat rooms, etc) , cell phone, in-person, peers, family members, etc; v. Alias names or dates of birth for the youth used. SERVICES DELIVERED BY THE DEPARTMENT April 17 , 2017 - P.T. 2017.02 Illinois Department of Ch ildren and Family Services Procedures 302 - Appendix C (7) c) Requirements for Supervisors 1) Upon notification by the worker of a child's involvement in human trafficking, the supervisor will immediately confirm the worker has completed all of the required reports and contacts as described in S ection IV of these procedures ; 2) The supervisor will confirm that th e human t rafficking indicator in SACWIS has been selected; 3) The supervisor will review the case note (s) completed by the worker to ensure the required information regarding the trafficking has been documented; 4) The supervisor will assist the worker in developing and implementing a plan to provide an appropriate change of placement if needed, and services for the child. A summary of the discussion and plan shall be documented in a Supervisory note. VI. The Role of the Child Intake and Recovery Unit (CIRU) Youth involved in human t rafficking are almost always missing from placement when trafficking occurs, therefore including the DCFS Child Intake and Recovery Unit (CIRU) is crucial to the process of identification and recovery. a) CIRU will forward any inf ormation regarding a missing youth and human trafficking via \"DCFS Human Trafficking\" mailbox on Outlook to the Statewide Human Trafficking Coordinator , and also to the worker; b) CIRU will document the information in the missing child section in SACWIS to aid in current or future incidents of the child missing from care ; c) When appropriate and necessary, CIRU will share information with law enforcement and shelter staff, to ensure the child's safety. SERVICES DELIVERED BY THE DEPARTMENT April 17 , 2017 - P.T. 2017.02 Illinois Department of Ch ildren and Family Services Procedures 302 - Appendix C (8) VII. Assessment and Safety Workers, in consultation with their supervisors, are responsible for determining the immediate actions to be taken when a youth is involved in human t rafficking. The supervisor and worker shall assess any immediate safety concerns, identifying the actions that are necessary to minimize any risks and ensure those actions are taken as expeditiously as possible. A trafficked child can be either abducted by his/her trafficker(s) or lured to meet them. Consideration should be given to moving the child to a new placement to ensure the child's safety when necessary. If the child is moved to a new placement, strict confidentiality (only those with an absolute need to know the location of the new placement should be informed) is necessary to avoid the trafficker(s) from obtaining information on the child's whereabouts. Consideration should be given to the role of those in contact with the youth and the specific reason why he/she would need to be made aware of the youth's new placement location. Additionally, the trafficked youth and other youth at the facility or placement should not be informed of where the tr afficked youth is being moved. Every measure possible should be taken to protect the privacy and identity of child victims in order to ensure their safety and security. On rare occasions it may be necessary to move a youth quickly and confidentially to avoid possible abduction and/or harm. On those occasions the Statewide Human Trafficking Coordinator will work directly with the Chief of the Bureau of Operations or his/her designe e and the assigned caseworker and supervisor to facilitate such a rapid and confidential placement. Once the confidential placement has been accomplished the worker can proceed with development of the Human Trafficking Supervision Plan as described in Section VII (b) below. Note: When trafficked victims are moved, other youth in the placement known to traffickers remain at risk . Measures should be taken to secure t he facility or placement by notifying law enforcement and informing all facility staff or caregivers of any possible threat. a) Risk Factors Workers shall refer to the list below to determine any current or future human trafficking safety threat to the child or another child in care . Any of the following factors may contribute to increased ri sks and must be addressed when assessing safety and minimizing risks. These factors include: 1) The child is in contact with an alleged trafficker; 2) The alleged trafficker kno ws the location of the child's placement; 3) The alleged trafficker has threatened to harm the child or others close to the child (including other foster children in the same placement); SERVICES DELIVERED BY THE DEPARTMENT April 17 , 2017 - P.T. 2017.02 Illinois Department of Ch ildren and Family Services Procedures 302 - Appendix C (9) 4) The child is in contact with other people involved in human t rafficking ; 5) The child has a history of running from placement; 6) The child states intent to e ngage in trafficking in the future; 7) The child expr esses a fear for his/her safety; 8) The child has previously recruited or may attempt to recruit another child to become involved in human t rafficking. b) The Human Trafficking Supervision Plan If based on f actors outlined above in Section VII(a) , the child is determined to be at a high risk of harm from a trafficker or subsequent commercial sexual exploitation , the worker shall convene a Child and Family Team meeting (CFTM), to develop a Human Trafficking Supervision Plan , to ensure the child has appropriate supervision in all areas of daily life . The Child and Family Team must include, among others : the youth, if age 12 or older , the primary caregiver , the caseworker and his/her supervisor, the youth's ther apist or other treatment provider who is familiar with the youth's history, behavior and living arrangements , and other adults responsible for the youth's supervision. Describe in detail (includ ing phone and internet access) how an effective level of supervision will be provided to the youth during the following routine activities: When planned supervision is required in the placement, the caseworker shall discuss the required supervision with the caregiver/facility staff and document the details of the p lanned supervision in a contact note . When planned supervision is required in the school setting, the caseworker shall discuss the required supervision with school personnel and document the details of the planned supervision in a c ontact note. The casew orker will obtain all the required signatures on the CFS 600-3, Consent for Release of Information form regarding the youth who requires planned supervision. When planned supervision is required for the youth to participate in recreational or community ac tivities, the caseworker shall discuss the required supervision with the person or staff responsible for the supervision and document the details of the planned supervision in a c ontact note. The caseworker will obtain all the required signatures on the C FS 600-3, regarding the youth who requires planned supervision. The caseworker will have a discussion with the youth regarding the Human Trafficking Supervision Plan and the safety measures the child will take if he/she has any contact whatsoever with the trafficker or with another person acting on behalf of the trafficker . Any specific tasks for the child regarding his/her safety shall be included in the child's Service Plan . The discussion with the youth will be documented in a contact note . SERVICES DELIVERED BY THE DEPARTMENT April 17 , 2017 - P.T. 2017.02 Illinois Department of Ch ildren and Family Services Procedures 302 - Appendix C (10) The casew orker and supervisor will monitor the plan weekly via phone or email and monthly in- person with the caregiver/facility staff and any other staff/personnel currently providing supervision to the youth, to revise and/or terminate the plan as needed. The cas eworker's review of the Human Trafficking Supervision Plan will be documented in case note . c) Termination of the Human Trafficking Supervision Plan Termination of the Human Trafficking Supervision Plan will be determined at a CFTM, which must include, among others : the youth, if age 12 or older, the primary caregiver, the caseworker and his/her supervisor , and the youth's therapist or other treatment provider , and other adults responsible for the youth's supervision. CFT M participants must consider the following factors when considering the need for an ongoing Human Trafficking Supervision Plan: 1) The youth's current behaviors and behavioral changes, including the youth's ability to effectively monitor and manage his/her behavior and his/her safety ; 2) The y outh's support network; 3) Amount and type of contact if any , the youth has with the trafficker or another person acting on behalf of the trafficker. VIII. Placement Considerations To ensure appropriate care and intervention for victims of human trafficking , caregiver(s) (including residential and group home staff) should have a firm grasp and understanding of trafficking including the characteristics of trafficking, effects on victims (psychological, emotional and physical) and the implications for service delivery. Caregivers must be mindful that the crime of trafficking causes a severe breakdown of confidence and trust for victims and that to rebuild trust and a normal relationship for trafficking victims requires patience, awareness and skill. Care givers should be empathetic and non- judgmental in their approach to victims. a) When human trafficking of a youth is alleged, suspected or known, a discussion concerning trafficking sha ll occur between the worker and the youth's caregiver to ensure the placement is appropriate and the caregiver continues to be able to meet the needs of the youth . A summary of the discussion shall be documented in a contact note . b) When human trafficking of a youth is alleged, suspected or know n, the worker will convene a CFTM and/or a Clinical Intervention Placement Preservation (CIPP) meeting to evaluate the appropriateness of the child's current placement and/or to identify the need for a new placement, if necessary. SERVICES DELIVERED BY THE DEPARTMENT April 17 , 2017 - P.T. 2017.02 Illinois Department of Ch ildren and Family Services Procedures 302 - Appendix C (11) c) If a child is missing from care and is known or suspected to be involved in human trafficking, an appropriate placement plan must be determined for when t he child is recovered . Every effort should be made to avoid emergency shelter placement of a trafficked youth. d) If a child who is a suspected or known victim of trafficking indicates that he or she will not accept the placement selected by the Department, every effort must be made to engage the child in identifying a placement the child is willing to accept in accordance with Procedures 329 .60, Placement Considerations. IX. Medical Examinations Medical examinations of suspected or known trafficking victim s shall be completed and include physical , sexual , and substance use assessments and/or screens. If a particular evaluation is refused, sustained efforts need to be made to engage the youth, and a plan developed with the youth to have the evaluation done at a later date. a) Medical Examinations must include but may not be limited to : Routine physical assessment ; Assess for signs of physical abuse ; Assess for sig ns of medical neglect, nutritional status ; Check for tattoos or other markings or branding. b) Sexual Screens must include but may not be limited to: Pregnancy test (when appropriate) ; STD testing (when appropriate); Assess for signs of sexual abuse . c) Subst ance Use screens must include but may not limited to: Query about substance use history; Assess for signs of substance use; Test for recent substance use ; and Assess for withdrawal symptoms . X. Mental Health Assessment and Services Victims of human traf ficking require t rauma- informed care which recognizes the impact of traumatic experiences (specifically violence and abuse) on an individual's life, behavior, and self -perception. \"Do no harm\" is the first principle of ethics in service delivery to trafficking victims given the extreme risks associated with trafficking, the fragile state of many of its victims, and the pote ntial for increased trauma. SERVICES DELIVERED BY THE DEPARTMENT April 17 , 2017 - P.T. 2017.02 Illinois Department of Ch ildren and Family Services Procedures 302 - Appendix C (12) Mental health effects that victims of human trafficking may present include: Post Traumatic Stress Diso rder; Depression ; Disconnection from feelings and/or a flat affect ; Anxiety Disorders ; Self-blame ; Suicidal ideation and gestures ; Paranoia; Stockholm Syndrome; Fatalism and rage ; Dual diagnosis; Self-care issues ; Sleeping issues ; Dissociative Disorder; Feelings of h opelessness, helplessness; Nightmares ; Anger and anger management issues . a) Mental Health and Trauma Assessment General mental health and trauma screening assessments shall be completed on all youth who are suspected or known victims of traff icking . If an initial screening is completed in an emergency room or by SASS, a thorough assessment should also be completed following placement. When a youth has an existing therapist and/or medication provider, the therapist or provider should be utili zed for assessments whenever possible. The assessor will discuss with the youth any fears or concerns the youth has regarding his/her own safety. These assessments should be scheduled within (2) two weeks of identification as a trafficking victim. b) Clinical Consultation Per Policy Guide 2012.03, a clinical consultation can be requested to provide support to investigative and casework personnel in planning and obtaining clinical services for youth that are beyond the ability of the existing array of services . A consultation is a supportive clinical activity where a youth's case is reviewed and analyzed to provide guidance and insight. This may include the consideration of various practice alternatives that will enhance the determin ation of a course of action. The worker and supervisor should discuss the need for a clinical consultation prior to completing the CFS 399 -1, Clinical Referral form and emailing it to the Outlook mailbox \"clinicalref\" or calling 855 -814-8421 or 312-328-2075. SERVICES DELIVERED BY THE DEPARTMENT April 17 , 2017 - P.T. 2017.02 Illinois Department of Ch ildren and Family Services Procedures 302 - Appendix C (13) c) Mental Health Services According to the International Organization for Migration (I OM) Handbook on Direct Assistance for Victims of Trafficking, individual counseling for human trafficking victims should consist of brief interventions focused on practical problem solving and behavior. The objective of individual counseling is to help the trafficking victim learn or develop skills to cope with, and adjust to, the immediate circumstances with a view to a full recovery. Interventions are aimed to assist trafficking victims to cope with specific life situations and the immediate next ste ps of the process towards recovery. Problem- solving strategies and coping mechanisms in relation to issues of immediate concern, such as restoration of emotional and physical stability , personal safety, cooperation with law enforcement in legal proceedings should be included in the therapeutic process. The IOM Handbook on Direct Assistance for Victims of Trafficking may be downloaded and saved by clicking on the following link: http://publications.iom.int/bookstore/index.php?main_page=product_info&produc ts_id=116 If the youth is placed in a residential facility, the youth's needs and interventions addressing human trafficking will be included in the youth's treatment plan. Otherwise, the youth's needs and interventions addressing human trafficking will be included in the youth's treatment plan with the therapist/counselor. XI. Involvement of Law Enforcement The Illinois Safe Children Act ensures innocent youth under the age of 18 who are lured or coerced into prostitution are immune from criminal prosecution. Although immune from prosecution for a prostitution offense, youth can be taken into protective custody and detained by law enforcement for investigative purposes. When this occurs, the officer is required to report an allegation of human trafficking to SCR, which shall take a report for the Department to initia te an investigation of child abuse or neglect within 24 hours. Encounters with law enforcement are stressful in many ways for trafficking victims. Youth may fear they are under suspicion or may be arrested, that they will not be believed or may suffer from anxiety related to the intrusive and intense nature of an investigation. Trafficked youth may have a pre- existing fear and suspicion of law enforcement officials, often due to the influence of his/her trafficker. SERVICES DELIVERED BY THE DEPARTMENT April 17 , 2017 - P.T. 2017.02 Illinois Department of Ch ildren and Family Services Procedures 302 - Appendix C (14) In order to minimize any anxiety that may be fe lt by the youth , and to coordinate involvement with law enforcement: a) T he Statewide Human Trafficking Coordinator will act as the Department liaison to law en forcement when youth in care have been trafficked and will refer information to the appropriate authorities. b) If law enforcement personnel request an interview with a youth (under the age of 18) regarding human trafficking, the Office of the DCFS Guardian (312-814- 8600) must be notified and grant approval for the interview. c) The assigned w orker shall have a discussion with the youth prior to the interview with law enforcement to explain the reason for the interview and to ensure the youth understands he/she will be interviewed as a victim . A summary of the discussion will be documented in a contact note . d) Sometimes, the youth will be arrested on allegations of committing other crimes, even though the initial encounter with law enforcement was based upon allegations of human trafficking. If the DCFS youth is subject to other criminal charges, the youth's worker shall contact the Office of the DCFS Guardian at 312- 814-8600 to request legal representation for the youth. SERVICES DELIVERED BY THE DEPARTMENT July 1, 1984 SUBPART C: DEPARTMENT CHILD WELFARE SERVICES APPENDIX D - SERVICES TO UNACCOMPANIED MINORS I. Purpose The following outlines the necessary procedur es to follow in providing services to unaccompanied minors. II. Definition According to the Department of Health a nd Human Services, \"A refugee unaccompanied minor or a Cuban/Haitian Entrant unaccompanied minor is defined as a person who: 1) has not yet reached eighteen years of age or such higher age as may be established by the State of placement according to its child welfare plan under Title IV-B of the Social Security Act for the availability of such serv ices for any other children in the State; 2) entered the Country unaccompanied by a parent or an immediate adu lt relative, ie., grandparent, aunt, uncle, or adult sibling who is willing and able as determ ined by a Court to care for the child, or any adult who arrived having documentable eviden ce of legal custody of the minor; 3) has no parent(s) in the United States.\" The vast majority of unaccompanied minors are from Indo- China. However, a small number of children can also be anticipated to arrive from other regions; i.e., Middle East, Eastern Europe, Africa and Central America. III. Means of Entry Into Country Most unaccompanied minors arrive in the Un ited States through the efforts of national voluntary agencies which operate resettleme nt reception and placement services under contract with the Department of State. Others arrive as non-relative members of a family group from the same camp. These children do not arrive on a planned basis and the adults with whom they live do not have guardianship. Some also arrive after having falsified their birthdates. IV. Responsibility for Service Department of Health and Human Services polic y states that \"the State public child welfare agency should assume legal responsibility fo r unaccompanied minors within its geographic jurisdiction.\" Federal policy further states that \"the purpose of establishing legal responsibility is to ensure that unaccompanied minors receive the full range of assistance, care and services to which a child in the State is entitled and to designate a legal authority to act in place of the child's unavailable parent(s).\" V. Procedures to Follow in Providing Service When unaccompanied minors are identified by the voluntary agencies in Illinois which serve refugees and Cuban/Haitian entrants, the ag encies will contact Ralph Hanebutt (217) 785- 2687 in Central Office. Mr. Procedures 302 - Appendix D (1) SERVICES DELIVERED BY THE DEPARTMENT July 1, 1984 Hanebutt will refer the case to the appropriate Region for follow-up. The first step will usually require the Field Office caseworker a nd the voluntary agency representative who is knowledgeable about the child to contact the St ate's Attorney's Office in the County where the child resides. The voluntary agency re presentative will provide the Court with the necessary information to substantiate a dependency petition. Simultaneous with planning the Court process, the Department caseworker and the voluntary agency representative should arrive at a d ecision regarding the ongoi ng case handling. Some of the voluntary resettlement agencies also operate foster care divisions. In serving referrals from such agencies, the Department must decide whether to refer the child for purchase of care, or to provide the service directly. If the voluntary resettlement agency does not have a foster care division, the Department caseworker will decide whether to refer the child to a voluntary agency which has a foster care contract with the Department, or to plan for the child directly. The majority of unaccompanied minors have been residing with refugee families. In those instances an assessment must be made of the child's adjustment in the home and the family's willingness and ability to be licensed as a foster home. VI. Payment for Services All of the Department's expenses involved in providing the necessary room and board, medical care, social services and administra tive cost are 100% reimbursable by the Federal Government. When the Department has been awarded guardianship of an unaccompanied minor, the caseworker shall complete the following steps in order to assure that the cost of care will be charged to the appropriate account: A. Open a service case, but do not make an entry in the payment section of the Module. B. Call Pete Pirrera in the Office of Fina ncial Management a child's Minors I.D. numbers carry a V prefix. C. Submit all vouchers for services provided to Pete Pirrera who will arrange for their payment from the Refugee Assistance Fund. If it is decided that service will be provided by a private agency with whom the Department has an approved contract for regular foster care, that contract will need to be amended to provide for service to either Refugee Un accompanied Minor or Cuban/Haitian Entrant Unaccompanied Minors. Procedures 302 - Appendix D (2) SERVICES DELIVERED BY THE DEPARTMENT July 1, 1984 VII. Payment for Administrative Costs Federal Regulations and the Inter-Agency Agreement provide for the reimbursement of all administrative expenditures incurred in the pr ocess of serving Unaccompanied Minors. The following procedures shall be followed in the recovery of expenditures for specific line items: A. Personal Services 1. An employee whose job descrip tion reflects full-time service to Unaccompanied Minors shall be paid from Fund 684. 2.

It is used to help the pregnant or parenting youth get connected to important parenting and other community resources to support the young family where they live. This includes the community in which the young family will reside follo wing discha rge from DCFS care. The goal of the family's Community Map is to identify high -quality, supportive services that enrich a young family's well -being, educational/employment development, and overall health. Mapping is a process that continues to evolve and be enhanced over time. A Community Map must be created within 30 days of case assignment and must be updated during periods of transition, such as: when a Permanency Worker first learns that a youth in care is expecting a child; when a youth becomes a parent; when a youth changes placements (including moving into a TLP or ILO, or moving into a launch placement); when a parent ing youth's child turns 2 \u00bd, so the Permanency W orker and parent can prepar e for the child's enrollment in to a Head St art, public Pre- Kindergarten or other early learning program at age 3; and within 90 days of case closure (to coincide with the youth's final Child and Family Team Meeting). This is especially critical if the youth is relocating to their final living arr angement, f ar from their primary support. If a youth has a visiting resource that is utilized consistently and the community is different from where the youth resides, the Permanency Worker and youth shall create a Community Map for the visiting resource community a s well. The Community Map also includes the names of support persons in the parenting youth's life. Older youth tend to have a blend of families and fictive kin .

Anybody in contact with children/youth in DCFS care, who is acting under DCFS/POS authority or control, whether or not directly employed by DCFS or a POS , is prohibited from engaging in the discrimination, bias, or harassment prohibited by Appendi x K. These procedures provide information and guidance to all staff working with LG BTQ children , youth and their families . Anyone working with DCFS involved LGBTQ children and youth should contact the DCFS LGBTQ C oordinator through the Office of Specialty Services at 855-814-8421 under the Division of Clinical Practice & Development for information and guidance or to report concerns or questions regarding conduct in violation of Appendix K or otherwise discriminatory or harmful to LGBTQ children, youth and their families . Contact can also be made by completing a CFS -399- 1 Clinical Referral Form and sending it to ClinicalRef utilizing the DCFS Outlook. Children and youth who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer and questioning are protec ted by the Illinois Human Rights Act [ 755 ILCS 5] http://www.ilga.gov/legislation/ilcs/ilcs5.asp?ActID=2266 . Children and youth have many legal rights while in care, including the right to be free from verbal, emotional and physical harassment in their placements, schools, and communities. The adults involved in their care have a legal and ethical obligation to ensure that they are safe and protected. These children and youth also ha ve the right to be treated equally, to express their gender identity, and to have the choice to be open or private about their sexual orientation, gender expression and gender identity. The Department 's policy is to maintain and promote a safe and affirming environment for LGBTQ children and youth in DCFS care, including children/ youth who are in DCFS contracted residential facilities and programs, foster care and any other substitute care settings. Like all other children, LGBTQ children/youth are to be placed in the least restrictive setting appropriate for their needs, and LGBTQ status is not an indicator, much less a justification, to place a child in a more restrictive settin g. All staff are prohibited from e ngaging in any form of discrimination, bias or harassment against LGBTQ children , youth and their families. Staff may not impose personal, organizational or religious beliefs on LGBTQ children , youth and families , and in no way should personal beliefs imp act the way individual needs of children/ youth or families are met. DCFS staff can be disciplined for violating this policy up to and including discharge, per the Employee Handbook and CMS Personnel Rules . See http://dnet/DCFS_Employee_Handbook/Illinois_Department_of_Children_and_Family_ Services_Employee_Handbook.pdf .

It is important for D CFS/POS staff, providers and foster parents to understand that when children and youth (including DCFS children and youth) explore/express a sexual orientation other than heterosexual and/or a gender identity that is different from the child/youth's sex a ssigned at birth , those children and youth are to be supported and respected without any effort to direct or guide them to any specific outcome for their exploration. DCFS is committed to supporting the physical and emotional health and well- being of all children and youth, including LGBTQ and specifically transgender/gender expansive child/youth that are in DCFS care. DCFS requires that all LGBTQ children and youth be placed in an affirming safe housing, receive LGBTQ competent medical and mental health services , and have equal opportunity and access to care. All DCFS /POS staff, providers, and foster parents shall treat LGBTQ children and youth in an affirming manner and proactively work to create a respectful space. All DCFS /POS staff, providers and foster parents are required to be culturally competent in serving the needs of LGBTQ children and youth, including understanding the challenges that LGBTQ and particularly transgender/gender expansive child/ youth face in foster care and congregate care. Therefore, any person who is involved with DCFS children/youth will complete mandatory training in LGBTQ competency. Specifically, LGBTQ training will be part of the retraining Child Welfare licen se, will be included as part of PRIDE training , and will be included in DCFS core training . DCFS and POS staff must complete additional, mandatory standalone LGBTQ training at least once per year. Agencies must include LGBTQ training in their training of volunteers. Annual training in LGBTQ competent care is required for all child welfare providers; whether or not they believe they have care for or currently care for any LGBTQ child/youth. It is critical that we always speak and behave in ways that are respectfully to L GBTQ children and youth even if we don't know that a LGBTQ child or youth is present. We must model r espect and valu e all children, youth and families regardless of their sexual orientation , gender identity and/or gender expression. S taff in congregate care facilities must be especially sensitive to the needs of, and be culturally aware in serving LGBTQ children and youth in care. This degree of professionalism is exceptionally crucial and especially critical in emergency facilities given that they are an important entry point for children and youth in care. Early consultation with DCFS LGBTQ Coordinator improves the delivery of services for children/youth and their caregivers . This prepare s and stabilize s placements, preventing unnecessary disruptions. DCFS will require all staff to attend ongoing training and education regarding sexual orientation, gender identity and gender expression. SERVICES DELIVERED BY THE DEPARTMENT May 11, 2017 - P.T. 2017.04 Illinois Department of Children and Family Services Procedures 302 - Appendix K - (3) b) Definitions : It is important to allow all children and youth to self -identify with these terms. The language expressing gender/sexual identities is constantly evolving but this policy is a static do cument. Children/Youth may be same sex practicing or gender expansive with or without claiming a LGBTQ identity. Language associated with being LGBTQ varies greatly across communities. The use of identity categories (gay, lesbian, queer, transgender), and gender pronouns may be fixed or fluid. Please seek LGBTQ competent consultation if you have questions. Affirming: Acknowledge and support the individual's right s to self -determination of gender and sexual orientation . Asexuality: Is the lack of sexual attraction to anyone, or low or absent interest in or desire for sexual activity. It may be considered the lack of a sexual orientation, or one of the variations thereof, alongside heterosexuality, homosexuality and bisexuality. Bisexual : A person who is emotionally, romantically, and sexually attracted to both men and women. Cisgender: Term used to describe people whose gender identity is congruent with sex assigned at birth . Coming -Out: There may be a gradual process of becoming aware of one's sexual orientation and gender identity that includes a personal sense of when to safely disclose this information to others. There is also a gradual coming out process for family, friends, and caregivers as they learn to understand and accept the LGBTQ children and youth. Not all people who identify as LGBTQ choose to or are able to come out. Congregate C are: Is defined as an entity which consists of 'group living', i.e. Residential Treatment Facility, Group Homes, Transitional Living Programs and Emergency Shelters. These facilities must also be licensed as a child care institution by DCFS. Culturally Compet ent: (Culturally Informed ) Cultural competence in terms of this population is having fundamental respect for children and youth and meeting their individual needs. Also, it is a lifelong project. Competence with one group doesn't mean you're competent wi th another. We're an increasingly culturally complex country. Training in cultural competence should include race and ethnicity, sexual orientation, age, gender expression, gender identity, disability status and other demographic characteristics. Gay: A person whose emotional, romantic, and sexual attractions are primarily for individuals of the same sex, typically in reference to men. In some contexts, the term is used as a general term for gay men and lesbians. SERVICES DELIVERED BY THE DEPARTMENT May 11, 2017 - P.T. 2017.04 Illinois Department of Children and Family Services Procedures 302 - Appendix K - (4) Gender Dysphoria: Replaces the obsolete diagnos is of gender identity disorder. Gender Dysphoria emphas izes distress, not disagreement , between birth -assigned gender and gender identity. Disagreement between birth -assigned gender and gender identity is not pathological and does not need diagnosis. Gender Dysphoria may be diagnosed when a transgender/gender expansive person is seeking medical interventions such as hormones and/or surgery. Not all transgender people experience gender dysphoria. Gender Expansive: Having or being perceived to have gender expression and/or behaviors that do not conform to traditional or societal expectations. Gender- expansive individuals may or may not identify as LGBTQ. Gender Expression: A person's way of communicating gender identity to others through behavior, dress , and physical characteristics. Most people express a range of masculine and feminine characteristics. Gender Identity: One's innermost concept of self as male or female or both or neither ; how individuals perceive themselves and what they call themselves. One's gender identity can be the same or different than the sex assigned at birth. Gender Identity is distinct from sexual orientation . For example, a transgender girl (identified as male at birth but whose identity is female) may i dentify as heterosexual, meaning she is attracted to boys. Intersex: A general term used to describe a person born with the sex characteristics (including genitals, gonads hormones and chromosome patterns) that do not fit typical binary notions of male or female bodies. While a person who is transgender has a gender that is different from the one traditionally associated with the sex they were assigned at birth, an intersex person is born with a variation in their sexual or reproductive anatomy such tha t their body does not fit typical definitions of male or female. Some intersex conditions are visible at birth while others do not become apparent until puberty or later and some differences may not be apparent at all. Upper estimates of the amount of intersex people are approximately 1.7 percent. The term \"hermaphrodite\" is outdated, stigmatizing, and used to sensationalize intersex people . An intersex person may or may not identify as LGBTQ. Lesbian: A woman whose emotional, romantic, and sexual attractions are primarily for other women. Some women prefer to call themselves gay. LGBTQ: Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender and Queer/Questioning. This is acronym for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and questioning/queer persons who despite their differences are often discriminated against in similar ways. LGBTQ is sometimes written to include \"I\" for intersex, and/or \"A\" for a lly. It is also, written LGBTQ+ to identify the many possible additions to the basic \"LGBTQ.\" Preferred Gender Pronoun (PGP): The pronoun or pronouns that an individual prefers others to use when speaking about them. Single use pronouns may include but are not limited to ; he, she, he gender neutral they and z e. SERVICES DELIVERED BY THE DEPARTMENT May 11, 2017 - P.T. 2017.04 Illinois Department of Children and Family Services Procedures 302 - Appendix K - (5) Queer: Historically, this was a derogatory slang term used to identify LGBTQ+ people but is now a term that has been embraced and reclaimed by the LGBTQ community and academia as a symbol of pride, representing individuals who may fall out of \"norms\" for gender and sexuality. Sex Assigned at Birth: Birth -assigned male or female sex typically based on reproductive anatomy (external and internal genitalia , e.g. penis, vagina, gonads, reproductive tracts, and so forth.). Sexual Orientation: Sexual behavior does not necessarily determine sexual orientation. Sexual orientation refers to o ne's enduring emotional, romantic, and/or sexual feelings to another person. Transgender: A broad term describing the state of a person's gender identity/expression, when their identity/presentation does not necessarily m atch those characteristics associated with sex assigned at birth. Associated terms may include female to male (FTM) male to female (MTF), transsexual, and gender queer. c) Background Information For many children and youth, understanding their sexuality, sexual orientation and gender identity can be a time of reflection, questioning, as well as turmoil and stress. For LGBTQ children and youth, understanding these matters is often more difficult, as LGBTQ children/ youth may face prejudice and discrimination from their family, friends, professionals and community. LGBTQ children and youth of color and diverse cultural backgrounds may experience added bias. Unfortunately, America's children and youth bear much of the fallout from anti -LGBTQ prejudices. Our DCFS children and youth are more highly impacted than the general population of LGBTQ children and youth. According to the Child Welfare League of America, LGBTQ children/ youth are at higher risk than their heterosexual cisgender counterparts for emotional and physical abuse from family members and/or peers, failed out -of-home placements, homelessness, emotional/physical victimization, and/or institutional neglect or abuse. LGBTQ youth, as a group, have a higher incidence of suicide attempts, runaway behavior, substance abuse, high-risk sexual behaviors, sexually transmitted infections, HIV and pregnancy. In school, LGBTQ youth are at greater risk than their heterosexual counterparts for academic failure, school truancy and premature withdrawal, often as a result of fear, intimidation or threats from other students or staff. Consequently, many LGBTQ children and youth are unlikely to reveal their sexual orientation or gender identity, particularly to peo ple in perceived positions of authority or power (e.g., social service staff, family members, caregivers, te achers, church members, etc.). SERVICES DELIVERED BY THE DEPARTMENT May 11, 2017 - P.T. 2017.04 Illinois Department of Children and Family Services Procedures 302 - Appendix K - (6) d) Identifying a Need A child or youth may self -identify as having questions surrounding their sexual orientation or gender identity , or may be identified as LGBTQ by child protection or child welfare staff, school personnel, a birth or foster family member, a therapist, or others from within the community. The caseworker and supervisor are responsible for respecting the children's and youth's sexual orientation, gender identity and expression; informing all children and youth about their legal rights and protecting the child/youth's privacy in the coming out process. It is the caseworker and supervisor's responsibility to ensure that all DCFS youth know that discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity is unlawful in Illinois. Sexual orientation, gender identity, and gender expression are critical components of each individual's development. These components may or may not be factors in the emotional or behavioral concerns of the LGBTQ child/youth. It is important to recognize that these are developmental milestones , not problematic behavior. The LGBTQ Coordinator can provide information, clinical consultation, training, and resources to staff and participate in case staffing. The caseworker sh all notify their supervisor and contact the DCFS Clinical Specialty Services LGBTQ Coordinator immediately when there are concerns regarding the child/youth's safety and well -being. C aseworkers and supervisors are responsible for ensuring that recommendations f rom the consultation are implemented to protect the safety and well -being of the children and youth. e) Meeting the Need Placement and Support Services: A child or youth's LGBTQ status is not a reason to place them in congregate care. Most needs of LGBTQ children and youth can be met through positive caregiver , family support and community peer educational support groups . Placement decisions, such as the d ecision to place a child with kin or fictive kin , must be guided by the caregiver 's capacity to meet the unique an d diverse needs of the individual. If a child or youth is known to be LGBTQ, the caseworker is responsible for determining prior to placement , the caregiver's attitudes and beliefs regarding sexual orientation, gender identity /gender expression. In no instance should LGBTQ children /youth be placed with a non-affirming caregiver who is opposed to sexual orientation s that differ from the caregiver's own. Nor should LGBTQ children and youth be placed with caregivers who are unwilling/unable to support child ren and youth whose gender identity or gender expression differs from traditional expectation. It is critical that children and youth be in a safe, supportive and affirming environment that is safe and promotes physical and emotional well -being the assessment is ongoing . If a caregiver is found to be non- affirming or is otherwise in violation of the nondiscrimination requirements in Appendix K, the youth's DCFS caseworker must take immediate action to intervene and take appropriate corrective action and contact the LGBTQ Coordinator. SERVICES DELIVERED BY THE DEPARTMENT May 11, 2017 - P.T. 2017.04 Illinois Department of Children and Family Services Procedures 302 - Appendix K - (7) The children's and youth's worker, family , foster family members , or placement caregivers and peers may themselves need assistance in supporting the LGBTQ children and youth. The LGBTQ Coordinator can provide education and identify resources that will assist the caregiver , and support the children and youth in placement. Participation in education and support groups, such as, PFLAG https://www.pflag.org/ for Parents, Families, Friends, and allies united with people who are LGBTQ, sh all be encouraged. LGBTQ children and youth may also experience difficul ty in school. For example transg ender students have the right to us e the gendered school facilities ( e.g.. restrooms and locker rooms) that correspond to the student's gender identity. Caseworkers and caregivers should assist children/youth in obtaining their school 's permission to use these facilities. Organizations such as the ACLU of Illinois www.aclu -il.org/ are resources to go to should issues in this area arise . Agencies such as t he Illinois Safe Schools Alliance http://illinoissafeschools.org/ promote sa fe and respectful schools for LGBTQ and allie s, for children/ youth throughout Illinois by providing professional development to school personnel, supporting children/ youth in organizing Gay -Straight Alliances, advocating for inclusive school policies, and providing crisis intervention to child/youth and families in need. Consult educational advisor and DCFS LGBTQ Coordinator if school is impacted. As with any child/ youth, LGBTQ children and youth experiencing emotional and/or behavioral problems may require specific services, such as short -term outpatient counseling or psychotherapy. For example, w hen a child/ youth is having a severe emotional reaction to their sexual orientation , gender exp ression or gender identity (e.g., persistent depression or anxiety, engaging in substance use or dangerous, high- risk behaviors, social withdrawal, rejection of child/ youth, placement disruption), more intensive services may be required. These services mi ght include, but are not limited to, individual, group or family therapy. For any and all services, s taff should refer children and youth who identify as LGBTQ only to community -based providers who demonstrate cultural competence in working with LGBTQ children and youth. All staff should recognize that many adolescents are still exploring their sexual orientation, gender identity, and/or gender expression. Staff should also recognize that children and youth may not be aware of the relevant terminolog y related to sexual orientation and/or gender identity. Caseworkers and caregivers should facilitate exploration of any LGBTQ matters through an affirming approach with children and youth by being open, non- judgmental, and empathic. Caseworkers, caregivers and clinicians should allow children and youth to guide the process of choosing language with which they feel most comfortable while discussing their sexual orientation and gender identity and/or expression. Caseworkers, caregivers, and clinicians should recognize that this language may change over time, and affirm and support children and youth in their process of identity formation and expression. SERVICES DELIVERED BY THE DEPARTMENT May 11, 2017 - P.T. 2017.04 Illinois Department of Children and Family Services Procedures 302 - Appendix K - (8) In some situations, the sexual identity or orientation of LGBTQ children and youth may not be respected . They may not feel safe from harassment, stigma, or discrimination. The LGBTQ Coordinator may be able to assist through education or support services. However, w hen the risk of harm cannot be mitigated and placement stabilization is no longer in the best interest of the child/youth, the caseworker shall imm ediately make every effort to seek an alternative placement that is LGBTQ affirming and respect ful of the child/youth's right to self -determination. The LGBTQ Coordinator can also assist with identifying resources. It is important to note that staff should continue to carefully consider the parent/caretaker's attitude towards the child/youth's sexual orientation, gender identity/expression and other related behaviors throughout the life of the case when assessing possible safety factors. f) Expectations of DCFS/POS Direct Services, Foster Parents, Congregate Care (Residential, TLP, Shelter, Group Home Staff) Respect and Privacy : It is critical to respect the child/youth's gender expression and self-determination , including the child/youth's choice of clothes, make- up, hairstyl e, friends, and activities within appropriate boundaries (e.g. if a caregiver permits a cisgender heterosexual child/youth to date at a certain age, the caregiver may not prohibit a gay or transgender child/youth f rom dating ). The child/youth's chosen name and preferred gender pronoun (including gender -neutral pronouns such as \"they\" or \"ze/hir\") must be respected . While records must also identify the child/youth's legal name, use the chosen name when communicating directly to the child/youth. Some children and youth choose privacy . \"R espect \" refers to protecting the children's and youth's right to confidentiality about sensitive and private information such as their sexual orientation and gender identity. Child welfare staff must be sensitive to the timing and nature of the child/youth's coming -out process and must obtain the child/youth's explicit oral or written permission (CFS 600-3, Consent for Release of Information , or on the D -Net at: Forms ) prior to disclosing this information . Moreover, permission is not \"universal\" once given. Rather, the caseworker must request permission from the child/ youth each time disclosure to a different individual is involved. If a youth requests that their preferred name, and /or gender neutral pronoun also be included in writt en documents, however, that request should be honored for all written records, including court documents, medical records, school records, and clinical or other service referrals. When a child or youth requests the use of a preferred name and/or gender pronoun, the staff or provider should ask the youth how they would like to be referred to in conversations with family members and other service providers (e.g., community -based servi ce providers, school officials, and so forth) and the court. As children/youth may experiment with different names and pronouns, this question may need to be repeated frequently. Remember to be flexible . Reference to a child/youth's orientation or gende r identity may be disclosed without permission only if there is reason to believe that the child/youth is in immediate danger of self-harm or is at risk of being harmed by others be cause of their LGBTQ identity. SERVICES DELIVERED BY THE DEPARTMENT May 11, 2017 - P.T. 2017.04 Illinois Department of Children and Family Services Procedures 302 - Appendix K - (9) If a DCFS child/youth is to be body searched , cross -gender searches of transgender youth are prohibited. The child/youth must be searched by someone of the same gender as the child/youth's gender identity unless the child/youth requests otherwise. If the child/ youth feels they are being discriminated against or harassed, or that their service needs are not met, they should be advised to contact the LGBTQ Coordinator along with the DCFS or POS Administrator for assistance. Children and y outh also have the right to contact their Guardian Ad Litem, Lambda Legal, or the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) . g) Documentation Documentation and d isclosure of LGBTQ matters shall be guided by the children's and youth's right to privacy, the scope of document distribution, and the children's/youth's informed consent. Most references should be limited to case notes. Permission to include explicit LGBTQ references in assessments sh all be sought from the child/youth. If the child/ youth does not or cannot consent, general references regarding \"identity\" and \"relationships\" may be substituted. S ervice plans sh all incorporate the recommendations as they relate to specific daily living, emotional or behavioral concerns . These may include recommendations for counse ling or support groups \" to address identity and relationship matters \" but there should be no explicit reference to LGBTQ services without the permission of the child/youth. h) Sleeping A rrangements for Transgender/Gender Expansive C hildren and Y outh : No matter the type of placement, placing youth consistent with their gender identity, rather than their sex assigned at birth, is generally, the best way to protect youth. Accordingly, placement consistent with gender identity should be the presumptive placement. Moreover, a youth's perception of where they should be placed and would feel safest should be the primary factor informing housing decisions and placements should never be made before discussing the issue with the youth. 1) Foster Care Licensed , Foster H ome, Home of Relatives and H ome of F ictive Kin When a transgender/gender expansive child/youth is residing in a foster home, the agency is expected to make sleeping arrangement decisions on an individualized basis , while following the general guidance detailed above. Decisions on bedrooms for transgender/gender expansive child/ youth in foster homes should be based on the child/youth's individualized needs and should prioritize the child/youth's emotional and physical safety . The agency (DCFS/POS) should take into account the child/youth's perception of where they will be most secure, as well as any recommendations from the child/youth's health care provider. The child/youth's well-being as well as that of any other children /youth in the foster home should be taken into consideration when making this decision. It is important to consider the LGBTQ child/ youth and other children/youth in the home in the decision making process. While this may take time and effort on the front end, there will be a highe r likelihood that the placement will be stable over time. SERVICES DELIVERED BY THE DEPARTMENT May 11, 2017 - P.T. 2017.04 Illinois Department of Children and Family Services Procedures 302 - Appendix K - (10) All LGBTQ children and youth are particularly vulnerable to failed placements. With this in mind, individualized placement decisions, as well as an increase and diversification of placement options available to LGBTQ children and youth is critical. Caregivers for LGBTQ children/youth must understand and support the LGBTQ children/youth's identity. 2) Congregate C are: (Residential, Group Home, Shelter, Transitional Living) A child or youth's LGBTQ status is not a reason to place them in congregate care. For situations where a transgender/gender expansive child/youth is in congregate care for reasons other than because they are LGBTQ, every effort should be made so that transgender/gender expan sive child/ youth are housed in a facility that can provide transgender/gender expansive c ulturally competent staff, individual sleeping quarters (one person bedroom), as well as private bathroom and shower to allow for safety and privacy. Where shared sleeping accommodations are required, extensive consideration must be given to ensuring that assigned roommates are not a risk to the transgender/gender expansive child/youth's emotional/psychological well- being or physical saf ety. Transgender/gender expansive child/ youth should not automatically be housed according to their sex assigned at birth. As in foster care setting, the agency should make hous ing/sleeping quarters decisions based on the child/youth's individualized need and should prioritize the child/youth's emotional and physical safety . Agency staff should take into account the child/youth's perception of where they will be most secure, as well as any recommendations from the child/youth's health care providers and remember to include the child/youth in the decision making process as to avoid alienating them . Care must be taken to protect male identified children and youth who were labeled female at birth from aggressive peers/staff in congregate settings. If safe congregate housing cannot be found for transgender/gender expansive male identified people assigning them to female congregate facilities could be considered , but their transgender/gender expansive identity must be respected in the female facility. If a facility has both male and female residents, it could be considered to have the transgender/gender expansive child/ youth sleep on the unit of their assigned gender and program on the unit of their preferred gender. Individualized decisions are needed and must place the safety/ well-being of the transgender/gender expansive child/youth first, over institutional ease. If a DCFS child/youth is to be body searched , cross -gender searches of transgender y outh are prohibited. The child/youth most be searched by someone of the same gender as the child/youth's gender identity unless the child/youth requests otherwise. This should be reflected in the agency's Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) manual of the congregate care facility . Designated staff should conduct ongoing check- ins with the LGBTQ child/youth to confirm that the placement continues to be one that is supportive of their identity and meets their needs. SERVICES DELIVERED BY THE DEPARTMENT May 11, 2017 - P.T. 2017.04 Illinois Department of Children and Family Services Procedures 302 - Appendix K - (11) i) Expectations of the DCFS LGBTQ Coordinator The DCFS LGBTQ Coordinator can help workers and supervisors in addressing the sensitive matter s of sexuality and gender expression or emerging sexuality of children and youth for whom the Department is responsible. The Coordinator can help: consult about the Department's LGBTQ policy educate staff, caregivers, and child/youth about LGBTQ legal rights and matters raise self -awareness about attitudes or bias through consultation and training participate in meetings and staffings identify LGBTQ -sensitive resources and placements help with the preparation of a new placement consult about the preservation of the current placement distinguish problematic behaviors from identity development consult with children and youth about legal rights process, and resources advocate respect for diversity j) Health C are: Medical: LGBTQ appropriate and culturally competent medical care and sexual health education and resources shall be provided to all DCFS child/youth. All DCFS child/youth receive a comprehensive health assessment at case opening which includes identification of existing medications being taken by child/ youth. If the child/youth reports that they were prescribed hormones or puberty blocking medications by a licensed medical provider, these medications m ust be continued under appropriate medical supervision while the child/youth is in care. A referral to DCFS Nursing Services should be made to ensure there is continuity of care utilizing the CFS 531 and sending the referral to NurseRef via DCFS Outlook. If a child/youth makes a request to begin puberty blocking/hormone therapy while in care, they should be referred to medical professionals who are recognized as medically competent in the care of transgender child/ youth. The Statewide LGBTQ Coordinator should be contacted when transgender medical care is being considered, along with the DCFS Guardian's office. Please refer to Procedures 327.5 Medical Consents Section (a)(5) for the new initiation of puberty blocking/hormone therapy . If the child/youth's Permanen cy Goal is to return home, and if the parent's whereabouts are known, they should be informed of the initiation of puberty blocking/hormone therapy. Two physicians or a physician and another licensed health care provider such as a licensed psychologist, LCPC, LCSW who is culturally competent in transgender health care, must agree that the child/youth is appropriate for the initiation of puberty blocking/ho rmone therapy. Definitions and information of these terms can be found through this link http://transhealth.ucsf.edu/trans?page=guidelines- youth . SERVICES DELIVERED BY THE DEPARTMENT May 11, 2017 - P.T. 2017.04 Illinois Department of Children and Family Services Procedures 302 - Appendix K - (12) Intersex : For children and youth that are intersex, a referral to a health provider/specialist should be made. In addition, referrals to DCFS Nursing , utilizing the referral form CFS 531 should be sen t to NurseRef via DCFS Outlook. Mental Health : LGBTQ children and youth commonly experience chronic stress related to harassment, the need for vigilance to protect against discrimination and abuse, coming out to family and friends, and having one's sexual orientation discovered. Chronic stress can lead to increased l evels of depression and anxiety. Several studies, including population- based studies, indicate a higher risk of suicide ideation and attempts among lesbian, gay, and bisexual youth, compared with their heterosexual peers. LGBTQ children and youth are also at risk for inappropriate mental health treatment, including misdiagnosis of gender identity disorder, involuntary institutionalization, and reparative therapy or other interventions designed to change their sexual orientation or gender identity. Transge nder children and youth may present health concerns distinct from those common to lesbian, gay, or bisexual children and youth generally. Transgender children and youth experience very high levels of stigmatization, which may increase their feelings of depression and hopelessness. They may also experience significant distress because their body does not correspond to their gender identity. CWLA Best Practice Guidelines https://familyproject.sfsu.edu/sites/default/files/bestpracticeslgbtyouth.pdf DCFS and POS staff must consult with the LGBTQ Coordinator when an LGBTQ child or youth is demonstrating signs of stress or anxiety and must be referred to a mental health professional experienced in serving LGBTQ youth. k) C hild Welfare Do's and D on'ts Do: 1) The LGBTQ Coordinator should be notified when a DCFS child/youth is identified as LGBTQ. When there are acknowledged or suggested concerns regarding the sexual orientation, gender identity and/or gender expression with a child or youth for whom the department is responsible the LGBTQ Coordinator must be contacted immediately. For example, a child or youth may confide to staff that his foster parent or other children/youth in the home tease him because he \"acts like a girl\" or \"acts gay.\" The Coordinator can provide information, training, and resources as well as participate in staffings and assessments. DCFS staff and POS staff should notify the LGBTQ Coordinator whenever questions or concerns surrounding a child or youth's sexual orientation or ge nder identity arises, even if the child does not identify as LGBTQ. The LGBTQ Coordinator can be contacted in the Clinical Division's Specialty Services office at 855-814-8421 and also through the DCFS outlook email system completing the Clinical Refer ral Form CFS -399 and sending to ClinicalRef utilizing DCFS Outlook. SERVICES DELIVERED BY THE DEPARTMENT May 11, 2017 - P.T. 2017.04 Illinois Department of Children and Family Services Procedures 302 - Appendix K - (13) 2) Implement recommendations made by the LGBTQ Coordinator within five working days of the contact . If there are barriers to meet this deadline, contact the DCFS LGBTQ Coordinator to request additional assistance or to see if an extension can be granted. 3) Inform children and youth about their legal rights. All LGBTQ individuals are protected by the Illinois Human Rights Act http://www.ilga.gov/legislation/ilcs/ilcs5.asp?ActlD+2266 . Children and youth have many legal rights while in care, including the right to be free from verbal, emotional and physical harassment in their placements, schools, and communities. The adults involved in their care have a legal and ethical obligation to ensure that they are safe and protected. These children and youth also have the right to be treated equally, to express their gender identity, and to have the choice to be open or private about their sexual orientation. 4) E nsure that LGBTQ children and youth are placed in LGBTQ affirming environments that respect the children's and youth's right to self - determination . The LGBTQ Coordinator can assist by providing training and resources to the caregiver or provider prior to placement or anytime gender or sexual orientation matters are identified. When there is risk of impending emotional or physical harm in the child/youth's placement due to the bias of others about his or her acknowledged or perceived sexual orientation, gender identity or gender expression, the caseworker must contact the LGBTQ Coordinator and consider the prompt removal of the child/ youth from that placement when the risk cannot be mitigated. 5) Always be respectful of the child ren's and youth's gender expression and self-determination. Child welfare staff must be sensitive to the nature and timing of the children's and youth's coming out process. T he children's and youth's choice of clothes, hairstyles, make -up, friends, and age appropriate activities should be respected along with regard for the children's/ youth's chosen name and preferred gender pronoun. If there are places in the child/youths place of residence w here their name is listed -for example on an in/out board, use the child/youth's preferred name unless they say not to do so. In terms of transgender children and youth who are placed in a male -only or female- only facility that does not conform to the child or youth's gender identity (based primarily on the youth's perception of where they should be placed and would feel safest), should be allowed to dress consistent with their gender identity, notwithstanding any dress code. SERVICES DELIVERED BY THE DEPARTMENT May 11, 2017 - P.T. 2017.04 Illinois Department of Children and Family Services Procedures 302 - Appendix K - (14) 6) Protect the children's a nd youth's right to privacy about their sexual orientation and gender identity. Child welfare staff must obtain the child/youth's explicit oral or written permission (CFS 600- 3 form) for disclosure of this information to persons other than the LGBTQ Coordinator . The information may be disclosed to persons other than the LGBTQ Coordinat or without permission only if there is reason to believe that the child/ youth is in immediate danger to their self or is at risk of being harmed by others because of their LGBTQ identity. 7) Documentation and disclosure of LGBTQ matters shall be guided by the child/youth's right to privacy, the scope of document distribution, and the child/youth's informed consent (CFS 600- 3 form). Unless a child or youth permits otherwise, DCFS and POS staff should not include information disclosed in confidence about their sexual orientation or gender identity. Permission to include explicit LGBTQ references in assessments must be obtained from the child/youth. If the child/ youth does not or cannot consent, general references regarding \"identity\" and \"relationships\" may be substituted. Document recommendations in the child/youth's service plan only as they relate to specific daily living, emotional or behavioral concerns . This may include recommendations for counseling or support groups \"to address identity and relationship matters \" but there should be no explicit references to LGBTQ services without the child/youth's permission. 8) Provide supportive and affirming care regardless of one's personal attitudes , beliefs, preconceptions and/or judgments, if any, surrounding matters of sexual orientation , gender identity, and gender expression . LGBTQ youth in care are entitled to receive care and services from individuals who treat them with respect and without bias. Individuals who have difficulty meeting this standard for personal reasons should seek assistance from supervisors and the LGBTQ Coordinator in order to address those issues . DCFS will not tolerate exposing LGBTQ children and youth to staff/service providers who are not supportive of children and youths' right to self -determination of sexual/gender identity. 9) Create an environment in your office and in meetings that signals to all clients that you are a safe and supportive person for them to talk with about LGBTQ matters and concerns. \"Safe space\" stickers , DCFS LGBTQ printed material or informational pamphlets from local LGBTQ child/ youth support and drop-in groups must be displayed in the office reception area. Do Not: 1) Include specific information about a child/youth's sexual orientation, gender identity or expression without the permission of the child/ youth except when the child/youth presents a danger to self or is at risk of being harmed by others because of their LGBTQ status. General references regarding \"identity\" and \"relationships\" may be included in written records. SERVICES DELIVERED BY THE DEPARTMENT May 11, 2017 - P.T. 2017.04 Illinois Department of Children and Family Services Procedures 302 - Appendix K - (15) 2) A ddress a child/youth as deviant, pathological, immoral or in need of changing because o f their sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression or questioning status or allow a child/youth to receive services from such providers. 3) C ontract or seek treatment services for the purpose of changing a child/youth's sexual orientation, gender identity, or gender expression. Such treatment would be ineffective and extremely damaging to the children 's/youth's sense of self and well -being. Reparative/conversion therapy is illegal [ 815ILCS 505/2Z] 4) A ssume that only LGBTQ adults can be effecti ve in working with LGBTQ child/youth. 5) Ask children or youth about their sexual orientation, gender expression/gender identity in a public space. A private space will help keep the conversation confidential and increase the likelihood of children and youth feeling safe in disclosing their identity and/o r sexual orientation. 6) Discuss sexual orientation, gender expression/gender identity in front of family with out consent of the child/youth. They may not be ready to come out to family members, and if the family does know, they may not yet be sup portive of the child/youth's gender identity/sexual orientation. 7) Assume that all sites/service providers/agencies that serve LGBTQ children and youth are transgender inclusive. The needs of transgender/gender expansive child/ youth are different than that of lesbian, gay and bisexual child/youth and not all places are able to work effectively with transgender/gender expansive child/youth. For example, transgender/gender expansive children and youth may need private bedrooms, access to private bathrooms and showers , for individual shower time. DCFS requires that all agencies, providers and sites are culturally competent, affirming and equipped to care for LGBTQ children and youth. Human Rights Campaign www.hrc.org has guidelines and certifications for agencies to become LGBTQ culturally competent . 9) Assume the sexual orientation of transgender/gender expansive individuals. Gender and sexual orientation are separate and distinct matters . 10) Shame a child/youth for fl uctuating gender presentation. Switching names/pronouns/physical presentation is often a developmental step for LGBTQ child/youth. 11) For many LGTQ children and youth their g ender pronouns are flu id and flexible. Do not assume that you know the child/youth's preferred gender pronoun, always ask.

Closeted : Keeping one's sexual orientation or gender identity secret. Gender fluid/expansive/creative: Conveys a wider, more flexible range of gender expression, with a range of interests and behaviors. Expanding beyond traditional gender stereotypes. It reinforces the notion that gender is not -binary, but a continuum; and that many children and adults express their gender in multiple ways. Gender Non -binary: Those with non- binary genders can feel that they: Have an androgynous (both masculine and feminine ) gender identity, such as androgyne. Have an identity between male and female, such as intergender. Have a neutral or nonexistent gender i dentity, such as agender or neutrois.

II. DEFINITIONS American Sign Language (ASL) means a language in and of itself, different from the English language: It has its own word order and syntax. Auxiliary Aids include but are not limited to amplifie rs or amplified phones, decoders or flashing lights which can indicat e a phone or doorbell ringing or the presence of smoke or fire; Baby Crying (a monitor which picks up the sound of a baby's cry), closed caption devices for televisions, hear ing aids and flash cards. Deaf means the absence of the ability to he ar and understand speech or monitor one's own speech production with or without a hearing aid. Procedures 302 - Appendix L (1) SERVICES DELIVERED BY THE DEPARTMENT June 11, 2010 - P.T. 2010.09 Department Statewide 504 Coordinator means the employee in the Office of Affirmative Action responsible for coordinating Department compliance with Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. Hard of Hearing is a description for a person who has sufficient hearing, with or without hearing aids, to understand the speech of others and monitor his own speech, even though he has a hearing loss. Illinois Relay Center (IRC), also known as \"Dual Party Relay,\" is a 24-hour-a-day, seven-day-a-week service which provides a communications link between those who use a Telecommunications Device for the Deaf (T DD) and those who use a standard voice telephone. IRC provides relay service through a program by the Illinois Telecommunications Access Corp. (ITAC), the local phone company, and AT&T. Interpreter means a person who facilitates co mmunication through sign language or other visual means for persons who are deaf or persons who have a partial or severe hearing loss. A person who translates si gn language or othe r means of visual communication into spoken English for pers ons who are deaf or hard of hearing. Lip reading (or speech reading) means watching a person's mouth and face to read what words are being said. Research indicat es that only about 3 out of every 10 words can be speech read easily. Manually coded English (or \"signed English\") means signs that represent English words in English word order. Prelingual Deafness means deafness which occurs before the acquisition of language (usually before 3 years of ag e). Such a person will have no language frame of reference for English when learning to speak, write, or speech read. Primary language means the language which the clie nt normally uses in day-to-day activities. Postlingual Deafness means deafness which occurs after the acquisition of language (usually after 3 years of age). In most cas es, persons who have lost their hearing after this age have a relatively strong language base. Registry of Interpreters for the Deaf (RID) means a national organization that has established an evaluation and certificati on mechanism for sign language and oral interpreters. A certificate signifies that an interpreter has attained a minimum skill level. A registry of certified Interpreters is pub lished annually by the RID, and is recommended as a way of verifying cu rrent certification status. Telecommunication Device for Deaf (TDD) means a special typewriter-style device that enables the telephone conversation to be typed rather than spoken. A deaf person can communicate directly with anyone who has a similar device. Procedures 302 - Appendix L (2) SERVICES DELIVERED BY THE DEPARTMENT June 11, 2010 - P.T. 2010.09 III. BACKGROUND On September 20, 1991, the Department entere d into a Voluntary Compliance Agreement with the U.S. Department of Health and Hu man Services, Office of Civil Rights, which addressed how the Department would provi de services to persons with hearing impairments and limited/non-English speaking persons. As the Agreement applies to persons with hearing impairments, the Department is required to do the following: a) Develop policies and procedures to a ssure effective communications between Department staff and all hearing-impaired persons coming into contact with the Department; b) Develop and implement a procedure for a ssessing special language needs at the point of intake and ensuring that the language needs are noted throughout case files and communicated betw een appropriate staff; c) Notify deaf or hard of hearing persons that the Department has entered into written agreements with sign language interpreter services or will otherwise provide appropriate inte rpreter services at the Department's cost; d) To NOT use family members or friends of adult deaf or hard of hearing persons as interpreters involving alleged abuse, neglect, dependency, or in hearings and appeals, and never use family members or friends of a deaf or hard of hearing child as interpreters for any purpose; e) Provide TDDs (The term TDD is generic and replaces the earlier term TTY which refers specifically to teletypewriter machin es.) at each office, with appropriately trained staff, and publicize the TDD number s to community agencies dealing with deaf or hard of hearing persons; f) Train all staff with direct client contact and their supervisors on all of the policies and procedures relevant to the Agreement; g) Implement and maintain a record-keeping system; and h) Review compliance by Department service providers. As a result, the Department re vised many of its procedures to address the issues described in the agreement. In addition, training was conducted in all Department Regions explaining the Department's policies on servi ces to deaf or hard of hearing persons. Compliance Issues On October 7, 1997, the Office of Civil Rights initiated an investigation pursuant to a complaint alleging that a person with a hear ing impairment was discriminated against on the basis of her hearing impairment, because the Department failed to make adequate Procedures 302 - Appendix L (3) SERVICES DELIVERED BY THE DEPARTMENT June 11, 2010 - P.T. 2010.09 arrangements for the provision of sign language interpreters. The issues subject to investigation included whethe r the person filing the compla int was denied sign language interpreters and whether the Department, th rough its methods of administration, fails to ensure that qualified disabled individuals are not subject to discrimination on the basis of disability. New Agreement The Office of Civil Rights suspended furt her administrative action on the complaint pending verification that the Department completed the actions outlined in a new agreement. The provisions of the new agreement are described in Section IV below. IV. REQUIREMENTS FOR THE DEPARTMENT a) The Department must develop or reiterate policy and procedures clearly stating the obligations of purchase of service pr oviders to offer and provide sign language interpreters or other auxiliar y aids which enable deaf or hard of hearing persons to participate and benefit from their se rvices. The procedure must provide instructions on how to arrange for an interpreter (directly or through the Department) and whether the Department or the POS provider is responsible for the cost of the interpreter. b) The Department must disseminate the pol icy and procedure to all current POS providers and provide training for th ese providers on its implementation. c) The Department has developed a plan that ensures that all current POS providers, prior to executing a service contract, are made aware of their obligati on to provide interpreter services and agree to adhere to the policy. d) Through its State Deaf Servic es Coordinator, the Depa rtment conducts training on the Department's policy and procedure re garding interpretive services and the Department's obligation to assure the compliance of its POS providers. e) Through its State Deaf Servic es Coordinator, the Depart ment provides all regional and field offices within Cook County and statewide a composite list of resources for sign language interpreter services, upda ted at least annually, and ensures that staff is informed of these resource s via memoranda or other communication. f) The Department will appoint a person who will be responsible for evaluating each field office's and provider's procedure and/ or plan of action to assure that each has demonstrated the ability to comply with the requirements, and for taking necessary corrective action whenever compliance problems are discovered. Procedures 302 - Appendix L (4) SERVICES DELIVERED BY THE DEPARTMENT June 11, 2010 - P.T. 2010.09 V. WORKING WITH DEAF OR HARD OF HEARING CHILDREN OR FAMILIES In the time that has passed since the 1997 agre ement with the Office of Civil Rights, the Department has continued its e fforts to improve services to deaf and hard of hearing individuals. Educating the child welfare co mmunity about the need s of individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing, revising po licies and procedures and providing ongoing guidance and support to employees of the Depart ment and those in the private sector have been a critical part of this process. Understanding the Disability The primary disability of deaf or hard of h earing persons is a grea tly reduced ability to communicate with most hearing persons. Staff should exercise sensitivity when interacting with persons with hearing impairments. The invisibility of deafness/hearing impairment often makes it difficult for others to understand and a deaf or hard of hearing person's actions can be misinterpreted. Furthe rmore, there is a misconception that deaf people can overcome the communication barrie r through lip reading and use of hearing aids. The person's degree of hearing loss an d the method they use to overcome it will dictate the method used. Deafness is an invisible. One cannot tell wh ether or not a person is deaf or hard of hearing by looking at them. It is not until they demonstrate their inab ility to communicate verbally or in some other manner that their deafness becomes known. Unfortunately, there is a long history of deaf persons be ing misdiagnosed as having numerous physical and/or mental limitations and placed in hospita ls-or programs that did not address their deafness. Communication barriers are prevalen t and make it impossible for a deaf person to communicate their condition or illness to a doctor or other professional that does not know sign language. At one time, the term deaf and dumb was used to describe persons who could not hear and could not speak. Deafness and its associatio n with ignorance is a stigma that to this day is prevalent in some areas of society. In some areas, the deaf are placed in classrooms with the mentally retarded because of thei r inability to communicate or because school systems do not have the resources to pr ovide the auxiliary aids they need. When a deaf person tries to speak, they ofte n do so in a monotone voice. Others can only make shrill noises as they try to form and speak words. To the person not familiar with deafness, it would be possible to assume the person has a speech impediment rather than deafness. They cannot hear themselves spea k, making it impossible for them to control the tone, pitch or volume of their voices. A d eaf person who tries to speak may do so in a loud voice which can be mistaken for anger if the person being spoken to is not aware that the person is deaf. Deaf culture dictat es that their members not use their voices. Deaf persons rely upon their visu al skills to observe and expr ess themselves in society. Depending on what is being discussed, two deaf persons involved in a conversation (signing) may use extreme hand, arm, and facial expression to communicate their position. To the unfamiliar observer, it may appear that those involved in the Procedures 302 - Appendix L (5) SERVICES DELIVERED BY THE DEPARTMENT June 11, 2010 - P.T. 2010.09 conversation are angry and on the verge of violen ce. However, it is possible that they are just communicating to each other what they saw on television last night. Being deaf does not equate to being an angry person. Like most minority populations in our societ y, a deaf have developed a culture that reflects the uniqueness of lives. They communicat e with each other in their own language (American Sign Language or ASL) which is recognized as the third largest method of communication behind English and Spanish. Deaf culture consists of many customs and traditions practiced only by them. They have a number of role models who are deaf or come from the deaf culture including a numbe r of deaf authors, actors, comedians, and entrepreneurs. VI. SPECIALIZED INTERVENTIONS A ND SERVICES FOR DEAF AND HARD OF HEARING CLIENTS a) Requirements for DCFS and POS Workers The following requirements are for DCFS a nd POS Workers alike. Monitoring of POS Workers' compliance with the following requirements takes place through IDCFS POS Monitoring Office. 1) Initial Contact Department and POS staff who are res ponsible for initial contact with the client shall ensure that persons w ith hearing impairments are identified and the mode of communication which they use is docum ented. In many instances, at the initial contact, the worker will have been alerted by the referring party, agency, family member, cl ient, etc., that the client is deaf or hard of hearing and requires the us e of an interpreter to facilitate communication. DCFS and POS staff sha ll then obtain the services of a certified sign language interpreter when ever possible for the initial contact with the client or at the earliest time an interpreter can be secured. If the staff person does not know how to obtain an interpreter or translator for communication with deaf or hard of hearing pe rsons, he or she must immediately contact the Deaf or Hard of Hearing office (see Attachment I of these procedures for additional information). Interpreter services are provided at no cost to the client. POS agencies have funds allocated within their contract for these services. A written notice shall be given to the deaf or hard of hearing client at the initial contact, informing the client of the right to an interpreter or other auxiliary aids at no cost to the client. The notice describes the circumstances under which an interprete r must be provided, a description of auxiliary aids options, the right to a psychological assessment performed by a qualified professional, se rvices available to meet the needs of deaf or hard of hearing individual s and contact information for the Deaf Procedures 302 - Appendix L (6) SERVICES DELIVERED BY THE DEPARTMENT June 11, 2010 - P.T. 2010.09 Services Coordinator and the Office Deaf Services Coordinator if there is a question or complaint regarding co mpliance with the auxiliary aids policy. Video tape notices using American Sign Language may be provided to deaf parents with limited or no English language literacy. The notice also informs deaf or hard of hearing individuals of their right to contact the Office for Civil Rights if there are questions regarding compliance. The DCFS or POS worker shall document on the SACWIS Case Note the individual's preferred method of communication and shall identify the client as deaf or hard of hearing in the initial SACWIS Client Service Plan, under \"Language/Mode of Communication.\" Additionally, workers must document as described above, any needed specialized communication services required, in cluding but not limited to sign language interpreter services, to su ccessfully service the corresponding case. 2) Use of Sign Language Interpreters and Translators The Department provides interpreters, translators and othe r auxiliary aids in order to enable deaf and hard of hearing clients access to the service it provides at no cost to the client. POS agencies have funds allocated within their contract for these services. A certified interpreter is also provided when clients must be present in court related to Department matters (if the court does not have su ch services available) when clients attend a hearing or appeal, when clients must be present at an Administrative Case Review and all ot her appearances requ ired to conduct business with the Department related to their case. A certified interpreter for the deaf must show proof of a certificate issued by the Registry of Interpreters for the Deaf (RID); a satisfactory evaluation by the National Associati on of the Deaf; a satisfactory Interpreter Skills Assessment Screening (ISAS) evaluation; or licensure or certification or a satisfactory evaluati on or screening in another state. According to the Illinois Deaf Hard of Hearing Commission (IDHHC) the following requirements are true for State Licensure Levels for Sign Language Interpreters working for DCFS. Red Licensure SLI - Provisional Skills (Unable to provide any sign language services to DCFS.) Yellow Licensure SLI - Intermediate Skills (Qualified to provide general meeting and communication sign language services to DCFS and POS when youth or ca regivers are not present.) Procedures 302 - Appendix L (7) SERVICES DELIVERED BY THE DEPARTMENT June 11, 2010 - P.T. 2010.09 Green Licensure SLI - Advanced Skills (Qualified to provide services to all DCFS programs except legal services.) Silver Licensure SLI - Masters Level (Qualified for all DCFS services.) All Sign Language Interpreters are licensed by IDHHC and will provide proof of, at least, green licensure when working for DCFS youth in care, care givers, POS, Intact Families, IA, etc and proof of Silver Licensing for Juvenile Court and other legal venues. A sign language translator is a person who is qualified to translate due to their education and experience. A registered interpreter shall be present for all of the following: All visits between a hearing child and deaf adult; All Investigations; Court appearances; Home Visits; Office visits; Visits children by staff; Plan Meetings; Evaluations; Social histories; Psychological evaluations; Psychiatric evaluations; Substance abuse treatment evaluations; and Other interactions as deemed n ecessary by IDCFS or POS provider or the client. Family members or friends of the adul t or minor deaf or hard of hearing person may not be used as interpreters in cases involving alleged abuse, neglect, dependency, and hearings and appeals. The use of family or friends to interpret may compromise the Department's investigation of child abuse or neglect if, for example, a parent is reluctant to disclose child abuse or domestic violence if the spouse is present and interpreting or a deaf child does not disclose child abuse if the parent is interpreting for child. Minor children are ne ver to be used as in terpreters as doing so places the child in an unacceptable child-parent role, increases the likelihood of inaccurate information be ing conveyed, and allows the child access to the parent's confidential in formation including such matters as mental health or substance abuse trea tment history. These restrictions are to ensure confidentiality of info rmation and accurate communication. Procedures 302 - Appendix L (8) SERVICES DELIVERED BY THE DEPARTMENT June 11, 2010 - P.T. 2010.09 In other situations, after being info rmed in writing that the Department will provide an interpreter at no cost to the client, adult deaf or hard of hearing clients may request that a family member or friend be used as an interpreter for themselves. Such a request shall be documented in the case file. However, parents may not provide such consents for their children. Sign language interpreters are to serve only as facilitators of com-munication and are not otherwise invo lved in the client's business. Interpreters should never be expect ed to act as social workers, psychologists or counselors. All ce rtified interpreters are bound by the Registry for Interpreters for the Deaf Code of Ethics and all applicable state laws to keep all information strictly confidential. DCFS workers and those employed by pr ivate child welfare agencies shall document on the SACWIS Case Note each instance that an interpreter was provided, including the date and purpose and explain any circumstances under which an interpreter was not provided. No determination or final decision regarding service delivery shall be made until an interpreter has been involved. 3) Auxiliary Aids In addition to qualified in terpreters, auxiliary aids and services for deaf and hard of hearing clients and wards sh all, if needed by a child or adult, be provided at no cost to the client . Auxiliary aids and services may include qualified sign langua ge or oral interpreters , computer-assisted real time transcription service (CARTS), wr itten materials, telephone handset amplifiers, assistive listening device s and systems, telephones compatible with hearing aids, TDDs and service animals. There are also devices available to the deaf person that will assist in making his or her environment safer for themselves and their families. They include: Monitors that flash when the child cries or makes noise in the nursery; Devices that allow a lamp and a phone line to be plugged into them. The light flashes when the phone rings; Devices that are wired into the door bell and flash when the door bell rings; Smoke detectors that have high powered strobe lights that flash when set off; Procedures 302 - Appendix L (9) SERVICES DELIVERED BY THE DEPARTMENT June 11, 2010 - P.T. 2010.09 Devices that are availabl e for deaf motorists to alert them when an ambulance or other emergency vehicle is with a siren is approaching; and Most communities have a pager ava ilable to deaf persons that I set off when severe weather warnings are sent out. Each DCFS Regional Office shall maintain a list of resources and provide DCFS and POS workers with instruc tions regarding how to access them. The Statewide Coordinator for Deaf Services will assist the Regional Offices in acquiring resources. Catal ogues are available from the Deaf Services Coordinator and a list of suppliers is maintained for reference. b) Assessments A mental health or psychological assessmen t of a deaf client requires effective communication between the deaf or hard of hearing client and a therapist or psychologist that is skilled in signed language communication or familiar with using qualified sign language interpreters . The therapist, psychologist or other clinician conducting the assessment shall ha ve extensive knowle dge of deafness and the cultural implications. This knowle dge is particularly critical in the evaluation of the deaf individual's intere sts, abilities, life experiences, and aspirations. c) Misdiagnosis and Biases There are a number of tools available to qualified professional clinicians that will prevent misdiagnosis of their deaf clients. Most deaf clients will not be able to read at higher grade levels or compre hend many of the terms used in diagnostic tools that are not designed specifically to meet their needs. Some diagnostic tools are inherently biased toward the deaf due to the language used in the tool. It is extremely important for the selected professional to be familiar with these tools and their use. There have been cas es in which psychometric tools unsuited for use with individuals who are deaf or hard or hearing were used, resulting in the individual being misdiagnosed as ment ally retarded. Misdiagnosis and biases are obstacles to achieving the preferred outcome for children and families, preventing or delaying their reunificati on. The caseworker may be able to determine whether the therapist/psychologist is familiar with the deaf and their culture by how they respond to questions about deaf persons and how they communicate to deaf persons themselves or through qualified interpreters. Procedures 302 - Appendix L (10) SERVICES DELIVERED BY THE DEPARTMENT June 11, 2010 - P.T. 2010.09 Common Indicators of Misdiagnosis and Bias There are several indicators in the assessm ent of deaf clients that may indicate the presence of misdiagnoses or bias : The following are some examples: The findings of the assessment indicate the deaf client is mentally retarded; A psychiatric examination was conducte d by a person who is not fluent in sign language or wit hout a qualified interpreter present; The assessment was not individualized to meet the needs of a deaf client; An evaluation tool was used which relies heavily upon English language competence and the client is diagnosed as mentally retarded; The clinician conducting the asse ssment has no training in the psychosocial aspects of deafness, no exposure to deaf culture and no experience evaluating deaf clients; or Failure by the psychologist to co nduct both cognitive and adaptive functioning. If one or more of these indicators is pr esent, a copy of the assessment report shall be forwarded to the Statewide Deaf Se rvices Coordinator and the Clinical Services Coordinator in the child's re gion and a clinical review shall be conducted. d) Services 1) Communication Requirements A prerequisite to the provision of services to Department clients is that the services be made available in a manner which can be understood by clients with special communication needs such as those who have limited or no English speaking ability or who have hearing loss. The Department's facilitates communication with such c lients through the early identification of communication needs, the assignment of staff who can communicate with the clients, the translation of forms, notices and letters into a language the client can understand and through the use of interpreters and other auxiliary aids. DCFS and POS caseworkers and supervisors are responsible for locating and accessing services that are provided in the client's preferred mode of communication. Procedures 302 - Appendix L (11) SERVICES DELIVERED BY THE DEPARTMENT June 11, 2010 - P.T. 2010.09 2) Specialized Parenting Services A person's inability to hear does not render them unfit as parents. Evaluation of a deaf or hard of heari ng parent's ability to care for children must be individualized. The DCFS or POS worker shall explore the technology and auxiliary aids that may assist such parents in caring for their children. Auxiliary devices such as door bell and a flashing device, closed captioning which enables hearing children of deaf parents to hear and read, specialized webcams, ba by monitors and alerts, computer programs to teach sign language, and other devices can improve the ability of deaf parents to take care of th eir children. Parent coaching on the use of auxiliary devices should be provided. e) Placement Considerations for De af or Hard of Hearing Children DCFS and POS workers must adhere to Procedures 301.60, Placement Selection Criteria when selecting a placement for childre n. All placements are to be made consistent with the best interests a nd special needs of the children. The Department will make diligent efforts to place children who have special communication/language needs in a home th at can meet those needs. This includes children with limited English sp eaking ability and children who are deaf or deaf or hard of hearing. The Department uses specialized caseworkers, sign language interpreters or translators, and other auxiliary aids to meet the communication needs of children and adults who are deaf and hard of hearing. Communication must be a critical consid eration when placing deaf or hard of hearing children or hearing children of d eaf adults (CODA). In order to preserve the child's deaf culture and maintain his or her ties to the deaf community, when a deaf or hard of hearing children must be removed from the home, DCFS and POS caseworker shall document all efforts to place the child in a home that is communication accessible. 1) Placement of a Deaf or Hard of Hearing Child (HOH) In prioritized order, a d eaf or hard of hearing ch ild shall be placed in a foster home in which: At least one individual that is deaf or HOH, has sign language abilities, and is willing to undergo the necessary training to become specialized foster parents for the deaf. Individuals that are familiar with sign language and the deaf culture but cannot sign and may or may not be deaf or HOH. Examples would be adult childre n of deaf adults (CODA'S), audiologists, or others working in fields who may work with the deaf and HOH on a regular basis. Procedures 302 - Appendix L (12) SERVICES DELIVERED BY THE DEPARTMENT June 11, 2010 - P.T. 2010.09 Any other foster home that is willing to undergo the necessary training to become communicati on accessible for individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing. If a home meeting these criteria is no t available, the DCFS or POS worker shall initiate targeted recruitment fo r a home that can support the child's communication needs. Locating an emergency foster home or adoptive home that is communication accessible must be a priority for the DCFS or POS worker and the supervisor. In the absence of an interpreter, it may be necessary to communicate by writing or if the child is unable to read or write, books, computer software, or video tapes/DVD's showing and teaching signs are available. Auxiliary aids to assist in communication must be provided and may include video equipment (television sets, VCR's, DVD players, etc.) that display the closed captions on the video programs, a TDD if the child is old enough to use a telephone and special alarms for smoke/carbon monoxide detectors, fire alarms, doorbells, and telephones . Videophones are available free of charge to deaf or hard of hearin g individuals provided they have high speed internet in the home. The child's worker is responsib le for developing a Plan of Accommodation when a deaf or hard of hearing (HOH) child is placed in a home with hearing foster parents who have no sign language skills. 2) Placement of a Hearing Ch ild of Deaf Adults (CODA) Children of deaf adults (CODA) who are not deaf or HOH shall be placed in communication accessible homes where they will be able to maintain or develop their signing skills, be exposed to the deaf culture, and maintain their involvement in deaf organizati ons and activities. If an accessible home is not available, targeted recr uitment efforts shal l be conducted. The child's case plan shall include sign language classe s and exposure to deaf culture. VII. MONITORING SERVICES TO DE AF OR HARD OF HEARING CLIENTS The Office of Information Technology provides the Statewide Deaf Se rvices Coordinator with identifying information on children, yout h, caregivers and fam ily members who are deaf or hard of hearing each month. The Coordinator monitors to ensure that appropriate resources and supports are provided. The St atewide Deaf Services Coordinator notifies the Clinical Services Coordinator if the servi ces and interventions th at are being provided to a deaf or hard of hearing child or adult do not provide acc ess to appropriate services.

CASE ASSIGNMENT For deaf and hard of hear ing clients, DCFS and POS s upervisors shall make case assignments the following prioritized basis: Staff that that specialize in services to deaf or hard of hear ing individuals and who are able to effectively communicate using American Sign Language(ASL); or Experienced staff person having no fewer than 5 years of ex perience with IDCFS or a private agency who has completed all of the training pertai ning to deaf clients and deaf needs; or If there are no staff available meeting these criteria, the most senior staff will be assigned to the case and, if not alrea dy trained, will contact the Statewide Coordinator of D eaf Services for immediate training. IX. TRAINING Ideally, parent training for deaf HOH clients should be conducted by a parent trainer and professionals that are either deaf or come from a deaf fa mily (CODA) and can sign to the parents. If such a trainer is not available, a certified interpreter shall be present at the training sessions and translate the informati on to the parent(s). Training sessions can be one on one or in groups. Group sessions encourag e sharing concerns that all deaf parents have in common about their children such as discipline, health and general child rearing. A portion of the training shoul d also cover the cultural i ssues unique to the deaf. Parent training for hearing parents who ha ve deaf children also requires a trainer specialized in deaf culture and familiar with al l of the auxiliary aids that are available to the parents to assist them in raising their deaf child. Training of potential foster parents in areas sp ecific to the deaf and hard of hearing will be arranged through the Statewide Deaf a nd Hard of Hearing coordinator provided resources. A communication plan for ongoing tr aining of foster parents wanting to be a communication accessible household will be developed and followed. Training of IDCFS staff and POS Agency Staff across the entire state: An online training course has been completed and participation in this training has been made mandatory for all staff. This online training course w ill help all direct service child welfare professionals apply the DCFS D eaf and Hard of Hearing Policy to your job, as either a child protection investigative specialist, a chil d welfare caseworker to either intact family or placement cases, or a casework supervisor . After completing Working with Deaf and Hard of Hearing Families online training, staff will be able to: Explain the services the Department is mandated to provide to individuals who are Deaf and Hard of Hearing. Procedures 302 - Appendix L (14) SERVICES DELIVERED BY THE DEPARTMENT June 11, 2010 - P.T. 2010.09 Locate resources for Deaf and Hard of Hearing persons. Engage Deaf and Hard of Hearing persons. Assess the need for service provision of Deaf and Ha rd of Hearing persons. Provide service intervention to Deaf and Hard of Hearing persons in the following areas: o DCP investigations; o Intact services; and o Permanency/foster care services. Reference rules, procedures , and regulations related to communicating effectively with the Deaf and Hard of Hearing. X. RESOURCES Each region shall compile a list of providers who provide services to persons who are deaf or hard of hearing and ma ke the list available to DCFS and POS direct service staff. These services include but are not limited to interpreter services , counseling, advocacy, foster care and adoption, homemaker, case ma nagement, residential and psychological services. Additionally, update d lists of resources by regi on are available online by visiting the State of Illin ois Deaf and Hard of He aring Commission's (IDHHC) at Homepage at, http://www.idhhc.state.il.us/ . The Department will develop and provide needed services not available in the community fr om public and private agencies. Technical assistance can be obt ained from the Department's Statewide 504 Coordinator in the Office of Affirmative Action, the Illinois Department of Rehabilitation Services or local Centers for Independent Living. Note: Please refer to Procedures 359.5(k), Payment for Interpre ter Services and Auxiliary Aids, for payment information. Targeted Resource Development In its ongoing efforts to meet the needs of children and families it serves, DCFS has developed a resource development plan for its deaf and hard of hearing clients which focuses on: Contracting with specialized couns eling, treatment, evaluation and case management services for the deaf an d hard of hearing child and adult. Recruitment of communication accessible foster and adoptive homes for deaf children to prevent placemen t of deaf children with foster parents unable to communicate with the child ren in their language. Procedures 302 - Appendix L (15) SERVICES DELIVERED BY THE DEPARTMENT June 11, 2010 - P.T. 2010.09 The Department has established the following pr iorities in recruiting homes that allow for equal foster home access for deaf or hard-of-hearing children: Homes with at least one individual that is deaf or hard of hearing has sign language abilities, and is wi lling to undergo the necessa ry training to become specialized foster parents for the deaf. Individuals that are famili ar with sign language and the deaf culture but cannot sign and may or may not be deaf or hard of hearing. Examples would be children of deaf adults (CODA'S), audiologists, or others working in fields who may work with the deaf or hard of hearing on a regular basis. Any other foster home that would be will ing to undergo the ne cessary training to become communication accessible for the deaf or hard of hearing. To lessen the trauma children experience, first as the result of the abuse/neglect they have suffered and subsequently by separation from their parents, recruitment of accessible foster homes willing to serve children on an emergency basis is a critical part of this initiative. Targeted recruitment will be conducted when an accessible home is not available for a child who is deaf or hard of hearing. XI. DISCRIMINATION COMPLAINTS If any individual seeking or receiving Departme nt services has reason to believe that they have been discriminated against because of race, color, national origin, sex, religion, ancestry, inability to speak or comprehend the English language, disabilities or age, they shall be directed to file a complaint with the Department's Office of Affirmative Action: Department of Children and Family Services Office of Affirmative Action 1911 South Indiana Avenue, 4th Fl.

However, sign language interpreters will be the main communication link between the deaf and often h earing IDCFS staff person or POS st aff. It is important that staff persons dealing with the deaf understand the terminology used in classification of sign language interpreters. According to Illinois Law (225 ILCS 443/1) \"Int erpreters for the Deaf\" licensure Act of 2007; \"On or after January 1, 2009, no person shall practice as an interpreter for the deaf, hold himself or herself out as a licensed interpreter for the deaf, or use the title \"Licensed Interpreter for the Deaf,\" \"Licensed Transliterator fo r the Deaf,\" or any other title or abbreviation to indicate that the person is a licensed interpreter, unless he or she is licensed in accordance with the provisions of this Act.\" A person practicing as an interpre ter for the deaf under this new law must be licensed with the State of Illinois Deaf and Hard of Heari ng Commission. DCFS will recommend that only licensed interpreters be used. See above, Section VI (a) (2) of these proc edures for additional licensure requirements for interpreters working with DCFS. Certified Deaf Interpreters (CDI) are increasingly being used in the interpreting process. The CDI is a person who is deaf or hard of hearing. In addition to proficient communication skills and general interpreter tr aining, the CDI has special ized training and/or experience in the use of gesture, mime, props drawings and other to ols to enhance communication. The CDI has knowledge and understanding of deaf ness, the Deaf community, and Deaf culture. The CDI also possesses native or near-native fluency in American Sign Language.

SERVI CES DELIVERED BY THE DEPARTMENT September 2 4, 2020 - PT 2020. 15 Illinois Department of Children and Family Services Procedures 30 2.Appendix M - (2) c) Transition to Inde pendence Transition planning is an ongoing process for youth in care . Beginning as early as age 14, transition planning starts with an assessment of th e youth's strengths and needs in order to function as an independent adult, and allows for input from t he youth, car egiver, Permanency Worker and other appropriate individuals who have strong concern for the youth's welfare (e.g., youth's family, tea chers and counselors) in identifying the skills the youth needs to begin to acqu ire. At age 17, the youth and Permanency Worker develop the youth's first Youth Driven T ransition Plan (YDTP) . This written transition plan, documented on the CFS 2032 -1, Youth Dri ven Transition Plan , will list t he developmental act ivities and identify the supportive services design ed to assess and enhance the youth's development of independent living skills. The youth and Permanency Worker are expected to review and update t he YDT P at regular i ntervals to ensure that it remains current and includes all identi fied needs. Regular r eviews will also ensure that the youth, Permanency Worker, Department /POS agency , and the listed service providers are performing their assigned tasks and fulfilling their responsibilities . The YDTP must also contain information about the importance of de signating a nother individual to make health care treatment decisions on behalf of the youth, if the youth becomes unable to participate in such dec isions and does not have, or does not want, a relative who would otherwise be auth orized under State l aw to m ake such decisions. The youth must be provided the option to execute a health care power of attorney, health care proxy or other simil ar document recogni zed under State law for this purpose . At age s 19 and 20.9 (or 90 days prio r to leaving care), the youth and Permanency Worker will attend Countdown to 21 (C21) Meetings . A Countdown to 21 Meeting is a youth driven team planning process , guided by a facil itator who has no prior involvement in the case, that engages the youth, Permanency Worker , car egiver, family, and other individuals who have strong concern for the youth's welfare to help identify the youth's adult connections/relations hips and det ermine the array and intensity of supports and services needed to assist the youth in planning for suc cessful discharge from care. It is the Department's expectation that youth in care ages 17 and older will be engaged in a post-secondary educ ational or v ocation al program, employed at least part time (80 hours/month), or participating in a progra m or ac tivity de signed to promote or remove barriers to employment . Advanced educational and /or work experience is critical to ensure the youth is continuing to learn skills necessary to successfully sustain themselv es upon leaving care. For Federal IV -E claiming purpos es, the Permanency Worker must document in the Service Plan for youth in care age 18 through 20 years old whether the youth is atten ding school, wo rking , or pa rticipating in a job training related activity . When a youth is incapable of attending school on a full -time basis due to a medical condition, the Permanency Worker shall ensure that information related to that condition is docu mented in the c ase r ecord a nd Service Plan. When a youth is incapable of doing any of the se activities due to a medical con dition, the Permanency Worker must ensure that SERVI CES DELIVERED BY THE DEPARTMENT September 2 4, 2020 - PT 2020. 15 Illinois Department of Children and Family Services Procedures 30 2.Appendix M - (3) information related to that condition is documented in the case record and Service Plan. \"Medical c onditio n\" is defined as follows : A disability, as defined in the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (AD A), means either: a physical o r mental impairment that su bstantially limits one or more of an individual's major life activities; a record of such an imp airment; or being regarded as possessing such an impairment. \"Major Life Activities\" are those basic activities that the average per son can perform with little or no difficulty. This includes , but is not limited to, walking, seeing, he aring, speak ing, br eathing, learning and working. Note: A youth in care age 18 through 20 who is placed in a residentia l treatment cent er or group home set ting is presumed to have a medical condition , sufficient to meet this definition. In addition to completing the CFS 2 032-1, Youth Driven Transition Plan (YDTP) with the youth at age 1 7, the Permanency Worker must also : Provide education regarding Power of Attorney for Healthcare to all youth in care who are 17 years of age, reg ardless of living arrang ement, and inform t he youth regarding their option to exe cute the Power of At torney for Health Care on or after their 18th birthday by reviewing CFS 2032 -2, Your Future, Your Health ; with Statutory Short Form Power of Att orney for H ealth Care with the yout h; Obtain the youth's signature the CFS 2032-3, Receipt of Informa tion & Educatio n Regarding Health Care Options after this review ; Sign and date the CFS 2032 -3, Receipt of Information & Education Regarding Health Ca re Options and retain copies for th e youth's permane nt record as appropriate; and Provide the Administrative Case Revie wer with copies of all signed documents (i.e., the CFS 2032 -1 and CFS 203 2-3). 1) Life Skills Assessment The Department has chosen the Casey Life Skills Assessment (CLSA ) to es tablish the baseline life sk ills needed of youth served by the Department. Th e CLSA is a self-reporting instrument that allows youth and their Permanency Workers to assess their strengths and challenges for each o f the eight life skill domains: Dai ly Living; Self Car e; Relat ionships and Communication; Housing and Money Management; Work and Study; Career and Education Planning; Looking Forward ; and Permanency. SERVI CES DELIVERED BY THE DEPARTMENT September 2 4, 2020 - PT 2020. 15 Illinois Department of Children and Family Services Procedures 30 2.Appendix M - (4) The CLSA is appropriate for all youth ages 14 to 21 reg ardless of living circumstances. The Permanency Worke r is required to administer the assessment to each youth on their c aseload no later than 30 days after the youth's 14th and 16th birthdays, and 6 months prior to the youth's planne d discharge from guardianshi p. Yo uth entering the child welfare system afte r their 14th birthday shall be administered the life skills assessm ent no later than 60 days after their entry into substitute care. When administered at these intervals, the CL SA provides an ongoing guide f or the Permanency Worker and other providers to ensure development of appropriate service plans for each youth to a cquire independent living skills. The Permanency Worker shall do the following in preparation for each youth's ACR: At Quarterly Ch ild and Family Team Meetings, evaluat e the youth's progr ess in completing the Servic e Plan's life skills objectives. Admin ister a n updated CLSA to the youth utilizing only those domains needed to review the life skills objectives in the youth 's Service Plan . The CLSA can b e admin istered in English, Spanish or French. (For Spanish - speaking youth or youth who express a prefer ence to complete the assessment in the Spanish language, the assessme nt shall be complete d in Spanish and all written documentation acco mpanying se rvice s must be in the S panish language in accordance with the Burgos Consent Decree .) Print a copy of the CL SA assessment results and any documentation of the programs or servic es in which the yout h is participating that will enable the youth t o live inde pendently . The program /services may inclu de chores and/or training and direction that the youth is receiving in their foster home or living arrangement . The CLSA assessment res ults and documentati on of the programs and services shall be taken to the ACR . When ap propria te, est ablish new life ski lls Outcomes, Action Steps and time frames in the Service Pla n to address identified unmet needs. The Permanency Worker can obtain a co py of the Casey Life Skills Assessment instrument, a sample templat e for the S ervice Plan and a resou rce gu ide fro m the organization's website (www.caseylifeskills.org ). This website can also be accessed thro ugh the Resources li nk on D -net (Resources>Youth in Care>Promoting Independenc e and Self Sufficiency> Life S kills). To ad minister the life skills assessment, the Permanency Worker must es tablish an account on the Casey website. If assistance is needed, cl ick on the \"Help and Training\" link on the Casey Life Skills homepa ge. \"How t o\" guides and video tut orials are al so available on the Casey website. The Casey Life Skills Assessment may not be appropriate for adolescent youth i n care with special needs due to developm ental disabilities. For youth who have cognitive chal lenges, t he Permanency Worker can use the Level 1 (ele mentary SERVI CES DELIVERED BY THE DEPARTMENT September 2 4, 2020 - PT 2020. 15 Illinois Department of Children and Family Services Procedures 30 2.Appendix M - (5) age) assessment , Level 2 (middle school age) assessment, or si t with the youth to help the youth complete skill areas in the CLS main assessment . (E.g., read the statements to them if they have reading ch allenges. ) Permanency Worker s may contact the DCFS Intellectual/Development al Disabilities Prog ram (Outlook email : ServicesDevelopmental Disabilities ) with any questions . Pregnant/parenting youth should complete the CLSA supple ment for pregnant/parenting yo uth in addition to the primary assessment, and receive parenting education and/or training to address identified deficits and reinforce identified strength s. 2) Life Skills Training Acquisition of daily living skills are c ritical to th e achievement of ec onomic and social s elf-sufficiency . As part of the CLSA process, the Permanency Worker , in consultation with the youth, caregiver and involved providers , shall develop a Transition Plan with the yo uth that contain s indivi dualized object ives, tasks, and resource s. The youth 's assessment shall be used as a guide in developing the transition plan . The Permanency Worker shall document the Transition Plan object ives and tasks in the youth 's Service Plan . A sig nificant segment of the youth' s practical indepen dent l iving trainin g will take place in his /her placement environment and the Pe rmanency Wo rker must provide the youth 's caregiver with life skills instructional activities and suggestions . The Pe rmanency Wo rker should offer the \"Res ources to Inspire Guid e\" as a reference f or caregivers. This guide lists goals, learning objectives and a sample of youth -appropriate resources that may be useful to the caregiver, and may also be helpful when preparing a youth's Service Plan . The Permanenc y Worker should als o refer a youth to community -based life skills training programs when available and appropr iate. Many providers offer community -based life skil ls development program s for youth who demonstrate a need for training beyond what can be prov ided by the caregiv er and Permanency Worker. Program curricul a may provide practical experience that reinforce money ma nagemen t, consumer awareness, food management, personal appearance, health, housekeeping, transportation, educational plannin g, job - seeking skills, emergen cy and safety skill s, knowledge of community resources, interperson al skills, and hous ing. Classes are stru ctured to meet the identified needs of the participants . To refer a youth for life skills training, t he Permanency Wo rker shall complete and send a refer ral pa cket to the appropriate Transitio n Manager of the Office of Education and Transition Services (OETS ).

By the youth's high school freshman year, formalized planning, high school credits earned and work experience should be consider ed ann ually and inc luded in the youth's educational and t ransition plan s. Note: For youth el igible for special education or receiving special education services, planning post -secondary education or employment must start at age 14\u00bd and be a part of a n IEP transition plan th at is later noted in the CFS 2032 -1, Youth Driven Transition Plan (YDTP) (devel oped at age 17). The transition plan at this age drives the education plan process ( see Procedures 314.50, Educational Plan ). Youth in care planning for po st-secondary educati on should obtain informat ion and assi stance from their school counse lor con cernin g colleges or trade schools, campus visitation, American College Test (ACT) or Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) registration an d preparati on, financial aid a nd sch olarships (Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA)) .

The law also requires the federal Administration for Children and Famil ies (AC F) to develop a data collec tion system to track indepe ndent living services that states provide to youth and develo p outcomes t o measure s tates' success in preparing youth for independe nce. The law requires ACF to impose a penalty of between 1 and 5 perce nt of a state's annu al Cha fee allotment fo r any state that does not comp ly with reporting requirements. To meet t he mandate, A CF publishe d a rule in the Federal Register on Febr uary 26, 2008. The rule establishes the National Youth in Transition D atabase (NYTD) requiring st ates to conduct client -specific da ta collection a ctivities on an ongoing basis. The purpose o f NYTD is to measure the effectiveness of providing independent living services to youth by measuring outcomes for yo uth who have aged out of care. 2) NYTD Requi rement s The NYTD regu lation ident ifies three populations that are separate, but not mutually exclusive. Together, th ese three populations com prise the repor ting population. NYTD requires that states report to ACF all youth who receiv e at least one indep endent living skills s ervice paid for, or provided by, the Chafee -funded agency (DCFS). This is the \"Served Population .\" NYTD requires that the following 14 i ndepend ent livi ng skills services be reported: Independent Living Need s Asses smen t.

[705 ILC S 405/2 -31] SERVICES DELIVERED BY THE DEPARTMENT June 15, 1999 - P.T. 99.14 SUBPART C: DEPARTMENT CHILD WELFARE SERVICES APPENDIX N -Transition Planning For Wards With Developmental Disabilities Procedures 302. Appendix M - Transition Planning fo r Adolescent Wards, describes components of planning for adolescents who are transitioning from th e child welfare system into the self-sufficiency of adulthood. This Appendix outlines additional procedures applicable to those youths for whom the Department is legally responsible who have special needs due to a developmental disability. A. DEFINITIONS \"Developmental disability\" means a disability which is attributable to (a) mental retardation, cerebral palsy, epilepsy or autis m; or to (b) any condition which results in impairment similar to that caused by mental retardation and which requires services similar to those required by menta lly retarded persons. Such disability must originate before the age of 18 years, be expected to continue indefinitely, and constitute a substantial handicap. \"Developmental disability services\" means an array of community-based supports and residential services designed to en able individuals with developmental disabilities to reside in their own homes whenever possible, and to achieve their maximum potential for independence and self-sufficiency. \"Disabled person\" means a person 18 years or older who (a) because of mental deterioration or physical incapacity is not fully able to manage his person or estate, or (b) is a person with mental illness or a person with a developmental disability and who because of his mental illness or developmental disability is not fully able to manage his person or estate. \"Independent Service Coordination Agency (ISC)\" means a community agency under contract with the Department of Human Services to provide information, referral and coordination of services to pe rson(s) with developmental disabilities and their families. The following disability codes in the DCFS CYCIS system relate to developmental disabilities: D= Autism E= Traumatic Brain Injury G= Mild Mental Retardation Procedures 302 - Appendix N (1) SERVICES DELIVERED BY THE DEPARTMENT June 15, 1999 - P.T. 99.14 H= Moderate Mental Retardation I= Severe Mental Retardation J= Profound Mental Retardation K= Cerebral Palsy L= Epilepsy N= Mental Retardation/Physical Disability V= Developmentally Disabled/Child In Need of Mental Health Services W= Developmentally Disabled/Substance Abuse X= Medically Complex/Developmentally Disabled It is essential that child welfare staff correctly enter disability codes on the CFS 1410, Registration/Case Opening form so that childre n/youth with disabilities are identified and included in service planning. B. TRANSITION PLANNING Effective transition planning begins early and starts with appropriate assessment of the youth's skills and needs. Assessment tools for other children and youth may not be appropriate for youths with developmental di sabilities. The child welfare worker should consult with staff of the Department's Clini cal Division to determine assessment needs. At minimum, assessment tools must be specifica lly designed to assess the functioning of the adolescent with developmental disabilities and determine cognitive function, social adaptive function, and capacity for independent living. When the child welfare worker determines, or has reason to believe, that a youth for whom the Department is legally responsible may be unable to fully manage on his or her own or manage his or her estate without ongoing supports, the child welfare worker must ensure that adult developmental services and/or adult guardianship are in place prior to the youth's discharge from care. Not all persons with developmental disabilities require or need specialized services such as adult guardianship. Many are able to function independently. Others are able to function in the community with such natural s upports as family, friends or neighbors. These resources should be explored before consid ering whether the youth may need specialized adult services. Child welfare workers shall develop service pl ans for children for whom the Department is legally responsible that lead to reduced n eed for services and increased capacity for independent functioning, economic self-sufficien cy, and community integration. Skill areas include but are not limited to: personal care, si mple food preparation, safety precaution, use of public transportation, basic money manage ment, and vocational training and placement. Procedures 302 - Appendix N (2) SERVICES DELIVERED BY THE DEPARTMENT June 15, 1999 - P.T. 99.14 The Department of Children and Family Services (DCFS), the Department of Human Services (DHS) and the Guardianship and Advocacy Commission (GAC) have entered into an interagency agreement which defines th e responsibilities of the three agencies for planning and carrying out the transition of yout h from the child welfare system to adult developmental services. C. ACCESSING ADULT DD SERVICES 1) DHS Developmental Disability(DD) Network Adult developmental services are provide d by the Department of Human Services (DHS) through its statewide network. When the youth reaches 17 1/2 years old, the child welfare worker should contact the DHS DD Network represen tative for the area (See Attachment A for list) to indicate th at he/she believes a youth for whom DCFS is legally responsible may be in need of adult developmental disability services. At minimum, the information required fo r a referral will include social history, current service plan, copies of psychol ogical or psychiatric assessments, and Individual Education Plan (IEP). The DHS DD Network representative will re view the referral for appropriateness. Included in this review process is the youth's disability code. If the disability code is missing or does not indicate a developmenta l disability, processing of the referral could be delayed while additional informati on is sought to verify that the youth has a developmental disability. If in reviewing the referral, the DHS DD network staff determine that it is inappropriate for an Independent Servi ce Coordination agency (ISC) to begin working with a youth, they will notify the child welfare worker in writing of the reason(s) for this determination. If the referral is deemed appropriate , the DHS DD Network representative will authorize the case for assignment to a local Independent Service Coordination agency. 2) Independent Service Coordination Agencies Access to DHS services for persons with developmental disabilities is determined by an assessment completed by a statewid e network of Independent Service Coordination agencies (ISCs). Procedures 302 - Appendix N (3) SERVICES DELIVERED BY THE DEPARTMENT June 15, 1999 - P.T. 99.14 The assessment done by the ISC focuses on the following areas: Self Care - Ability to perform daily activitie s to meet basic life needs including feeding, bathing, toileting, dressing, hygiene and grooming; Language - Communication involving verbalization or an alternative communication system which enables an individual to convey ideas and information to others; Learning - General cognitive competence; the ability to acquire new behaviors, perceptions, and information; and the ability to apply experiences to new situations; and Mobility - Ability to perform gross and fine motor-skills. The capability of locomotion, either by independent ambul ation or with mobility assistance such as adaptive equipment/ mechanical aids. See Attachment B for a listing of ISCs and the areas they serve. The child welfare worker is expected to provide all information requested by the ISC to make their assessment on a timely basis. The worker shall also ensure that the youth is available for appointments, if requested. Consent of the guardian and authorizations for release of information shall be requested as required by Department policy. In assessing a youth's needs, the ISC will provide the child welfare worker information regarding available services which are appropriate to meet the youth's needs. If placement is required in an a dult facility other than the youth's current foster home, the ISC will suggest placemen t options. The ISC will also provide a recommendation regarding whether the youth needs an adult guardian. The child welfare worker, in conjunction with his or her supervisor, retains responsibility for providing any necessary re ferral information to the adult service provider(s) proposed by the ISC, and for fina l selection of the service provider. The decision-making process should include th e youth with developmental disabilities and take into consideration his or he r preferences. The ISC cannot recommend one particular service provider over another. D. ADULT GUARDIANSHIP When the ISC assessment concludes that a youth may need an adult guardian, the child welfare worker is responsible for taking the necessary steps to ensure the appropriate Procedures 302 - Appendix N (4) SERVICES DELIVERED BY THE DEPARTMENT June 15, 1999 - P.T. 99.14 appointment of a guardian. In addition to comply ing with Sections B and C of this Appendix to ensure appropriate adult placement, servi ces and funding, the child welfare worker must obtain supporting documentation from a physicia n and identify an appropriate guardian before a petition for guardianship can be filed. As part of this process, the child welfare worker should explore less restrictive alternativ es such as appointment of a limited guardian or protective payee for youths who have some ability to manage their own affairs. Guardianship of an adult with a disability re quires filing a petition in the Probate Court of the county in which the youth re sides. The DCFS Regional Counsel, in conjunction with the Office of State Guardian (OSG) if applicable (see Section F below), will file the petition in the appropriate county, when the appropriate steps have been completed. Generally, the petition should be filed no later than the date the youth reaches the age of twenty years and six months to allow time for the court proceed ing before the youth reaches age twenty-one. The following information and documents should be gathered by the child welfare worker and presented to the DCFS Regional Counsel, so that they can file the petition for appointment of an adult guardian. 1) Physician's Report A petition for the appointment of a guardian through the Probate Court must be accompanied by the report of a licensed phys ician who has examined the individual with a disability within the past three m onths. The physician's report attests to the mental and physical condition of the individual as well as the physician's assessment of the individual's ability to make decisions and function independently. Since the physician's report filed in the court pro ceeding must be based on an examination which occurred less than three months prio r to the filing of the guardianship petition, the child welfare worker shall coordinate securing the examination with the Regional Counsel and the Guardianship and Advocacy Commission, if applicable. The physician's report should be completed by a physician who has some familiarity with the youth with a disability since the report calls for an opinion as to the youth's ability to function independently. Accordingl y, if the youth's condition arises from a V Code disability such as a mental illness diagnosis, the report is most appropriately completed by the youth's treating psychiatri st. If, however, the youth's condition is organically based, a report from the yout h's primary physician should be obtained. NOTE: A psychological evaluation or a statement by a mental health professional is NOT sufficient to support a petition for adult guardianship. The physician's report must be completed by a licensed physician. Procedures 302 - Appendix N (5) SERVICES DELIVERED BY THE DEPARTMENT June 15, 1999 - P.T. 99.14 2) Identifying a Suitable Guardian The identified guardian for a youth may be a private citizen such as a family member, friend, current or former foster pa rent(s). A private organization may be appointed such as a designee at a residentia l facility or social service agency. As a last resort, the Office of the State Guar dian under the Guardianship and Advocacy Commission may be appointed. It is the responsibility of the child welfare worker to determine the suitability of the person he or she wishes to recommend be named as guardian of a person with developmental disabilities. The assessmen t of the individual's suitability shall include, at minimum, the following: (a) Whether the person meets the statutory definition of who may act as guardian under The Probate Act of 1975 (755 ILCS 5/11a-5) which states: A person who has attained the age of 18 years; is a resident of the United States, is not of unsound mind, is not an adjudged disabled person as defined in this Act, and has not been convicted of a felony, and who the court finds is capable of providing an active and suit able program of guardianship for the disabled person is qualified to act as guardian of the person and, if he is a resident of this State, guardian of the estate of a disabled person. Background Check Required The person selected to serve as adult guardian is required to authorize CANTS and LEADS checks with the understanding that without these checks the Department will be unable to determine their suitability. The individual is required to sign a C FS 718G, Authorization For Background Check. The CFS 718G includes an ac knowledgment that the information resulting from the CANTS and LEADS i nvestigations will be shared with DHS, the GAC and the court as n ecessary in processing the adult guardianship. Once the individual has authorized the CANTS and LEADS checks by signing CFS 718G, the child welfare work er, with proper identification, may telefax the form to the State Central Register at 217/524-0359 to request the background check. The results of the background check and the confirmation number provided by SCR shall be recorded on the CFS 718G for later use in filing a guardianship petition. Procedures 302 - Appendix N (6) SERVICES DELIVERED BY THE DEPARTMENT June 15, 1999 - P.T. 99.14 NOTE : Under provisions of the Child Ca re Act of 1969, persons convicted of some felonies may be licensed afte r meeting certain criteria. The Probate Act requires that the individual a ppointed guardian of a person be free of felony convictions. Therefore, a LEADS check is required regardless of whether the individual is currently licensed as a foster parent. The suitability of a person with a record of indicated child abuse or neglect on CANTS may be evaluated in accordance with the criteria set forth in Part 385, Background Checks, Section 385.50. (b) Whether the person is an indicated perpetrator of child abuse or neglect or has a criminal record; (c) In addition to statutory requirements and safety, other factors to assess in determining the suitability of a person to serve as guardian include, but are not limited to: The wishes of the person with the developmental disability; The length of time the individua l has known the person with the developmental disability and the nature of the relationship; Whether the individual is likely to exert undue influence or pressure on the person with a developmental disability rather than permit him or her to exercise independence and judgment to the maximum extent to which the person with a developmental disability is capable; Whether the person demonstrates an unde rstanding of any special needs that the youth might have as a result of his or her developmental disability; Whether the person can communicate with the youth in the youth's preferred mode of communication and/or language; Whether the person has an observabl e or diagnosed illn ess, disability or other impairment (including substance/alcohol dependency or abuse) which might interfere with their ability to meet the needs of the youth with a disability; Procedures 302 - Appendix N (7) SERVICES DELIVERED BY THE DEPARTMENT June 15, 1999 - P.T. 99.14 Whether the person demonstrates a willingness to work with the youth, siblings or other family members and/or community agencies to meet any special needs the youth might have; Whether there are members of th e individual's household who might pose a threat to the person with a disability; and Whether the proposed residence can physically accommodate the needs of the youth; if necessary, it is wheelchair accessible or can be made accessible by a ramp, lift, etc. It may be necessary to assess severa l potential guardians before making a recommendation. A written record shall be maintained of all persons considered and the reason(s) they were determined unsuitable. In the event of a referral to the Office of the State Guardian, it may also be necessary to explain why these individuals were ruled out. E. OFFICE OF THE PUBLIC GUARDIAN The Office of the Public Guardian should be explored as the potential adult guardian when the youth has an estate of more than $25,000. The Office of the Public Guardian then manages the estate and is responsible for providing the appropriate accountings to the Probate Court each year. If the youth has such an estate, the child welfare worker should contact the DCFS Office of the Guardian to obt ain information about the exact nature and extent of the estate, and then refer the youth to the Office of the Public Guardian. F. OFFICE OF THE STATE GUARDIAN The Office of the State Guardi an (OSG), a division of the Guardianship and Advocacy Commission, is charged with the responsibility of serving as guardian of the person or guardian of the estate of an individual, or both, when so appointed by a court under the Probate Act of 1975. The Office of State Guardi an may assume full or partial guardianship of a person depending upon the individual's ability to manage his or her own affairs. By statute, the Office of State Gu ardian is the \"guardian of last resort\" and can assume its guardianship role only when no private individua l or agency is available to function as guardian. The Office of State Guardian may al so recommend alternatives to guardianship (such as protective payee or power of attorn ey) when it is felt that guardianship is not needed. Procedures 302 - Appendix N (8) SERVICES DELIVERED BY THE DEPARTMENT June 15, 1999 - P.T. 99.14 1) Referral to OSG Prior to making a referral to the Office of the State Guardian, the child welfare worker shall identify and assess other potential guardians from among the youth's family members, friends, former and current foster parents, and other interested parties and organizations. Also, prior to making a referral to the OSG, details such as who the adult service provider will be and how services will be funded need to be worked out in conjunction with the ISC's and DHS Network staff. A referral to the Office of the State Guardian is made through the regional office of the Guardianship and Advocacy Commission serving the area where the individual lives. See Attachment C for a directory of GAC offices. To make a referral to OSG, the child welfare worker must telephone or visit the nearest GAC office and request the re ferral form, GAC309-078l, Guardianship Referral/ Client Status Form. In Cook C ounty, the child welfare worker can call 708/338-7500 and ask to speak with an intake worker who can complete the referral form over the phone. The Referral/Client Status Form requires complete information, including: a) Availability of potential guardians (other than DCFS); b) Funding sources; c) Nature of the disability necessitating guardianship; and d) Type of guardianship required (full or partial). The OSG will review the referral and notify the child welfare worker of its guardianship decision, in writing, usually within thirty days. In urgent cases (such as a child/youth placement disruption), OSG will complete its review within fourteen days. If OSG determines that adult guardians hip is appropriate, DCFS Regional Counsel will petition the Probate Court to have OSG appointed guardian of the youth. The OSG guardianship will serve as the basi s for requesting termination of DCFS guardianship in the Juvenile Court. If the OSG determines that adult guardianshi p is not appropriate or necessary, or that OSG is not best suited to serve as guardian for the youth, the OSG will Procedures 302 - Appendix N (9) SERVICES DELIVERED BY THE DEPARTMENT June 15, 1999 - P.T. 99.14 notify the child welfare worker of the reasons for that conclusion. OSG may also offer alternatives to state guardianship to effect the youth's transition to adulthood. Should the child welfare worker and superv isor disagree with the conclusion of the OSG, the supervisor should request a sta ffing with the OSG to resolve point(s) of disagreement. The assistance of Regiona l Counsel should be sought to clarify technical issues and present additional info rmation which might assist in resolving the situation. 2) Other Required Documentation The child welfare worker must also provi de certain background information to the DCFS Regional Counsel before a petition for adult guardianship can be prepared and filed. At a minimum, the child welfar e worker must submit a thorough social investigation, a current Service Plan (or equi valent treatment plan if the youth resides in a residential facility), and a list of all known relatives of the youth with mailing addresses, if available. The list of relatives is used to satisfy notice requirements of the Probate Act of 1975. The child welfar e worker should also be prepared to provide any additional information wh ich may be requested by the Regional Counsel, such as a psychological evaluati on, education information or vocational information. G. ENSURING CONTINUITY OF FUNDING Unlike child welfare services, adult disability services are not an entitlement. It is not sufficient to identify a vacancy in an adult program which is appropriate to the youth's needs. It is also necessary to ensure that a source of funding the adult services is secured. On a quarterly basis, DCFS provides DHS re ports of youth for whom DCFS is legally responsible who have developmental disabilitie s who are 17 1/2 years old or older. DHS begins planning at that point for these youth who will be aging out of the child welfare system. Youth-specific planning becomes more concrete when the child welfare worker begins working with the ISC on behalf of a particular youth. DHS will notify the ISC when f unding is available for a particular youth, and the ISC will communicate this information to the child welfare worker. In addition to funds which may be available through DHS for services, the child welfare worker shall ensure that an application has been submitted to the local office of DHS for medical assistance to provide for the youth's medical needs. Procedures 302 - Appendix N (10) SERVICES DELIVERED BY THE DEPARTMENT June 15, 1999 - P.T. 99.14 During transition planning and prior to refe rring a situation to the Guardianship and Advocacy Commission, the child welfare work er should contact the DCFS Children's Accounts Unit at 217/785-2671 to determine wh ether the youth is receiving Supplemental Security Income (SSI) benefits. SSI provide s monthly cash assistance for persons who are over 65 or disabled and lack income or res ources. (See Procedures 351, Federal Benefits and Other Federal Funds, Section V for SSI eligibility requirements and benefits.) If the youth is not receiving SSI benefits, th e child welfare worker should contact the Children's SSI Project, which is managed by two DCFS contractors. For youth served by the three Cook Regions, contact Maximu s at 312/782-5300. For youth served by the Downstate Regions, contact the Center for Law and Human Services at 800/841-2812. Staff of Maximus or the Center for Law and Human Services, as appropriate, will review the youth's case record, obtain supporting evidence, prepare the necessary application package and pursue any administrative appeals when the contractor determines that the SSI case has merit. In developing the case for SSI, the contractor will talk with the youth's caregiver and child welfare worker. The child welfare worker may be required to provide the Contractor information regarding youth's level of func tioning, services that are being provided. Additionally, the child welfare worker may need to assist with obtaining a current psychological assessment and assist the current caregiver with arrangements to make sure the youth attends a consultative examination a nd/or administrative hearing scheduled by the Social Security Administration. Expedited Transitions Generally, DHS will attempt to schedule a youth's transition to an adult setting following the completion of the school year in which the yout h turns 21. However, if the child welfare placement of a youth 18 years of age or older is being disrupted and his or her service plan calls for transition to adult services, the child welfare worker shall notify the Regional Clinical Services Manager, and shall seek expedited transition to adult services. If appropriate adult services are available, DCFS will retain payment responsibility until the youth reaches 21 years of age. (In the event that DHS does not receive an appropriation for transition services in the year in which the youth reaches 22, DCFS will assume payment responsibility for that year as well.) Paymen t for adult residential services for youth over age 18 requires the development of new cont ract(s) through the Regional Business Office. DHS will provide a recommended rate to the DCFS Regional Business Office upon request. Payment arrangements for 22 year olds will be handled by the DCFS Central Office of Financial Management. Procedures 302 - Appendix N (11) SERVICES DELIVERED BY THE DEPARTMENT June 15, 1999 - P.T. 99.14 H. TERMINATION OF DCFS GUARDIANSHIP AND CASE CLOSING If a youth requires an adult guardian, a petiti on to terminate DCFS guardianship must be filed in the Juvenile Court having jurisdicti on once adult guardianship has been awarded to either a private individual or the Office of the State Guardian. The basis for termination of (juvenile) guardianship is the appointment of an adult guardian. The child welfare worker must contact the DCFS Regional C ounsel for instructions regarding the court procedures for termination of guardianship. The DCFS case should remain open on CYCIS until the child welfare worker can document that funding responsibility has been transferred to a source other than DCFS and that guardianship has been transferred to a private individual, the OSG or the Office of the Public Guardian as appropriate. Questions regarding these procedures should be dir ected to the Regional Clinical Services Manager.

SERVICES DELIVERED BY THE DEPARTMENT September 14, 2009 -P.T. 2009.16 302.Appendix P Food Allergies and Anaphylaxis This Appendix addresses food allergies in children and the potentially lif e threatening allergic reactions (\"anaphylactic reaction\" or \"anaphylaxis\") that may result from contact with or ingestion of certain foods. However, it is impor tant to note that substa nces other than food can also cause anaphylactic reactions. At the end of this Appendix is a list of websites that address food allergies, anaphylaxis, and other substances that cause potentially lif e threatening allergic reactions. This list is not intended to be exhaustive, but is a good starting place for caseworkers and caregivers to obtain additiona l information about allergies to food and other substances. a) Frequently Asked Questions and Answers 1) Do many children have food allergies? Food allergies affect 8% of children under age three, 6%-8% of school age children and 2.5% of adults. Nationwide, three million children suffer from food allergies. A child with an undiagnosed food allergy ma y experience his/her first food allergy reaction at school. According to published studies, allergy pr evalence has increased significantly in the last five years. Forty to fifty per cent of those persons with a diagnosed food allergy are judged to be at high risk of having an anaphylactic reaction (a life threatening allergic reaction). 2) How do I know if a child has a food allergy? A food allergy happens when the body reac ts against harmless proteins found in foods. The reaction usually happens shortly after a food is ea ten. Food allergy reactions can vary from mild to severe. Because there are many things that can be confused with food allergies, it is important to know the difference. 3) What foods tend to cause food allergies? Food allergies are more common among child ren than adults. Ninety percent of all food allergy reactions are cause by 8 f oods: milk, soy, eggs, wheat, peanuts, tree nuts, fish and shellfish. Severe, life threatening reactions are more common with allergies to peanuts, tree nuts, shellfish, fish and eggs. These life- threatening reactions are more common in people who also have asthma. Procedures 302 - Appendix P (1) SERVICES DELIVERED BY THE DEPARTMENT September 14, 2009 -P.T. 2009.16 4) How serious are food allergies? Allergic reactions to foods vary and can ra nge from mild to severe life threatening \"anaphylactic reactions.\" Some children w ho are very sensitive may react to just touching or inhaling the food or substance. The severity of a reaction is not predictable. A life threatening reaction can occur immediately, within minutes or even hours after exposure to the food or substance. A child may suffer a cumulative effect from past exposures to a particular food or substance, and his/her reaction may wo rsen with each subsequent exposure. 5) Do other allergens (besides f ood) cause anaphylactic reactions? Medications, insect stings , foods and latex most often cause anaphylaxis and anaphylactic reactions. Medications are the leading cause. Anaphylactic deaths from taking medications are well documented. Co mmon culprits are penicillin and other antibiotics, aspirin and aspirin-related products, muscle relaxants, seizure medications and dyes used dur ing certain procedures such as nuclear imaging. People with allergie s or asthma are more likely to have an anaphylactic reaction to shots. Stings from insects such as bees, wasps, yellow jackets, hornets and fire ants can cause anaphylaxis. Bites fro m the \"kissing bug\" and deer fly also cause the reaction. Experts estimate th at at least 40 deaths per year are caused by anaphylaxis to insect stings. Intense exercise , particularly in ho t weather, can bring on anaphylaxis. Sometimes this only occurs with exercise after eating celery, shellfish, wheat, peaches or other specific food s to which the person is allergic. 6) What is an \"anaphylactic reaction\"? An anaphylactic reaction (also called anaphylaxis) is a potentially life threatening medical condition that can occur after exposur e to a particular f ood or substance. The most dangerous symptoms of an anaphylactic reaction include difficulty breathing and a drop in bl ood pressure or shock. Other symptoms can include flushed skin, rash, swelling of tissues such as lips or joints, stuffy nose, sweating, paleness, panting, nausea, abdominal cram ps, rapid pulse, faintness, confusion, wheezing, convulsions and passing out, itching of the mouth and throat, frequent ear infections, hoarseness, cramping of the uterus, and feeling the need to urinate. Procedures 302 - Appendix P (2) SERVICES DELIVERED BY THE DEPARTMENT September 14, 2009 -P.T. 2009.16 An anaphylactic reaction can occur imme diately, within minutes or even hours after exposure to the food or substance. For children with known allergies, the onset of any of the symptoms noted a bove can precede an anaphylactic reaction, and immediate action is required. When these symptoms occur in children who do not have known allergies, the caregiver should be urged to watch the child closely for any further signs of distress. 7) How is an anaphylactic reaction treated? An anaphylactic reaction is usually treated initially with epinephrine, which is a prescription medication. Epinephrine is given to the child by injection using an EpiPen (registered trademark for an autoin jector of epinephrine - a.k.a. adrenaline - used in medicine to treat anaphylactic shock) or similar prescribed device. After injecting epinephrine, the caregiver or responsible a dult should call 911 and the child should be transported by ambulance to the nearest hospita l emergency room even if the symptoms have begun to disappear. Since a child can die if epinephrine is withheld during an an aphylactic reaction, caregivers should be told to always give epinephrine to a child having an anaphylactic reaction and to s eek immediate medical help. If a child with a life threatening allergy doesn't have an EpiPen or Ana-kit, the worker should consult with th e child's physician immediately. 8) How can a child's food or other po tentially life threatening allergies be addressed while at school? At the beginning of each school year (or immediately after the diagnosis of a food or other potentially life threatening aller gy), the caseworker shall ensure that the caregiver meets with the school nurse to discuss the child's allergies. The caseworker shall ensure that the child's primary care phys ician or allergist and the school nurse develop an Indivi dual Health Care Plan th at details the preventative steps the school will take to help protec t a child with potentia lly life threatening allergies, and an Emergency Action Plan that details how the school officials will respond when the child faces a potentially life threatening emergency. The caseworker shall also ensure that a 504 Plan (Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973) is developed, if appropriate, with input from the child's primary care physician or allergist that identifies the child's needs while in the school environment and the actions re quired of school officials to meet those needs. The 504 plan will describe: the child's disabling condition; the major life function affected by th e condition in the school setting; Procedures 302 - Appendix P (3) SERVICES DELIVERED BY THE DEPARTMENT September 14, 2009 -P.T. 2009.16 how the major life activity within the school setting is limited; and the services to be provided by th e school district to meet the needs identified. The 504 Plan should specify that service provided by the school district will include a medication administ ration and monitoring program. The caseworker shall ensure that the 504 Pl an is on file with the child's school. Additional Information on 504 Plans is available at the following website: http://www.foodallergyinitiative.org/ section_home.cfm?section_id=8&sub_se ction_id=3 ) b) Guidelines for Children with Potent ially Life Threatening Food Allergies The long-term goal for children with potentiall y life threatening food allergies is to be independent in the prevention, care, and management of their food a llergies and reactions based on their developmental level. A child should be taught: not to trade or share foods. to wash hands or use hand wipes before and after eating. to recognize symptoms of an allergic r eaction and notify an adult immediately if a reaction is suspected. to promptly tell an adult as soon as accidental exposure occurs or symptoms appear. to develop a relationship with the school nur se and at least one other trusted adult in the school to help in identifying issues related to the management of the allergy in school. not eat anything with unknown ingredients or ingredients known to contain an allergen. to develop a habit of always read ing ingredients before eating food. never board the school bus if experiencing any symptoms of an allergic reaction. Procedures 302 - Appendix P (4) SERVICES DELIVERED BY THE DEPARTMENT September 14, 2009 -P.T. 2009.16 if medically necessary and developmenta lly appropriate, to be responsible for carrying and taking his/her medications appropr iately. If a medical ID bracelet or necklace is provided, the child is respons ible for wearing the ID at all times. c) Guidelines for Caregivers Caseworkers should ensure that caregivers are informed of the child's food allergies. Caregivers must assist in the prevention, care, and management of the child's food allergies and reactions. Additionally, care givers should be encouraged to foster independence on the part of the child, based on her/his developmental level. To achieve this goal, caregivers should be asked to follow these guidelines. Ensure that an Individual Health Care Plan, Emergency Action Plan and a 504 Plan (if appropriate) are on file with th e school, informing school officials of the child's allergies prior to th e opening of school (or immedi ately after a diagnosis). In addition, provide: o medication orders from the physician; o EpiPen (or similar prescribed devi ce) and other necessary medications; o annual updates on the child 's allergy status; o a current picture of the ch ild, for the Individual Heat h Care Plan at school; and o if the child carries medications, period ically check for expiration dates and replace medications as needed. Contact the caseworker for assistance in obtaining a medical ID bracelet or necklace for a child with a potentially life threatening allergy. When required, the child's medical ID bracelet or neckl ace can be purchased using payment Code 1116 (medical supplies and equipment). Vouchers for these payments are processed through the DC FS Regional Office. Introduce the child to the bus driver and head cook to explain the child's allergy. While the school will not exclude an allergic student from a field trip, a caregiver may choose to do so. Be willing to go on the child's field trips if requested. If needed, help decide upon an \"alle rgy-free\" eating area in the cafeteria. Provide safe classroom snacks for the child. Talk with the child about the school lunch menu as often as necessary based on the child's knowledge and maturity. If eating a lunch provided by the school is not appropriate, have the child take a l unch to school. Call the school nurse or head cook to discuss any concerns about ingredients in th e school lunch menu. Procedures 302 - Appendix P (5) SERVICES DELIVERED BY THE DEPARTMENT September 14, 2009 -P.T. 2009.16 It is important that children take increased re sponsibility for their allergies as they grow older and as they become developmentally ready. The caregiver should consider teaching the child to: Understand the seriousness and recognize the first symptoms of an allergic or anaphylactic reaction and no tify an adult immediately. Carry and use an EpiPen (or similar prescr ibed device that cont when this is an age appr opriate task, or know where it is kept. Recognize safe and unsafe foods and do not touch or share snacks, lunches, or drinks. Encourage the habit of reading ingr edient labels before eating food. Understand the importance of hand washing before and after eating. Inform others of his/her allergy and specific needs. d) Additional Information Here are several web sites that offer additi onal information about al lergies to foods and other substances: New Jersey's \"Ask Mayo Clinic: http://www.mayoclinic.com /health/food-allergies/AA00057 National Institutes of Health (NIH), U.S. Department of Health and Human Services: http://health.ni h.gov/result.asp/265/29 Nutrition.gov, National Food Allergy National Institute of Allergy and Infec tious Diseases, National Institutes of Health: http://www3.niaid.nih.gov/topics /foodAllergy/default.htm Procedures 302 - Appendix P (6) SERVICES DELIVERED BY THE DEPARTMENT September 14, 2009 -P.T. 2009.16 Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America: http://www.aafa.org/ o General food and drug allergy information: http://www.aafa.org/display.cfm?id=9&sub=20 o Information on how the Americans with Disabilities Act protects the rights of those with allergies and asthma: http://www.aafa.org/display.cfm?id=9&sub=20&cont=280 New Jersey Department of Agriculture Links to Food and Nutrition Websites: http://www.state.nj.us/seafood/consumerlinks.htm American Academy of Pediatrics, Child ren's Health Topics - Asthma and Allergies: http://www.aap.org/healthtopics/asthma.cfm Recommended Guidelines for Medication Administration in Schools , Illinois Department of Human Services and Illin ois State Board of Education (2000): http://www.isbe.state.il.us/spec-ed/pdfs/medication_administration.pdf Food Allergy Initiative.

Asthma is a chronic disorder of the airw ays that involves a complex interaction of airflow obstruction, bronchial hype r-responsiveness and an underlying inflammation. Asthma can be a life threat ening condition. The cause of asthma is unknown. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, more than 22 million people in the United States have asthma, including 6.5 million children under age 18. Asthma is the most common chronic illness in ch ildren and is the leading cause of school absenteeism due to chronic disease. Allergy induced asthma is the most common type of asthma in the United States. Sixty to seventy-five percent of the people who have asthma have associated allergies. Asthma cannot be cured, but it can be controlled with proper environmental and medical management. For children with asthma, it is essential to provide the proper management of asthma that incl udes four main components: assessment and monitoring of asthma, patient educat ion, control of factors contributing to asthma severity, and treatment with medications. 2) How severe is asthma? Asthma severity in children is classifi ed based upon the most severe category in which any feature occurs. The classifications of asthma severity are: intermittent, mild persistent, moderate pers istent and severe persistent. Intermittent: Asthma is considered intermittent when daytime asthma symptoms occur less than or equal to twice per week, nighttime symptoms occur less than twice per month, and the child has fewer than two episodes per year. Peak flow measurements remain between 80-100% of predicted normal values. Mild persistent : Asthma is considered mild persistent when daytime symptoms occur more than twice per week but less than daily and nighttime symptoms occur more than two times per month. Peak flow measurements remain between 80-100% of predicted normal values. Moderate persistent : Asthma is considered moderate persistent when daytime symptoms occur daily and ni ghttime symptoms occur more than one time a week. Peak flow measur ement falls between 60 - 80 % of the predicted normal values. Procedures 302 - Appendix Q (1) SERVICES DELIVERED BY THE DEPARTMENT September 14, 2009 - P.T. 2009.16 Severe persistent : Asthma is classified as severe persistent when daytime symptoms occur continually and nighttime symptoms occur frequently. Peak flow measurements fall below 60% of the predicted normal values. Note: Peak flow is measured by a peak fl ow meter, which is a portable hand held device used to measure how air flows from the lungs. The peak flow meter helps a child with asthma see how well his/he r lungs are working by measuring child's ability to push air out of the lungs at any given time. Changes in normal peak flow values can provide early warning of an asthma attack. 3) What triggers an asthma attack? Asthma can be triggered by inhaled allerg ens, such as dust, dust mites, mold, pollen, various grasses, animal dander, sa liva from any pets , paint, perfume, strong odors, fumes, cockroaches and their droppings, wood smoke, cigarette smoke, cold air, abrupt ch anges in the weather, str ong emotions, exercise, and having the common cold, influenza, ot her respiratory illnesses, etc. 4) How is asthma managed? The symptoms of asthma can be manage d with appropriate medical treatments, environmental adjustments and life-style changes. Asthma Action Plan. An Asthma Action Plan helps the child with asthma and the family understand how best to keep as thma under control, what the health care provider says to do if the asthma becomes out of control and when to seek help. Medications. Medications for asthma are cate gorized into two general classes: long-term control medications and quick-r elief medications. Long-term control medications are used daily to achieve and maintain control of persistent asthma. The most effective long-term medications are those that ad dress the underlying inflammation characteristic of asthma. Quick-relief medications are used to treat acute symptoms and exacerbations. The type, amount and scheduling of medications is determined by the level of asthma severity or asthma control. Medical equipment. Medical equipment for a child with asthma may include items such as an inhaler, spacer, nebu lizer, humidifier, pe ak flow meter or oxygen. An inhaler holds medicine that is breathed into the lungs. A spacer is placed on the end of the inhaler and helps more of the medication reach the lungs. A nebulizer also helps the medication reach the lungs. Environmental adjustments. The child's caregiver is required to eliminate allergens, pollutants or irritants from the home environment that may cause an asthma attack and compromise the child's life and well-being. Examples include: tobacco or wood smoke in or outside of the home, pet dander, cleaning products, dust, perfumes or strong odors. Procedures 302 - Appendix Q (2) SERVICES DELIVERED BY THE DEPARTMENT September 14, 2009 - P.T. 2009.16 Life-style changes. Managing a child's asthma may require changes in the child or caregiver's day to day activities, in cluding changes in such things as food preparation procedures and eating habits, and stress redu ction. The ca regiver and child should work with the child's health care provider to identify known or suspected allergens, irritants, pollutants, triggers and stimuli, and reduce or eliminate the child's exposure to these items. 5) How is asthma addressed while the child is at school? Children with asthma are permitted to carry asthma medication with them and use this medication at school, at school-sponsored activities, while away from school under the supervision of school personnel, and at before- or af ter-school activities on school property. To meet the requirements of the School Code for the self-administration of medication, the caseworker must: provide written authorization for th e child's self-administration of medication; and provide a written statement from the child's health care provider containing the name and purpose of th e medication, the prescribed dosage, and the times that, or the special circumstances under which, the medication is to be administered. The caseworker shall ensure that the chil d's health care pr ovider and the school nurse develop an Individual Health Care Plan that details the preventative steps the school will take to help protect a ch ild with asthma, and an Emergency Action Plan that details how the school offici als will respond when the child faces a potentially life threatening emergency. The caseworker shall also ensure that a 504 Plan (Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973) is developed, if appropria te, with input from the child's health care provider that identif ies the child's needs while in the school environment and the actions re quired of school officials to meet those needs. The caseworker shall ensure that the 504 Plan is on file with the child's school. The 504 plan will describe: the child's disabling condition; the major life function affected by th e condition in the school setting; how the major life activity within the school setting is limited; and Procedures 302 - Appendix Q (3) SERVICES DELIVERED BY THE DEPARTMENT September 14, 2009 - P.T. 2009.16 the services to be provided by th e school district to meet the needs identified. A 504 Plan may, for exampl e, require the school to provide alternate activities wh en a child has asthma symptoms and cannot participate in gym, or require the sc hool to eliminate triggers from the school environment such as animals with fur or strong odors. The 504 Plan should specify that service provided by the school district will include a medication administration and monitoring program (when appropriate). Additional Information on 504 Plans is available at the following website: http://www.foodallergyinitiative.org/section_home.cfm?section_id=8&sub_sectio n_id=3 ) If the child's asthma contributes to lear ning difficulties, then an Individualized Education Plan/Program (IEP) may also be required. b) Guidelines for workers 1) Initial Health Screening When a child is known to have asthma, th e investigation speci alist shall inform IHS staff of that fact and review the IHS Encounter form before leaving the site to ensure that the examining physician documented an asthma diagnosis, asthma severity classification and medications. The investiga tion specialist shall obtain a temporary Asthma Action Plan at the IHS and ensure that the physician prescribes a rescue medication in case the child's asthma flares up. The investigation specialist shall prepare and fax a CFS 691, Identification of a Child Diagnosed with Asthma to the Division of Serv ice Intervention - Health Services as directed on the form, a nd place a copy in the child's record. 2) Referral to Regional Nurse Any child brought into the system with known moderate persistent to severe persistent asthma, uncontrolled asthma or with severe exacerbations shall be referred to the DCFS Regional Nurse. Incl uded with the referral should be as much history and medical docum entation as can be obtained. Any child newly diagnosed with moderate persistent to severe persistent asthma, uncontrolled asthma or with severe exacerbations shall be referred to the DCFS Regional Nurse for assessmen t recommendations, and potential follow-up with a health care provider or specialist regarding the caregiver's knowledge and comfort in ha ndling the child's asthma. Procedures 302 - Appendix Q (4) SERVICES DELIVERED BY THE DEPARTMENT September 14, 2009 - P.T. 2009.16 Any child currently diagnosed with moderate persistent to severe persistent asthma, uncontrolled asthma or with severe exacerbations who is to be moved to a new foster or relative care setti ng shall be referred to the DCFS Regional Nurse to assess the home environment a nd caregiver's knowledge, and assist the new caregiver as necessary regarding the medical needs of the child. As a general rule, a ny child who suffers two emergency room visits or one hospital admission during a year due to the child's asthma problems will require a referral of the case to the DCFS Regional Nurse. As a part of the referral, the caseworker shall provide copi es of the child's Asthma Action Plan, Unusual Incident Reports re lated to asthma exacerbations, HealthWorks medical records and/or other health documentation and the updated Health Passport information. Any concerns about the control management of asthma for any child, despite the severity of the condition, shall be referred to a DCFS Regional Nurse. The following are examples of asthma that is poorly controlled that require a DCFS nursing consultation and/or referral. two emergency room visits for asthma in a year's time; one hospitalization for asthma in a year's time; intubation (insertion of a breathing tube) for asthma; prior asthma admission to a hospital Intensive Care Unit; frequent and consistent absences fr om school due to asthma attacks; hospitalization or emergency room visit for asthma within the past month; any severity of asthma and a cardiopulmonary medical condition; a health care provider's statement that the child's asthma is not controlled; or frequent use of rescue albuterol inhaler. Note: DCFS Regional Nurse Referral instruc tions are set out in Procedures 302- Appendix O. 3) Placement requirements for children with asthma When selecting placement for a child with asthma, the caseworker shall rely on the environmental and treatment recomme ndations of the child's physician for eliminating allergens, pollutants, or irri tants (such as smoke, animals, or others) Procedures 302 - Appendix Q (5) SERVICES DELIVERED BY THE DEPARTMENT September 14, 2009 - P.T. 2009.16 from the child's environment that the chil d may react to and that may compromise the child's life and well-being. These recommendations shall be documented in the SACWIS health information section and the child's case record and followed with the urgency indicated by the child's physician. The child shall not be placed with, or be allowed to remain in a placement with, a caregiver who is unable or unwilling to adhere to the Asthma Action Plan and the health care provider's environmental or treatment recommendations. If a caregiver is unable or unwilling to follow these recommendations, the investigator or caseworker must immediately seek another placement. When time is not of the essence, the caregiver should be given an opportunity to make necessary changes or obtain training that would allow for the child's health needs to be met. If a child must be moved to a different placement, the caseworker must ensure that medications, medical equipment, the Asthma Action Plan, and other environmental aids for the child's asthma are moved with the child. The caseworker shall also provide the new caregiv er with the child's list of known or suspected allergens, irritants, pol lutants, triggers, and stimuli. 4) Follow-up worker's responsibilities A) If the child is dia gnosed with asthma at th e IHS, the investigation specialist or caseworker (if no protectiv e custody was taken) shall ensure that the Division of Service Intervention-Health Services is notified by faxing a CFS 691, Identification of a Child Diagnosed with Asthma . The investigation specialis t shall also document th e diagnosis in SACWIS. B) If a child currently diagnosed with asthma does not have an Asthma Action Plan, the caseworker shall ensure that the caregiver takes the child to a health care provider to have an Asthma Action Plan developed. The caseworker will share with the caregi ver the list of known or suspected allergens, pollutants, irritants, triggers, and stimuli. The caseworker shall ensure that the he alth care provider has prescribed appropriate maintenance medication and a rescue medication, and that the rescue medication is available in case the child's asthma flares up. The caseworker shall place a copy of the Asthma Action Plan in the child's case record, and ensure that the caregiver distributes the Asthma Action Plan to the child's school, day care or preschool. If the child is school age and is involved in extracurri cular activities, th e caregiver shall ensure that the Asthma Action Plan is given to the adult supervising that activity. Procedures 302 - Appendix Q (6) SERVICES DELIVERED BY THE DEPARTMENT September 14, 2009 - P.T. 2009.16 C) The caseworker shall regularly rein force the necessity of the caregiver taking the Asthma Action Plan to every health care provider visit so it can be reviewed and revised as needed and also informing the health care provider of all medicines taken by the child (prescribed and over the counter), all diagnoses, and all equipment used. D) The caseworker shall ensure that the caregiver has been advised by the health care provider of the impairment , risk, and category of severity of the child's asthma (intermittent, mild persistent, moderate persistent or severe persistent). The health ca re provider should be consulted about whether the child may receive or benefit from the annual flu vaccination. E) The caseworker shall also ensure that that the caregiver has been advised on recognizing the early si gns, symptoms, and peak flow expiratory flow measures, if a peak flow meter ha s been prescribed, that indicate worsening asthma. F) The caseworker shall ensure that th e caregiver requests a peak flow meter from the health care provi der, especially if the child has moderate or severe persistent asthma or has a hist ory of severe exacerbations, or takes daily asthma medication. If the hea lth care provider has prescribed a peak flow meter, the caseworke r shall reinforce the need for the caregiver to review the readings with the health care provider. G) In addition to seeing their health care provider, children who have had difficulties with maintaining control of asthma, or recurrent exacerbations and children with moderate persistent and severe persistent asthma should be referred to a specialist, such as an allergist, immunologist or pulmonologist for evaluation and/or co-management of the disease. H) The caseworker shall ensure that the caregiver takes measures that reduce or eliminate the child's e xposure to allergens. For example, the caregiver may need to encase the child's mattre ss and/or pillow with an allergy barrier cover, or many need to reduce or eliminate the child's exposure to tobacco or wood smoke in or outside of the home or to irritants like perfume, cleaning products, dust, or vapors. I) The caseworker shall ensu re that placement and service guidelines related to management of the child's asthma are placed in child section of SACWIS Service Plan. 5) Reunification Before finalizing reunification of children with asthma with their parents, the caseworker must document that the parent s have demonstrated to the child's health care provider a level of proficiency in their knowledge about their child's Procedures 302 - Appendix Q (7) SERVICES DELIVERED BY THE DEPARTMENT September 14, 2009 - P.T. 2009.16 asthma and asthma care. All of the ch ild's medications, medical equipment, the Asthma Action Plan, other environmental ai ds for the child's asthma, and copies of the child's health information sh all go with the child upon reunification. c) Role of the DCFS Regional Nurse Upon receiving a referral, the DCFS Regiona l Nurse shall contact the caregiver, caseworker and/or health care provider to de termine what actions are needed. When a child with severe persistent asthma is referred, the DCFS Regional Nurse shall schedule a site visit. The child's caseworker sha ll accompany the Regional Nurse during the site visit. The DCFS Regional Nurse shall assess and re inforce knowledge the child and caregiver have received from the health care provide r, treating physician and/or hospital discharge instructions regarding: medications (proper dosage , times, side effects); proper use of an inhaler, spacer, and nebuliz er. If these items were not prescribed, the DCFS Regional Nurse shall contact th e physician or spec ialist to obtain a prescription for the needed e quipment (if appropriate); and use and care of the peak flow meter. The Regional Nurse shall encourage the caregiver to request the doctor to prescrib e a peak flow meter for each child with moderate persistent or se vere persistent asthma. If the DCFS Regional Nurse determines that the caregiver needs additional training to care for the child, the Regional Nurse shall recommend that the caregiver contact the child's health care provider to a rrange for the needed training. The DCFS Regional Nurse shall assess the environment to identify environmental triggers that could precipitate an attack (e.g., pollutants, allergens, insects, etc.) and make recommendations as needed based on the assessment. The Regional Nurse shall ensure that all chil dren with moderate pe rsistent or severe persistent asthma are referred to an allergist, immunologist or pulmonologist. d) Guidelines for children 1) A child with asthma shall follow the recommendations of his/her health care provider. This may include follow ing the Asthma Action Plan, using a preventative inhaler on a daily basis, using nasal medication, receiving ongoing allergy shots, etc. Procedures 302 - Appendix Q (8) SERVICES DELIVERED BY THE DEPARTMENT September 14, 2009 - P.T. 2009.16 2) A child with asthma should learn to id entify the early signs and symptoms that indicated that his/her asthma is becoming worse, and be able to identify the steps that he/she should take when these signs and symptoms occur. The child should keep his/her rescue inhaler handy and acce ssible at all times, and know what to do if his/her asthma reaches a crisis level (e.g., call 911). 3) The child should be able to identify the lis t of known or susp ected allergens, irritants, pollutants, and stimuli that tri ggers his/her asthma a nd avoid exposure to these items. e) Guidelines for caregivers 1) If a child is suspected of having as thma because of breathing problems, the caregiver should contact the ch ild's health care provider as soon as possible for an appointment, or, in the event of an emer gency, take the child to the emergency room for immediate medical care. 2) The caregiver shall obtain information from the health care provider about the impairment, risk, and category of severity of the child's asthma (intermittent, mild persistent, moderate persistent or severe persistent). The health care provider should be consulted about whether the ch ild may receive or benefit from the annual flu vaccination. 3) If a child currently diagnosed with as thma does not have an Asthma Action Plan, the caregiver shall ask the child's he alth care provider to develop one. 4) The caregiver shall provide a copy of th e Asthma Action Plan to the child's day care provider, preschool or school nurse. Each time the Asthma Action Plan is revised, the caregiver shall give a copy of the revised plan to the day care provider, preschool or sc hool nurse. The caregiver shall give the day care provider, preschool or school nurse a sufficient supply of the child's prescribed rescue medication, and shall refill the medication when requested. 5) The caregiver shall be able to recogni ze the early signs, symptoms, and peak flow expiratory flow measures (if a peak flow meter has been prescribed) that indicate worsening asthma. The caregiver shall ensure that the child's maintenance medication is up-to-date and being taken as prescribed, and that the child's rescue medication is always immediately accessibl e in case the child's asthma flares up. 6) The caregiver shall request a peak flow meter from the health care provider, especially if the child has moderate or seve re persistent asthma or has a history of severe exacerbations, or takes mainte nance medication. If the health care provider has prescribed a peak flow meter, the caregiver shall review the readings with the health care provider at each visit. Procedures 302 - Appendix Q (9) SERVICES DELIVERED BY THE DEPARTMENT September 14, 2009 - P.T. 2009.16 7) The caregiver shall remove potential allerg ens, pollutants, irri tants, triggers, and stimuli from the home, and shall take measures that reduce or eliminate the child's exposure to them. For example, the caregiver may need to encase the child's mattress and/or pillow with an allergy barrier cover, or many need to reduce or eliminate the child's exposure to tobacco or wood smoke in or outside of the home or to irritants like perfum e, cleaning products, dust, or vapors. 8) The caregiver shall take the Asthma Ac tion Plan to every health care provider visit so it can be reviewed and revised as needed, and shall also inform the health care provider of all medicines taken by the child (prescribed and over the counter), all diagnoses, and all equipment used. 9) The caregiver shall cooperate with requests made by the DCFS Regional Nurse with regard to the child. If the DC FS Regional Nurse determines that the caregiver needs additional training to care for the child, the caregiver shall contact the child's primary care or treating phys ician for assistance in obtaining the needed training. 10) The caregiver shall comply with the Asthma Action Plan and the health care provider's recommendations. If a caregiver is unable or unwilling to adhere to a health care provider's environmenta l or treatment recommendations or Asthma Action Plan, the investigat ion specialist or caseworker must immediately seek another placement. When time is not of the essence, the caregiver should be given an opportunity to make necessary changes or obtain training that would allow for the ch ild's health needs to be met. 11) The caregiver shall complete all caregiver activities identified in the child's service plan. f) Additional information American Academy of Pediatrics, Child ren's Health Topics - Asthma and Allergies: http://www.aap.org/healthtopics/asthma.cfm Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America: http://www.aafa.org/ o General food and drug allergy information: http://www.aafa.org/display.cfm?id=9&sub=20 o Information on how the Americans with Disabilities Act protects the rights of those with allergies and asthma: http://www.aafa.org/display.cfm?id=9&sub=20&cont=280 National Institutes of Health (NIH), U.S. Department of Health and Human Services: http://health.ni h.gov/result.asp/265/29 and http://kids.niehs.nih.gov/asthma.htm Procedures 302 - Appendix Q (10) SERVICES DELIVERED BY THE DEPARTMENT September 14, 2009 - P.T. 2009.16 Mayo Clinic: http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/asthma/AS99999 http://www.asthmaactionamerica.org/me dia/asthma_control_made_simple.pdf The Lung and Blood Institute: http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/dci/Dis eases/Asthma/Asthma_WhatIs.html U.S. National Library of Medicine: http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/asthma.html Centers for Disease Control and Prevention: http://www.cdc.gov/asthma/ Procedures 302 - Appendix Q (11) SERVICES DELIVERED BY THE DEPARTMENT September 14, 2009 - P.T. 2009.16 This page intentionally left blank.
