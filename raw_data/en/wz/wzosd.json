Hum Vaccin Immunother ; : 2100173, 2022 safe [vaccination]programs and to detect rare AEFI not observed in clinical trials. The increasing availability of [electronic] [health]-care related data and correspondence from both [health]-related providers and [internet]-based media has revolutionized [health]-care information. Many and varied forms of [health]information related to [adverse event]following [immunization](AEFI) are potentially suitable for [vaccine] [safety] [surveillance]. The utilization of these media ranges from more efficient use of [electronic]spontaneous [reporting], automated solicited [surveillance] [methods], [screening]various utilization language processing] [techniques]to scan enormous amounts of [internet]-based data for AEFI mentions. Each of these [surveillance]types have advantages and disadvantages and are often complementary to each other. Most are \"hypothesis generating,\" detecting potential [safety]signals, where some, such as [vaccine] [safety]datalinking, may also serve as \"hypothesis testing\" to help verify and investigate those potential signals.
