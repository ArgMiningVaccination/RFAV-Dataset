DOTA and fluorophore conjugates for PET and fluorescence imaging. SG and BG aided with radiochemistry and labeled sample preparation and analysis. SCK led PET and MRI measurements and tissue analysis, WZ and CGF assisted with PET/MRI and tissue analysis. DGC and GS at Emory University. JTM, BLH, MBM, BJC, JA, and TT carried imaging.
