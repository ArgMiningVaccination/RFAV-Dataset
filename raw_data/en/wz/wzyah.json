Using cross-sectional data from the 2016 through 2018 National Health Interview Survey (n = 26,926), we explored associations between spinal pain and chronic health conditions and investigated the influence that a set of confounders may have on the associations between spinal pain and chronic health conditions. Variance estimation method was used to compute weighted descriptive statistics and measures of associations with multinomial logistic regression models. All four chronic health conditions significantly increased the prevalence odds of spinal pain; cardiovascular conditions by 58%, hypertension by 40%, diabetes by 25% and obesity by 34%, controlling for all the confounders. For all chronic health conditions, tobacco use (45-50%), being insufficiently active (17-20%), sleep problems (180-184%), cognitive impairment (90-100%), and mental health conditions (68-80%) significantly increased the prevalence odds of spinal pain compared to cases without spinal pain. These findings provide evidence to support research on the prevention and treatment of non-musculoskeletal conditions with approaches of spinal pain management.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2023-04-03", "cleaned_text": "Spinal Pain, Chronic Health Conditions and Health Behaviors: Data from the 2016-2018 National Health Interview Survey [https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph20075369](https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph20075369) [Demographic, Clinical and Psychological Factors Influencing Musculoskeletal Disorders](https://www.mdpi.com/journal/ijerph/special_issues/factors_musculoskeletal)) Abstract 1. Introduction [1](https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/20/7/5369#B1-ijerph-20-05369)]. In the 2021 Global Burden of Disease study, low back pain continues to be the greatest cause of disability burden worldwide, with 12.5% and 11.5% of years lived with disability due to low back pain attributed to modifiable risk factors smoking and elevated body mass index, respectively [ [2](https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/20/7/5369#B2-ijerph-20-05369)]. In adults aged 50 years and over, low back pain, ischemic heart disease and diabetes were all ranked in the top ten causes of disability adjusted life years globally [ [3](https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/20/7/5369#B3-ijerph-20-05369)], with ischemic heart disease and diabetes both in the top ten causes of death globally (1st and 10th, respectively). The costs of treating these diseases are very high. Spending during the year 2020 in the US was estimated at USD 134.5 billion for low back and neck pain, USD 111.2 billion for diabetes and USD 89.3 billion for ischemic heart disease. [4](https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/20/7/5369#B4-ijerph-20-05369), and obesity [ [11](https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/20/7/5369#B11-ijerph-20-05369)]. A population-based study conducted in the United States reported that adult Americans with spinal pain had an increased prevalence for comorbid conditions compared with those who had low back pain only or neck pain only [ [12](https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/20/7/5369#B12-ijerph-20-05369)]. In Australia, a number of chronic conditions (including cardiovascular conditions, diabetes and obesity) have been shown to be associated with spinal pain in older women with arthritis, with an incremental increase in the risk of spinal pain associated with increasing comorbidity count [ [13](https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/20/7/5369#B13-ijerph-20-05369)]. A scoping review conducted by the Global Spine Care Initiative reported a range of health conditions such as cardiovascular disease, hypertension, diabetes and obesity associated with major categories of spinal conditions [ [14](https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/20/7/5369#B14-ijerph-20-05369)]. [12](https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/20/7/5369#B12-ijerph-20-05369)]. These findings were supported by data from the 2009-2012 NHIS, demonstrating significant associations between self-reported lower back pain and including leisure-time physical inactivity, current or former smoking, current or former alcohol drinking, and short sleep duration [ [15](https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/20/7/5369#B15-ijerph-20-05369)]. A biological gradient associated with exposure to smoking cigarettes and back pain was demonstrated with data from the 2012 NHIS, showing that the number of cigarettes smoked per day for current smokers was higher for those with back pain [ [16](https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/20/7/5369#B16-ijerph-20-05369)]. 2.

Statistical Analysis [17](https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/20/7/5369#B17-ijerph-20-05369)], to compute weighted descriptive statistics and measures of associations. We divided the weight by three for the three combined years of data, 2016-2018. Descriptive analysis reports the characteristics of the study population, the prevalence of chronic health conditions, health behaviors, functional disability, cognitive impairment and mental health conditions by spinal pain status. 3. Results [Supplementary Material, Table S1](https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/20/7/5369#app1-ijerph-20-05369)for data flow chart). [Table 1](https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/20/7/5369#table_body_display_ijerph-20-05369-t001)shows the prevalence of neck pain only, low back pain only, and spinal pain by age, sex, race/ethnicity, education, and earnings. These conditions were most common in the older age groups, with low back pain being the most prevalent condition at all ages. Spinal pain was more common in females and non-Hispanic Whites. The prevalence of neck pain only was highest in those with a Bachelor's degree of education and above, while low back pain and spinal pain was more common in those with less than a college education. A similar pattern emerged with earnings, where the prevalence of neck pain only was highest among those with higher earnings, while those with lower earnings had a higher prevalence of low back pain only or spinal pain. [Figure 1](https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/20/7/5369#fig_body_display_ijerph-20-05369-f001)shows the prevalence of cardiovascular conditions, hypertension, diabetes, and obesity in the general population, by neck pain only, by low back pain only, and by spinal pain. All conditions were more prevalent in those reporting neck and low back pain (alone or together) than in the general population, with the exception of a slightly lower prevalence of obesity in those with neck pain only (26.9% vs. 30.5% in the general population). [Supplementary Material, Table S2](https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/20/7/5369#app1-ijerph-20-05369)shows the prevalence of smoking, leisure-time physical activity, sleep problems, functional disability, cognitive impairment and mental health conditions in the general population, no spinal pain, neck pain only, low back pain only, and spinal pain. The prevalence of smoking, physical inactivity, and sleep problems was highest among those with spinal pain (24.5%, 35.9%, and 5.6%, respectively). The prevalence of functional disability, cognitive impairment and mental health conditions was highest among those with spinal pain (50.3%, 7.1% and 28.4%, respectively). [Table 2](https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/20/7/5369#table_body_display_ijerph-20-05369-t002)shows Model 3 for the associations between cardiovascular conditions and spinal pain variables. Cardiovascular conditions increased the prevalence odds of spinal pain by 58%, of low back pain only by 15% and of neck pain only by 27% compared to cases without spinal pain and after adjusting for all confounders. For spinal pain, the health behaviors of tobacco use (46%), being insufficiently active (19%) and sleep problems (180%) significantly increased the prevalence odds compared with cases without spinal pain. For spinal pain, functional disability (324%), cognitive impairment (90%), anxiety (76%) and depression (70%) significantly increased the prevalence odds compared with cases without spinal pain. [Table 3](https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/20/7/5369#table_body_display_ijerph-20-05369-t003)shows Model 3 for the associations between hypertension and spinal pain variables. Hypertension increased the prevalence odds of spinal pain by 40%, of low back pain only by 31% and of neck pain only by 23% compared to cases without spinal pain and after adjusting for all confounders. For spinal pain, the health behaviors of tobacco use (46%), being insufficiently active (17%) and sleep problems (181%) significantly increased the prevalence odds of spinal pain compared to cases without spinal pain. For spinal pain, functional disability (323%), cognitive impairment (94%), anxiety (768) and depression (71%) significantly increased the prevalence odds of spinal pain compared to cases without spinal pain. [Table 4](https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/20/7/5369#table_body_display_ijerph-20-05369-t004)shows Model 3 for the associations between diabetes and spinal pain variables. Diabetes increased the prevalence odds of spinal pain by 25%, of low back pain only by 20% and of neck pain only by 12% compared to cases without spinal pain and after adjusting for all confounders. For spinal pain, the health behaviors of tobacco use (45%), being insufficiently active (20%) and sleep problems (183%) significantly increased the prevalence odds of spinal pain compared to cases without spinal pain. For spinal pain, functional disability (329%), cognitive impairment (100%), anxiety (77%) and depression (72%) significantly increased the prevalence odds of spinal pain compared with cases without spinal pain. [Table 5](https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/20/7/5369#table_body_display_ijerph-20-05369-t005)shows Model 3 for the associations between obesity and spinal pain variables. Obesity had increased the prevalence odds of low back pain only by 34% and spinal pain by 17% compared to cases without low back pain only and without spinal pain and after adjusting for all confounders. For spinal pain, the health behaviors of tobacco use (50%), being insufficiently active (19%) and sleep problems (184%) significantly increased the prevalence odds of spinal pain compared to cases without spinal pain. For spinal pain, functional disability (331%), cognitive impairment (99%), anxiety (80%) and depression (68%) significantly increased the prevalence odds of spinal pain compared with cases without spinal pain. [Supplementary Material, Tables S3-S6](https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/20/7/5369#app1-ijerph-20-05369), shows the three models for the associations between each chronic health condition and spinal pain variables. 4. Discussion [12](https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/20/7/5369#B12-ijerph-20-05369), [15](https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/20/7/5369#B15-ijerph-20-05369)], and reveals a multitude of physical and psychosocial comorbidities that are associated with spinal pain. Sadly, however, after 20 years of research, studies are still needed to address modifiable health behaviors and psychological risk factors shown here in people with low back, neck and spinal pain. [18](https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/20/7/5369#B18-ijerph-20-05369)]. In this study, we found health behaviors such as tobacco use, being physically inactive or insufficiently active, and sleep problems significantly increased the prevalence odds of spinal pain. Sleep problems had the highest increases in prevalence odds ratios for spinal pain by 180-184%. In a recent systematic review of the association between sleep and chronic spinal pain, sleep was a strong predictor for the development of chronic spinal pain potentially due to poor sleep exacerbating responses to nociceptive stimuli and thus increasing existing pain hypersensitivity with variations in pain sensitivity occurring throughout the day [ [19](https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/20/7/5369#B19-ijerph-20-05369)]. Further, tobacco use also increased the prevalence odds for spinal pain by 45-50% and being insufficiently active increased the prevalence odds for spinal pain by 17-20%, when compared with patients without spinal pain. [20](https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/20/7/5369#B20-ijerph-20-05369)]. In particular, depression and insomnia were identified as comorbid conditions that may accelerate cognitive decline in people with low back pain [ [20](https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/20/7/5369#B20-ijerph-20-05369)], both of which increased the prevalence odds for spinal pain, in all chronic health conditions in this study. [12](https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/20/7/5369#B12-ijerph-20-05369)], while in this study, we estimated the 3-month prevalence of spinal pain at 12.3%. The most recent Global Burden of Disease study estimates reveal a significant increase in the number of prevalent cases of low back pain globally since 1990 (60.4%), with projections suggesting that in 2050, there will be 843 million prevalent cases of low back pain globally [ [2](https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/20/7/5369#B2-ijerph-20-05369)]. The 2018 Lancet low back pain series highlighted the roles of advice and education that support self-management, physical, and psychological interventions, especially as first-line treatments for low back pain [ [21](https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/20/7/5369#B21-ijerph-20-05369), [22](https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/20/7/5369#B22-ijerph-20-05369), [23](https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/20/7/5369#B23-ijerph-20-05369)]. Also, a multidisciplinary approach to the assessment and treatment of spinal pain based on the associations found with comorbidities, lifestyle and behavioral factors has been suggested. Ramond-Roquin et al. [ [24](https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/20/7/5369#B24-ijerph-20-05369)] recently suggested taking into account comorbidity in patients with chronic low back pain and adopting a more comprehensive, patient-centered and coordinated approach. Such an approach may include screening for serious diseases, identifying barriers to improvement, managing motivations and expectations, embracing interprofessional collaboration and providing longitudinal continuity of care [ [24](https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/20/7/5369#B24-ijerph-20-05369)]. [25](https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/20/7/5369#B25-ijerph-20-05369)] because all of the confounders are highly prevalent. Co-occurrence does not imply an underlying relationship, whether it be causal, complicating, or reciprocal [ [26](https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/20/7/5369#B26-ijerph-20-05369)]. Other health-related variables (such as psychosocial risk factors, diet, and workplace related risk factors) may influence these associations and therefore the results. Future longitudinal studies investigating alternative hypotheses represent fertile and important grounds to better understand the associations between spinal pain, comorbid conditions, health behaviors, functional disability, and mental health concerns. 5.
