Geriatrics No dose adjustment is recommended for patients who are aged 65 years of age or over. There are limited clinical data wit h JEMPERLI in patients aged 75 years or over. Pediatrics Health Canada has not authorized an indication for pediatric use. Hepatic Insufficiency No dose adjustment is recommended for patients with mild hepatic impairment. Data are not sufficient for drawing any conclusion on patients with moderate hepatic impairment and there are no data in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see 10.3 Pharmacokinetics ). Renal Insufficiency No dose adjustment is recommended for patients with mild or moderate renal impairment. Data are not sufficient for drawing any conclusion on patients with severe renal impairme nt or end stage renal disease undergoing dialysis (see 10.3 Pharmacokinetics ). 4.3 Reconstitution JEMPERLI should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discolouration prior to administration. JEMPERLI is a slightly opalescent colourless to yellow solution. Discard the vial if visible particles are observed. For the 500 -mg dose, withdraw 10 mL of JEMPERLI from a vial and transfer into an intravenous (IV) bag containing sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection, or glucose 50 mg/mL (5%) solution for injection . The final concentration of the diluted solution should be between 2 mg/mL and 10 mg/mL. For the 1,000 -mg dose, withdraw 10 mL of JEMPERLI from each of two vials (withdraw 20 mL total) and transfer into an IV bag containing sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection or glucose 50 mg/mL (5%) solution for injection . The final concentration of the diluted solution should be between 2 mg/mL to 10 mg/mL. Mix diluted solution by gentle inversion. Do not shake the final infusion bag. Discard any unuse d portion left in the vial (see 11 STORAGE, STABILITY AND DISPOSAL ). 4.4 Administration JEMPERLI is for intravenous infusion only. JEMPERLI should be administered by intravenous infusion using an intravenous infusion pump over 30 minutes. Tubing should be made from polyvinyl chloride (PVC), platinum cured silicon or JEMPERLI (dostarlimab for injection ) January 31, 2023 Page 9 of 34 polypropylene (PP); fittings made from PVC or polycarbonate and needles made from stainless steel. A 0.2 or 0. 22 micron in -line poly ethersulfone (PES) filter must be used during administration of JEMPERLI. JEMPERLI must not be administered as an intravenous push or bolus injection. Do not co -administer other drugs through the same infusion line. For instructions on dilution of the medicinal product before administration, see 4.3 Reconstitution . 4.5 Missed Dose It is very important to not miss a dose of this medicine. If a planned dose of JEMPERLI is missed, it should be administered as soon as possible. The schedule of administration should be adjusted to maintain the prescribed dosing interval. 5 OVERDOSAGE There is no in formation on overdosage with JEMPERLI. The maximum tolerated dose of JEMPERLI has not been determined. If overdose is suspected, the patient should be closely monitored for any signs or symptoms of adverse reactions or effects, and appropriate standard of care measures should be instituted immediately. For management of a suspected drug overdose, contact your regional poison control centre. 6 DOSAGE FORMS, STRENGTHS, COMPOSITION AND PACKAGING To help ensure the traceability of biologic products, including biosimilars, health professionals should recognise the importance of recording both the brand name and the non -proprietary (active ingredient) name as well as other pr oduct -specific identifiers such as the Drug Identification Number (DIN) and the batch/lot number of the product supplied. Table 3 Dosage Forms, Stren gths, Composition and Packaging JEMPERLI is packaged in a carton containing one 10mL single -use vial with c lear to slightly opalescent colourless to yellow solution, essentially free from visible particles .

General JEMPERLI should be administered under the supervision of physicians experienced in the treatment of cancer. Driving and Operating Machinery Exercise caution when driving or operating a vehicle or potentially dangerous machinery. Immune Immune -mediated adverse reactions, which may be severe or fatal, have occured in patients treated with antibodies blocking the programmed cell death protein -1 / programmed death -ligand 1 (PD- 1/PD -L1) pathway, including JEMPERLI . While immune -mediated reactions usually occur during treatment with PD -1/PD -L1 blocking antibodi es, symptoms can also manifest after discontinuation of treatment. Immune -mediated adverse reactions may occur in any organ or tissue and may affect more than one body system simultaneously. Important immune -mediated adverse reactions listed in this sectio n are not inclusive of all possible severe and fatal immune -mediated reactions. Early identification and management of immune -mediated adverse reactions are essential to ensure safe use of PD -1/PD -L1 blocking antibodies. Patients should be monitored for s ymptoms and signs of immune -mediated adverse reactions . Clinical and haematological chemistries, including liver , kidney and thyroid function tests, should be evaluated at baseline and periodically during treatment. For suspected immune -mediated adverse re actions, adequate evaluation including specialty consultation should be ensured. Based on the severity of the adverse reaction, JEMPERLI should be withheld or permanently discontinued and corticosteroids (1 to 2 mg/kg/day prednisone or equivalent) or other appropriate therapy administered (see below and 4.2 Recommended Dose and Dosage Adjustment ). Upon improvement to Grade 0 or 1, corticosteroid taper should be initiated and continued for at least 1 month or longer. Based on limited data from clinical studies in patients whose immune -mediated adverse reactions could not be controlled with corticost eroid use, administration of other systemic immunosuppressants can be considered. Hormone replacement therapy for endocrinopathies should be institu ted as warranted. Treatment with JEMPERLI should be permanently discontinued for any Grade 3 immune -mediated adverse reaction that recurs and for any Grade 4 immune -mediated adverse reaction toxicity, except for endocrinopathies that are controlled with replacement hormones and unless otherwise specified in 4.2 Re commended Dose and Dose Adjustment . Immune -mediated pneumonitis Immune -mediated pneumonitis has been reported in patients receiving JEMPERLI (see 8.2 Clinical Trial Adverse Reactions ). Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of pneumonitis. Suspected pneumonitis should be confirmed with radiographic imaging and other causes excluded. Patients JEMPERLI (dostarlimab for injection ) January 31, 2023 Page 11 of 34 should be managed with JEMPERLI treatment modifications and corticosteroids (see 4.2 Recommended Dose and Dosage Adjustment, Dose Modifications and 8 ADVERSE REACTIONS ). Immune -mediated colitis JEMPERLI can cause immune -mediated colitis (see 8 ADVERSE REACTIONS ). Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of colitis and manage with JEMPERLI treatment modifications, anti -diarrheal agents and corticosteroids (see 4.2 Re commended Dose and Dosage Adjustment and 8 ADVERSE REACTIONS ). Immune -mediated hepatitis JEMPERLI can cause immune -mediated hepatitis. Monitor patients for changes in liver function periodically as indicated based on clinical evaluation and manage with JEMPERLI treatment modifications and corticosteroids (see 4.2 Recommended Dose and Dosage Adjustment and 8 ADVERSE REACTIONS ). Immune -mediated adrenal insufficiency (primary and secondary) , have been reported in patients receiving JEMPERLI . Long -term hormone replacement therapy may be necessary in cases of immune -mediated endocrinopathies. Adrenal insufficiency Immune -mediated adrenal occurred in patients receiving JEMPERLI . Patients should be monitored for clinical signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency. For symptomatic adrenal insufficiency, patients shou ld be managed as recommended in 4.2 Recommended Dose and Dosage Adjustment (see 8 ADVERSE REACTIONS ). Hypophysitis JEMPERLI can cause hypophysitis. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of hypophysitis (including hypopituitarism). Administer corticosteroids and hormone replacement as clinically indicated (See 4.2 Recommended Dose and Dosage Adjustment ). Type 1 diabetes mellitus JEMPERLI can cause type 1 diabetes mellitus, including diabetic ketoacidosis. Monitor patients for hyperglycemia or other signs and symptoms of diabetes. Administer insulin for type 1 diabetes and withhold JEMPERLI in cases of severe hype rglycemia until metabolic control is achieved (See 4.2 Recommended Dose and Dosage Adjustment ). Thyroid disorders ( Hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism ) Immune -mediated thyroid disorders, including hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism (including thyroiditis) occurred in patients receiving JEMPERLI . Hypothyroidism may follow hyperthyroidism. Patients should be monitored for changes in thyroid function (at the start of treatm ent, periodically during treatment and as indicated based on clinical evaluation) and clinical signs and symptoms of thyroid disorders . Hypothyroidism may be managed with hormone replacement therapy (if indicated). Initiate medical management for control o f hyperthyroidism. JEMPERLI (dostarlimab for injection ) January 31, 2023 Page 12 of 34 Immune -mediated hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism (including thyroiditis) should be managed as recommended in 4.2 Recommended Dose and Dosage Adjustment . (see 8 ADVERSE REACTIONS ) Immune -mediated nephritis JEMPERLI can cause immune -mediated nephritis (see 8 ADVERSE REACTIONS ). Monitor patients for changes in renal function and manage with JEMPERLI treatment modifications and corticosteroids (see 4.2 Recommended Dose and Dosage Adjustment ). Immune -mediated skin adverse reactions Immune -mediated skin reactions including rash , pruritus and pem phigoid been reported in patients receiving JEMPERLI (see 8.2 Clinical Trial Adverse Reactions ). Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of severe skin reactions and ex clude other causes . Immune -mediated severe skin reactions should be managed as recommended for other immune -mediated adverse reactions (see 4.2 Recommended Dose and Dosage Adjustment ). Cases of Stevens -Johnson Syndrome (SJS) or toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), some with fatal outcomes, have been reported in patients treated with PD -1 inhibitors. Exfoliative dermatological conditions should be managed as recommended in 4.2 Recommended Dose and Dosage Adjustment . For signs and symptoms of SJS or TEN, withold treatment and refer the patient for specialized ca re for assessment and further treatment. If SJS or TEN is confirmed, permanently discontinue treament. Caution should be used when considering the use of JEMPERLI in a patient who has previously experienced a severe or life -threatening skin adverse react ion on prior treatment with other immune -stimulatory anticancer agents. Other immune -mediated adverse reactions Given the mechanism of action , JEMPERLI can cause other clinically important immune -mediated adverse reactions including potentially serious events [e.g. demyelinating Clinically significant immune -mediated adverse reactions reported in less than 1% of patients treated with JEMPERLI as mo notherapy in clinical trials include haemolytic anemia , pancreatitis, uveitis, and iridocyclitis. Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of immune - mediated adverse reactions and managed as described in 4.2 Recommended Dose and Dosage Adjustment . Solid organ transplant rejection has been reported in the post -marketing setting in patients treated with PD -1 inhibitors. Treatment with JEMPERLI may increase the risk of rejection in solid organ transplant recipients. The benefit of treatment with JEMPERLI versus the risk of possible organ rejection should be considered in these patients. Complications of Allogeneic HSCT after PD -1/PD -L1-Blocking Antibody Fatal and other serious complications can occur in patients who receive allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) before or after being treated with a PD -1/PD antibody. injection of 34 chronic GvHD , hepatic veno -occlusive disease after reduced intensity conditioning, and steroid - requiring febrile syndrome (without an identified infectious cause). T hese complications may occur despite intervening therapy between PD -1/PD -L1 blockade and allogeneic HSCT. Follow patients closely for evidence of transplant -related complications and intervene promptly. Consider the benefit versus risks of treatment with a PD -1/PD -L1-blocking antibody prior to or after an allogeneic HSCT. Infusion -related reactions JEMPERLI can cause infusion -related reactions, including hypersensitivity, which can be severe . For severe (Grade 3) or life -threatening (Grade 4) infusion -related reactions, stop infusion and permanently discontinue JEMPERLI (see 4.2 Recommended Dose and Dosage Adjustment ). Monitoring and Laboratory Tes ts Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of immune -mediated adverse reactions and managed as described in 4.2 Recommended Dose and Dosage Adjustment . For suspected immune -mediated adverse reactions, adequate evaluation including specialty consultation should be ensured (see 7 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS, Immune ). Patients should be e valuate d for clinical and haematological chemistries, including liver function tests (hepatic transaminase and bilirubin levels), serum electrolytes and renal and thyroid function tests, at baseline and periodically during treatment. Reproductive Health : Female and Male Potential Fertility Fertility studies have not been co nducted with JEMPERLI (see 16 NON -CLINICAL TOXICOLOGY ). Embryo -fetal toxicity JEMPERLI can cause fetal harm. Pregnant women or women with reproductive potential should be advised of the potential risk associated with the administration of JEMPERLI to the fetus ( see 7.1.1 Pregnant Women ). Verify pregnancy status in females of reproductive potential prior to initiating JEMPERLI. Women of childbearing potential should use effective contraception during treatment with JEMPERLI and until 4 months after the last dose of JEMPERLI . 7.1 Special Populations 7.1.1 Pregnant Women There are no available data on the use of JEMPERLI in pregnant women. Animal reproduction and development studies have not been conducted with JEMPERLI ; however, inhibition of the PD -1/PD -L1 pathway has been shown in murine models of pregnancy to disrupt tolerance to the fetus and to result JEMPERLI (dostarlimab for injection ) January 31, 2023 Page 14 of 34 in an increase in fetal loss (See 16 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY ). These results indicate a potential risk, based on its mechanism of action, that administration of JEMPERLI during pregnancy could cause fetal harm, including increased rates of abortion or stillbirth . Human IgG4 immunoglobulins (IgG4) are known placental barrier; therefore, being an IgG4, JEMPERL I has the potential to be transmitted from the mother to the developing fetus . JEMPERLI is not recommended during pregnancy . Women of childbearing potential should use effective contraception during treatment with JEMPERLI and until 4 months after the last dose of JEMPERLI . 7.1.2 Breast -feeding It is unknown if JEMPERLI is secreted in human milk. A risk to the newborns/infants cannot be excluded. Precau tion should be exercised because many drugs can be secreted in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in breastfed children, JEMPERLI should not be used during breast -feeding and breast -feeding should be avoided for at least 4 m onths after the last dose of JEMPERLI. 7.1.3 Pediatrics No data are available to Health Canada; therefore, Health Canada has not authorized an indication for pediatric use. 7.1.4 Geriatrics No overall differences in safety or efficacy were reported between elderly patients (65 years and over) and younger patients (less than 65 years). No dose adjustment is recommen ded for patients who are aged 65 years or over. There are limited clinical data with dostarlimab in patients aged 75 years or over ( see 4.2 Recommended Dose and Dosage Adjustment -Geriatrics ). 8 ADVERSE REACTIONS 8.1 Adverse Reaction Overview The safety of JEMPERLI has been evaluated in 605 patients (i.e. monotherapy pooled safety population) with endometrial cancer or other advanced solid tumours who received dostarlimab monotherapy in the open -label, multi -cohort GARNET study, including 153 patients with dMMR/MSI -H recurrent or advanced endometrial cancer . Patients received doses of 500 mg every 3 weeks for 4 doses followed by 1000 mg every 6 weeks for all cycles thereafter (see 4.2 Recommended Dose and Dosage Adjustment ) . The median treatment duration for the monotherapy pooled population was 24 weeks (range 1 to 229 weeks), including 31.6 % of patients treated for greater than one year and 18.7 % of patients treated for greater than two years . Dostarlimab is most commonly associated with immune -mediated adverse reactions (see 8.2 Clinical Trial Adverse Reactions, Immune -mediated Adverse Reactions ). JEMPERLI (dostarlimab for injection ) January 31, 2023 Page 15 of 34 In patients with advanced or recurrent solid tumo urs (N = 605), the most common adverse reactions ( 10 %) were anemia ( 28.6 %), diarrhea (26.0%) , nausea pyrexia ( 12.4 %), aspart ate aminotransferase increased (11.2 %) and hypothyroidism ( 11.2 %). Adverse reactions were serious in 11.2 % of patients; most serious adverse reactions were immune -mediated adverse reactions (see 8.2 Clinical Trial Adverse Reactions, Immune - mediated Adverse Reac tions ). Serious adverse reactions reported in 1 % of patients were pyrexia (1.7 %), vomiting ( 1.5 %), nausea ( 1.3 %), anemia (1.3 %) and pneumonitis (1.3 %). JEMPERLI was permanently discontinued due to adverse reactions in 38 (6.3 %) patients, most of them were immune - mediated events. Adverse reactions leading to dose interruption were reported in 71 (11.7 %) patients . The safety profile for patients with dMMR/MSI -H endometrial cancer in the GARNET study (N= 153) was not different from that of the overall monotherapy population (i.e. monotherapy pooled safety population) . 8.2 Clinical Trial Adverse Reactions Clinical trials are conducted under very specific conditions . The adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials ; therefore, may not reflect the rates observed in practi ce and should not be compared to the rates in the clinical trials of another drug . Adverse reaction inf ormation from clinical trials may be useful in identifying and approximating rates of adverse drug reactions in real -world use. Immune -mediated Adverse Reactions The selected adverse reactions described below are based on the safety of dostarlimab in a monotherapy pooled safety database of 605 patients in the GARNET study in patients with endometrial cancer or other advanced solid tumours. Immune -mediated adverse reactions were defined as events of grade 2 and above from a pre -specified list of terms ; the frequencies below exclude grade 1 event s. The management guidelines for these adverse reactions are described in section 4.2 Recommended Dose and Dosage Adjustment . Immune -mediated pneumonitis Immune -mediated pneumonitis occurred in 14 (2.3 %) patients, including grade 2 ( 1.3 %), grade 3 (0.8 %) and grade 4 (0.2%) pneumonitis. Pneumonitis led to discontinuation of dostarlimab in 8 (61.3 %) patients. Systemic corticosteroids (prednisone 40 mg per day or equiva lent) were required in 11 (78.6%) patients experiencing pneumonitis. Pneumonitis resolved in 11 (78.6 %) patients. Immune -mediated colitis Colitis occurred in 8 ( 1.3 %) patients, including grade 2 ( 0.7 %) and grade 3 (0. 7 %) colitis. Colitis did not lead to discontinuation of dostarlimab in any patients. Systemic corticosteroids (prednisone 40 mg per day or equivalent) were required in 5 (62.5 %) patients. Colitis resolved in 5 (62.5 %) patients experiencing colitis. Immune -mediated hepatitis Hepatitis occurred in 2 (0.3 %) patient s, all were grade 3. Systemic corticosteroids (prednisone 40 mg per day or equivalent) were required in 1 (50.0 %) patient . Hepatitis led to discontinuation of dostarlimab in 1 (0.2 %) patient and resolved in all 2 patients . JEMPERLI (dostarlimab for injection ) January 31, 2023 Page 16 of 34 Immune -mediated endocrinopathies Hypothyroidism occurred in 46 (7.6 %) patients, all of which were grade 2. Hypothyroidism did not lead to discontinuation of dostarlimab an d resolved in 17 (37.0 %) patients. Hyperthyroidism occurred in 14 (2.3 %) patients, including grade 2 ( 2.1 %) and grade 3 (0.2 %). Hyperthyroidism did not lead to discontinuation of dostarlimab and resolved in 10 (71.4 %) patients. Thyroiditis occurred in 2 (0.3 %) patients; both were grade 2. Neither event of thyroiditis resolved; there were no discontinuations of dostarlimab due to thyroiditis. Adrenal insufficiency occurred in 7 ( 1.2 %) patients, including grade 2 ( 0.5 %), and grade 3 ( 0.7 %). Adrenal insufficiency resulted in discontinuation of dostarlimab in 1 (0.2 %) patient and resolved in 4 (57.1 %) patients. Immune -mediated nephritis Nephritis, including tubulointerstitial nephritis, occurred in 3 ( 0.5 %) patients ; all were grade 2. Systemic corticosteroids (prednisone 40 mg per day or equivalent) were required in 2 (66.7 %) patients experiencing nephritis. Nephritis led to discontinuation of dostarlimab in 1 (0.2 %) patient and resolved in all 3 patients. Immune -mediated skin adverse reactions Immune -mediated rash (rash, rash maculo -papular, rash macular, rash pruritic, pemphigoid , drug eruption, skin toxicity, toxic skin eruption ) occurred in 31 (5.1 %) patients, including Grade 3 in 9 (1.5 %) patients receiving dostarlimab. The median time to onset of rash was 57 days (range 2 days to 1485 days). Systemic corticosteroids (prednisone 40 mg per day or equivalent) were required in 9 (29.0 %) patients experiencing rash. Rash led to discontinu ation of dostarlimab in 1 (0.2%) patient and resolved in 23 (74.2 %) patients. Infusion -related reactions Infusion -related reactions including hypersensitivity occurred in 6 (1.0 %) patients, including grade 2 (0.3 %) and grade 3 (0.2 %) infusion -related reactions. Systemic corticosteroids (prednisone 40 mg per day or equivalent) were required in 1 (16.7 %) patient. All patients recovered from the infusion -related reaction. Mismatch repair deficient (dMMR) or mic rosatellite instability -high (MSI -H) endometrial cancer (EC) patient population In 153 patients with dMMR/MSI -H EC the most common adverse reactions ( 10%) were anemia (33.3 %), nausea (32. 7 %), diarrhea (29.4 %), vomiting ( 22.2 %), arthralgia ( 21.6 %), pruritus ( 19.0 %), rash (15.7 %), pyrexia (13.7 %), myalgia (10. 5 %), and hypothyroidism (11.8 %). Grade 3 adverse reactions were reported in 27 (17 .6 %) of patients receiving JEMPERLI.

Dostarlimab is considered to have low potential to affect pharmacokinetics of other drugs based on the lack of effect on cytokines, cytochrome P450, and active substance transporters. 9.4 Drug -Drug Interactions Immunosuppression The use of systemic corticosteroids or immunosuppressants before starting JEMPERLI should be avoided because of their potential interference with the pharmacodynamic activity and efficacy of JEMPERLI. Ho wever, systemic corticosteroids or other immunosuppressants can be used after starting JEMPERLI to treat immune -mediated adverse reactions (See 7 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS ). 9.5 Drug -Food Interactions Interactions with food have not been established. 9.6 Drug -Herb Interactions Interactions with herbal products have not been established. 9.7 Drug -Laboratory Test Interactions Interactions with laboratory tests have not been established. 10 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 10.1 Mechanism of Action Dostarlimab is an anti stable Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line. Binding receptor found on T cells inhibits T -cell proliferation and cytokine production. Upregulation of PD -1 ligands occurs in some tumours and signaling through this pathway can contribute to inhibition of active T -cell immune surveillance of tumours. Dostarlim ab binds to PD -1 and blocks its PD-L1 releasing inhibition of PD -1 pathway -mediated immune response, including the anti -tumour immune response. In syngeneic mouse tumour models, blocking PD -1 activity resulted in decreased tumou r growth. 10.2 Pharmacodynamics Dostarlimab provides sustained target engagement as measured by direct PD -1 binding and IL -2 production throughout the dosing interval at the recommended therapeutic dosing regimen. Cardiac Electrophysiology In a phase 1, open -label, single -arm study of JEMPERLI administered to patients with multiple tumo ur types, no large mean increase from baseline in QTc interval (i.e. > 10 ms) was detected fo llowing treatment with JEMPERLI at the recommended therapeutic dos e, when assessed at 0.5 hours postdose. JEMPERLI (dostarlimab for injection ) January 31, 2023 Page 20 of 34 10.3 Pharmacokinetics Dostarlimab pharmacokinetics (PK) was assessed using no n-compartmental analysis (NCA) and population PK (n=546) based approach for single agent JEMPERLI. The pharmacokinetics of dostarlimab is linear in the dose range of 1 to 10 mg/kg. NCA PK parameters corresponding to the 500 mg (single dose) is summarized i n Table 6. At the recommended therapeutic dose (500 mg administered intravenously every 3 weeks for 4 doses, followed by 1,000 mg every 6 weeks) , dostarlimab shows an approximate two -fold accumulation ( Cmin) starting cycle 4 through cycle 12, consistent with the terminal half -life. Table 6 - Summary of Dostarlimab Non -Compartmental Pharmacokinetic Parameters in Patients 4506 (20.5) a Geometric mean and geometric coefficient of variation (%), when applicable b Median (range), when applicable Cmax: maximum drug concentration, C min: minimum drug concentration, T max: time when maximum drug concentration is attained, t 1/2: drug half life, AUC 0-:area under the concentration -time curve between times zero and infinity, CL: systemic drug clearance, Vd : volume of distribution after single dose Absorption JEMPERLI is administered via the intravenous route and therefore is immediately and expected to be completely bioavailable . Distribution The geometric mean volume of distribution of dostarlimab at steady state is approximately 5.26 L ( % Coefficient of Variation (% CV): 14.2%). Metabolism The metabolic pathway of dostarlimab has not been characterized. As a humanized IgG4 monoclonal antibody, dostarlimab is expected to be degraded into small peptides and amino acids via catabolic non-specific pathways in the same ma nner as endogenous IgG. Elimination The geometric mean clearance (CL) parameter at steady state and terminal half -life (30.2% CV) and 23.5 days (22.4% CV), respectively . Special Populations and Conditions Based on population pharmacokinetic analysis, age (24 -86 years), sex, race, ethnicity, and tumo ur type did not have an effect on pharmacokinetic parameters of dostarlimab. JEMPERLI (dostarlimab for injection ) January 31, 2023 Page 21 of 34 Hepatic Insufficiency : No dose adjustment is needed in patients with mild hepatic impairment (total bilirubin (TB) 1.0 to 1.5 x ULN or AST > ULN as defined using the National Cancer Institute criteria of hepatic dysfunction) based on a population PK analysis. Data are not sufficient for drawing any conclusion on patients with moderate hepatic impa irment (TB > 1.5 to 3 x ULN and any AST) and no data in patients with severe hepatic impairment (TB > 3 x ULN and any AST). Renal Insufficiency : No dose adjustment is needed in patients with mild (estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR) < 90 and 60 mL/min/1.73 m2) or moderate (eGFR < 60 and 30 mL/min/1.73 m2) renal impairment based on a population PK analysis. Data are not sufficient for drawing a conclusion on patients with severe (eGFR < 30 and 15 mL/min/1.73 m2) renal impairment. 11 STORAGE , STABILITY AND DISPOSAL Store in a refrigerator 2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C.

JEMPERLI (dostarlimab for injection ) January 31, 2023 Page 22 of 34 PART II: SCIENTIFIC INFORMATION 13 PHARMACEUTICAL INFORMATION Drug Substance Proper name: Chemical name: Immunoglobulin C It is a glycosylated homodimer consisting of two identical heavy chains and two identical light chains, with 12 intra -chain disulfide bonds and 4 inter -chain disulfide bonds . Physicochemical properties: Formulated drug substance : dostarlimab is a clear to slightly opalescent, colorless to yellow solution , essentially free from visible particles. 14 CLINICAL TRIALS 14.1 Clinical Trials by Indication Mismatch repair deficient (dMMR) / or microsatellite instability -high (MSI -H) endometrial cancer (EC) The efficacy and safety of JEMPERLI were investigated in the GARNET study, a multicentre, uncontrolled, multiple parallel cohort, open -label phase -1 study. The GARNET study inc luded expansion cohorts in subjects with recurrent or advanced solid tumo urs who have limited available treatment options. GARNET study Cohort A1 enrolled 129 patients with mismatch repair deficient (dMMR)/microsatellite instability -high (MSI -H) endometrial cancer who have progressed on or after a platinum containing regimen. The identification of dMMR/MSI -H tumour status was prospectively determined based on local testi ng. Local diagnostic assays (IHC, PCR or NGS) available at the sites were used for the detection of the dMMR/MSI -H status in tumour material. Most of the sites used IHC as it was the most common assay available. Patients with the following status were exc luded from the GARNET study: ECOG baseline performance central nervous system metastases or carcinomatous meningitis; other malignancies within the last 2 years; immunodeficiency or receiving immunosuppressive therapy within 7 days; active HIV, hepatitis B or hepatitis C infection; active autoimmune disease requiring systemic treatment in the past 2 years excluding replacement therapy; history of interstitial lung disease; or receiving live vaccine within 14 days. JEMPERLI (dostarlimab for injection ) January 31, 2023 Page 23 of 34 Patients received JEMPERLI 500 mg every 3 weeks for 4 cycles followed by 1000 mg every 6 weeks. Treatment continued until unacceptable toxicity or disease progression that was either symptomatic, rapidly progressive, required urgent intervention, or occurr ed with a decline in performance status. The median duration of treatment was 26 weeks, with a minimum of 3 weeks and a maximum of 139 weeks. The major efficacy outcome measures were objective response rate (ORR) and duration of response (DOR) as assessed by blinded independent central radiologists' (BICR) review according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST v1.1 ). The efficacy population was defined as patients who had measurable disease by BICR at baseline and had minimum of 2 4 weeks follow -up or had less than 24 weeks of follow -up and discontinued due to adverse events or disease progression .

JEMPERLI (dostarlimab for injection ) January 31, 2023 Page 25 of 34 14.2 Study Results A total of 108 patients (18 years or older) with dMMR/MSI -H EC were evaluated for efficacy in the GARNET study . A total of twenty -one patients were excluded from primary efficac y analysis including 12 patients with measureable disease at baseline who had not discontinued either from treatment or from the study at the time of analysis but had insufficient follow -up at the time of the data cut -off, and 9 patients who had no measura ble disease at baseline by RECIST 1.1 per BICR. At the time of analysis, 63% of subjects and 41% of subjects had discontinued treatment and discontinued from the study respectively. The e fficacy results of GARNET study for mismatch -repair deficient /MSI -H endometrial cancer patients are shown in Table 8.

Anti-drug antibodies (ADA) were tested in 384 patients who received 500 mg Q3W for the first 4 cycles followed by 1000 mg Q6W dostarlimab and the incidence of dostarlimab treatment -emergent ADAs was 2.1%. Neutralising antibodies were detected in 1.0% of patients. Due to the limited number of patients who tested positive for anti -drug antibody, no conclusio ns can be drawn concerning a potential effect of immunogenicity on efficacy or safety. 15 MICROBIOLOGY No microbiological information is required for this drug product. JEMPERLI (dostarlimab for injection ) January 31, 2023 Page 26 of 34 16 NON -CLINICAL TOXICOLOGY General Toxicology: Dostarlimab was administrated by IV to cynomolgus monkeys in a single dose study and two repeat -dose studies: 4 -weeks and 13 -weeks. Dostarlimab was generally well tolerated in cynomolgus monkeys in the single - and 4 -weeks repeat -dose toxicity studies and the no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) in both studies was considered to be 100 mg/kg, the top dose. The NOAEL could not be deter mined in the 13 -weeks repeat -dose study. In Study 4010 -09-003, dostarlimab by IV to cynomolgus monkeys (4 animals/ sex/group) at dose levels of 10, 30, and 100 mg/kg once weekly over 13 weeks (14 doses in total). After completion of dosi ng, 2 animals/sex/group from the control and high -dose groups were assigned to an 8-week treatment -free recovery period. One male receiving 10 mg/kg dostarlimab was euthanized on Day 89 due to chronic, unresolved, generalized skin findings (first recorded on Day 5) and secondary swollen and firm inguinal lymph nodes. The skin findings were indicative of an immune reaction and they could be exaggerated pharmacological effects of dostarlimab based on the mechanism of action. Additionally, liquid feces observe d in all groups, including control, was considered a possible drug - related effect at 30 mg/kg/week dose given the increased incidence over concurrent controls and timing relative to dosing. However, there were no correlated changes in body weight and food consumption, or associated pathology findings, thus, it was not considered adverse. Also, sporadic and dose -unrelated macroscopic and/or microscopic findings of an immune -mediated nature were observed in the skin, kidney, liver, or heart of 1 -2 animals pe r group, dosed with dostarlimab . These findings could be the anticipated pharmacological effects or drug -related exacerbation of background findings. Carcinogenicity : No studies have been performed to assess the potential of dostarlimab for carcinogenicity. Genotoxicity : No studies have been performed to assess the potential of dostarlimab for genotoxicity. Reproductive and Developmental Toxicology : Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with dostarlimab . The PD -1/PD -L1 pathway is thought to be involved in maintaining tolerance to the fetus throughout pregnancy. Blockade of PD -L1 signalling has been shown in murine models of pregnancy to disrupt tolerance to the fetus and to result in an increase in fetal loss. These results indicate a potential risk that the administration of JEMPERLI during pregnancy could cause fetal harm, including increased rates of abortion or stillbirth . Animal fertility studies have not been conducted with dostarlimab . In 1 -month and 3 -month repeat -dose toxicology studies in cynomolgus monkeys, there were no notable effects in the male and female reproductive organs; however, these results may not be repr esentative at all of the potential clinical risks because of the immaturity of the reproductive system of animals used in the studies. Therefore, fertility toxicity remains unknown . Special Toxicology: No immunotoxicity or local tolerance studies have been performed with dostarlimab . Tissue cross -reactivity studies were performed in human and cynomolgus monkey tissues in two JEMPERLI doses, 0.5 or 5.0 g/mL. Dostarlimab -specific binding was observed at 0.5 or 5.0 g/mL in both human and cynomolgus monkey ti ssues. Binding in cynomolgus monkey tissues was similar to that of human tissues; however, a greater amount of staining was present in the human tissue panel. In both the human and cynomolgus monkey studies, there was no unexpected binding, and hence no ti ssue cross -reactivity was observed.

This leaflet is a summary and will not tell you everything about this drug . Talk to your healthcare professional about your medical condition and treatment and ask if there is any new information about JEMPERLI . What is JEMPERLI used for ? For the following indication(s) , JEMPERLI has been approved with conditions (NOC/c). This means it has passed Health Canada's review and can be bought and sold in Canada, but the manufacturer has agreed to c omplete more studies to make sure the drug works the way it should. For more information, talk to your healthcare professional. JEMPERLI is a prescription medicine used in adults to treat: a kind of cancer called endometrial cancer (cancer of the lining of the womb) in adults that is shown by a laboratory test to be mismatch repair deficient (dMMR) or microsatellite instability -high (MSI -H) that has progressed on or following prior treatment with a platinum containing regimen. What is a Notice of Compliance with Conditions (NOC/c)? A Notice of Compliance with Conditions (NOC/c) is a type of approval to sell a drug in Canada. Health Canada only gives an NOC/c to a drug that treats, prevents, or helps identify a serious or life - threatening illness. The drug must show promising proof that it works well, is of high quality, and is reasonably safe. Also, the drug must either respond to a serious medical need in Canada, or be much safer t han existing treatments. Drug makers must agree in writing to clearly state on the label that the drug was given an NOC/c, to complete more testing to make sure the drug works the way it should, to actively monitor the drug's performance after it has been sold, and to report their findings to Health Canada. How does JEMPERLI work? JEMPERLI contains the active substance dostarlimab, which is a monoclonal antibody , a type of protein designed to recognise and attach to a specific target substance in the body . JEMPERLI works by helping your immune system fight your cancer. It is given when endometrial cancer (cancer of the lining of the womb) has spread, or cannot be taken out by surgery, and has progressed on or following prior treatment. JEMPERLI (dostarlimab for injection ) January 31, 2023 Page 29 of 34 What are the in gredients in JEMPERLI ? \"Do not use JEMPERLI if\").

JEMPERLI (dostarlimab for injection ) January 31, 2023 Page 30 of 34 Breast -feeding You must not breast -feed during tr eatment and for at least 4 months after your last dose of JEMPERLI. A risk to the newborns/infants cannot be excluded. If you are breast -feeding, ask your doctor for advice before you are given this medicine. The active ingredient of JEMPERLI may pass into your breast milk. You and your doctor should decide if you will take JEMPERLI or breast -feed, you should not do both. Children: It is not known if JEMPERLI is safe and effective in children less than 18 years of age. Therefore, Health Canada has not authorized an indication for children less than 18 years of age . Elderly No overall differences in safety or efficacy were reported between elderly patients (65 years and over) and younger patients (less than 65 years). No dose adjustment is recommended for patients who are aged 65 years or over. There are limited clinical data with dostarlimab in patients aged 75 years or over . Other warnings you should know about: There are possible side effects of JEMPERLI treatment in people who have received a transplant Rejection of a transplanted organ . People who have had an organ transplant may have an increased risk of organ transplant rejection. Your doctor should tell you what signs and symptoms you should report and monitor you, depending on the type of organ transplant that you have had. JEMPERLI can cause complications, including graft -versus -host -disease (GVHD), in people who have received a bone marrow (stem cell) transplant that uses donor stem cells (allogeneic) . These complications can be serious and can lead to death. These complications may happen if you underwent transplantation either befor e or after being treated with JEMPERLI . Your healthcare professional will monitor you for these complications. JEMPERLI can have serious side effects, which can sometimes become life -threatening and can lead to death. These side effects may happen at any t ime during treatment, or even after your treatment has ended. You may get more than one side effect at the same time.
