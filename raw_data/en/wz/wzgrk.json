What Different Types of Over-The-Counter Medicine Are There? There are a wide variety of over-the-counter medicines, each with a different purpose. It's important to know what type of small health issue you want to treat to ensure you're taking the right medication.

What to Consider When Buying Over-The-Counter Medicine Even though you can buy over-the-counter medicine without a doctor's prescription, you should be intentional and cautious when purchasing new medicine. All OTC drugs on the market are approved by the Food and Drug Administration before being sold, but that doesn't mean every medication is a good fit for every individual. There are several key factors you should consider while stocking your medicine cabinet: - Purpose of medicine: Some over-the-counter medications can be used for multiple purposes. That being said, you should know why you're taking the medication and what it's meant to treat. - Frequency and quantity of medicine: Knowing how frequently you're going to take over-the-counter medication can help you to know what size of package or bottle you should purchase. - Dosage amount: The same type of medication can come in different dosage amounts, so be sure you check the drug information and your doctor's instructions before purchasing. - Length of use: Again, knowing how long you're going to take an over-the-counter medication at the recommended dosage and frequency will help you know which package or bottle to stock in your medicine cabinet. - Side effects: Some over-the-counter medicines have side effects that can lead to more serious issues. Knowing what these side effects are is important so you can watch for them and discuss any symptoms with your doctor. - Allergies: You should never take medication you are allergic to. - Pre-existing medical conditions: Any pre-existing conditions such as pregnancy or risk of heart failure should be considered when purchasing over-the-counter medication. Consult with your doctor to be sure you're using medicine that keeps you safe and healthy. - Interactions with other medications: Some drugs can react with one another to create side effects or dangerous conditions. By checking the active ingredients in OTC medicines, you can check to see if different prescriptions and over-the-counter medications will interact. - Price: Be sure you're keeping your over-the-counter medications within your budget. Generic or store-brand versions of helpful drugs are often available at a lower cost. - Shelf-life: Expired medications may not work or may cause painful side effects. Be sure you check the expiration date of your over-the-counter medicine before taking and replace any that are expired. What Brands of Over-The-Counter Medicine Does Sam's Club Sell?
