While it may seem normal, these emotions could point to a more serious problem deep within the energy body: blocked chakras. Residing in the astral body (energy body), [chakras ](https://www.arhantayoga.org/blog/7-chakras-introduction-energy-centers-effect/https://www.arhantayoga.org/blog/7-chakras-introduction-energy-centers-effect/)are energy centers that are responsible for our physical, emotional and spiritual well-being. Just like the heart pumps blood to other organs in the body, so chakras spread [prana](https://www.arhantayoga.org/blog/prana-definition-the-5-vital-energies/), or life-force energy, to these vital regions, ensuring good emotional and physical health. Learning how to unblock chakras is therefore critical for the healthy functioning of the mind, body and spirit. But healing chakras is not as simple as treating a headache or a swollen ankle as chakras do not exist in the physical body, so we cannot see or touch them. Instead, we have to use holistic practices like [meditation](https://www.arhantayoga.org/blog/what-is-meditation-benefits-and-effects/), [mudras](https://www.arhantayoga.org/blog/complete-guide-to-mudras-and-benefits/), affirmations or chanting to activate and stabilize these swirling wheels of energy. Whether you'd like to help others find stability or want to gain control of your own life, chakra balancing can help you tap into unknown energy, awaken mental control, and gain optimal physical health. Below, we explore the 7 chakras, the effect of a blocked chakra on the body, as well as how to unblock chakras with meditation and affirmations. Ground your sitting bones into the earth, clear your mind and let's dive into chakra balancing. What is a Blocked Chakra? Chakras move at a particular frequency to spread prana in a local region. Each chakra is surrounded by a certain element, like the Root Chakra is surrounded by the earth element. When the element around the chakra becomes blocked, it restricts the movement of the chakra causing it to slow down. When the chakra movement slows down, it does not spread enough prana in the local region, causing numerous problems to arise. What Does a Blocked Chakra Feel Like? Blocked chakras can manifest themselves in different ways. You could experience an emotional imbalance through negative feelings of insecurity, loneliness, and greed, or physical issues like headaches, indigestion, and colon problems. Sometimes, it can be difficult to determine if your Third Eye Chakra is imbalanced, or you're just dehydrated. Fortunately, blocked chakras have [telltale signs](https://www.arhantayoga.org/blog/7-chakras-introduction-energy-centers-effect/) that you can easily pick up with active awareness. It's also wise to familiarize yourself with the location of each of the 7 chakras in the body, as the area of your issue can usually be linked to chakra that resides there. A blocked Third Eye Chakra, for example, is located in the middle of the brain between the eyebrows, and can cause physical problems like regular headaches, blurry vision, and eye strain. Ultimately, if you're feeling off, emotionally unstable or disconnected from the world around you, it's usually a sign that there is a blockage or imbalance in your energy system. By being aware of your body and taking notice of sudden changes in your mood, you can determine which chakra is blocked and clear and balance it with regular practice. What Causes Chakras to Become Blocked? There are many reasons why a chakra can become blocked, but the most common cause is an unhealthy lifestyle. Too much stress, negative thinking, a lack of physical exercise, not enough sleep and an unhealthy diet are all leading contributors of a blocked chakra. And at the same time, too much of something good can also cause an imbalance in the energy body with an equally harmful effect on your health and well-being. One or all of these factors can cause your chakras to enter into either a hypoactive or hyperactive state. When hypoactive, your chakra distributes an insufficient or reduced amount of prana to the area. A hyperactive or imbalanced chakra means there is too much energy flowing into that particular region, causing an imbalance in the entire chakra system. Why is it Important to Unblock Your Chakras? The 7 chakras are strongly tied to the organs and glands that surround it. If just one chakra is hypoactive or hyperactive, it can have a ripple effect on the entire body, negatively impacting your physical, emotional and spiritual well-being. If not tended to, a blocked chakra may also lead to more serious physical illnesses and mental health challenges like depression or anxiety. Knowing how to unblock chakras is therefore important to maintain good health and keep your energy body in check. When your chakras are clear and aligned, you are your best Self. You will naturally have a more positive outlook on life and feel more energized and confident. On the mat, you'll also notice a healthy progression in your performance. How to Unblock Chakras with Meditation and Affirmations So, how do you unblock chakras? You can purge the 7 chakras in the body through chakra meditation, mudras, affirmations, pranayama and yoga poses. Meditation for balancing chakras is similar to traditional meditation, except that your intention for the practice is to open and clear the body's energy centers. You'll focus all your attention on the blocked chakra and drive energy to the area using mantras, mudras and breathing techniques. Affirmations are positive phrases that can remove mental blockages and help you channel energy to where it's needed most.
