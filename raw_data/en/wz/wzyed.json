Many of these tests also reflect the general dysfunction of cellular metabolism that underlies a host of chronic conditions. Vitamin D3 Level: There are so many good reasons to measure a patient's level of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-OHD) in the blood. Vitamin D3 is important for the prevention and treatment of heart disease and viral infections. It is a simple inverse relationship: if vitamin D is low, risk is higher. Statistically, low vitamin D correlates strongly with COVID risk. Vitamin D also activates many cancer prevention genes; women with high levels of vitamin D3 (60-90 ng/ml) have an 82% lower risk for breast cancer. Most studies indicate that risk of CVD rises when vitamin D levels drop below 30 ng/ml. Optimal levels for protection against CVD are in the range of 60-90 ng/ml. GlycoMark: The GlycoMark test measures blood levels of 1,5-Anhydroglucitol (1,5-AG), a glucose-like sugar found in many foods. It is an indicator of the average maximum blood glucose level over the previous 14 days. A sharp decrease in circulating 1,5-AG signals that a patient has frequent post-prandial glucose surges and greater risk. According to the company that makes the test, two people with similar A1C levels in the 7-8% range may have very different glucose variations throughout a day. Roughly 40% of people with \"healthy\" A1Cs have persistent glucose spikes, putting them at high risk for cardiometabolic complications. GlycoMark is an adjunct to standard glucose tests. It is a simple well-validated tool for early detection of glucose dysregulation. A reading of 3 ug/ml or lower indicates potential problems; a reading above 10 indicates better glucose regulation. Homocysteine: This is a great test to determine if the body has adequate levels of B vitamins, especially B6, B12 and folic acid. Deficiencies in these vitamins often indicate future cardiovascular and cognitive problems, as well as hormone-related diseases, potential birth defects, and many other health challenges. C-Reactive Protein (CRP): Inflammation is a key driver of CVD, along with other chronic diseases and CRP is a reliable indicator of inflammation. It provides an early warning for heart disease and many other chronic problems. Often triggered by the presence of free radicals and oxidative stress, high CRP is an early warning sign for heart disease, cancer, and other illnesses. 8-OHgD test: 8-hydroxy- 2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) is a byproduct of oxidative damage to guanine bases in DNA, which makes it a good indicator of DNA damage caused by chemical toxins in the air, water or food, as well as various forms of radiation. A high level of 8-OHgD in urine indicates increased oxidative stress, thus providing an early warning of disease. The acceptable or \"normal\" levels on the 8-OHgD urine test are 43.9+/-42.1 ng/mg ng/mg creatinine in males. Galectin-3 (Gal-3): This molecule plays important roles in normal cell adhesion, cell growth, and chemoattraction. However, Gal-3 elevations indicates that something is wrong. High Gal-3 is strongly associated with ventricular remodeling, heart failure, and stroke. It is also associated with some forms of cancer. Gal-3 is over-expressed on cancer cell surfaces, and actually helps them to stick to one another. It also circulates in the blood, indicating that cancers are attempting to metastasize. Because it can signal the possibility of multiple diseases, Gal-3 measurement is not a stand-alone diagnostic test for any particular condition. But it is a useful biomarker of chronic inflammation, tissue fibrosis, and possible neoplasia. From a CVD perspective, serum Gal-3 levels below 18 ng/ml are considered low-risk; readings above 25 ng/ml suggest high risk for heart failure. Oximetry: A simple finger oximeter can provide important signals. If oxygen levels are low, the mitochondria do not produce enough energy and cells are not able to function properly. Most finger oximeters use a 100-point scale: the desired level is from 96 to 100. As oxygen level drops, cellular metabolic problems increase. Vascular damage and vasoconstriction are primary causes of low readings. In some cases, this reflects infection with SARS-CoV-2. Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF): VEGF is a signal protein that stimulates the growth of new blood vessels in response to low levels of oxygen. It can also produce a profound increase in vascular permeability and edema. Over- and under-expression of VEGF can both create problems. Too much VEGF can lead to excess vessel growth and excess permeability of capillaries. Too little can lead to a lack of oxygenation in tissues, which can trigger symptoms of chronic inflammatory response syndrome (CIRS). Most studies establish the optimal range of VEGF to be between 31 pg/ml and 86 pg/ml. Gamma-Glutamyltransferase (GGT): This enzyme is found in many organs in the body, with higher concentrations in the liver where it helps to deliver cysteine for intercellular glutathione synthesis. While predominately a marker of liver disease, elevated serum GGT also indicates oxidative stress, often associated with excessive alcohol consumption, heavy metal exposure, heart disease, and diabetes. High GGT can also be associated with increased cancer risk. Typical reference ranges are 15-85 IU/L for men, and 5-55 IU/L for women. Magnesium RBC: Magnesium has many physiological roles. One of the most important is glucose and insulin transport. The level of magnesium in red blood cells is the best indicator of overall magnesium levels in the body. Mg deficiency is associated with diabetes, and a host of cardiometabolic problems. It is also linked to increased cancer risk. The reference range for magnesium RBC tests is 4.26.8 mg/dL. D-dimer: D-dimer is a small protein fragment that results from fibrinolysis. High levels are associated with deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, and stroke. It is also a biomarker of abnormal clots associated with COVID-19 infection or in response to a COVID vaccine (if the test is done within ten days of diagnosis or injection). A four-fold increase in D-dimer is an indicator of poor prognosis in hospitalized COVID patients. In adult males and non-pregnant females, the threshold is 0.5 ug/ml. Omega 3/6 ratio: This test measures the ratio of omega-3 to omega-6 fatty acids in the blood. In broad-stroke terms, omega-3 is anti-inflammatory, while omega 6 is inflammatory. We need both to maintain health, but they need to be in the right balance. Too much omega-6 drives inflammation and raises risk of CVD and other diseases. A good ratio is in the range of 2 to1 or 3 to1, favoring the omega-3s. MRI Plaque View: This relatively new assessment tool shows the actual morphology of atherosclerotic plaques, including multi-contrast identification of the lipid core, calcification, and hemorrhage potential. It indicates maximum carotid wall thickness, normalized wall index, and gives a lot of information about the health of the endothelial lining. It is an accurate way to assess plaque vulnerability to rupture, thus giving a clear picture of thrombosis risk. PULS Cardiac Test: The Protein Unstable Lesion Signature (PULS) Cardiac Test is another relatively new method that aggregates biomarkers of immune system activation and endothelial injury, including IL-16, MCP-3, Eotaxin, and sFas, along with HDL and hemoglobin A1c. It combines these variables into a composite score that predicts the odds that someone will have a heart attack within five years. There is good science to support this method, as summarized in a recent paper by Premyodhin and colleagues in Coronary Artery Disease. But PULS testing is not yet considered standard of care in cardiology. Cardiac surgeon Steven Gundry recently published an abstract looking at the effect of mRNA COVID vaccines on PULS scores. Gundry has been using PULS regularly for 8 years. He ran the PULS tests 2-10 weeks following patients' second doses of mRNA shots, and compared the scores to each patient's pre-vaccine levels. Based on those comparisons, he observed increases in IL-16, sFas, and HGF (hepatocyte growth factor), which raised 5-year coronary event risk scores from an average 11% to 25%. Gundry concludes that mRNA vaccines trigger endothelial inflammation. The findings are not entirely surprising given that the purpose of a vaccine is to generate temporary inflammation. The question is whether the observed elevations are dangerous. Gundry's experiment did not include an unvaccinated control group, patients who received a non-mRNA vaccine, or people receiving any other type of conventional non-COVID vaccine. The paper gives no data about duration of the inflammatory surges. Further, there is no information given about PULS score changes during an acute COVID episode, which makes it difficult to gauge the potential vaccine risk Gundry is suggesting against the risks associated with severe COVID. His observations raise important questions that warrant attention. But without these comparators they are not conclusive. Charles K. Bens, PhD, is a nutritionist and educator based in Sarasota, FL.

Reach Dr. Bens at: bensck@gmail.com A recently published case series from the University of Chicago underscores the value of plant sterol supplements for managing elevated cholesterol in statin-intolerant patients at moderate to high risk for cardiovascular disease. While statin therapy with accompanying lifestyle modification remains the preferred conventional intervention for treating dyslipidemias and reducing cardiovascular risk, many patients do not want to take statins, or are intolerant of them. Plant sterols have long been recommended in the global medical guidelines to control cholesterol, primarily for patients who do not quality for pharmacotherapy, cannot tolerate statins, or who opt against prescription drug therapies. \"Over the last few decades, phytosterols have been established to provide a convenient, safe, and modestly efficacious adjunct to lipid-lowering therapies with reproducible effects.\" -Priya Pulipati, MD, University of Chicago Lipid Clinic The need for effective statin alternatives to manage cholesterol is particularly acute at the primary care level. The American College of Cardiology recommends several non-statin therapies for cholesterol management, including plant sterols. Sterols and stanols, which are basically the plant world's analogue to cholesterol, competitively inhibit cholesterol absorption from intestinal micelles. Taken daily, they can lead to a 5-15% decrease in serum cholesterol within several weeks. According to the FDA, foods containing at least 0.65 g per serving of plant sterol esters, eaten twice a day with meals for a total daily intake of at least 1.3 g, as part of a diet low in saturated fat and cholesterol, may reduce the risk of heart disease. Dietary sources of plant sterols and stanols include green vegetables, whole grains, beans and legumes, nuts, and seeds. Olive oil, Sunflower oil, and other vegetable oils are also good dietary sources. In the new case series, researchers at the University of Chicago's Lipid Clinic looked at the potential impact of a novel chewable plant sterol supplement to lower elevated cholesterol in six moderate to high risk individuals. Developed by Piper Biosciences, this product was designed to provide practitioners with a clinical solution for their statin-intolerant patients, as well as for patients with elevated cholesterol who do not qualify for a prescription medication. Priya Pulipati, MD, a preventive cardiology fellow at the University of Chicago, and Michael Davidson, MD, Director of the university's Preventive Cardiology program, documented changes in the lipid profiles of six patients taking daily packs of the sterol-containing gummies, providing 2.28 grams of plant sterol esters (1.4 grams of plant sterols) per day. The patients were instructed to take the supplements at meal time, twice daily. These case studies showed impressive LDL-C lowering effects that exceed the more typical 5-15% reductions reported in larger studies and meta-analyses looking at the impact of plant sterols and stanols. All of the patients in this case series showed clinically meaningful improvements in their lipid profiles. Patient 1 was a 72-year-old African-American female with a history of mitral valve prolapse and essential hypertension. Despite frequent counseling, the patient declined statins for over 10 years due to personal preference. Her estimated 10-year ASCVD risk score was 19%, representing intermediate to high risk. After 28 weeks of using the plant sterol supplement as monotherapy, her LDL-C decreased from 164 to 122 mg/dL, a 26% decrease. Patient 2 was a 30-year-old Caucasian female with parental history of early onset heart disease. Since the age of 23, she had tried multiple statins including the lowest dose of an alternate statin but experienced severe muscle side-effects prompting her to discontinue. By age 29, she was taking several OTC products (red yeast rice, L-methyl folate and krill oil), with no significant changes in her LDL levels, despite good compliance. The addition of the sterol gummies for 24 weeks, along with the other OTC products she was taking, yielded a 32% decrease in LDL-C (from 193 to 132 mg/dL). Patient 3 was a 64-year-old Asian male with no other medical co-morbidities. He was a non-smoker with no personal or family history of premature heart disease. After 6 weeks of chewable plant sterol therapy, while continuing to take a low-dose red yeast rice product, his LDL-C decreased from 203 (while taking red yeast rice alone) to 153 mg/dL-a 25% decrease. Patient 4 was a 66-year-old female with family history of heart disease. She had tried multiple statins over several years but experienced severe muscle side-effects that caused her to stop the drugs. She was started on ezetimibe 10mg daily with a reasonable LDL-C response (while on ezetimibe, LDL-C was 135 mg/dL). After the addition of the sterol supplement to her ezetimibe regimen, LDL-C decreased by an additional 12% after 30 weeks. Patient 5 was a 48-year-old Asian male without significant co-morbidities but with a family history of heart disease. He experienced non-specific muscular side-effects and cognitive impairment while taking statins, leading to discontinuation. The University of Chicago investigators started this patient on a combination of low dose rosuvastatin (5 mg daily), ezetimibe 10 mg daily, and chewable plant sterols, which reduced LDL-C from 182 to 53 after 16 weeks, a 71% decrease. Patient 6 was a64-year-old Caucasian female with a history of moderate aortic stenosis and essential hypertension, but no family history of premature heart disease. She tried and discontinued multiple statins due to severe muscular side effects. Her 10 year ASCVD risk score was 9.8%, representing intermediate risk. She began monotherapy with the sterol product, and after 72 weeks, her LDL-C improved from 156 to 122, a 22% decrease. These case studies showed impressive LDL-C lowering effects that exceed the more typical 5-15% reductions reported in larger studies and meta-analyses looking at the impact of plant sterols and stanols. This could be due to variability within a small sample size or to the adjunctive use of other treatments including OTC products (red yeast rice, folate, omega-3 supplements, etc), ezetimibe or low dose statins. Seen in that light, this case series does provide good examples of how healthcare providers can manage complex lipid cases through a combination of different modalities. Palipati, Davidson and colleagues summarize the clinical indications for plant sterol therapy: \"Patients with low to moderate ASCVD risk who do not qualify for pharmacotherapy, patients who decline pharmacotherapy, as an adjunct therapy in patients with high CVD risk with suboptimal LDL-C control on maximally tolerated lipid-lowering therapy especially in situations of statin and/or non-statin associated side-effects.\" They observed no side effects in these six cases, though they do note that potential side effects from plant sterols can include mild bloating, diarrhea, or constipation. The authors conclude, \"Over the last few decades, phytosterols have been established to provide a convenient, safe, and modestly efficacious adjunct to lipid-lowering therapies with reproducible effects. The evolving understanding of phytosterol function, metabolism, and interaction with patient-specific factors such as genetics has led to increased awareness and utility of this therapeutic option in clinical practice. Further research on the effects of phytosterols on cardiovascular outcomes is warranted.\" Nitric Oxide (NO) has been the topic of over 140,000 research articles. The pinnacle of accomplishment in this field was the Nobel Prize in Medicine given to three American scientists for their work in discovering the nitric oxide pathway. Since then, pharmaceutical and nutraceutical companies have been scrambling to create new products that harness the powers of this simple yet profound molecule. NO has been proven to improve many aspects of human health, including cardiovascular function, pain and inflammation, brain, vision, sexual health, athletic performance, healthful aging, and sleep. In this webinar, natural health practitioner Jay Wilkins will discuss how the research directs us to natural interventions to boost waning NO levels. You will learn what the foremost thought leaders in this field are saying regarding reversing cardiovascular and other issues. Wilkins will answer practical clinical questions like, which pathway is best for increasing NO productions-arginine or nitrate/nitrite? You'll also learn what types of supplements are best for NO support, as well a way to non-invasively track results of NO-focused interventions. Jay Wilkins, is a natural healthcare practitioner who has been in the health and wellness industry for more than 25 years. For over 13 years, he operated a fully staffed naturopathic clinic.
