What Is Acupuncture? Acupuncture is a key component of traditional Chinese medicine that was used to restore energy balance within the body. The technique involves inserting very thin metal needles into the skin at precise points of the body with the intent of clearing energy channels and restoring or maintaining health. Each spot of insertion is chosen based on a network of energy lines in the body, called meridians. These energy lines encircle the entire body, similar to the global lines of longitude and latitude. Depending on the issue you want to address, specific points will be targeted to provide relief. How Acupuncture Works Acupuncture has been used in traditional Chinese medicine for as many as 3,000 years to alleviate pain and resolve bodily ailments. The ancient technique aimed to restore physical energy flow (known as Chi) by placing needles in strategic points. Promoting energy flow and balance was thought to relieve ailments and stress. In modern medicine, acupuncture is performed by a trained acupuncturist who will insert sterile, medical-grade needles into the skin at varying depths. When placed at the appropriate points, the needles are thought to affect your neurological system by stimulating nerves, enhancing blood flow, and triggering the release of pain-reducing hormones and endorphins. Acupuncture has become a popular and trusted treatment globally due to its ability to produce results through a relatively painless procedure without side effects. Modern Uses of Acupuncture Therapy Modern medicine utilizes acupuncture to treat a variety of ailments and common bodily injuries. In addition, acupuncture is thought to promote relaxation, helping those who suffer from stress or anxiety.

We'll ensure you're comfortable throughout the process by answering all your questions and putting your mind at ease before we begin. You can expect your first appointment to take about an hour, as we'll need to discuss your health history before beginning. After the initial appointment, treatments should take about 30 to 45 minutes. The procedure begins with the acupuncturist swabbing the affected areas with alcohol to sanitize the skin surface. Sterile, disposable needles will then be inserted into these points and left for 20 to 25 minutes. You will be monitored throughout the entire process until the needles are removed. What Should I Do to Prepare for Treatment? There are a few things you can do to prepare for the appointment if you have scheduled acupuncture treatment at one of our Maryland locations. Be sure to come to the office well-hydrated and avoid drinking coffee or alcohol in the three hours before and following the appointment. It's best to wear comfortable and loose-fitting clothing, so all placement sites are easily accessible. You should be sure to eat a light meal or snack before your appointment. After treatment, it's important to avoid strenuous physical activity for two hours.
