This was followed by the Medical Examination (Seafarers) Convention, 1946 (No. 73). These instruments have now been consolidated into the Maritime Labour Convention, 2006 (MLC, 2006). The laws of most maritime countries require that all seafarers carry a valid medical certificate. The International Maritime Organization's (IMO) International Convention on Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping for Seafarers (STCW), 1978, as amended, states that every seafarer holding a certificate issued under the provisions of the Convention, who is serving at sea, shall also hold a valid medical certificate issued in accordance with the provisions of Regulation I/9 and of Section A-I/9 of the STCW Code. With national fitness standards for seafarers varying widely, the set of international guidelines adopted in 1997 (the Guidelines for Conducting Pre-sea and Periodic Medical Fitness Examinations for Seafarers) was a first attempt towards harmonization. The increasing internationalization of shipping makes such harmonization even more de - sirable. Medical practitioners performing such examinations should have a clear under - standing of the special requirements of seafaring life, as their professional judgement is often critical to the lives of seafarers. All concerned should be able to trust a seafarer's medical certificate as having been issued in accordance with the relevant applicable international standards. These Guidelines have been endorsed by the ILO Governing Body and the IMO Maritime Safety Committee to provide complementary advice to competent authorities, medical practitioners and all stakeholders of the shipping industry on the application of the MLC, 2006, and the STCW Convention, 1978, as amended, with regard to safe - guarding the health of seafarers and promoting safety at sea. These Guidelines supersede the Guidelines for Conducting Pre-sea and Periodic Medical Fitness Examinations for Seafarers, which were published by the ILO and the World Health Organization (WHO) in 1997. Disseminating these Guidelines and ensuring their implementation should contribute to - wards harmonizing the standards for medical examinations of seafarers and improving the quality and effectiveness of the medical care provided to seafarers.5 Contents Preface .............................................................. 3 Part 1.

Purpose and scope of the Guidelines Seafarers are required to undergo medical examinations to reduce risks to other crew members and for the safe operation of the ship, as well as to safeguard their personal health and safety. The MLC, 2006, and the STCW Convention, 1978, as amended, require a seafarer to hold a medical certificate, detail the information to be recorded and indicate certain specific aspects of fitness that need to be assessed. These Guidelines apply to seafarers in accordance with the requirements of the MLC, 2006, and the STCW Convention, 1978, as amended. They revise and replace the Guidelines for Conducting Pre-sea and Periodic Medical Fitness Examinations for Seafarers, published by the ILO and WHO in 1997. When implementing and utilizing these Guidelines, it is essential to ensure that: (i) the fundamental rights, protections, principles, and employment and social rights outlined in Articles III and IV of the MLC, 2006, are respected; (ii) from the point of view of safety of life and property at sea and the protection of the marine environment, seafarers on board ships are qualified and fit for their duties; and (iii) medical certificates genuinely reflect seafarers' state of health, in light of the duties they are to perform, the competent authority shall, after consultation with the shipowners' and seafarers' organizations concerned, in giving due con - sideration to applicable international guidelines referred to in Guideline B.1.2 of the MLC, 2006, prescribe the nature of the medical examination and certificate, as outlined in Standard A.1.2.2 of the MLC, 2006. These Guidelines are intended to provide maritime administrations with an internation - ally recognized set of criteria for use by competent authorities either directly or as the basis for framing national medical examination standards that will be compatible with international requirements. Valid and consistent guidelines should assist medical practi- tioners, shipowners, seafarers' representatives, seafarers and other relevant persons with the conduct of medical fitness examinations of serving seafarers and seafarer candidates. Their purpose is to help administrations establish criteria that will lead to equitable de - cisions about who can safely and effectively perform their routine and emergency duties at sea, provided these are compatible with their individual health-related capabilities. These Guidelines have been developed in order to reduce the differences in the applica - tion of medical requirements and examination procedures and to ensure that the med - ical certificates which are issued to seafarers are a valid indicator of their medical fitness for the duties they will perform. Ultimately, the aim of the Guidelines is to contribute to health and safety at sea. A medical certificate issued in accordance with the requirements of the STCW Convention, 1978, as amended, also meets the requirements of the MLC, 2006.8 Guidelines on the medical examinations of seafarersII. Contents and use of the Guidelines The Guidelines are arranged in the following manner: Part 1 summarizes the purpose and scope of the Guidelines, their contents and the back - ground to their preparation, and identifies the main features of a framework for medical examinations and the issue of a medical certificate to a seafarer. Part 2 provides information relevant to competent authorities to assist with the framing of national regulations that will be compatible with relevant international instruments on the health and fitness of seafarers. Part 3 provides information relevant to those who are carrying out seafarer medical assessments. This may be used directly or may form the basis for national guidelines for medical practitioners. Part 4 includes a series of appendices on standards for different types of impairing con - ditions, recordkeeping and the contents of the medical certificate.Some parts of the Guidelines are more appropriate for competent authorities than for individual medical practitioners, and vice versa. Nevertheless, it is suggested that the whole of the Guidelines be taken into consideration to ensure that all topics and infor - mation are taken into account. The Guidelines are designed as a tool to enhance med - ical examinations and make them more consistent; they cannot and are not intended to replace the professional skill and judgement of recognized medical practitioners. III. Background to the preparation of the Guidelines In 1997, the ILO and WHO published the first international guidelines concerning the medical examinations of seafarers. This has been an invaluable document for maritime authorities, the social partners in the shipping industry and the medical practitioners who conduct medical examinations of seafarers. Since 1997 there have been important changes in the diagnosis, treatment and prognosis of many of the medical conditions that need to be taken into account. The 1997 Guidelines provided detailed information on the conduct of seafarer medical examinations but they did not, with the exception of vision, assist by proposing the appropriate criteria to be used when deciding whether a medical certificate could be issued for other conditions. The need for revision was recognized by a number of maritime authorities, by the social partners and by doctors undertaking seafarer medical examinations. This led to a resolution being adopted by the 94th (Maritime) Session of the International Labour Conference in 2006 recommending that the need for revision should be considered. The IMO, in its comprehensive review of the 1978 STCW Convention and Code, also recog - nized the need to include medical fitness criteria that were relevant to maritime safety, and concluded that the present Guidelines required revision. The ILO and the IMO subsequently agreed to create a joint working group to develop revised Guidelines. IV. Seafarer medical fitness examinations The aim of the medical examination is to ensure that the seafarer being examined is medically fit to perform his or her routine and emergency duties at sea and is not suf - fering from any medical condition likely to be aggravated by service at sea, to render him or her unfit for service or to endanger the health of other persons on board. Wherever possible, any conditions found should be treated prior to returning to work at sea so that 9Part 1. Introduction the full range of routine and emergency duties can be undertaken. If this is not possible, the abilities of the seafarer should be assessed in relation to his or her routine and emer - gency duties and recommendations made on what the seafarer is able to do and whether any reasonable adjustments could enable him or her to work effectively. In some cases, problems will be identified that are incompatible with duties at sea and cannot be rem - edied. Appendices A-E provide information on the disabilities and medical conditions which are not likely to prevent all routine and emergency duties being performed, those which require adaptation or limitation to routine and emergency duties, and those which result in either short-term or longer term unfitness to work at sea. Medical examination findings are used to decide whether to issue a medical certificate to a seafarer. Consistent decision-making needs to be based on the application of criteria for fitness that are applied in a uniform way, both nationally and, because of the global nature of seafaring and marine transport, internationally. These Guidelines provide the basis for establishing national arrangements which are compliant with the relevant inter - national Conventions. The medical certificate is neither a certificate of general health nor a certification of the absence of illness. It is a confirmation that the seafarer is expected to be able to meet the minimum requirements for performing the routine and emergency duties specific to their post at sea safely and effectively during the period of validity of the medical certifi - cate. Hence, the routine and emergency duties must be known to the examining medical practitioner, who will have to establish, using clinical skills, whether the seafarer meets the standards for all anticipated routine and emergency duties specific to their individual post and whether any routine or emergency duties need to be modified to enable them to be performed safely and effectively. The ability to safely and effectively perform routine and emergency duties depends on both a person's current degree of fitness and on the likelihood that they will develop an impairing condition during the validity period of the medical certificate. Criteria for performing routine and emergency duties safely will be higher where the person has critical safety duties, either as part of their routine or in emergencies. Other safety con - sequences also need to be considered, for instance whether a seafarer is suffering from any medical condition likely to be aggravated by service at sea, to render the seafarer unfit for such service, or to endanger the health and safety of other persons on board. The examining medical practitioner should base the decision to issue a medical certifi - cate on whether criteria for minimum performance requirements, as listed in the appen - dices to this document, are met in the following areas: (i) vision (Appendix A), hearing (Appendix B) and physical capabilities (Appendix C); (ii) impairment from the use of medication (Appendix D); (iii) presence or recent history of an illness or condition (Appendix E). The consequences of impairment or illness will depend on the routine and emergency duties and, in some cases, on the distance from shore-based medical facilities. Thus, the examining medical practitioner needs the skills to assess individual fitness in all these areas and the knowledge to relate their findings to the requirements of the individual's routine and emergency duties at sea whenever any limitations in fitness are identified. Competent authorities may, without prejudice to the safety of the seafarers or the ship, differentiate between those persons seeking to start a career at sea and those seafarers already serving at sea and between different functions on board, bearing in mind the different duties of seafarers.11 Part 2. Guidance for competent authorities V. Relevant standards of and guidance from the International Labour Organization, the International Maritime Organization and the World Health Organization The Guidelines have taken into account the appropriate Conventions, Recommendations and other instruments of the ILO, the IMO and WHO. Competent authorities should ensure that medical practitioners are provided with information on other relevant stand - ards which may have been formulated after the date of adoption of these Guidelines. ILO instruments concerning the medical examination and health of seafarers Several earlier Conventions on seafarer working conditions have been consolidated in the MLC, 2006, including requirements for the issue of medical certificates (Regulation 1.2 and associated standards and guidelines) and for medical care on board ship and ashore (Regulation 4.1 and associated standards and guidelines). An important objective of the MLC, 2006, is to safeguard the health and welfare of seafarers. The MLC, 2006, applies to all seafarers except where expressly provided oth - erwise in the Convention (Article II, paragraph 2). IMO instruments concerning medical examination requirements for seafarers The IMO STCW Convention, 1978, as amended, includes requirements for medical ex - aminations and the issue of medical certificates. Earlier versions of the STCW Convention included criteria for vision and physical capa - bility but not for other aspects of medical assessment. Every seafarer holding a certificate issued under the provisions of the STCW Convention who is serving at sea must also hold a valid medical certificate issued in accordance with the provisions of STCW Convention regulation I/9 and of section A-I/9 of the STCW Code. WHO measures concerning seafarers' health and medical services and medical examinations of seafarers The WHO Executive Board and World Health Assembly have adopted resolutions on the health of seafarers (WHA14.51, EB29.R10, WHA15.21, EB37.R25, EB43.R23), re - questing nations to improve the health of seafarers, ameliorate the medical records of seafarers, and make available to seafarers services in each port where the necessary specialized medical care can be provided. Furthermore, in May 1996, a res - olution of the 49th World Health Assembly (WHA49.12) on the WHO Global Strategy for Occupational Health for All and in May 2007, a resolution of the 60th World Health Assembly (WHA60.26), the Global Plan of Action on Workers Health urge countries to 12 Guidelines on the medical examinations of seafarersgive special attention to full occupational health services for the working population, including groups at high risk, such as seafarers. In addition, the following guidelines approved by the WHO Guidelines Review Committee since 2007 include references to medical examinations: the \"Guidelines for treatment of tuberculosis\" (fourth edition); the \"WHO policy on TB infection control in health-care facilities, congregate settings and households\"; the \"Guidelines for using HIV testing technologies in surveillance: selection, evaluation and implementation\" (2009 update); and the \"mhGAP Intervention Guide for mental, neurological and substance use disorders in non-specialized health settings\". VI. Purpose and contents of the medical certificate The MLC, 2006, (Standard A1.2) and the STCW Convention, 1978, as amended, (sec - tion A-I/9, paragraph 7) specify the information that should be included as a minimum on the medical certificate. The detailed content of these Guidelines aligns with these requirements and the other more detailed provisions of the relevant international Conventions, which should be consulted when developing national procedures. The aim of the Guidelines is, wherever possible, to avoid subjectivity and to give objective criteria for decision-making. The period of validity of the medical certificate is indicated in the MLC, 2006, (Standard A1.2, paragraph 7) and the STCW Convention, 1978, as amended, (regulation I/9). Both Conventions specify that the medical certificate will remain in force for a maximum period of two years from the date on which it is granted, unless the seafarer is under the age of 18, in which case the maximum period of validity is one year. Medical certifi - cates issued in accordance with the STCW Convention, 1978, as amended, which expire during the course of a voyage will continue to be in force until the next port of call where the seafarer can obtain a medical certificate from a medical practitioner recognized by the party, provided that the period does not exceed three months. In urgent cases, the administration may permit a seafarer to work without a valid medical certificate until the next port of call where a medical practitioner recognized by the party is available, provided that the period of such permission does not exceed three months and the sea - farer concerned is in possession of an expired medical certificate of recent date. In so far as a medical certificate relates to colour vision, it will remain in force for a period not exceeding six years from the date it is granted. Two years is the period over which fitness should normally be assessed. However, if the examining medical practitioner considers that more frequent surveillance of a condition that may affect health or performance at sea is indicated, a medical certificate of shorter duration should be issued and arrangements made for reassessment. The examining medical practitioner should only issue a medical certificate with a duration of less than two years if they can justify their reasons in a particular case. The medical practitioner should indicate on the medical certificate whether the person is fit for all duties worldwide within their department (deck/engine/catering/other), as indicated on their medical certificate; whether they can undertake all routine and emer - gency duties but are only able to work in specified waters, or whether adaptation of some routine and emergency duties is required. Safety-critical visual capabilities such as lookout duties should be specifically indicated. If the seafarer cannot perform routine and emergency duties safely and effectively and adaptation of duties is not possible, the seafarer should be notified that they are \"not fit for duty\". If adaptation is possible then they should be notified that they are \"fit for duty with limitations\". The notification must be accompanied by an explanation of the seafarer's right to appeal as provided in section IX.13Part 2. Guidance for competent authorities Where illnesses and injuries may impair the ability of a seafarer with a valid medical certificate to perform routine and emergency duties safely, their current fitness may need to be assessed. Such examinations may be considered in various circumstances such as more than 30 days incapacitation, disembarkation for medical reasons, hospital admis - sion or requirement for new medication. Their current medical certificate may be revised accordingly. Before training commences, it is advantageous for any person who intends to subse - quently work at sea to be medically examined to confirm that they meet the required medical fitness standards. VII. Right to privacy All persons involved in the conduct of medical examinations, including those who come into contact with medical examination forms, laboratory results and other medical in - formation, should ensure the right to privacy of the examinee. Medical examination reports should be marked as confidential and so treated, and all medical data collected from a seafarer should be protected. Medical records should only be used for deter - mining the fitness of the seafarer for work and for enhancing health care; they should not be disclosed to others without prior written informed consent from the seafarer. Personal medical information should not be included on medical certificates or other documents made available to others following the medical examination. The seafarer should have the right of access to and receipt of a copy of his/her personal medical data. VIII. Recognition of medical practitioners The competent authority should maintain a list of recognized medical practitioners to conduct medical examinations of seafarers and issue medical certificates. The compe - tent authority should consider the need for medical practitioners to be personally inter - viewed and for clinic facilities to be inspected before authorization to conduct medical examinations of seafarers is given. A list of medical practitioners recognized by the com - petent authority should be made available to competent authorities in other countries, companies and seafarers' organizations on request. The competent authority, when developing guidance for the conduct of medical fitness examinations, should take into consideration that general medical practitioners may need more detailed guidance than medical practitioners with competence in maritime health. In addition, the provision of an expert helpline can aid decision-making on novel or complex problems and can be a source of information that may be used to improve the quality of assessments. The names of any medical practitioners whose recognition has been withdrawn during the previous 24 months should continue to be included, with a note to the effect that they are no longer recognized by the competent authority to conduct seafarers' medical examinations. A medical practitioner so recognized by the competent authority: (i) should be a qualified medical practitioner currently accredited by the medical registration authority for the place where they are working; (ii) should be experienced in general and occupational medicine or maritime occu - pational medicine; (iii) should have knowledge of the living and working conditions on board ships and the job demands on seafarers in so far as they relate to the effects of health 14 Guidelines on the medical examinations of seafarersproblems on fitness for work, gained wherever possible through special instruc - tion and through knowledge based on personal experience of seafaring; (iv) should have facilities for the conduct of examinations that are conveniently sit - uated for access by seafarers and enable all the requirements of the medical fitness examination to be met and conducted with respect for confidentiality, modesty and cleanliness; (v) should be provided with written guidance on the procedures for the conduct of medical examinations of seafarers, including information on appeals procedures for persons denied a medical certificate as a result of an examination; (vi) should understand their ethical position as examining medical practitioners acting on behalf of the competent authority, ensuring that any conflicts with this are recognized and resolved; (vii) should refer any medical problems found, when appropriate, for further investi- gation and treatment, whether or not a seafarer is issued with a medical certifi - cate; and (viii) should enjoy professional independence from shipowners, seafarers, and their representatives in exercising their medical judgement in terms of the medical examination procedures. Those employed by, or contracted to, a maritime em - ployer or crewing agency should have terms of engagement which ensure that an assessment is based on statutory standards. It is further recommended that such medical practitioners: (i) should be provided with information on the standard of competence for sea - farers designated to take charge of medical care on board ships in relevant na - tional laws and regulations; and (ii) should be familiar with the latest edition of the International Medical Guide for Ships , or an equivalent medical guide for use on ships. In the case of a certificate solely concerned with a seafarer's sight and/or hearing, the competent authority may authorize a person other than a recognized medical practi-tioner to test the seafarer and issue such a certificate. In such cases, the qualifications for such authorized persons should be clearly established by the competent authority and such persons should receive information on the appeals procedure described in section IX of these Guidelines. The competent authority should have in place quality assurance procedures to ensure that medical examinations meet the required standards. These should include publicized arrangements for: (i) the investigation of complaints from shipowners, seafarers, and their represen - tatives concerning the medical examination procedures and the authorized med - ical practitioners; (ii) collection and analysis of anonymized information from medical practitioners about the numbers of examinations undertaken and their outcomes; and (iii) the introduction, where practical, of a nationally agreed review and audit pro - gramme for examining medical practitioners' practices and recordkeeping un - dertaken by, or on behalf of, the competent authority. Alternatively, they could endorse appropriate external clinical accreditation arrangements for those un - dertaking seafarers' medical examinations, the results of which would be made available to the authority. Recognized medical practitioners who are found by the competent authority as a result of an appeal, complaint, audit procedure, or other reasons to no longer meet the re - quirements for recognition should have their authorization to conduct seafarers' medical examinations withdrawn.15Part 2. Guidance for competent authorities IX. Appeals procedures The MLC, 2006 (Standard A1.2, paragraph 5) provides that seafarers that have been refused a medical certificate or have had a limitation imposed on their ability to work must be given the opportunity to have a further examination by another independent medical practitioner or by an independent medical referee. The STCW Code, in section A-I/9, paragraph 6, requires parties to the Convention to establish processes and pro - cedures to enable seafarers who do not meet fitness standards or who have had a limi-tation imposed on them to have their case reviewed in line with that party's provisions for appeal. The competent authority may delegate the arrangements for appeals, or part of them, to an organization or authority exercising similar functions in respect of seafarers generally. The appeals procedure may include the following elements: (i) the medical practitioner or referee undertaking the review should have at least the same qualifications as the medical practitioner who conducted the initial examination; (ii) the medical practitioner or referee undertaking the review process should be provided access to other medical experts; (iii) the appeals procedure should not result in unnecessary delays for the seafarer or shipowner; (iv) the same principles of confidentiality called for in the handling of medical re - cords should apply to the appeals procedure; and (v) quality assurance and review procedures should be in place to confirm the con - sistency and appropriateness of decisions taken at appeal.17 Part 3. Guidance to persons authorized by competent authorities to conduct medical examinations and to issue medical certificates X. Role of the medical examination in shipboard safety and health The medical practitioner should be aware of the role of the medical examination in the enhancement of safety and health at sea and in assessing the ability of seafarers to per - form their routine and emergency duties and to live on board: (i) The consequences of impairment from illness while working at sea will depend on the routine and emergency duties of the seafarer and on the distance of the ship from shore-based medical care. Such impairments may adversely affect ship operations, as both the individual and those who provide care will not be avail - able for normal duties. Illness at sea can also put the individual at risk because of the limited care available, as ships' officers only receive basic first-aid and other medical training, and ships are only equipped with basic medical supplies. Medication used by seafarers needs to be carefully assessed as it can lead to im - pairment from side effects that cannot be readily managed at sea. Where medi-cation is essential to control a potentially life-threatening condition, inability to take it may lead to serious consequences. (ii) Infectious diseases may be transmitted to others on board. This is particularly relevant to food-borne infections in those who prepare or handle food or drinks. Screening for relevant infections may be undertaken at the medical examination or at other times. (iii) Limitations to physical capability may affect ability to perform routine and emergency duties (e.g. using breathing apparatus). Such limitations may also make rescue in the event of injury or illness difficult. (iv) The medical examination can be used to provide an opportunity to identify early disease or risk factors for subsequent illness. The seafarer can be advised on preventive measures or referred for further investigation or treatment in order to maximize their opportunities for continuing their career at sea. However, the seafarer should be made aware that it does not replace the need for other clinical contacts or necessarily provide the main focus for advice on health maintenance. (v) If a medical condition is identified, any adverse consequences may be reduced by increasing the frequency of surveillance, limiting duties to those where the medical condition is not relevant or limiting the pattern of voyages to ensure that health care is readily available. (vi) Seafarers need to be able to adjust to living and working conditions on board ships, including the requirement to keep watches at varying times of the day and night, the motion of the vessel in bad weather, the need to live and work within the limited spaces of a ship, to climb and lift weights and to work under a wide variety of weather conditions (see Appendix C, table B-I/9, for examples of relevant physical abilities). (vii) Seafarers should be able to live and work closely with the same people for long periods of time and under occasionally stressful conditions. They should be ca - pable of dealing effectively with isolation from family and friends and, in some cases, from persons of their own cultural background.18 Guidelines on the medical examinations of seafarersShipping operations and shipboard duties vary substantially. For a fuller understanding of the physical demands of particular categories of work on board ships, medical prac - titioners should acquire knowledge of the STCW Convention, 1978, as amended, and appropriate national requirements and should consult the relevant national authority, shipping company and trade union representatives and otherwise endeavour to learn as much as possible about seafaring life. XI. Type and frequency of medical examinations For most medical conditions, the same criteria are appropriate for medical examinations undertaken at all stages of a seafaring career. However, where a condition is present that is likely to worsen in the future and thus limit a cadet's or trainee's ability to undertake the range of duties and assignments that are essential for complete training, there may be less flexibility in the application of fitness standards than for serving seafarers, in order to ensure that all training requirements can be met. Examinations are normally performed every two years. Where there is a health condi - tion that requires more frequent surveillance, they may be performed at shorter inter - vals. It is important to recognize that the requirement for more frequent examinations may limit the ability of a seafarer to obtain employment and lead to additional costs for the seafarer or their employer. If examinations are at intervals of less than two years, they may solely concern the condition under surveillance and, in this case, any reissued medical certificate should not be valid for more than two years from the previous full examination. Any examination requirements of employers or insurers should be distinguished from statutory fitness examinations; the seafarer should be informed if both are being as - sessed at the same time and should consent to this. A medical certificate should be issued if statutory standards are met, irrespective of compliance with any additional employer requirements. Seafarer medical examinations may also provide an opportunity to take measures to correct or mitigate medical conditions which could adversely affect the health of sea - farers and should include measures of a preventive character. Tests necessary to evaluate the occupational exposure at work on board ship may, when appropriate, be performed at the same time as the periodic examinations. XII. Conduct of medical examinations The following suggested procedures do not aim to replace in any way the judgement or experience of the medical practitioner. They will, however, serve as a tool to assist in the conduct of examinations of seafarers. A model medical examination form has been provided in Appendix F. (i) The medical practitioner should determine whether there is any special purpose for the examination (e.g. return after illness or follow-up for continuing health problem) and, if so, should conduct the examination accordingly. (ii) The identity of the seafarer to be examined should be verified. The number of his or her seafarer's book, passport or other relevant identity document should be entered on the examination form. (iii) The examinee's intended position on board ship and, as far as practicable, the physical and mental demands of this work and the anticipated voyage pattern should be established. This may give insights that enable work to continue but 19Part 3. Guidance to persons authorized to conduct medical examinations with limitations based on the nature of the voyage (for example, fit for coastal or harbour service only) and the job to be held. (iv) Information should be collected from the examinee on his or her previous med - ical history. Point-by-point questions on the details of previous diseases and injuries should be asked and the results recorded. Details of other diseases or injuries not covered should also be recorded. After the information is collected, the examinee should sign the form to certify that to the best of his/her know - ledge it is a true statement. An individual should not, however, bear the burden of proof concerning the consequences of illness, past or present, on his or her fitness for work. (v) The examinee's previous medical records, where appropriate and available, should be reviewed. (vi) The physical examination and the necessary additional examinations should be checked and recorded according to set procedures (see Appendix F). (vii) Hearing, eyesight and colour vision, if necessary, should be checked and re - corded. Eyesight should be in compliance with the international eyesight stand - ards for seafarers set out in section A-I/9 of the STCW Code (see Appendix A for vision standards and Appendix B for hearing standards). In examinations, appropriate equipment should be used in the assessment of hearing capacity, visual acuity, colour vision and night blindness, particularly regarding those examinees who will be engaged in lookout duties. (viii) Physical capability should be assessed where the medical examination identifies that it may be limited by an impairment or medical condition (see Appendix C). (ix) Testing for the presence of alcohol and drugs in the course of a medical ex - amination does not form part of these international Guidelines. Where it is per - formed, as a requirement of national authorities or employers, the procedures used should follow national, if available, or international good practice guide - lines. These should provide adequate procedural and ethical safeguards for the seafarer. Consideration should be given to the Guiding Principles on Drug and Alcohol Testing Procedures for Worldwide Application in the Maritime Industry, adopted by the Joint ILO-WHO Committee on the Health of Seafarers (Geneva, 10-14 May 1993), and any subsequent revisions. (x) The application of multiple biochemistry or haematology tests or the use of im - aging techniques applied to all seafarers is not recommended, other than where indicated in Appendices A-E. Such tests should only be used where there is a clinical indication. The validity of any test used for the identification of a relevant medical condition will depend on the frequency with which the condi-tion occurs. Use is a matter for national or local judgement, based on disease incidence and test validity. In addition, decisions about fitness based solely on the results of single or multiple screening tests in the absence of a specific diag - nosis or impairment are of limited predictive value. Unless tests have very high validity, use will result in inappropriate certification of a proportion of those tested. (xi) The medical practitioner should be aware that there are no well-validated tests for the assessment of mental aspects of working ability that are suitable for in - clusion in the medical examinations of seafarers. (xii) The results of the examination should be recorded and assessed to determine if the seafarer is fit for the work which will be undertaken. Appendices A-E contain guidance on medical criteria used to consider whether a seafarer is fit or currently unfit for work at sea. The age and experience of the seafarer to be examined, the nature of the duties to be performed and the type of shipping operation and cargo should be taken into account. 20 Guidelines on the medical examinations of seafarersThere are defined numerical criteria for some aspects of vision (Appendix A) and hearing (Appendix B). Here, decisions on fitness will depend on achieving the levels of percep - tion that are listed, taking note of the explanatory information in the appendices. For other conditions, where such numerical criteria do not exist, the criteria have been clas - sified in three categories, depending on the likelihood of recurrence at different stages and the severity of each condition. Case-by-case assessment is recommended in the appendices where a specialist view on prognosis is needed or where there is considerable diversity in capability or likelihood of recurrence or progression. (A) Incompatible with the reliable performance of routine and emergency duties safely or effectively: (i) expected to be temporary (T), i.e. less than two years; (ii) expected to be permanent (P), i.e. more than two years. For seafarers who are determined by the medical practitioner to have a medical con - dition where such a finding has been made, a medical certificate would not normally be issued. This category means that the medical condition is such that the seafarer may cause a danger to the safety of the vessel or to other persons on board; they may not be able to perform their routine and emergency duties on board; or their health or life may be put at greater risk than would be the case if they were on shore. The cate - gory may be used temporarily until a condition has been treated, returns to normal, or a period without further episodes indicates that the likelihood of recurrence is no longer increased. It may be used on a permanent basis where the seafarer has a condition that can be expected to render them unable to meet the standards in the future. (B) Able to perform some but not all routine and emergency duties or to work in some but not all waters (R): a restricted medical certificate would normally be issued. Increased surveillance needed (L): a medical certificate of limited duration would normally be issued. This category may mean that the seafarer has a condition that requires more fre - quent medical assessment than the two-year normal interval between medical cer - tificates - i.e. a time-limited medical certificate (L). Alternatively, they may be capable of performing the routine and emergency duties required of all seafarers but need some of their own duties to be adapted because they are expected not to be able to perform some of the duties specific to the work they normally undertake. They may also be more likely to suffer serious adverse effects from working in certain climates or beyond a certain distance from onshore medical care. In these cases, the job adaptations needed are specified and the med - ical certificate is restricted (R). Use of this category can enable seafarers to remain working despite the presence of certain health-related impairments. However, it should be used only when clearly in - dicated as it may lead to the possibility that an employer will choose not to engage a seafarer even for duties that are within their capabilities or where duties can readily be adjusted. (C) Able to perform all duties worldwide within designated department: an unrestricted medical certificate of full duration would normally be issued. This category means that the seafarer can be expected to be fit for all duties within their department on board and can fully discharge all routine and emergency duties for the duration of the medical certificate.21Part 3. Guidance to persons authorized to conduct medical examinations If the seafarer is found fit for the work to be performed, the medical certificate should be issued. Any restrictions concerning work (i.e. the job the seafarer will perform, the trade area, the time limit or other considerations) should be reflected on the medical certificate in the description of the work he or she is fit to undertake. Further information on the medical certificate is provided in Appendix G. If the seafarer is found temporarily or permanently unfit for service or has limitations placed on their duties, he or she should be given an explanation of the reasons and should be advised of the right to appeal and on how to make an appeal. Additional guidance on appeals procedures is provided in section IX of these Guidelines. If \"temporarily unfit\", advice should be given on the need to undergo additional tests, to obtain opinions from specialists or to complete dental or other treatment, rehabilitation and/or appropriate medical care. The seafarer should be informed when to return for another examination. As appropriate, the seafarer should be counselled on lifestyle (limiting alcohol intake, stopping smoking, modifying diet, losing weight, etc.) and on the dangers of and methods of prevention of malaria, hepatitis, HIV/AIDS and other communicable diseases. Printed health educational materials on drug and alcohol abuse prevention, smoking cessation, diet, communicable diseases prevention, etc., should also be provided, if available. The medical examination records should be clearly marked as confidential and retained, according to national regulations, in the custody of the health establishment where the medical certificate was issued. The file should be kept confidential and should not be used for any purpose other than facilitating the treatment of seafarers and should be made available only to persons duly authorized in accordance with national data pro - tection laws. Relevant information on his/her health should be given to the seafarer on request and the seafarer should be advised to take it to the next medical examination or when he or she is treated for an illness or injury. If possible, a card indicating blood type, any serious allergies and other vital information should also be given to the seafarer to fa - cilitate emergency treatment. A copy of the medical certificate should be kept in the files of the health institution in which it was issued.23 Appendix A Vision standards Testing All tests needed to determine the visual fitness of a seafarer are to be reliably performed by a competent person and use procedures recognized by the relevant national authority. Quality assurance of vision-testing procedures at a person's first seafarer examination is particularly important to avoid inappropriate career decisions; competent authorities may wish to specify this in detail: - Distance vision should be tested using Snellen test type or equivalent. - Near vision should be tested with reading test type. - Colour vision should be tested by colour confusion plates (Ishihara or equivalent). Supplementary investigations such as lantern tests may be used when appropriate (see the International Recommendations for Colour Vision Requirements for Transport of the International Commission on Illumination (CIE-143-2001, including any sub - sequent versions)). The use of colour-correcting lenses will invalidate test results and should not be permitted. - Visual fields may initially be assessed using confrontation tests (Donders, etc.) and any indication of limitation or the presence of a medical condition where visual field loss can occur should lead to more detailed investigation. - Limitations to night vision may be secondary to specific eye diseases or may follow ophthalmological procedures. They may also be noted during other tests or found as a result of limitations to low-contrast vision testing. Specialist assessment should be undertaken if reduced night vision is suspected. Visual correction Medical practitioners should advise persons required to use spectacles or contact lenses to perform duties that they should have a spare pair or pairs, as required, conveniently available on board the ship. Additional guidance If laser refractive surgery has been undertaken, recovery should be complete and the quality of visual performance, including contrast, glare sensitivity and the quality of night vision, should have been checked by a specialist in ophthalmology. All seafarers should achieve the minimum eyesight standard of 0.1 unaided in each eye (STCW Code, section B-I/9, paragraph 10). This standard may also be relevant to other seafarers to ensure visual capability under emergency conditions when visual correction may be lost or damaged. Seafarers not covered by the STCW Convention's eyesight standards should have vision sufficient to perform their routine and emergency duties safely and effectively.24 Guidelines on the medical examinations of seafarersSTCW Code table A-I/9: Minimum in-service eyesight standards blindness 4Diplopia (double vision) aided or unaided I/11 II/1II/2II/3II/4 II/5 deck officers and ratings required to undertake look-out duties0.5 20.5 Vision required for ship's navigation (e.g. chart and nautical publication reference, use of bridge instrumentation and equipment, and identifi - cation of aids to navigation)See Note 6Normal visual fieldsVision required to perform all necessary functions in darkness without compromiseNo significant condition evident I/11III/1 III/2 III/3III/4III/5III/6III/7 VII/2All engineer officers, electro-technical officers, electro-tech - nical ratings and ratings or others forming part of an engine-room watch0.4 50.4 5Vision required to read in - struments in close proximity, to operate equipment, and to identify systems/components as necessarySee Note 7Sufficient visual fieldsVision required to perform all necessary functions in darkness without compromiseNo significant condition evident I/11IV/2GMDSS radio operators0.4 0.4 Vision required to read in - struments in close proximity, to operate equipment, and to identify systems/components as necessarySee Note 7Sufficient visual fieldsVision required to perform all necessary functions in darkness without compromiseNo significant condition evident Notes: 1 Values given in Snellen decimal notation. 2 A value of at least 0.7 in one eye is recommended to reduce the risk of undetected underlying eye disease. 3 As defined in the International Recommendations for Colour Vision Requirements for Transport by the Commission Internationale de l'Eclairage (CIE-143-2001, including any subsequent versions). 4 Subject to assessment by a clinical vision specialist where indicated by initial examination findings. 5 Engine department personnel shall have a combined eyesight vision of at least 0.4. 6 CIE colour vision standard 1 or 2. 7 CIE colour vision standard 1, 2 or 3.25 Appendix B Hearing standards Testing Hearing capacity for seafarers apart from those identified below should be an average of at least 30 dB (unaided) in the better ear and an average of 40 dB (unaided) in the less good ear within the frequencies 500, 1,000, 2,000 and 3,000 Hz (approximately equiva - lent to speech-hearing distances of 3 metres and 2 metres, respectively). It is recommended that hearing examinations should be made by a pure tone audiometer. Alternative assessment methods using validated and standardized tests that measure im - pairment to speech recognition are also acceptable. Speech and whisper testing may be useful for rapid practical assessments. It is recommended that those undertaking deck/bridge duties are able to hear whispered speech at a distance of 3 metres. Hearing aids are only acceptable in serving seafarers where it has been confirmed that the individual will be capable of safely and effectively performing the specific routine and emergency duties required of them on the vessel that they serve on throughout the period of their medical certificate. This may well require access to a back-up hearing aid and sufficient batteries and other consumables. Arrangements need to be in place to ensure that they will be reliably aroused from sleep in the event of an emergency alarm. If noise-induced hearing loss is being assessed as part of a health surveillance pro - gramme, different criteria and test methods will be required.It is recommended that national authorities indicate which tests for hearing are to be used, based on national audiological practices, using the above thresholds as criteria. Procedures should include the methods to be adopted in deciding if the use of a hearing aid is acceptable. 26 Guidelines on the medical examinations of seafarersAppendix C Physical capability requirements Introduction The physical capability requirements for work at sea vary widely and have to take ac - count of both routine and emergency duties. The functions that may require assessment include: - strength; - stamina; - flexibility; - balance and coordination; - size - compatible with entry into confined areas; - exercise capacity - heart and respiratory reserve; and - fitness for specific tasks - wearing breathing apparatus. Medical conditions and physical capability Limitations may arise from a range of conditions, such as:- high or low body mass/obesity; - severely reduced muscle mass; - musculoskeletal disease, pain or limitations to movement; - a condition following an injury or surgery; - lung disease; - heart and blood vessel disease; and - some neurological diseases. Physical capability assessment Physical capability testing should be undertaken when there is an indication for it, for instance because of the presence of one of the above conditions or because of other con - cerns about a seafarer's physical capabilities. The aspects that are tested will depend on the reasons for doing it. Table B-I/9 gives recommendations for physical abilities to be assessed for those seafarers covered by the STCW Convention, 1978, as amended, based on the tasks undertaken at sea. The following approaches may be used to assess whether the requirements in Table B-I/9 are met: - Observed ability to do routine and emergency duties in a safe and effective way. - Tasks that simulate normal and emergency duties. - Assessment of cardio-respiratory reserve, including spirometry and ergometric tests. This will predict maximum exercise capacity and hence the seafarer's ability to per - form physically demanding work. A large reserve will also indicate that heart and lung performance is less likely to be compromised in the next few years. The bench - mark test is maximum oxygen uptake (VO2 max). This requires dedicated equipment. 27Appendix C Step tests such as the Chester or the Harvard, are simpler alternatives, which may be used for screening. If step tests are abnormal, they should be further validated (e.g. VO2 max or treadmill stress tests). - Informal testing of reserve, for instance climbing three to six flights of stairs and assessing any distress, plus the speed of pulse rate decline on stopping. This is not readily reproducible but can be used for repeat assessment at the same location by the same medical practitioner. - Clinical assessment of strength, mobility, coordination, etc. Additional information may come from activities recently or regularly undertaken, as described by the seafarer, such as: - physically demanding duties on the vessel, e.g. carrying weights or handling mooring equipment; - attendance at a physically demanding course within the last two years, e.g. firefighting, helicopter escape or STCW basic training; and - a confirmed personal pattern of regular strenuous exercise. Interpretation of results (1) Is there any evidence that the seafarer is not able to perform their routine and emer - gency duties effectively? (2) Are there any observed limitations to strength, flexibility, stamina or coordination? (3) What is the outcome of any test for cardio-respiratory reserve? (i) Test performance limited by shortness of breath, musculoskeletal or other pain, or exhaustion. Causes need to be investigated and taken into account in deter - mining fitness. (ii) Unable to complete test. (iii) Completed but stressed or with poor recovery after stopping. (iv) Completed to good or average standard. (4) Discuss subjective feelings during the test with the subject and also go over ex - periences of fitness and capability when doing normal tasks and emergency drills. Obtain corroboration from others if performance at work uncertain. Decision-making Information from a range of sources may be required and many of these are not easily accessed in the course of a medical examination: (1) Is there any indication that physical capability may be limited (e.g. stiffness, obesity or history of heart disease)? (i) No - do not test. (ii) Yes - consider what tests or observations will enable the seafarer's capability to perform their routine and emergency duties to be determined. Go to (2). (2) Do the test results indicate that capabilities may be limited? (i) No - provided there are no underlying conditions that affect conduct of assess - ment. Able to perform all duties worldwide within designated department. (ii) Yes - but duties can be modified to enable safe working, without putting excess responsibilities on others. Able to perform some but not all duties (R). (iii) Yes - but cause of limitation can be remedied. Incompatible with reliable per - formance of essential duties safely or effectively (T). (iv) Yes - but cause of limitation cannot be remedied. Incompatible with reliable performance of essential duties safely or effectively (P).28 Guidelines on the medical examinations of seafarersTable B-I/9: Assessment of minimum entry level and in-service physical abilities for seafarers \u00b3 Shipboard task, function, event or condition 3Related physical ability A medical examiner should be satisfied that the candidate: 4 Routine movement around vessel: - on moving deck - between levels - between compartments Note 1 applies to this row Maintain balance and move with agility Climb up and down vertical ladders and stairways Step over coamings (e.g. Load Line Convention requires coamings to be 600 mm high) Open and close watertight doors Has no disturbance in sense of balance Does not have any impairment or disease that prevents relevant movements and physical activities Is, without assistance, 5 able to: - climb vertical ladders and stairways - step over high sills - manipulate door closing systems Routine tasks on board: - use of hand tools - movement of ship's stores - overhead work - valve operation - standing a four-hour watch - working in confined spaces - responding to alarms, warnings and instructions - verbal communication Note 1 applies to this row Strength, dexterity and stamina to manipulate mechanical devices Lift, pull and carry a load (e.g. 18 kg) Reach upwards Stand, walk and remain alert for an extended period Work in constricted spaces and move through restricted openings (e.g. SOLAS regulation 11-I/3-6.5.1 requires openings in cargo spaces and emer - gency escapes to have the minimum dimensions of 600 mm \u00d7 600 mm) Visually distinguish objects, shapes and signals Hear warnings and instructions Give a clear spoken description Does not have a defined impairment or diag - nosed medical condition that reduces ability to perform routine duties essential to the safe operation of the vessel Has ability to:- work with arms raised - stand and walk for an extended period - enter confined space - fulfil eyesight standards (table A-I/9) - fulfil hearing standards set by competent authority or take account of international guidelines - hold normal conversation Emergency duties 6 on board: - escape - firefighting- evacuation Note 2 applies to this row Don a lifejacket or immersion suit Escape from smoke-filled spaces Take part in fire-fighting duties, including use of breathing apparatus Take part in vessel evacuation procedures Does not have a defined impairment or diag - nosed medical condition that reduces ability to perform emergency duties essential to the safe operation of the vessel Has ability to:- don lifejacket or immersion suit - crawl - feel for differences in temperature - handle fire-fighting equipment - wear breathing apparatus (where required as part of duties) Notes: 1 Rows 1 and 2 of the above table describe: (a) ordinary shipboard tasks, functions, events and conditions; (b) the corresponding physical abilities which may be considered necessary for the safety of a seafarer, other crew members and the ship; and (c) high-level criteria for use by medical practitioners assessing medical fitness, bearing in mind the different duties of seafarers and the nature of shipboard work for which they will be employed. 2 Row 3 of the above table describes: (a) emergency shipboard tasks, functions, events and conditions; (b) the corresponding physical abilities which should be considered necessary for the safety of a seafarer, other crew members and the ship; and (c) high-level criteria for use by medical practitioners assessing medical fitness, bearing in mind the different duties of seafarers and the nature of shipboard work for which they will be employed. 3 This table is not intended to address all possible shipboard conditions or potentially disqualifying medical conditions. Parties should specify physical abilities applicable to the category of seafarers (such as \"deck officer\" and \"engine rating\"). The special circumstances of individuals and for those who have specialized or limited duties should receive due consideration. 4 If in doubt, the medical practitioner should quantify the degree or severity of any relevant impairment by means of objective tests, whenever appropriate tests are available, or by referring the candidate for further assessment. 5 The term \"assistance\" means the use of another person to accomplish the task. 6 The term \"emergency duties\" is used to cover all standard emergency response situations such as abandon ship or firefighting as well as the procedures to be followed by each seafarer to secure personal survival.29 Appendix D Fitness criteria for medication use Introduction Medication can play an important part in enabling seafarers to continue to work at sea. Some have side effects that can affect safe and effective performance of duties and some have other complications that will increase the likelihood of illness at sea. This appendix is only concerned with continuing prescribed medication use that is iden - tified at the medical examination. Ship operators need policies in place to reduce the impairing effects from short-term use of prescribed medication or the use of over-the- counter preparations. The use of oral medication at sea may be prevented by nausea and vomiting, and illness may arise if an oral medication is used to suppress the harmful effects of a condition (e.g. epilepsy) or if it is used to replace essential body chemicals (e.g. hormones). The examining medical practitioner will need to assess the known adverse effects of each medication used and the individual's reaction to it. The use of specific medication for some conditions listed in Appendix E is noted with the condition. If medication is clinically essential for the effective control of a condition, e.g. insulin, anticoagulants and medication for mental health conditions, it is dangerous to stop it in an attempt to be fit for work at sea. The medical practitioner should be alert to the need for the seafarer to have written documentation for the use of their medications. This should be in a form that can be shown to any official who may question the presence of the medication on board. This is particularly important for those medications that are legally prescribed controlled drugs or those drugs which may be abused. Medications that can impair routine and emergency duties (1) Medication affecting the central nervous system functions (e.g. sleeping tablets, an - tipsychotics, some analgesics, some anti-anxiety and anti-depression treatments and some antihistamines). (2) Agents that increase the likelihood of sudden incapacitation (e.g. insulin, some of the older anti-hypertensives and medications predisposing to seizures). (3) Medication impairing vision (e.g. hyoscine and atropine). Medications that can have serious adverse consequences for the user while at sea (1) Bleeding from injury or spontaneously (e.g. warfarin); individual assessment of like - lihood needed. Anticoagulants such as warfarin or dicoumarin normally have a likelihood of complications that is incompatible with work at sea but, if coagulation values are stable and closely monitored, work that is near to onshore medical facil - ities and that does not carry an increased likelihood of injury may be considered. 30 Guidelines on the medical examinations of seafarers(2) Dangers from cessation of medication use (e.g. metabolic replacement hormones including insulin, anti-epileptics, anti-hypertensives and oral anti-diabetics). (3) Antibiotics and other anti-infection agents. (4) Anti-metabolites and cancer treatments. (5) Medications supplied for use at individual discretion (asthma treatments and anti - biotics for recurrent infections). Medications that require limitation of period at sea because of surveillance requirements A wide range of agents, such as anti-diabetics, anti-hypertensives and endocrine replacements. Issue of medical certificates Incompatible with the reliable performance of routine and emergency duties safely or effectively: - on the recommendation of the examining medical practitioner, based on reliable in - formation about severe impairing side effects; - oral medication where there are life-threatening consequences if doses are missed because of sickness; - evidence indicating the likelihood of cognitive impairment when taken as prescribed; - established evidence of severe adverse effects likely to be dangerous at sea, e.g. anticoagulants. Able to perform some but not all duties or to work in some but not all waters: (R): medication can cause adverse effects but these only develop slowly, hence work in coastal waters will allow access to medical care. (L): surveillance of medication effectiveness or side effects needed more frequently that full duration of medical certificate (see guidelines on individual conditions in Appendix E). Able to perform all duties worldwide within designated department: No impairing side effects; no requirements for regular surveillance of treatment.31 Appendix E Fitness criteria for common medical conditions Introduction The medical practitioner should bear in mind that it is not possible to develop a compre - hensive list of fitness criteria covering all possible conditions and the variations in their presentation and prognosis. The principles underlying the approach adopted in the table below may often be extrapolated to conditions not covered by it. Decisions on fitness when a medical condition is present depend on careful clinical assessment and analysis and the following points need to be considered whenever a decision on fitness is taken: - The recommendations in this appendix are intended to allow some flexibility of inter - pretation while being compatible with consistent decision-making that aims to main - tain safety at sea. - The medical conditions listed are common examples of those that may render sea - farers unfit. The list can also be used to determine appropriate limitations to fitness. The criteria given can only provide guidance for physicians and should not replace sound medical judgement. - The implications for working and living at sea vary widely, depending on the natural history of each condition and the scope for treatment. Knowledge about the condition and an assessment of its features in the individual being examined should be used to reach a decision on fitness. The table in this appendix is laid out as follows: Column 1: WHO International Classification of Diseases, 10th revision (ICD-10). Codes are listed as an aid to analysis and, in particular, international compilation of data. Column 2: The common name of the condition or group of conditions, with a brief statement on its relevance to work at sea. Column 3: The guideline recommending when work at sea is unlikely to be indicated, either temporarily or permanently. This column should be consulted first when the table is being used to aid decisions about fitness. Column 4: The guideline recommending when work at sea may be appropriate but when restriction of duties or monitoring at intervals of less than two years is likely to be appropriate. This column should be consulted if the seafarer does not fit the criteria in column 3. Column 5: The guideline recommending when work at sea within a seafarer's desig - nated department is likely to be appropriate. This column should be con - sulted if the seafarer does not fit the criteria in columns 3 or 4. For some conditions, one or more columns are either not relevant or are not an appro - priate certification category. These are identified by the term \"Not applicable\".32 Guidelines on the medical examinations of seafarers ICD-10 (diagnostic codes)Condition (justification for criteria)Incompatible with reliable performance of routine and emergency duties safely or effectively - expected to be temporary (T) - expected to be permanent (P)Able to perform some but not all duties or to work in some but not all waters (R) Increased frequency of surveillance needed (L)Able to perform all duties worldwide within designated department A00-B99 Infections A00-09 Gastrointestinal infection Transmission to others, recurrenceT - If detected while onshore (current symptoms or awaiting test results on carrier status); or con - firmed carrier status until elimination demonstratedNot applicable Non-catering department: When satisfactorily treated or resolved Catering department: Fitness decision to be based on medical advice - bacteriological clearance may be required A15-16 Pulmonary TB Transmission to others, recurrenceT - Positive screening test or clinical history, until investigated If infected, until treatment stabilized and lack of infectivity confirmed P - Relapse or severe residual damageNot applicable Successful completion of a course of treatment in accordance with WHO Treatment of Tuberculosis guidelines A50-64 Sexually transmissible infections Acute impairment, recurrenceT - If detected while onshore, until diagnosis con - firmed, treatment initiated and impairing symptoms resolved P - Untreatable impairing late complicationsR - Consider near coastal if oral treatment regime in place and symptoms non-incapacitatingOn successful completion of treatment B15 Hepatitis A Transmissible by food or water contaminationT - Until jaundice resolved and liver function tests returned to normalNot applicable On full recovery B16-19 Hepatitis B, C, etc. Transmissible by contact with blood or other bodily fluids.

If in doubt, obtain advice or consider restriction and referral to referee47Appendix ENotes: * Recurrence rates: Where the terms very low, low and moderate are used for the excess likelihood of a recurrence. These are essentially clinical judgements but, for some conditions, quantitative evidence on the likelihood of recurrence is available. Where this is available, e.g. for seizure and cardiac events, it may indicate the need for additional investigations to determine an individual's excess likelihood of a recurrence. Quantitative recurrence levels approximate to: - Very low: recurrence rate less than 2 per cent per year; - Low: recurrence rate 2-5 per cent per year; - Moderate: recurrence rate 5-20 per cent per year. ** Asthma severity definitions: Childhood asthma: - Mild: Onset age > ten, few or no hospitalizations, normal activities between episodes, controlled by inhaler therapy alone, remission by age 16, normal lung function. - Moderate : Few hospitalizations, frequent use of reliever inhaler between episodes, interference with normal exercise activity, remission by age 16, normal lung function. - Severe : Frequent episodes requiring treatment to be made more intensive, regular hospitalization, frequent oral or IV steroid use, lost schooling, abnormal lung function. Adult asthma: Asthma may persist from childhood or start over the age of 16. There is a wide range of intrinsic and external causes for asthma developing in adult life. In late-entry recruits with a history of adult onset asthma, the role of specific allergens, including those causing occupational asthma, should be investigated. Less specific inducers such as cold, exercise and respiratory infection also need to be considered. All can affect fitness for work at sea.- Mild intermittent asthma : Infrequent episodes of mild wheezing occurring less than once every two weeks, readily and rapidly relieved by beta agonist inhaler. - Mild asthma : Frequent episodes of wheezing requiring use of beta agonist inhaler or the introduction of a corticosteroid inhaler. Taking regular inhaled steroids (or steroid/long-acting beta agonists) may effectively eliminate symptoms and the need for use of beta agonist treatment. - Exercise-induced asthma : Episodes of wheezing and breathlessness provoked by exertion, especially in the cold. Episodes may be effectively treated by inhaled steroids (or steroid/long-acting beta agonist) or other oral medication. - Moderate asthma : Frequent episodes of wheezing despite regular use of inhaled steroid (or steroid/long acting beta agonist) treatment requiring continued use of frequent beta agonist inhaler treatment, or the addition of other medication, occasional requirement for oral steroids. - Severe asthma : Frequent episodes of wheezing and breathlessness, frequent hospitalization, frequent use of oral steroid treatment.48 Guidelines on the medical examinations of seafarersAppendix F Suggested format for recording medical examinations of seafarers Name (last, first, middle): Date of birth (day/month/year): / / Sex: Male Female Home address: Method of confirmation of identity, e.g. Passport No./Seafarer's book No. or other relevant identity document No.: Department (deck/engine/radio/food handling/other): Routine and emergency duties (if known): Type of ship (e.g. container, tanker, passenger): Trade area (e.g. coastal, tropical, worldwide): Examinee's personal declaration (Assistance should be offered by medical staff) Have you ever had any of the following conditions?

Seafarers shall not work on a ship unless they are certified as medically fit to perform their duties. 2. Exceptions can only be permitted as prescribed in the Code. Standard A1.2 - Medical certificate 1. The competent authority shall require that, prior to beginning work on a ship, sea - farers hold a valid medical certificate attesting that they are medically fit to perform the duties they are to carry out at sea. 2. In order to ensure that medical certificates genuinely reflect seafarers' state of health, in light of the duties they are to perform, the competent authority shall, after con - sultation with the shipowners' and seafarers' organizations concerned, and giving due consideration to applicable international guidelines referred to in Part B of this Code, prescribe the nature of the medical examination and certificate. 3. This Standard is without prejudice to the International Convention on Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping for Seafarers, 1978, as amended (STCW). A medical certificate issued in accordance with the requirements of STCW shall be accepted by the competent authority, for the purpose of regulation 1.2. A medical certificate meeting the substance of those requirements, in the case of seafarers not covered by STCW, shall similarly be accepted. 4. The medical certificate shall be issued by a duly qualified medical practitioner or, in the case of a certificate solely concerning eyesight, by a person recognized by the competent authority as qualified to issue such a certificate. Practitioners must enjoy full professional independence in exercising their medical judgement in undertaking medical examination procedures. 5. Seafarers that have been refused a certificate or have had a limitation imposed on their ability to work, in particular with respect to time, field of work or trading area, shall be given the opportunity to have a further examination by another independent medical practitioner or by an independent medical referee. 6. Each medical certificate shall state in particular that: (a) the hearing and sight of the seafarer concerned, and the colour vision in the case of a seafarer to be employed in capacities where fitness for the work to be per - formed is liable to be affected by defective colour vision, are all satisfactory; and (b) the seafarer concerned is not suffering from any medical condition likely to be aggravated by service at sea or to render the seafarer unfit for such service or to endanger the health of other persons on board.55Appendix H 7. Unless a shorter period is required by reason of the specific duties to be performed by the seafarer concerned or is required under STCW: (a) a medical certificate shall be valid for a maximum period of two years unless the seafarer is under the age of 18, in which case the maximum period of validity shall be one year; (b) a certification of colour vision shall be valid for a maximum period of six years. 8. In urgent cases the competent authority may permit a seafarer to work without a valid medical certificate until the next port of call where the seafarer can obtain a medical certificate from a qualified medical practitioner, provided that: (a) the period of such permission does not exceed three months; and (b) the seafarer concerned is in possession of an expired medical certificate of recent date. 9. If the period of validity of a certificate expires in the course of a voyage, the certifi - cate shall continue in force until the next port of call where the seafarer can obtain a medical certificate from a qualified medical practitioner, provided that the period shall not exceed three months. 10. The medical certificates for seafarers working on ships ordinarily engaged on inter - national voyages must as a minimum be provided in English. Guideline B1.2 - Medical certificate Guideline B1.2.1 - International guidelines 1. The competent authority, medical practitioners, examiners, shipowners, seafarers' representatives and all other persons concerned with the conduct of medical fitness examinations of seafarer candidates and serving seafarers should follow the ILO/WHO Guidelines for Conducting Pre-sea and Periodic Medical Fitness Examinations for Seafarers , including any subsequent versions, and any other applicable international guidelines published by the International Labour Organization, the International Maritime Organization or the World Health Organization. Regulation 4.1 - Medical care on board ship and ashore Purpose: To protect the health of seafarers and ensure their prompt access to medical care on board ship and ashore 1. Each Member shall ensure that all seafarers on ships that fly its flag are covered by adequate measures for the protection of their health and that they have access to prompt and adequate medical care whilst working on board. 2. The protection and care under paragraph 1 of this Regulation shall, in principle,be provided at no cost to the seafarers. 3. Each Member shall ensure that seafarers on board ships in its territory who are in need of immediate medical care are given access to the Member's medical facilities on shore. 4. The requirements for on-board health protection and medical care set out in the Code include standards for measures aimed at providing seafarers with health pro - tection and medical care as comparable as possible to that which is generally avail - able to workers ashore.56 Guidelines on the medical examinations of seafarersStandard A4.1 - Medical care on board ship and ashore 1. Each Member shall ensure that measures providing for health protection and medical care, including essential dental care, for seafarers working on board a ship that flies its flag are adopted which: (a) ensure the application to seafarers of any general provisions on occupational health protection and medical care relevant to their duties, as well as of special provisions specific to work on board ship; (b) ensure that seafarers are given health protection and medical care as compa - rable as possible to that which is generally available to workers ashore, including prompt access to the necessary medicines, medical equipment and facilities for diagnosis and treatment and to medical information and expertise; (c) give seafarers the right to visit a qualified medical doctor or dentist without delay in ports of call, where practicable; (d) ensure that, to the extent consistent with the Member's national law and practice, medical care and health protection services while a seafarer is on board ship or landed in a foreign port are provided free of charge to seafarers; and (e) are not limited to treatment of sick or injured seafarers but include measures of a preventive character such as health promotion and health education programmes. 2. The competent authority shall adopt a standard medical report form for use by the ships' masters and relevant onshore and on-board medical personnel. The form, when completed, and its contents shall be kept confidential and shall only be used to facilitate the treatment of seafarers. 3. Each Member shall adopt laws and regulations establishing requirements for on-board hospital and medical care facilities and equipment and training on ships that fly its flag. 4. National laws and regulations shall as a minimum provide for the following requirements: (a) all ships shall carry a medicine chest, medical equipment and a medical guide, the specifics of which shall be prescribed and subject to regular inspection by the competent authority; the national requirements shall take into account the type of ship, the number of persons on board and the nature, destination and dur - ation of voyages and relevant national and international recommended medical standards; (b) ships carrying 100 or more persons and ordinarily engaged on international voy - ages of more than three days' duration shall carry a qualified medical doctor who is responsible for providing medical care; national laws or regulations shall also specify which other ships shall be required to carry a medical doctor, taking into account, inter alia, such factors as the duration, nature and conditions of the voyage and the number of seafarers on board; (c) ships which do not carry a medical doctor shall be required to have either at least one seafarer on board who is in charge of medical care and administering medi- cine as part of their regular duties or at least one seafarer on board competent to provide medical first aid; persons in charge of medical care on board who are not medical doctors shall have satisfactorily completed training in medical care that meets the requirements of the International Convention on Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping for Seafarers, 1978, as amended (\"STCW\"); sea - farers designated to provide medical first aid shall have satisfactorily completed training in medical first aid that meets the requirements of STCW; national laws or regulations shall specify the level of approved training required taking into 57Appendix H account, inter alia, such factors as the duration, nature and conditions of the voyage and the number of seafarers on board; and (d) the competent authority shall ensure by a prearranged system that medical advice by radio or satellite communication to ships at sea, including specialist advice, is available 24 hours a day; medical advice, including the onward transmission of medical messages by radio or satellite communication between a ship and those ashore giving the advice, shall be available free of charge to all ships irrespective of the flag that they fly. Guideline B4.1 - Medical care on board ship and ashore Guideline B4.1.1 - Provision of medical care 1. When determining the level of medical training to be provided on board ships that are not required to carry a medical doctor, the competent authority should require that: (a) ships which ordinarily are capable of reaching qualified medical care and medical facilities within eight hours should have at least one designated seafarer with the approved medical first-aid training required by STCW which will enable such persons to take immediate, effective action in case of accidents or illnesses likely to occur on board a ship and to make use of medical advice by radio or satellite communication; and (b) all other ships should have at least one designated seafarer with approved training in medical care required by STCW, including practical training and training in life-saving techniques such as intravenous therapy, which will enable the persons concerned to participate effectively in coordinated schemes for medical assistance to ships at sea, and to provide the sick or injured with a satisfactory standard of medical care during the period they are likely to remain on board. 2. The training referred to in paragraph 1 of this Guideline should be based on the contents of the most recent editions of the International Medical Guide for Ships, the Medical First Aid Guide for Use in Accidents Involving Dangerous Goods, the Document for Guidance - An International Maritime Training Guide , and the medical section of the International Code of Signals as well as similar national guides. 3. Persons referred to in paragraph 1 of this Guideline and such other seafarers as may be required by the competent authority should undergo, at approximately five year intervals, refresher courses to enable them to maintain and increase their knowledge and skills and to keep up-to-date with new developments. 4. The medicine chest and its contents, as well as the medical equipment and medical guide carried on board, should be properly maintained and inspected at regular in - tervals, not exceeding 12 months, by responsible persons designated by the competent authority, who should ensure that the labelling, expiry dates and conditions of storage of all medicines and directions for their use are checked and all equipment func - tioning as required. In adopting or reviewing the ship's medical guide used nation - ally, and in determining the contents of the medicine chest and medical equipment, the competent authority should take into account international recommendations in this field, including the latest edition of the International Medical Guide for Ships , and other guides mentioned in paragraph 2 of this Guideline. 5. Where a cargo which is classified dangerous has not been included in the most recent edition of the Medical First Aid Guide for Use in Accidents Involving Dangerous Goods , the necessary information on the nature of the substances, the risks involved, the necessary personal protective devices, the relevant medical procedures and specific antidotes should be made available to the seafarers. Such specific antidotes and per - sonal protective devices should be on board whenever dangerous goods are carried. 58 Guidelines on the medical examinations of seafarersThis information should be integrated with the ship's policies and programmes on oc - cupational safety and health described in Regulation 4.3 and related Code provisions. 6. All ships should carry a complete and up-to-date list of radio stations through which medical advice can be obtained; and, if equipped with a system of satellite commu - nication, carry an up-to-date and complete list of coast earth stations through which medical advice can be obtained. Seafarers with responsibility for medical care or medical first aid on board should be instructed in the use of the ship's medical guide and the medical section of the most recent edition of the International Code of Signals so as to enable them to understand the type of information needed by the advising doctor as well as the advice received. Guideline B4.1.2 - Medical report form 1. The standard medical report form for seafarers required under Part A of this Code should be designed to facilitate the exchange of medical and related information concerning individual seafarers between ship and shore in cases of illness or injury. Guideline B4.1.3 - Medical care ashore 1. Shore-based medical facilities for treating seafarers should be adequate for the pur - poses. The doctors, dentists and other medical personnel should be properly qualified. 2. Measures should be taken to ensure that seafarers have access when in port to: (a) outpatient treatment for sickness and injury; (b) hospitalization when necessary; and (c) facilities for dental treatment, especially in cases of emergency. 3. Suitable measures should be taken to facilitate the treatment of seafarers suffering from disease. In particular, seafarers should be promptly admitted to clinics and hospitals ashore, without difficulty and irrespective of nationality or religious belief, and, whenever possible, arrangements should be made to ensure, when necessary, continuation of treatment to supplement the medical facilities available to them. Guideline B4.1.4 - Medical assistance to other ships and international cooperation 1. Each Member should give due consideration to participating in international cooper - ation in the area of assistance, programmes and research in health protection and medical care. Such cooperation might cover: (a) developing and coordinating search and rescue efforts and arranging prompt medical help and evacuation at sea for the seriously ill or injured on board a ship through such means as periodic ship position reporting systems, rescue coordination centres and emergency helicopter services, in conformity with the International Convention on Maritime Search and Rescue, 1979, as amended, and the International Aeronautical and Maritime Search and Rescue (IAMSAR) Manual ; (b) making optimum use of all ships carrying a doctor and stationing ships at sea which can provide hospital and rescue facilities; (c) compiling and maintaining an international list of doctors and medical care facil - ities available worldwide to provide emergency medical care to seafarers; (d) landing seafarers ashore for emergency treatment; (e) repatriating seafarers hospitalized abroad as soon as practicable, in accordance with the medical advice of the doctors responsible for the case, which takes into account the seafarer's wishes and needs;59Appendix H (f) arranging personal assistance for seafarers during repatriation, in accordance with the medical advice of the doctors responsible for the case, which takes into account the seafarer's wishes and needs; (g) endeavouring to set up health centres for seafarers to: (i) conduct research on the health status, medical treatment and preventive health care of seafarers; and (ii) train medical and health service staff in maritime medicine; (h) collecting and evaluating statistics concerning occupational accidents, diseases and fatalities of seafarers and integrating and harmonizing the statistics with any existing national system of statistics on occupational accidents and diseases cov - ering other categories of workers; (i) organizing international exchanges of technical information, training material and personnel, as well as international training courses, seminars and working groups; (j) providing all seafarers with special curative and preventive health and medical services in port, or making available to them general health, medical and re - habilitation services; and (k) arranging for the repatriation of the bodies or ashes of deceased seafarers, in accordance with the wishes of the next of kin and as soon as practicable. 2. International cooperation in the field of health protection and medical care for sea - farers should be based on bilateral or multilateral agreements or consultations among Members. Guideline B4.1.5 - Dependants of seafarers 1. Each Member should adopt measures to secure proper and sufficient medical care for the dependants of seafarers domiciled in its territory pending the development of a medical care service which would include within its scope workers generally and their dependants where such services do not exist and should inform the International Labour Office concerning the measures taken for this purpose.60 Guidelines on the medical examinations of seafarersAppendix I Extract from the International Convention on Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping for Seafarers, 1978, as amended Regulation I/9 Medical standards 1. Each Party shall establish standards of medical fitness for seafarers and procedures for the issue of a medical certificate in accordance with the provisions of this regu - lation and of section A-I/9 of the STCW Code. 2. Each Party shall ensure that those responsible for assessing the medical fitness of seafarers are medical practitioners recognized by the Party for the purpose of sea - farer medical examinations, in accordance with the provisions of section A-I/9 of the STCW Code. 3. Every seafarer holding a certificate issued under the provisions of the Convention, who is serving at sea, shall also hold a valid medical certificate issued in accordance with the provisions of this regulation and of section A-I/9 of the STCW Code. 4. Every candidate for certification shall: (1) be not less than 16 years of age; (2) provide satisfactory proof of his/her identity; and (3) meet the applicable medical fitness standards established by the Party. 5. Medical certificates shall remain valid for a maximum period of two years unless the seafarer is under the age of 18, in which case the maximum period of validity shall be one year. 6. If the period of validity of a medical certificate expires in the course of a voyage, then the medical certificate shall continue in force until the next port of call where a medical practitioner recognized by the Party is available, provided that the period shall not exceed three months. 7. In urgent cases the Administration may permit a seafarer to work without a valid medical certificate until the next port of call where a medical practitioner recognized by the Party is available, provided that: (1) the period of such permission does not exceed three months; and (2) the seafarer concerned is in possession of an expired medical certificate of recent date.61 Appendix J Extract from the Seafarers' Training, Certification and Watchkeeping Code Section A-I/9 Medical standards 1. Parties, when establishing standards of medical fitness for seafarers as required by regulation I/9, shall adhere to the minimum in-service eyesight standards set out in table A-I/9 and take into account the criteria for physical and medical fitness set out in paragraph 2. They should also take into account the guidance given in sec - tion B-I/9 of this Code and table B-I/9 regarding assessment of minimum physical abilities. These standards may, to the extent determined by the Party without prejudice to the safety of the seafarers or the ship, differentiate between those persons seeking to start a career at sea and those seafarers already serving at sea and between different func - tions on board, bearing in mind the different duties of seafarers. They shall also take into account any impairment or disease that will limit the ability of the seafarer to effectively perform his/her duties during the validity period of the medical certificate. 2. The standards of physical and medical fitness established by the Party shall ensure that seafarers satisfy the following criteria: (1) have the physical capability, taking into account paragraph 5 below, to fulfil all the requirements of the basic training as required by section A-VI/1, paragraph 2; (2) demonstrate adequate hearing and speech to communicate effectively and detect any audible alarms; (3) have no medical condition, disorder or impairment that will prevent the effective and safe conduct of their routine and emergency duties on board during the va - lidity period of the medical certificate; (4) are not suffering from any medical condition likely to be aggravated by service at sea or to render the seafarer unfit for such service or to endanger the health and safety of other persons on board; and (5) are not taking any medication that has side effects that will impair judgement, balance, or any other requirements for effective and safe performance of routine and emergency duties on board. 3.

Parties, in establishing seafarer medical fitness standards and provisions, should take into account the minimum physical abilities set out in table B-I/9 and the guidance given within this section, bearing in mind the different duties of seafarers. 2. Parties, in establishing seafarer medical fitness standards and provisions, should follow the guidance contained in the ILO-WHO publication Guidelines for Conducting Pre-sea and Periodic Medical Fitness Examinations for Seafarers , including any sub - sequent versions, and any other applicable international guidelines published by the International Labour Organization, the International Maritime Organization or the World Health Organization. 3. Appropriate qualifications and experience for medical practitioners conducting med - ical fitness examinations of seafarers may include occupational health or maritime health qualifications, experience of working as a ship's doctor or a shipping company doctor or working under the supervision of someone with the aforementioned quali-fications or experience.STCW Code table A-I/9: Minimum blindness 4Diplopia (double vision) aided or unaided I/11 II/1II/2II/3II/4 II/5 deck officers and ratings required to undertake look-out duties0.5 20.5 Vision required for ship's navigation (e.g. chart and nautical publication reference, use of bridge instrumentation and equipment, and identifi - cation of aids to navigation)See Note 6Normal visual fieldsVision required to perform all necessary functions in darkness without compromiseNo significant condition evident I/11III/1 III/2 III/3III/4III/5III/6III/7 VII/2All engineer officers, electro-technical officers, electro-tech - nical ratings and ratings or others forming part of an engine-room watch0.4 50.4 5Vision required to read in - struments in close proximity, to operate equipment, and to identify systems/components as necessarySee Note 7Sufficient visual fieldsVision required to perform all necessary functions in darkness without compromiseNo significant condition evident I/11IV/2GMDSS radio operators0.4 0.4 Vision required to read in - struments in close proximity, to operate equipment, and to identify systems/components as necessarySee Note 7Sufficient visual fieldsVision required to perform all necessary functions in darkness without compromiseNo significant condition evident Notes: 1 Values given in Snellen decimal notation. 2 A value of at least 0.7 in one eye is recommended to reduce the risk of undetected underlying eye disease. 3 As defined in the International Recommendations for Colour Vision Requirements for Transport by the Commission Internationale de l'Eclairage (CIE-143-2001, including any subsequent versions). 4 Subject to assessment by a clinical vision specialist where indicated by initial examination findings. 5 Engine department personnel shall have a combined eyesight vision of at least 0.4. 6 CIE colour vision standard 1 or 2. 7 CIE colour vision standard 1, 2 or 3.64 Guidelines on the medical examinations of seafarers4. The premises where medical fitness examinations are carried out should have the fa - cilities and equipment required to carry out medical fitness examinations of seafarers. 5. Administrations should ensure that recognized medical practitioners enjoy full pro - fessional independence in exercising their medical judgement when undertaking med - ical examination procedures. 6. Persons applying for a medical certificate should present to the recognized medical practitioner appropriate identity documentation to establish their identity. They should also surrender their previous medical certificate. 7. Each Administration has the discretionary authority to grant a variance or waiver of any of the standards set out in table B-I/9 hereunder, based on an assessment of a medical evaluation and any other relevant information concerning an individual's adjustment to the condition and proven ability to satisfactorily perform assigned shipboard functions. 8. The medical fitness standards should, so far as possible, define objective criteria with regard to fitness for sea service, taking into account access to medical facilities and medical expertise on board ship. They should, in particular, specify the conditions under which seafarers suffering from potentially life-threatening medical conditions that are controlled by medication may be allowed to continue to serve at sea. 9. The medical standards should also identify particular medical conditions, such as colour blindness, which might preclude seafarers holding particular positions on board ship. 10. The minimum in-service eyesight standards in each eye for unaided distance vision should be at least 0.1.* 11. Persons requiring the use of spectacles or contact lenses to perform duties should have a spare pair or pairs, as required, conveniently available on board the ship. Any need to wear visual aids to meet the required standards should be recorded on the medical fitness certificate issued. 12. Colour vision testing should be in accordance with the International Recommendations for Colour Vision Requirements for Transport , published by the Commission Internationale de l'Eclairage (CIE 143-2001, including any subsequent versions) or equivalent test methods. * Value given in Snellen decimal notation.65Appendix J Table B-I/9: Assessment of minimum entry level and in-service physical abilities for seafarers \u00b3 Shipboard task, function, event or condition 3Related physical ability A medical examiner should be satisfied that the candidate: 4 Routine movement around vessel: - on moving deck - between levels - between compartments Note 1 applies to this row Maintain balance and move with agility Climb up and down vertical ladders and stairways Step over coamings (e.g. Load Line Convention requires coamings to be 600 mm high) Open and close watertight doors Has no disturbance in sense of balance Does not have any impairment or disease that prevents relevant movements and physical activities Is, without assistance, 5 able to: - climb vertical ladders and stairways - step over high sills - manipulate door closing systems Routine tasks on board: - use of hand tools - movement of ship's stores - overhead work - valve operation - standing a four-hour watch - working in confined spaces - responding to alarms, warnings and instructions - verbal communication Note 1 applies to this row Strength, dexterity and stamina to manipulate mechanical devices Lift, pull and carry a load (e.g. 18 kg) Reach upwards Stand, walk and remain alert for an extended period Work in constricted spaces and move through restricted openings (e.g. SOLAS regulation 11-I/3-6.5.1 requires openings in cargo spaces and emer - gency escapes to have the minimum dimensions of 600 mm \u00d7 600 mm) Visually distinguish objects, shapes and signals Hear warnings and instructions Give a clear spoken description Does not have a defined impairment or diag - nosed medical condition that reduces ability to perform routine duties essential to the safe operation of the vessel Has ability to:- work with arms raised - stand and walk for an extended period - enter confined space - fulfil eyesight standards (table A-I/9) - fulfil hearing standards set by competent authority or take account of international guidelines - hold normal conversation Emergency duties 6 on board: - escape - firefighting- evacuation Note 2 applies to this row Don a lifejacket or immersion suit Escape from smoke-filled spaces Take part in fire-fighting duties, including use of breathing apparatus Take part in vessel evacuation procedures Does not have a defined impairment or diag - nosed medical condition that reduces ability to perform emergency duties essential to the safe operation of the vessel Has ability to:- don lifejacket or immersion suit - crawl - feel for differences in temperature - handle fire-fighting equipment - wear breathing apparatus (where required as part of duties) Notes: 1 Rows 1 and 2 of the above table describe: (a) ordinary shipboard tasks, functions, events and conditions; (b) the corresponding physical abilities which may be considered necessary for the safety of a seafarer, other crew members and the ship; and (c) high-level criteria for use by medical practitioners assessing medical fitness, bearing in mind the different duties of seafarers and the nature of shipboard work for which they will be employed. 2 Row 3 of the above table describes: (a) emergency shipboard tasks, functions, events and conditions; (b) the corresponding physical abilities which should be considered necessary for the safety of a seafarer, other crew members and the ship; and (c) high-level criteria for use by medical practitioners assessing medical fitness, bearing in mind the different duties of seafarers and the nature of shipboard work for which they will be employed. 3 This table is not intended to address all possible shipboard conditions or potentially disqualifying medical conditions. Parties should specify physical abilities applicable to the category of seafarers (such as \"deck officer\" and \"engine rating\"). The special circumstances of individuals and for those who have specialized or limited duties should receive due consideration. 4 If in doubt, the medical practitioner should quantify the degree or severity of any relevant impairment by means of objective tests, whenever appropriate tests are available, or by referring the candidate for further assessment. 5 The term \"assistance\" means the use of another person to accomplish the task. 6 The term \"emergency duties\" is used to cover all standard emergency response situations such as abandon ship or firefighting as well as the procedures to be followed by each seafarer to secure personal survival.Seafarers are required to undergo medical examinations to reduce risks to other crew members and for the safe operation of the ship, as well as to safeguard their personal health and safety. The Maritime Labour Convention, 2006, and International Convention on Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping for Seafarers, 1978, as amended, therefore require seafarers to hold medical certificates attesting that they are medically fit to perform the duties they are to carry out at sea. These Guidelines will assist medical practitioners, shipowners, seafarers' representatives, seafarers and other relevant persons with the conduct of medical fitness examinations of serving seafarers and seafarer candidates. They also will help administrations establish criteria that will lead to equitable decisions about who can safely and effectively perform their routine and emergency duties at sea, provided these are compatible with their individual health-related capabilities. They have been developed in order to reduce the differences in the application of medical requirements and examination procedures and to ensure that the medical certificates which are issued to seafarers are a valid indicator of their medical fitness for the duties they will perform. Ultimately, the aim of the Guidelines is to contribute to health and safety at sea.
