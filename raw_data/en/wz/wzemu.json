In our vision for the future, the City of Varberg has unique opportunities. Our goal is clear, and we are acting on it. We are building a community converging around means of public transportation in a rapidly expanding region. The railroad, which has long created a barrier between the seaside and the city centre, will now be relocated into a tunnel underneath the city. To expand on this opportunity we are moving the harbour in order to further free up land for letting the city reclaim its position as a seaside town. In total, the project will result inmore than 500,000m 2of land for development of our future city front. For people living, working or visiting the city of Varberg, the change will dramatically increase the freedom to experiencethe coastline. Places of residency, places for eating and meeting, places to shop and work, etc. - comes as a bonus. Come to Varberg. Share our vision.

Today it also faces a social and political crisis that threatens the very foundations of its existence. The EU now has to regain the trust of its citizens by revitalising its economy. We therefore need to invest in priority policies that have a direct impact on employment, which is the main concern of all Europeans and a lever for boosting domestic demand.The utmost priority is to revitalise European industry. The European Economic and Social Committee, of which I am president, sees this as a way of securing jobs at the local level and of combating the desertication that threatens many European regions. By stating that industry should account for 20% of European GDP ,Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the next European Commission, is moving in the right direction. We must also invest in the future. To be competitive, Europe must support its innovative companies, encourage its researchers to stay and promote the development of high-potential sectors. But it must also invest in another asset - its young, educatedworkforce - by encouraging Member States to make their education and training systems competitive. Learning is therefore an avenue worth exploring more intensively. As regards the Youth Guarantee, this will only be fully eective if it proves its worth on the ground. If the EU is to regain the qualities that made European integration so strong in its early days, it must build on the solidarity that exists between Member States. It must end tax dumping, develop common policies in areas of strategic importance, such as energy, by drawing strength from collective action, and protect the interests of all 28 Member States and not just a few. Europe is rst and foremost about creating a common area that is able to hold its own in an increasingly competitive world. Where external relations are concerned, the European Union must make its voice heard in a way that is distinct and faithful to itsvalues, rather than making free trade its sole priority. This European solidarity is also what links all Europeans. Social Europe must become a reality to ensure that European identity becomes an integral part of people's lives. Let us end the social dumping that creates pock- ets of poverty and becomes a source of xenophobia. Of course, these ambitious priorities will not have the desired impact unless they are carried out on the basis of continual consultation with civil society. Let us pursue the approach started by the Lisbon Treaty.There has never been a greater need for such a process, as the challenge is formidable: to encourage Europeans to turn to Europe once again. This is the key issue for the next European Commission: to embody the courage and willingness to work together to build a common future of prosperity for all. Henri Malosse PresidentEuropean Economic and Social CommitteeIntroduction Welcome to the August edition of Adjacent Government. In this summer issue we focus on an array of topics that are high on the agenda within government. Changes are afoot within the European Commission, with a new President conrmed for the next 5 years - Jean-Claude Junker. The new President has pledged his support for economic growth in order to \"kick Europe out of an unemploymentcrisis.\" Throughout Europe, economic growth and development is a key area that has been debated by many experts and government ocials. In line with this we commence with a Foreword from the President of the European Economic and Social Committee, Henri Malosse. Mr Malosse gives thought to how Europe must invest in the future, and invest in prior ity policies in order to have a direct impact on employment and boost growth and demand. Elsewhere in the publication we turn our attention to the marine industry. In a special focus, an article from Maria Damanaki, European Commission for Marine Aairs and Fisheries outlines the Blue Growth strategy. The importance of the industry is also highlighted in an article from the European Maritime Safety Agency. The health and social care section takes a closer look at healthcare innovation. Vice-President of the European Com-mission Neelie Kroes, Commissionerfor Digital Agenda discusses e-health and its benets for eciency in healthcare. Wound care innovation is another topic we shine the spotlight on, with contributions from the Euro pean Wound Management Association, and the Wound Healing Research Unit at Cardi University. The built environment is a key area that we remain focussed on at Adjacent Government, and editorial features in this edition discuss the urban environ- ment, and the importance of developing sustainable cities throughout Europe. Articles from Johannes Hahn, EU Com missioner for Regional Policy, and Dr Barbara Hendricks, German Minister for the Environment lead the discussions in this area. Hot topics also in this edition include asset management, continuous improvement, volunteering, agriculture, carbon capture and storage, and cardiology. In what seems to be a key year for Europe and its leaders, I do hope you enjoy the articles within, and as always welcome any thoughts you may have.

Vienna is immediately associated with culture, heritage and high quality of life, but this rst impression is incomplete. The Vienna metropolitan region has seen an era of dynamicdevelopment since the political changes of the 1990s. With a population approaching 3 million, it has become a pivotal hub in Central and Eastern Europe.Urban development planning for this region is quite evidently, a challenge. The overall strategy for this important eld of development is called STEP 2025,the Vienna Urban Development Plan, and was recently adopted by the Vienna City Council. Like most successful metropolitan areas, the Vienna region attracts a large number of people, which of course leads to population growth and increasingdiversity. These factors alone result in various demands on infrastructure, housing and job creation.Our strategies for meeting the demands should be intelligent, sustainable and compatible with limited nancial and spatial resources. This is what we invari ably keep in mind when taking urban development decisions. We aim to overcome borders by cooperating closely with our neighbours within the metropolitan region. This is a chance to further improve the way our region is organised. STEP 2025 addresses a multitude of development tasks, and many of them have a highly complex tech nical background. For example, I would like to highlight 2 central aspects that demonstrate theprinciples of our urban development strategy. Vienna is a city of social equity, and we are committed to keeping it this way, based on a concept of public services and social cooperation. We have dened a number of key goals for urban planning so living in Vienna remains attractive for all population groups.Public spaces are to be adapted to new requirements,taking into account various user groups and interests, ranging from children to senior citizens and from sports to general leisure activities. We are further expanding our network of green spaces to supplement the many recreation areas and pockets of natural environment Vienna already has. Our housing policy concentrates on continuing the model of subsidised social housing, while at the same time promoting newhousing developments to make sure there will always be enough homes as the population keeps growing dynamically. This is to prevent price hikes in the rental sector. Moreover, we support walking, cycling and public transport as eco-friendly, healthy and generally aordable ways of getting around in Vienna. The second major aspect I would like to address is our commitment to sustainable urban development. We constantly ask ourselves how life in the city can be planned and organised with the limited resources that are available to us in the long term. This goal inevitably influences our urban planning strategy: new urban neighbourhoods are planned in a compact manner, existing areas are regenerated and, where possible, housing density is increased while maintaining high quality standards. This approach goes hand in hand with the mobility strategy outlined above. A smoothly functioning public transport system in combination with cycling, attractive footpaths and new mobility options ensures people can get around perfectly well without having to buy their own maria.vassilakou@wien.gv.at www.wien.gv.atIf we talk today about our cities, or in particular about the urban environment we live in, we can use statistics to show how we behave within our environment. We explain our living behaviour using graphs to measure our intentions, or we use diagrams to show how our urban behaviors relate to each other. While we might have given quantatative data to our behavior, we don't research the formal understanding of our human environment. While cities are madeout of buildings, streets, parks, and public spaces we hardly talk about its forms. What we neglected to ask ourselves is about the quality of the form we want to live in. The intention of the institute of urban design (ioud) is to develop an expertise on the formal understand- ing of our urban environment within metropolitan areas as well as ourcountryside. What we investigate is the architectural knowledge of our human environment, which gives form to our quantitative data. We call our research 'a research by design', with the intention to investigate new architectural forms of living environ- ments. After all, there is no content without a form. History If we look into the history of urban design and planning, especially in Europe during the 19th and 20th Century, and more recently into the 1st decade of the 21st Century, two essential aspects of urban design and development belonged to each other. One was the understanding of ourspatial behavior through statistics, and the other was to give form to it. When our cities grew during the 19th Century, the grid became its model of urban expansion, and the urban block gave it architectural form. We can see the variation of such urban blocks throughout our cities based on the various cultural differences of land ownership and housing typologies. Within the beginning of the 20th Century - on a free piece of land mainly owned by the city itself - the single standing slab building emerged. This architectural type became the model of our urban settlement before and after the 2nd World War. Both urban forms were highly influenced by the involvement of city and state governments to increase the quality of our living environment. Through late capitalism and definitely within the last 20 years, urban devel- opments are executed by project next to project, development next to development. The question of formbecame replaced by the problem of where investment is needed. Cities have given away the formal control of their cities. What we witness today is what was historically known as the liberal urbanism of the 19th Century, an urban development without formal consciousness. What we need is a research of forms under which our cities evolve. It is the form in which we live in, not its data. Urban living Recently published statistic on the behavior of the Austrian populationForms of living 10within their urban environments, by APA/Statistik Austria, shows tenden- cies became visualised. This can be found nearly anywhere within the European landscape of historically developed modes of inhabitation. While many cities in Austria grew immensely - from 14.1% as in the city of Eisenstadt, 12.9% in Graz to 9.3% in the metropolitan city like Vienna and 8.4% in Innsbruck the city of the alps - small size villages or cities within the immediate distance also exploded in terms of population by up to 30%. There is an enormous magnetic ten-dency, which attracts people towards large urban metropolitan areas, whileat the same time historically estab- lished villages on the countryside empty out. This tendency is similar throughout Europe and even globally; while in Central Europe, within the area of the Alps, this tendency took on a particu- lar form. The villages decreased by twofold: not only did these villages decrease in size and population, but at the same time, their population changed from permanent inhabitants (those that both lived and worked in the village), to temporary inhabitants, like tourists, (second home citizens and weekend dwellers which work orstudy during the week in metropolitan areas and spend their weekends in the village). It can be argued that the village is not sustainable anymore, neither socially nor economically, oreven spatially. It's form as we know it will eventually die. PROFILEAt the same time a new architectural form has emerged within the tourist areas of the Alps, namely the high-rise building. The high-rise emerged as a particular form within densely popu- lated environments like Chicago and New York. The reason for the emer- gence of high rise buildings was not only its potential to increase the den- sity, but to gain maximum profit for the increasing land values within met- ropolitan areas. The urban hotel Today it seems that the architectural form of the high-rise has lost its con- text. Emerging from alpine areas so its real quality can be seen -namely the idea of the high rise building as a hotel containing all the facilities of a city. The high-rise can be seen there- fore as a form of a city, a building that contains the life of a city. One of our recent research projects has been the investigation of the pos- sible merge of a village and the hotel as a model of urbanisation. Our research mainly developed forms of high-dense living environments onthe base of a one family house. While villages are constituted by a large number of single family houses spread along roads, the design chal- lenge was to keep the individual home alive while reducing the related out- door space and the form of access. Such a design investigation has hap- pened many times throughout the history of urban design, and has its precursors in Le Corbusier Villa- Immeubles from 1925 and many research projects within northern European countries during the 1950s to the 1970s, as well as recent projects in Asia, (especially Japan). The intention of the research is to understand urban transforma tion as a problem of form. The forms that are investigated are high dense urban fabrics. These fabrics are not only intended to reintroduce aesthetics into the political consideration whenplanning our cities, but they are the only primaryarchitectural forms that can solve problems of sustainability.In order to live socially, economically, and materially sustainable we need to live in dense urban environments.Univ Prof Peter Trummer Arch.

Nowadays the majority of the European population live in urban areas. Cities form the backbone of our economy and society. Cities are where the economy grows, where jobs arecreated, where we can best ght climate change andwhere scarce resources can be used more eciently. Without cities we will not reach the ambitious goals we have set ourselves on tackling pollution, unemployment and creating more prosperity for people through Europe2020 objectives. As Commissioner for Regional and Urban Policy I have championed the cause of cities and urban development. I believe that we have already made progress as we have a new Cohesion Policy with a much stronger urban dimension. We expect that more than half of our Cohesion Policy budget for 2014-2020 will be invested in cities. We will also continue to work with URBACT, who provide a platform for exchange ofexperience and work on integrated strategies and action plans in the various elds of cooperation between European cities. We also expect to provide around \u20ac330m in particular innovative actions in sustainable urban development exploring new solutions to today and tomorrow's urban challenges. But we can do more. We have to make sure that the many EU policies that impact on cities are well coordi- nated and that the European, national, regional and local levels work with and support each other. For this I believe an EU Urban Agenda is the way forward. Although many EU policy areas already have an urban dimension, not everything works as it should: urban realities and cities' needs are not always reflected in our priority setting and policies that intervene and are implemented in cities are not always well coordinated. If we continue to consider sectors like the environmentThe Built Environment 12The Built Environment and transport separately, we will never get the best results, and we will fail to exploit the potential of cities to address our major societal challenges. An EU Urban Agenda could help us to adopt a more joined-up approach, and bring together the eorts of dierent levels of governance: EU, national and regional, and of course, at city level too. The development of an EU Urban Agenda has to take place in a coherent framework which allows dierentactors to take on dierent roles with commonly agreed objectives. An EU Urban Agenda will depend both on strong national agendas as well as on thecontribution of EU Member States to wider EU agenda setting. It is crucial that the Agenda is not seen as theEU pushing aside governments on the national level but strengthening and developing the urban agenda process within the dierent initiatives on urban devel opment at Member State level. The voices of cities need to be heard more clearly,because the best mayors and local administrations are closest to citizens, because local authorities have wide responsibilities that influence citizens' everyday lives. They are key for Europe and some would argue all the more so in the current context of socio-economic crisis, and wavering condence in public administrationand political institutions. The recent European elections have reminded us too that we need to stay close to our citizens, the involvement of cities in our policy making is one way to do that. This initiative is not an exclusive one: many live outside cities but are aected by them. They too can benet from an Urban Agenda and should be involved in the debate. We need to involve all stakeholders at every stage of the process to ensure a smooth implementation of an EU Urban Agenda. This means also that cooperation between all levels of government and within the Euro pean Commission should be enhanced. While respecting the principles of subsidiarity, more concerted action at EU level can help to ensure that policies that impact on cities or where cities are the key implementing partner are coherent, and conceived with urban areas and the needs of the people that live there in mind.The aim of an EU Urban Agenda is not to makeEuro pean cities less unique. Diversity is a valuable asset. Dierent cities have dierent potentials and face dierent challenges. The Urban Agenda should promote exchanges of best practice and the sharing of experience to ensure the best possible development. In my view the Urban Agenda should provide a working method to tackle key challenges. The EU Urban Agenda would strengthen the urban dimension of EU policies, improve their quality and coherence and give Europe's cities a more representative role as partners of the EU. I believe that bringing towns and cities into policy- making, the EU will respond more eectively to thereal changes and challenges facing our urban areas. I very much hope that our recent communication: \"The Urban Dimension of EU Policies\" and public consultation will stimulate discussion and bring valu- able feedback. Everybody is welcome to contribute to the public consultation on the Urban Agenda (which closes on the 26th of September)1. It should gather ideas from stakeholders to further clarify the need for an EU Urban Agenda, the objectives it should include and how it could function. I invite you to have your say, make your views known and contribute to the public consultation - and help us to put cities higher up on the political agendaacross European Commissionhttp://ec.europa.eu/commission_2010-2014/hahn http://ec.europa.eu/regional_policy 13Creativity, innovation and a strong focus on sustainable and attractive growth are at the very heart of the vision for the City of Varberg to become the Swedish West Coast's Creative Hot Spot by 2025. The municipality is growing quickly and has a population of more than 60,000 residents, mainly due to its location between two expanding regions - G\u00f6teborg (the West Sweden region) and Malm\u00f6 (the \u00d6resund region). Varberg is a stronghold for culture and tourism, and is especially renowned for its 13th Century fortress, long stretches of beautiful beaches and inland deciduous woodland with plenty of small lakes. It is also well known among surfers from all across northern Europe as one of the best places in Scandinavia for all kinds of surfing. The City of Varberg is focusing strongly on sustainable development and has been acknowledged for its success in bridging the gap between public service and the diverse interests of various partners in society (e.g. commerce,business, industry, development, conservation, culture, etc.). The municipality has a sharp focus on the way ahead, and a portfolio full of solidstrategies. In our vision for the future, the City ofVarberg has unique opportunities and we are acting on them. We are building a city converging around means of public transportation in arapidly expanding region. The railroad, which has long created a barrier between the seaside and the city centre, will now be relocated into a tunnel underneath the city. To expand on thisopportunity we are moving the harbour in order to further free up land for letting the city reclaim its position as a seaside town. In total, the project will result in more than 500,000 m2of land for development of our future city front. For people living, working or visiting the city of Varberg, the change will dramatically increase the freedom to experience the coastline. More places of residency, places for eating and meeting, places to shop and work, etc. - comes as a bonus. In our vision for Varberg 2025 we are striving to be at the forefront of supporting social and cultural aspects of sustainability. The municipality is localised in the middle of a strong academic region. The University of G\u00f6teborg and Chalmers University of Technology, the University of Lund and Malm\u00f6, the University of Bor\u00e5s and the University of Halmstad are all located well withinReinventing the City Building on Creativitycomfortable commuting distance from Varberg. This is of great importance for our local business climate and for our young. We are focused on consolidating the relationship with our academic allies even stronger, strengthening the position of our own Campus Varberg. The same is true for cultural institutions. For our growth it is key to attract enterprises and institutions that share our idea of building a more sustainable future, in the heart of a progressive region. This means that we are especially on the lookout for academic and cultural institutions, and enterprises with profiles that fit our idea of a modern sustainable city and trying to attract them into investing in Varberg. It is often stated that the place, and the people and lifestyle associated with it, is everything. If this is true, then the City of Varberg has everything to offer. www.varberg.seCome to Varberg. Share our vision.Green Growth Requires Systemic Cha ngeThe Built Environment 17Finnish Minister of the Environment, Ville Niinist\u00f6 explains how Finland is exploring dierent possibilities for sustainable economic growth... Finland has a long history as a forest-based econ omy. It has been said that we live from our forests. Then, some years ago, we started discussing the concept \"bio-economy\". N owadays we have found ourselves discussing more about a new but in reality old concept - \"forest bio-economy\". In Finland, we do not rush too fast into new businesses - but we really need to look at our economies with fresh eyes. In recent years, the Finnish government has been extensively exploring dierent possibilities for economic growth and renewal. One core pillar of our work has been the strategies and programmes for sustainable growth enhancing well-being, though carried out in several separate projects. Our approach has been broad, touching several political sectors, and I feel that this kind of a broad approach to greener growth is crucial on the European level as well. In short, taking a broad approach to green growth means that we need to understand the role of ecosystem services. Ecosystem services, including natural resources, processes and values, are not only a prerequisite for a green economy, but are also, by their very nature, an opportunity. We need to identify their value and use them wisely.At the same time, one clear challenge to our economy is to increase added value. This can be done by processing the products further. We can also use intangible values such as design and brand management to produce higher value for customers and achieve competitive advantages that are dicult to imitate. When doing this we need to remember that nature and the cultural values based on it do produce remarkable intangible values. Natural values support business activities, enhance the attractiveness of areas and create good living environments. Nature can improve well-being and, in and of itself, it contributes to health and welfare services. The benets and busi ness opportunities from these are already grow ing exponentially, but are not properly identied in policy discussions, or even in ocial statistics. For this reason we need to draw attention to the opportunities for creating intangible values in all policy actions. Moving towards a green economy is more than just adopting specic actions, rather it also needs a systemic change. For it to develop, it needs to be taken up by whole communities and societies. In the future, 80% of the global population will live in cities. The ecient use of water, materials, energy and space will be a necessity in areas with high popu lation densities. We need sustainable solutions for meeting these needs. In cities and urban regions, a green economy will be developed through innovations, and linkages between the innovations and by dissemination of them. Interactions between cities and the surrounding countryside will be stepped up in order to derive more benets from the economy, including local food, renewable energy production, and services for health and well-being. Thus, we need to support an environment for long-term development that is built upon large investments in urban regions, in which we can experiment with, test and develop resource-eective solutions for anew generation of renewable energy, water supply and waste management, and new models for ecologi- cally sustainable transport. In Finland, the existing cooperation platforms on research and development (SHOK Centres, INKA programme actors, researchcooperation models) will be part of this cooperation with cities and sub-regions. Promoting green and sustainable growth in urban regions must also play a role in land use and urban planning. The loss of biodiversity is a severe problem in Europe.Finland's ecosystems are also experiencing a decline in biodiversity, even though the loss of biodiversity has not been as high in forest ecosystems, partly because of advanced practices in forest management. Now we are looking at growth of the bio-economy, which willmean extensive use of forests and other renewableresources. Thus, a real condition for green growth viabio-economy is the sustainable use of ecosystem services. Sustainability must be assessed and it must be secured. In Finland we believe that the sustainability criteria we use must be generally accepted and updated when relevant, taking into account the changes in biomass use or the need for other ecosystem services, such as carbon sinks. To guarantee the sustainable use of forest biomass, sustainable forest management is a key factor. Besides sustainably managed commercial forests, we also need forest reserves to protect biodiversity. For this purpose, there are several instruments in use 1in Finland. Under all of these, the forest owner getscompensation for any major disadvantage, and this compensation is nanced by the national budget. For a sustainable bio-economy, the protection of bio- diversity, including funding needs to be secured. The transition from a fossil fuel economy to a low-carbon economy is inevitable, but we cannot rely too much on the bio-economy in achieving this. The reason is that the non-food biomass resources aretoo scarce to substitute for the massive use of coal and oil. Besides substitution, we need substantial eorts to save energy and resources on all levels of the economy. Still, the sustainably produced, advanced bio-based fuels are a better alternative to fossil fuel ones. Their introduction should be encouraged onthe European level as well. 1[Including strict nature reserves established under the Nature Conservation Act, protected wilderness and recreation areas, areas protected under the volunteer METSO programme, and protection agree- ments under the Forest Act.

Ville Niinist\u00f6 Finnish 18The Built Environment 19A renaissan ce of cities - sustainable Germany Dr Barbara Hendricks, Federal Minister for Environment, Nature Conservation, Building & Nuclear Safety in Germany gives an overview of how her country is making 'cities of the future'... Compared to Tokyo, the world's largest metropolis with 36 million inhabitants, Germany's largest city Berlin, with a population of 3.5 million, seems downright \"small\". However, something both cities have in common is their almost non-stop growth over the last decades. This highlights the pow erful attraction that cities have - even more so today thana thousand years ago. In newly industrialising and developing countries urbanisation is advancing at pace and is still on the rise in Germany. By 2030 the globalurbanisation rate will have climbed to some 60% -around 5 billion people will then live in cities. We are thus facing a \"renaissance of cities\". Increasingly, how our society develops will be determined in cities: In the future, 80% of global social, economic and ecological development will take place in cities. It should be self- evident that this development has to be sustainable, but up to now this has been nothing more than a goal. Achieving this goal must be our spur for the future. Changes in the environment and climate, economyand society are magnied in our cities and urban communities. The main challenges of our time - climate action, transforming our energy systems, resource conservation, demographic change, civil participation, equal opportunities and economic development - are most tangible in urban areas. As large-scale consumers of natural resources and major emitters, cities have an ambivalent relationship to the environment. City dwellers more often bear the brunt of negative environmental impacts. However, the density of citiesalso promotes the creation of ecient structures and they are key players in sustainable development.Cities have long been seen as the cradle of new ideas and hubs of economic development.We may be able to flesh out the idea of sustainable development in cities, but whether we can put it into practice and carry it forward to the future will also be determined in cities. What exactly do we understandby \"sustainable urban development\", and how do we make the \"city of the future\" liveable for as many inhabitants as possible? Truly sustainable urban development calls for integrated urban development planning and coherent political action across a range of policy areas - both within the eld of environment through coordinated policies on water, air quality, waste management and nature conservation, and beyond that through integrated urban policies on energy, transport, industry and infrastructure. Urban development is a long-term, joint project for all social forces from politics, administration, science and civil society. Particularly with regard to Germany, it is important to recognise that the megatrend of urbanisation is not ageneral trend. Few of Germany's major cities are growing, while many smaller and medium-sized towns are even experiencing de-urbanisation processes which likewise bring many problems in their wake. Thus there can be no blueprint for sustainable devel- opment - we must coordinate and develop solutions tailored to the individual case and to local conditions, working with and for local communities. However, cooperation at international, national, regional and municipal level is particularly important and this isreflected in the ongoing political debate. For instance, preparations for the United Nations Human Settlements Programme UN-Habitat are taking shape worldwide. At the Habitat III conference in 2016 a \"New UrbanAgenda\" is expected to be adopted for the next 20 years. Germany is actively engaging in these debates,also in close cooperation with its European partners. At national government level the reorganisation of the ministry has brought environmental protection and nature conservation under one roof with the allegedly opposing elds of building and urban development. The broader base of the ministry allows it to reflect the entire spectrum of sustainable development, and to take the ecological, economic and social dimensions of sustainability into account. If policy is to be sustainable and successful in our everyday reality -and ultimately that means achieving sustained success - policymakers must take a more holistic approach, recognising and addressing conflicts ofinterest at an early stage. In order to better coordinate ongoing programmes,establish networks between research projects at dierent levels and tap new elds of action for innovation and research, the ministry is currently working with other government departments, scientists and municipal administrators to develop a strategic research and innovation agenda as part of the National Platform for the City of the Future (Nationale Plattform Zukunftsstadt). One topic under intensive discussion in this platform is municipal climate action - for it is only at municipallevel that concrete climate action can take place. More and more German cities, municipalities and districts are implementing measures to reduce theirgreenhouse gas emissions. The Federal Environment Ministry promotes municipal climate projects and supports the appointment of climate managers, for instance, or the elaboration of climate action planswhich help municipalities to implement their climate targets. Of particular note in this context are the 19 \"master plan municipalities\", supported by the Federal Environment Ministry. They embody the idealof a sustainable city. They have set themselves very ambitious targets - minus 95% greenhouse gas emissions and minus 50% energy consumption by 2050 compared to 1990 levels. These targets cannot be achieved solely through climate measures in the known relevant sectors. The master plans outlining the course up to 2050, which were adopted by the highest municipal body, must also provide for theadaptation of administrative structures and ensure the long-term involvement of all local players, fromthe regional business and nancial sectors to associations, churches and the local population. Other important aspects are recreational options close to people's homes and areas which enable nature to be experienced in the city as well. Attractive green spaces enhance quality of life, support biological diversity in the city and are benecial for the climate. At the same time we need to ensure greater social justice and improve the living situation of those with a lower socio-economic status. For this reason, in futureurban development policy must take urban nature conservation into greater account. Our goal is to make an active contribution towards a sustainable, liveable future - and to ensure that the conditions needed for this are established in our Federal Minister for Environment, Nature Conservation, Building & Nuclear Safety www.bmub.bund.de/en/ Dr Barbara Hendricks, Federal Minister for Environment, Nature Conservation, Building & Nuclear SafetyThe Built Environment 20The Built Environment 21Fresh air an d thi nking for ci ties Teresa Gonzalez Rico, Future Cities Catapult project leader, and Han Pham, Experience Strategist for Intel, suggest how the challenge of air quality could uncover new ways to work together as part of the \"Sensing London\" project... Air quality is one of our cities' biggest challenges which aects everyone. Air respects no political or geographical boundaries, and is a growing global issue that is at once pervasive and particular to the context of each city. The impacts of air pollution can seem daunting on many levels. Financially, the costs of PM2.5 levels to the UK is in the range of \u00a38-17bn per year accordingto the Policy Exchange report, \"Something in the Air,\" 1 and particulate matter is only one of the many airpol lutants. From a health perspective, the World Health Organisation (WHO) has reported that over 7 million deaths around the world could be attributedto poor air quality in 2012. Addressing the air quality issue is not simply an urban \"problem\", it's a question of how to address urban innovation in a way that is grounded but forward thinking as well as sustainable - environmentally, economically and socially. As part of our Sensing London project, we believe it's possible, and imperative, to think about innovation collaboratively. Urban innovation needs collaborative innovation How can we rethink how we monitor, measure and manage urban environments? How can we not only generate but share, learn about, and design with urban information in a way that it can create a more liveable, vibrant city? \"Sensing London aims to enable citizens to better understand issues of air quality, using distributed sensor networks to highlight and discuss the problem. It also generates data to better inform policy develop- ment by local authorities. In helping instrument andunderstand our cities, we support these discussions to sketch out a more sustainable mode for future cities\", says Dan Hill, Executive Director of Futures and Best Practice for the Future Cities Catapult. The Future Cities Catapult is one of 7 'Catapults' launched by the UK's Technology Strategy Board, with the aim to become a world-leading innovation centre focused on developing the solutions cities need if they are to have a strong economy, resilient environment and good quality of life for the people that live there. The Sensing London project and the Future Cities Catapult (FCC), in collaboration with Intel Collaborative Research Institute (ICRI), The Royal Parks, ScienceScope, City Insights and others, will instrument the city with a low-cost, high-quality, open and replicable network of sensors able to measure a variety of environmentalfactors, starting with air quality, to help provide a foundation for evidence-based innovation that can help develop new products, services and business models that work for the long term benet of our cities. \"One of the key tenets of our research is that we primarily position our work in eld - if you're looking at designing for the urban environment, you have to be in it. You need to understand and design for the social, technological, environmental and political contexts of urban cities,\" says Dr. Duncan Wilson, Director of the Intel Collaborative Research Institute on Sustainable Connected Cities, a partnership between Intel, University College London and Imperial University (www.cities.io). \"What we have experienced, and learned from, in the past through placing our work in real world situations is that while some things have technicalchallenges, it's also equal parts social, political, or environmental challenges that are equally as dicultor meaningful to address.\" One of the aims of Sensing London is to make air quality - an invisible problem - a more tangible one by sensing air quality, increasing literacy and both sharing and designing with people tools that they can use to contribute to the solution(s). \"The Future Cities Catapult is one of 7 'Catapults' launched by the UK's Technology Strategy Board, with the aim to become a world-leading innovation centre focused on developing the solutions cities need if they are to have a strong economy,resilient environment and good quality of life for the people that live there.\" Part of the project is to nd new ways to trial and prototype innovations in a real city environment to build evidence of their performance in use. Over the long term, insights from data will provide a foundation for evidence-based solutions to help us support small/medium enterprises' (SMEs) to develop new urban services that meet the needs of the citizens and the city systems that aect, and are aected by,air quality. Driving innovation in the real city: 3 insights Issues like air quality are too big and complex to be addressed in isolation. Our approach to designing these integrated solutionsuses three core processes that inform and inspire the way we work: 1. Putting citizens at the heart of our work and our research. Researchers and designers spend time in the eld to carry out in-depth interviews to paint a picture of people's mental models, everyday practices, and understanding around air quality to highlight insightsand design interventions that work with, and for, people's lives. By sharing these learnings with communities across London to help inspire new ways to raise awarenessabout air quality or address needs and interests of specic audiences, we can help turn an air quality \"issue\" into a chance to change the way we think about, create, and sustain the cities we live in. 2. Leading a multi stakeholder co-creation process. Throughout the length of the project, Intel and Future Cities Catapult also work with city councils to under- stand the pressures and requirements that are asked of them in regards to air quality. As part of the project, for example, in Eneld Borough Council, 100 air quality sensor nodes will be deployed across the borough in coordination with the council and community. The aim is to help catalyse more diverse ways of thinking by bringing together citizens to local business, and public authorities to academia to be part of the solution to investigate and design the next generation of sensing technology and cityservices together. \"Citizens have to be involved, because like all of us, we are the ones creating air pollution. So, we need to help people consider: how do you approach your travel? We all have social responsibility towards our environment. If we don't take that responsibility, things are never going to improve. What we probably need is a culture change. We're at the rst step now of something that is really very dierent,\" raises Ned Johnson, Principal Environmental Health Ocer at Eneld Council. 3. Prototyping and testing performance-in-use of innovative solutions AQ sensor experts are part of the project to develop low cost sensing devices that provide data in real time. In addition, taking a design approach to prototyping, the team is integrating skills ranging from design toThe Built Environment 22The Built Environment 23anthropology or data science, to develop solutions that are inclusive and take into account people as wellas city systems. Doing this in an open way strives to involve citizens in the process and this transparency inspires trust. The goal is to design technology that can be trusted, but also interventions that people will care about. Greg Jackson, a design technologist at Intel, says,\"One of the big challenges when working with sensors is quality of sensing. Sensors have dierent qualitylevels and dierent accuracies. Sensor data could be influenced by placing them at a dierent height, heatsource or breeze - all of which could possibly skew sensor readings if they're not calibrated well. A core challenge in making these technologies more accessible and meaningful to the public occurs not only inpro viding sensors or data, but in how to help people look beneath it. So it's more than building technology that can give you data, it's building a culture ofdata literacy. It comes back to people, as well as the technology.\" Innovating the way we live: How can urban data be relevant to our daily lives? Sensing London is not only asking questions about how cities can approach 'fresh air' and fresh thinking better together, but is also considering how Sensing London can help citizens understand such questions as: Innovating Policy: Can designing cities collaboratively change how we govern? Innovating Technology: How do you build more transparent technologies? Innovating Information: In an already busy world, how do you design for information so that it's simple to understand and act upon, whether you're a citizen or leading the local government? Innovating Collaborative Cities: How do we get people to participate long-term and feel a sense ofbelonging and ownership of their future cities?\"One of the aims of Sensing London is to make air quality -an invisible problem -a more tangible one by sensing air quality, increasing literacy and both sharing and designing with people tools that they can use to contribute to the solution(s).\" Tim Brooke, a creative technologist with the FCC, suggests designing future cities is a shared learning process that is collaborative and iterative. \"Bringing ideas to life early on in a project makes sense - you can quickly assess what works and what doesn't and learn from the process.\" In sensing - and learning - about London, we welcome you join in us in considering: What would you senseabout your city to help you create fresh thinking to city challenges?

Managing public sector buildings is an arduous task. In line with budget cuts, a number of central government departments have streamlined their oces and created ecient t for purpose estates that deliver value for money. In 2012 the National Audit Oce (NAO) published a report that looked at the eciency of central government oce property since 2004. The report found that departments had made good progress in improving eciency of their oce estate - but need to stop managing their estates in isolation from one another, in order to achieve best value. \u00a3100m was raised by Ministers in 2012, by disposing of unwanted properties and renegotiating leases.However, Cabinet Oce Minister Francis Maude said that the government had \"to make better use of space, and put an end to the days where government estate was bigger, inecient and went without scrutiny.\" He also said: \"Government will always need property but it can only be right that the public see what property is held and how eciently it is being used.\" 1 The Government Property Unit (GPU) was put in place (in 2010) to create an eective and ecient government estate, which provides value for money for the taxpayer, reduces our environmental impact and enables improvements in the way we work. As well as, making savings by reducing the amount of locations used by government. 24Home Office Building on Marsham Street, WestminsterThe Built Environment The NAO report found that since its establishment in 2010, the Unit has been slow to change the way government manages its estate. In its rst year it concentrated on developing plans to transfer control over the estate to a central body, which it failed to gain support for. \"Government departments such as DCLG work with private sector bodies in order to create service delivery eciencies relating to their property. \" The Estates Professional Services Framework (EPS) agreement was created as part of the government's vision to create an ecient, t-for-purpose and sustainable estate. The Framework runs for 4 yearsfrom April 2013 to 2017, and covers a wide range of property-related services which will help the majority of UK public sector bodies including central government departments - such as Department for Communities and Local Government (DCLG) and Department for Education (DfE), NHS bodies, local authorities, and emergency services. Government departments such as DCLG work with private sector bodies in order to create service delivery eciencies relating to their property. Framework agreements of this sort are crucial for central government departments looking for cost eective solutions to managing estate professional services.Private sector partners such as GVA Grimley oer expert property services to government departments, and local authorities. As part of the framework agree ment they work in partnerships with the public sector organisation and deliver cost eective services that are essential to that organisation. In August this year, Ministers and sta at the Department for Communities and Local Government moved into oces with the Home Oce. The NAO noted that the DCLG move will save taxpayers an estimated \u00a3220m over the remaining lifetime of the PFI contract. The relocation from the Eland House oce in Victoria to the Home Oce building Marsham Street, Westminster, was ordered by Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, Eric Pickles. The Secretary of State said: \"There is still immense ineciency across the public sector. By sharing serv ices and streamlining our own back oce, we are practising what we preach to town halls by illustrating the scope to save even more taxpayers' money. \"And in waving goodbye to an old building which will be turned into new shops and oces, we are alsodoing our bit to support the existing House in Victoria the old home of DCLGGVA is one of the leading providers of estates profes- sional services to Central Government and the wider Public Sector.

At GVA our dedicated teams exploit options to enable property to con- tribute to business strategy. Savingshere can have a direct impact on the bottom line and opportunities include: 1. Lease restructuring Certain properties will be consideredcore to the business, even in a down- turn. An early renewal should generate a rent free or capital contribution. Maximising your Public Sector covenant that suits your operational needs can generate a positive result. 2. Break options These can be a very cost effective way of reducing cash burn. However, plan early for them because many breaks have onerous conditions, and land- lords might fight hard to frustrate you exercising your break options. A looming break option has a depressing effect on a landlord's investment value. If the premises are core, consider 'selling'the break to the landlord for a rent free period or cash contribution. 3. Lease expiry Exiting on lease expiries is an extremely cost effective way of reducing cash burn, but, again, plan well in advance in order to reduce the operational impact on your business. Dilapidation claims should be strongly challenged. 4. Surplus or underused assets An accurate portfolio assessment will also allow you to properly assess themerits of potential deals on surplus space; be that assignment, subletting or surrender. Co-locating together can have a positive effect on the overall cost saving that can be achieved. MOTOs can help provide flexibility and certainty for all parties. A supporter of the Crown Commercial Service EPS framework 265. Assets sales It's important to have a realistic expec- tation of price, and knowing the local markets is essential. It's also worth considering a revised planning zoning/ consent to enhance value depending on how 'time critical' the generation of a capital receipt might be. Always consider the long term impact of such activity against the short term benefits of cash injection. 6. Property cost audit Many organisations do not have a clear overview of their property costs because payments come from different budgets but the core areas are: Rates -Challenging the current assessment with a view to securing arate refund and reduced future pay- ments needs to be considered for every property, including checking transition relief calculations and other relief. Many occupiers employ GVA rating surveyors to negotiate reduced assessments and this is a great way of generating cash quickly at no net cost. Forensic Rates Audit - Reviewing historic information and payments ina forensic manner can often yield discrepancies that can be discussed. GVA has saved over \u00a3500m. Service charges - Thoroughly ques- tioning budgets and reconciliations provided by landlords frequently yieldsPROFILEcash savings. That should include revisiting historic service charges to check for errors which may lead to cash reimbursement. Energy/utility use audits - Are your buildings and services running as efficiently as they should and are you paying the lowest price? Thinking, acting and 'going green' can and willsave you money and minimise the impact of pending and future energy- related taxation/charging. Portfolio analysis and data manage- ment -Tactical decisions need to be informed by quality data and sound analysis of the relevant benefits when site by site tactics are being consid- ered. Comprehensive property data is unfortunately often lacking. This forms the springboard for analysing the portfolio to identify savings. Cost-in-use analysis - A relative comparison of each of your facilitieswill quickly highlight those that aremost expensive on a price per head, price per unit of production or any other business metric relevant to your organisation. This will demonstrate where the greatest savings can be achieved. Space utilisation audit - How efficiently you use your space - orremodel the business through any restructuring - will be key to freeing up more space for your own use (or that of the wider public sector) or for dis- posal.

Recent months have seen a recovery but as construction businesses emerge from the downturn, many are uncertain what approach to take to printing. Construction companies need acces- sible printing that is dependable and of high graphical quality. Yet, many such firms remain reluctant to makelarge investments in new solutions. Instead they often just struggle on, wasting money through inefficient processes and ageing printers. The construction sector would benefit from a third approach, which involves buying printing as a service which develops with their business. Managed print services is often the ideal solu- tion here. That is because, instead of requiring them to make an upfront investment in the latest technology, it enables them to buy printers, supplies, maintenance and support in one all-inclusive ongoing contract as operational rather than capital expenditure. And these are exactly the kinds of benefits that OKI can deliver to construction sector businesses through its managed print services and associated managed page solutions. An OKI managed print services imple- mentation typically begins with an audit of existing practices includingoutput volumes and printing types. By gaining a transparent view across the print landscape, a business can see where budget is spent and where it is potentially being wasted. The results will be used to design a long-term print solution tailored to the needs of that organisation, helping ensurethat the right printers are being used for the right job. This approach also establishes best practices such as setting double-sided and mono printing as default options to save costs and drive energy effi- ciencies. In addition, it means just one contract for all printing and doc- uments needs. This makes it easier to monitor on-going costs, reduce capital investment and control budgets. For businesses that need more granular control, OKI offers a comprehensive managed page services approach. This involves OKI working with its customer to establish their print and document requirements; recommending the right printing device and delivering a tailored all-inclusive printing plan that covers all consumables and servicing, thereby improving productivity. The right device together with the right printing plan and the implementation of print poli- cies will ensure the company pays a flat monthly fee for what it prints, so it can control its costs. Of course, in implementing such an approach, vendors need to provide printing solutions that drive addedRob Brown Business Manager OKI Systems (UK) Ltd Tel: 01784 274 300 www.oki.co.ukSmarter Printing for Construction By Rob Brown, OKI Business Manager for managed document services 28value for their construction sector clients.

Print OKI A lan d ba nking myth House builders have been battling against the myth of land banking for some time. The evidence provided here by Stewart Baseley, Executive Chairman at the Home Builders Federation explodes that myth... Accusations of \"land hoarding\" or land banking have long been used as a stick with which to beat house builders. To inform the debate, HBF recently undertook a major survey comprising results from 23 members whotogether build around almost 40% of all the new homes in Great Britain, and that have some 220,000 plots in their 'land banks'. Of their plots just 4% were on sites with an imple- mentable permission where work on site had not yet been started - an incredibly low figure that supports what we have been saying for years and totally debunks the accusations being made. 4%, equates to 8,300 out of over 220,000 plots that were 'oven ready', or what could be described accusatorially as a land bank and not underway. Even extrapolating this out to get a rough picture for theentire industry only gives us 22,000 plots - around the number of homes we need to be building each monthto begin plugging the housing shortage. The key statistic in my view was that over a quarter were plots with outline consent only. This is where the real focus should be, looking at how we speed up the planning system so that these plots can come forward. Our survey revealed nearly 60,000 plots stuck at outline stage and if you applied this gure on a proportional basis it implies the whole industry has over 150,000 homes in the planning system with an outline consent that is not yet implementable. Of the rest, the vast majority, 63%, were on sites where work was already underway. Another 2% of plots were on sites that were not currently viable. Housing development is a long and complex process. From initially identifying a potential land opportunity,Housing 30Housing through to completion of the rst homes can take years. As a result, home builders need to have an adequate supply of land in the pipeline to responsibly manage their building programmes. A more accurate,and certainly less emotive term for land banks would be \"land in progress\". It is reasonable to ask how much \"land in progress\" a house builder needs. Experts who have studied thissuggest it needs to be at least 3 years supply. Local authorities are required to have an identied 5 year land supply, so they should actually be able to identifyland for around 600,000 homes at today's building rates, or well over a million homes if we are to meet future housing requirements, many of which should have some form of planning permission. Looking at it logically, with Help to Buy driving demand, why on earth would house builders, who only realise prot if they develop housing, sit on land? With buyers eager to buy new homes, all the evidence now shows that builders are building out existing sites more quickly and so want to get onto new ones sooner. Sitting on land in the hope that inflationmight compensate for the impact such a decision would have on the builder's return on capital employed makes very little business sense. Of course, our statistics only bear out what numerous other independent or ocial investigations haveshown. Kate Barker, in her seminal review of housing supply 10 years ago, dismissed the proposition that builders land banked; as did the Calcutt Review in2007. Then in 2008 as part of its exhaustive study of 'Home Building in the UK', the OFT said 'it could nd no evidence that home builders hoard land', a view supported in more recent reports by Savills, and Molior. Yet despite the sizeable, and growing evidence base, the myth persists. The statistics we compiled largely reflect those in reports issued regularly by the Local Government Association (LGA). However, the LGA's press statements, and indeed the subsequent media reporting, fail to distinguish between implementable and outline permissions, or the plots on sites already underway, with everything conveniently labelled 'land bank'. Their report shows that 167,000 of the 323,000 plotsthey measure are on sites already under construction. On their measure, if you get planning permission for a site with 15,000 homes, until that last house is built and sold, all those 15,000 remain in the 'land bank'.So in reality, the gure they claim to be a 'land bank' contains thousands of homes that are not only built, but indeed have been sold and are being lived in. Similarly their 'land bank' gure fails to dierentiate between an outline and an implementable permission. So in many instances the site's developer is beingaccused of sitting on, or hoarding land which they cannot get onto as they are awaiting Reserved Matters to be approved, or for the local authority to discharge pre-commencement conditions. When you look beyond the rhetoric and consider the realities, the facts are quite clear. House builders do not sit on land that has an implementable planning permission. The challenge is to address the real problems that restrict the amount - and speed - of land coming through the planning system. With Help to Buy stimu lating demand, now is the time to step up supply and the planning system needs to react accordinglyif continued increases are to be sustained. Rather than focus on the sites not being built, I wouldwelcome the same passion and energy being devoted to a sensible discussion about how we tackle the long- entrenched problems in the planning system - and where we are going to build the homes the coun try info@hbf.co.uk www.hbf.co.ukwww.twitter.com/HomeBuildersFed 31A proactive ap proa ch to homelessness While some organisations are trying to deter rough sleepers, Wigan Council are undergoing actions to provide support services, here Councillor Chris Ready, Cabinet Member for Housing explains... The recent row about metal spikes placed outside buildings to deter rough sleepers thrust the issue of homelessness into the headlines. The practice caused outrage and a number of banks and shops, under pressure from the public, were forced to remove the spikes from outside their properties. It seemed to say something uncomfortable about modern Britain, that some of our most vulnerable people were being treated like pests. Has duty of care to the most in need - even basic human compassion - been lost in our new age of austerity? I'm pleased to say that's not the case here in Wigan.While the row about metal spikes was brewing, our sta were working hard on a plan to achieve the government's gold standard in housing support. It fol lows an inspection by the National PractitionerSupport Service earlier this year that found our approach to homelessness to be above the national benchmark and excellent in many areas. While some organisations are putting spikes in the ground to keep rough sleepers from their premises, in Wigan we are demonstrating that even with the nancial pressures all local authorities face, it is still possible to oer outstanding services to those inseri ous need of support. Since 2010, we've seen our budget cut by 30% - one of the largest reductions faced by any local authority. Having already saved more than \u00a364.8m, we've got to save another \u00a341m over the next 3 years. Throughout this process, the council is committed to protecting services for the most vulnerable such as the homeless, or those at risk of becoming homeless. Housing 32Housing So much so, we launched a new homeless strategy for the next 4 years. The strategy was developed at a time of unprecedented change in national policy and reductions in public expenditure in areas such aswel fare and social housing. Our aim was to produce a strategy t for our housing advice and homelessness services needs in the future. The absolute focus is on a proactive and preventative approach to tackling the causes of homelessness and not just dealing with its eects. So, working with ourpartners in the public sector and other organisations such as the Citizens' Advice Bureau, we identify households most at risk of homelessness and make sure they get the best advice and support at the earli est possible stage. For example, we noticed we were seeing more peoplewith multiple debts coming to our prevention service. We now target households with high debt levels, giving them training and advice on managing their money. Our aim is to step in before someone ndsthemselves with a housing crisis. This approach relies on working closely with our partners who we have a strong relationship with, something praised in the inspection earlier this year.A key element of our strategy is now tailored toaddress the impact of welfare reform, something identied as the greatest threat to future homeless- ness. With Wigan and Leigh Housing (WALH), who manage the council's housing stock, we've beenlooking at what can be done to prevent people becoming homeless. WALH now has a new arrears protocol for tenants, a new home nder service and has incentivised mutual housing exchanges. We've also invested in our services, and now have adedicated housing advice worker who specialises in cases of domestic abuse, providing advice and assis- tance to victims. Domestic abuse has been identied as another major cause of homelessness in Wigan. Thankfully, the rate of homelessness is declining in the borough year on year - a major achievement at a time of economic depression. But we're continuing to seek improvement in our services. We want to end rough sleeping. Last year we had 13 individuals who regularly slept on the streets. Even in a borough of320,000 people, that's 13 too many. \"The absolute focus is on a proactive and preventative approach to tackling the causes of homelessness and not just dealing with its eects. \" Homelessness is a complex problem requiring complex solutions. At a time of diminishing budgets, councils have to be smart and sympathetic in dealing with the issue. We think by acting early and involving our partners, we can prevent people from becoming homeless in the rst place. I'm proud our service and strategy has been recognised as excellent. We've shown you can do something posi tive to help the homeless and those at risk of becoming homeless. And that certainly does for Housing Wigan Council www.wigan.gov.uk 33 Suppressing the fire An eective sprinkler system can reduce a multitude of costs from re and here, Steve Mills, BAFSA Fire & Service Co-ordinator provides the evidence... Since the very rst occasion that mankind used re to cook and keep himself warm the phenomena of re has been the proverbial 'double edged sword'. Humankind has been able toharness its power to amazing creative eect but has also felt the destructive force and human tragedy that re has the potential to unleash. To know and feel that destructive element is perhaps everyone's worst nightmare. It was in response to that fear, witnessed in some very dramatic and tragic res, and of course the nan cial benets of not losing all one's possessions, that some were determined in seeking a way of automatically dousing re with water. Pioneering work came to a head, if you will excuse the pun, withthe development of the world's rst automatic re sprinklers in the 19th century and, though one has to say that the basic premise has remained true, since that time the concept has been continually developed. This has been achieved through thoroughtesting and design development, mainly aimed atreducing the economic cost of re. It has been in more recent years that the potential life safety bene ts of sprinklers have been portrayed, but has all this work been eective? There is an array of statistics, produced from a variety of sources to show how eective sprinklers (aka water based re suppression systems) are, and these can be most useful in discovering the potential benets sprinklers have in controlling re. For instance, a quick web search of 're sprinkler facts' gave the following result: 99% of res were controlled by sprinklers alone;60% of res were controlled by the spray from no more than 4 sprinklers; In New Zealand, where all res have had to be reported for over 100 years, records show that sprinklers have been eective in 99.7% of cases.1 One has to say that these kind of statistics are very powerful but there is also other information which is not so unequivocal. Some of these have been produced in research documents over recent years which, whilst upholding the benets of sprinklers have shown a more 'cautious' endorsement. In addition, the information released by the DCLG(Department for Communities and Local Government)in their latest 2011-2012 re statistics, as gathered from re and rescue service reporting show that: In 2010-11 there were 408 res with the outcome where sprinklers were present in the room of origin. 43 res were in dwellings and 365 res were in other buildings. Of these, 172 (42%) were extinguished/ contained/controlled, 29 (7%) did not contain/control the re, and 207 (51%) were not known. For the purposes of this article I will discount the other DCLG statistical information relating to sprinklers being on the same floor as the re - not I feel an unreasonable premise - that for any suppression system to be eective, it has to be in the same room as the re (room of origin). As can be deduced from the above, it would appear that there are large dierentials of how eectivesprinklers actually are if we look at statistical evidenceHealth & Safety 34Health & Safety only, especially as many sprinkler activations are believed to go unrecorded. What is perhaps needed is a broader view of the facts. Seeking practical experience As one with a re & rescue service background, I am keen to understand and investigate the practicalout working of how sprinkler systems operate in real re situations and how best to gather this information, and what information is likely to be of use. Thanks to a growing network of people who diligently record information where sprinkler activations occur,a broader picture is emerging of their usefulness in controlling re in a wide variety of building types. Since rst collecting such information in 2010 twothings have become clear: 1) In the incidents reported, sprinklers are shown to be extremely eective in controlling re size; 2) The level of interest shown in sprinkler incidents each year is growing; 2011: 32 incidents reported2012: 60 incidents reported2013: 63 incidents reported. Since the introduction to this country of re sprinklers into the residential and domestic arena, there have been a number of recorded sprinkler 'saves' in the home environment. However, the majority of recorded incidents appear to occur in commercial and industrial premises and this may be for a variety of reasons possibly relating to insurance claims, reset ting of systems being seen as more of a priority for large premises, or a reticence to call the re andrescue services to a controlled re situation. My gures for the past 2 years show the following breakdown of premise types where sprinkler actuations have been notied.2012 2013 Factories 25 23 Warehouses 5 3 Retail/Entertainment 16 11 Schools 26 Dom/Res 7 11 Hotel 2 2 PPS 2 3 Recycling 3 For the vast majority of these cases, the outcome has been very successful in terms of the low number of systems that were actually triggered and the amount of re damage caused to the property concerned. The most notable 'failures' of sprinkler systems occur where the system has been turned o or decommissioned, and at least three commercial incidents have been recorded where this has happened and the building concerned has been totally lost. Two res: dierent outcomes It is often said that one picture can paint a thousand words and one of the most interesting aspects of the appraisal of sprinkler eectiveness can occur when photographs of incidents turn up from time to time. These really help to put the amount of re damage into perspective. For instance, it is widely believed that sprinklers are ineective at controlling kitchen res, especially those involving burning oil or fat products. It is generally understood that up to 60% of allhouse hold res occur in the kitchen or are cooking related, so can sprinklers make a dierence? Many of the 'domestic' incidents related to me seem to involve such res and it is surprising to see how eective sprinklers are in such circumstances. 35Below are 2 re outcomes, the rst following a cooker re in a HMO in Birmingham. As you can see from the photograph (above), the re was intense enough to strip the plaster from thewalls and incinerate most of the contents of the room. Fortunately no one was hurt but the roof was lost and several other tenants in the building had tobe re-homed. The cost of repairs ran into several thousands of pounds and took several months to undertake, during which time all revenue from tenants was lost. The second re occurred in Brighton and this too involved a fat pan re. The outcome, as can be seen from the photograph (opposite), is completely dierent, and the contrast stark. As the re became hot enough, a single ceiling mounted sprinkler head nearest to the cooker activated (this isnormally at about 70\u00baC) and prevented the re from taking hold. The occupant, a person known to bevulnerable from re, was able to stay in her flat following the clean-up operations. It is at this point worth mentioning that the re serv ice advice is never to throw water onto a fat pan re as this is extremely dangerous and will cause the re to dramatically flare up with potentially life-threatening consequences. This advice remains sound. Never throw water on to a fat pan re or try to move a flaming pan of oil. While it is true that sprinklers do apply water to the re, the way they do it, in small droplet form, allows heat to be far more rapidly absorbed and this aids suppression of the re. How do sprinklers suppress re? Fire spreads by conduction through solid matter, radiation and convection through the gaseous prod ucts of combustion. It is a 3 dimensional eect meaning that a re can get rapidly out of hand. Sprinklers have been shown to be very eective in controlling re spread and this is borne out in my data and from re testing.Health & Safety 36 Courtesy of West Midlands Fire serviceHealth & Safety Firstly the water from the sprinkler head(s) introduces cooling/wetting to the re area. This helps to controlall three types of re spread. Fire gases are rapidly cooled and this is eective inpreventing 'flashover', where flame propagation in the room is uncontrolled and everything is consumed by re. In addition, as water from the sprinkler wets the items surrounding the re, this makes it more dicult for radiation to set re to nearby objects such as furniture. There is also strong evidence to suggest that as the water droplets pass through the re gases, a certain amount of 'scrubbing' takes place, reducing the toxicity of the products of combustion. What is the conclusion? Evidence from sprinklers activated in res within the United Kingdom is beginning to match that fromother countries, especially in the residential and domestic eld where sprinkler systems have been in use for a much longer period. While this article reflects just a snapshot of all the sprinkler activations that are occurring, it does contain a common thread to show that where a correctly designed, installed and maintained sprinkler system is activated by re, the outcomes show reduced re damage, increased resilience and reduced costs from re, improved business continuity and less envi ronmental damage. I leave you to draw your own conclusions. 1Fire Sprinkler Information and Fire Sprinkler Association) Tel: 01353 659187info@bafsa.org.uk www.bafsa.org.ukwww.twitter.com/BAFSAfocus 37 \"Thanks to a growing network of people who diligently record information where sprinkler activations occur, a broader picture is emerging of their usefulness in controlling fire in a wide variety of building types. \" Courtesy of East Sussex Fire and Rescue ServiceThe fire safe ty competency challenge The re sector has responded to questions raised by Brandon Lewis, former Fire Minister, at a recent conference. Here, Graham Ellicott, CEO of the Fire Industry Association (FIA) provides an overview of the discussions... The opening address at a recent 're event' in the Palace of Westminster was given by Brandon Lewis, Department for Communities and Local Government (DCLG) former Under Secretary of State (aka the 'Fire Minister') with responsibilities that include re. He laid emphasis on the fact that prevention andprotection are now the front line for the Fire and Rescue Services. The evidence of this is there for all to see, as over the last 10 years there has been a 35% reduction in domestic fatalities so this approach, in conjunction with the eorts from other re stakeholders is paying dividends. Brandon threw down 2 challenges to all in the re sector, namely: How can we keep up this reduction in re fatalities? How can competency become the norm for all in the re sector? Other speakers at the event addressed the issues highlighted by Brandon. For example, a senior re engineer commented that competency is required from all involved with re safety whether their buildings be'code compliant' or re engineered. He went on to saythat it should be remembered that however goodthe re design of a building, it can be 'undone' by poor construction and maintenance. A discussionensued as to whether all re engineering is value engineering as there had been some comments about this earlier on, most of it being anecdotal withno hard evidence. The competency theme was built upon by a represen- tative from a re research facility who asked why Building Regulations 7 (materials and workmanship) and 38 (provision of re safety information to the responsible person) aren't adhered to so that the building is 'safe' and its subsequent occupiers are fully informed of its re protection systems. To supplement these comments it should be appreciated that Approved Document B (the re guidance document to the Build ing Regulations) says: \"Building Control Bodies may accept the certication of the installation or maintenance of products, com ponents, materials or structures as evidence of compliance with the relevant standard. Nonetheless, a Building Control Body will wish to establish, in advance of the work, that any such scheme is adequate for the purpose of the Building Regulations.\" Health & Safety 38Continued on page 40...Train any T ime, anywhere - wi T h T he Bulls e ye ex T inguisher T raining sys T em. The BullsEye system is the most innovative fire training tool on the market. This state of the art training tool uses digital flames and a laser-driven extinguisher to teach trainees how to use a fire extinguisher. The training extinguisher interacts directly with digital flames, sound and smoke to create realistic scenarios in any training environment. uni T ed Kingdom Belgium France g ermany The n eT herlands, Head Office T : +44 (0)1527 888 960 T : +32 (0)14 699 820 T : +33 (0)3 44 26 00 51 T : +49 (0)231 2064 874 T : +31 (0)13 507 6800HOW IT WORKS The BullsEye training extinguisher has the same weight, feel and discharge time of an actual extinguisher. When the handle is squeezed, a conical laser is projected along with the sound of an extinguisher to give trainees a realistic hands-on experience. The flames respond automatically to how the trainee uses the extinguisher - going out only if the trainee aims and sweeps properly at the base of the fire. Training can now take place completely in- doors \u2014 from the training room to the produc - tion floor. And the completely dry laser-driven training extinguishers eliminate the cost, cleanup and lost productivity of traditional training methods. BULLSEYE FEATURES Clean The BullsEye extinguisher uses a conical laser to replicate discharge rather than depending on dry-chemical or CO2 extinguisher. For training variation, the BullsEye system can also be used with the air/water SmartExtinguisher. Safe Relies on LED driven digital flames and a laser extinguisher provide a completely safe training experience. Effective Provides an engaging training experience. Hundreds of trainees can be trained in a single day without recharging any extinguishers. Realistic BullsEye extinguishers have sound effects, a timed discharge and are weighted accordingly (2kg or 6kg.) to closely simulate dry-chemical or CO2 extinguishers.

However, Brandoncould bring influence to bear by ensuring that only competent people (those that are members of suitable schemes) are used on all buildings or as a minimumon those that employ the use of taxpayers' money. A National Social Housing Fire Strategy Group repre- sentative echoed the previous speaker's views by arguing that there is a real need to sort out BuildingRegulation 38 and the way that it is implemented and enforced. Indeed, one has to ask the question as to who has heard of Regulation 38 and my bet is thatfew hands would go up in any room; so if nobody's heard of it then it's a fair bet to say that it's enforcement is likely to be negligible as well. The Fire Sector isn't happy with this state of aairs as information supplied under the auspices of Regulation 38 provides a very good basis for the 'production' of a good re risk assessment for the building in question. In order to address this situation a working group has been setup to report the Fire Sector Federation's Technical Guidance Workstream. It is expected that this working group will report back later in 2014, so we may beable to discuss more of that in the future. A thoughtful presentation from the Fire Protection Association posed the question as to why the government won't legislate to protect: The most vulnerable in society from re; Those people aected by others over whom they have no control when it comes to re; Very large premises from the ravages of re which can cause loss of life, property damage and reduced levels of employment. In particular, the comment concerning the most vulnerable in society would drive down re deaths inthis demographic group. Such legislation would include the provision of the appropriate re protec tion systems (re detection, suppression etc.) at thechange of a tenancy. Indeed, past Westminster events have included presentations on the level of re deaths in rental accommodation, and in particularthose properties where there is no working smoke detection. A similar piece of legislation applies in Scot land under the 'Repairing Obligations' so one must ask why the English rental property is not treated in the same way? Hopefully Brandon is nowlistening as government announced on 20 November 2013 that it would be carrying out a review as towhether new rules are required for carbon monoxide and smoke detectors in private accommodation. This Rented Sector Review closed on 28 March 2014 and the results of this have not yet been issued. The government's own champion for re safety in rental accommodation gave a presentation concerning Firemark, which is a training and advice tool for all of those involved with re safety in rental accommodation. He indicated that when he asked Brandon's predeces- sor Bob Neill about the implementation of Firemark, he was told 'you don't get it do you, just get on with it'. Now, that last comment is a pragmatic attitude thatcould be applied to all of us in the re sector including the Minister, and only time will tell if he takes note of the answers from the re sector to the questions that he posed - only time will (0) 203 166 5002 info@a.uk.comwww.a.uk.comHealth & Safety 40Continued from page 38...Ivorfire Safety Services Ltd can provide services specialising in Fire and Fire Safety based on sound practical experience with; Former Fire Safety and Fire Service personnel who have years of experience of dealing with fire.

The latest Health and Safety Executive advice is that schools should identify, protect and manage asbestos-containing materials. Planning and Building Control Today assesses the current thinking... In 2013, the Committee on Carcinogenicity (CoC) conrmed that children are more vulnerable to asbestos exposure than adults, as they have a longer time for an asbestos disease to develop. Figures suggest that the lifetime risk of developing mesothelioma for a 5 year old child is about 5 timesgreater than an adult aged 30. In light of the ndings from the CoC, the Department for Education (DfE) pledged to review its policy by launching the consultation: Asbestos management in schools: DfE policy review. The consultation sought to hear from those involved in the day-to-day management of asbestos in schools about how eective current guidance is, how asbestos is being managed, what the barriers are to eectivemanagement, and how it can better support schools. Around 75% of UK state schools contain asbestos and more than 140 school teachers have died from the asbestos cancer mesothelioma in the past 10 years. Campaigners such as the Joint Union Asbestos Committee (JUAC) have been calling for a full audit of the schools estate to establish the condition of asbestos-containing materials. They also want to see a programme to remove completely all asbestos. As Julie Winn, Chair of JUAC said in the April edition of Planning and Building Control Today: \"The only long-term solution to preventing exposure to asbestos in schools is a strategic national plan for the phased removal of asbestos with priority being given to the most dangerous asbestos. Other coun- tries have recognised the problem of asbestos in public buildings and have committed to a long termpolicy of phased removal. We believe that a phasedremoval of asbestos from schools should be adopted as national policy in the UK and if this action is not taken, then asbestos will remain a problem in schoolsindenitely.\" Current government policy however, based on Health and Safety Executive (HSE) advice is that schools should identify, protect and manage asbestos- containing materials (ACMs), rather than remove them (the ndings are outlined below). It is thought that the cost alone of removing all asbestos from schools prevents the government from taking action. Speaking at the time of the CoC's nding last year, chair of the Asbestos in Schools campaign group Annette Brooke MP , said: \"The Department for Education must publish a strate gic plan involving an audit of school buildings and an assessment of the risks. Over a period of time the plan must aim for the removal of the most dangerous asbestos materials.\" As we nalise this issue of Adjacent Government , the DfE are yet to publish the results of the consultation, however, in June, the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) announced their results of asbestos management in schools inspections which took place between April 2013 and January 2014. The randomly selected sample of 153 non-local authority schools also included independent, voluntary aided and foundation schools, free schools and academies. The aim of the initiative was to assess the level of compliance with The Control of Asbestos Regulations 2012 (CAR) which places duties on those who haveHealth & Safety 42Health & Safety responsibilities for the maintenance of work premises, including schools, to manage the risk from asbestos. Overall, the HSE found the duty holders' awareness of their legal responsibilities was 9% higher than the level found in the 2010/11 inspection programme, with 95% of schools having a full or broad understandingof the requirements. The majority of schools that were inspected (71%) required either no further action or were given straightforward advice. However, 44 schools (29%) received written advice, with enforcement actiontaken in 20 of these schools (13%) - an Improvement Notice was served on each of these 20 schools. In 2010/11, HSE served 41 Improvement Notices on28 schools (17% of the schools visited). Geo Cox, the Head of HSE's Public Services Sector, said: \"Over the last few years there has been a lot of work by stakeholders across the school sector to raise awareness of the duty to manage asbestos. It is really encouraging to see that awareness of the requirements has increased since our previous inspection initiative. \"That said, schools should not be under any illusion - managing asbestos requires ongoing attention. Schools now have access to a wealth of guidance setting out clear and straightforward steps to achieve and maintain compliance. \"Where duty holders fall below acceptable standards, HSE has taken, and will continue to take, enforcement action\". Key ndings The results of these inspections should make clear to schools that managing asbestos requires ongoingattention. The HSE say that schools should focus particular attention on the following issues:Schools should make sure that their records are up to date. The management survey is an essential part of these records - its purpose is to locate ACMs that could be damaged or disturbed by normal activities, by foreseeable maintenance, or when installing new equipment. Schools must have an asbestos management plan. Where the status of a school changes from local authority control, the management team needs to be fully conversant with the plan and should satisfy itself that local knowledge has been incorporated. Schools must ensure that in-house operatives under taking building and maintenance work have received adequate asbestos training. Equally, dutyholders should ensure that they only use contractors that are trained to a sucient standard. Schools must have a system to inform anyone who may disturb ACMs of the presence of asbestos.

Nor-way\" actually means \"the way to the North\" in the Old Norwegian language, and this really is the High North, as the next stop is theNorth Pole. Norwegians claim that Ny-\u00c5lesund is the permanent settlement closest to the North Pole. Some Canadians and Greenlanders make the same claim about otherplaces. But I dare say: Try to nd a caf\u00e9, a post oce or an airport anywhere else at 79 degrees north. Let me try to illustrate how far north you are: I am from Lillesand in the south of Norway. If I travel the same distance from there, but go south insteadof north, I would end up in Tunis in North Africa. From here to the North Pole is only half the distance as from here to Oslo. No wonder many North Pole expeditions have started from Ny-\u00c5lesund. (Most of them were not successful, but that is another story). The size of Bangladesh, Svalbard has about 2,500 inhabitants. \"Svalbardfound\" is a statement in Viking Sagas from 1194. It is believed Norwegians travelled here from that time to hunt and sh. In 1596 William Barents rediscovered Svalbard - or Spitsbergen as he called it - on his search for the North-east Passage. It then became the scene for the rst race for oil in the Arctic, whale oil. Later, coal mining became the main source of income, and in Ny-\u00c5lesund, the Kings Bay company operated the mine. Today, things have changed. Research and tourism is more and more taking over the role of mining. There are now more than 40 nationalities present in Svalbard There is no better place to witness the large interna- tional presence than here in Ny-\u00c5lesund:Ny-\u00c5lesund is a platform for international cooperation on polar research. Researchers from 11 dierent countries in addition to those from Norway are here in the summer. Outside, you can see 2 lions protecting the Chinese research station. Climate action is at a stalemate. There are many impor- tant plans and proposals, but we are not moving fast enough, and t he process needs help. Each and every one of you are here because we consider you to be an important player. Private businesses often come up with innovations for a low-emission future. They need a stable horizon and public support to enable a green growth shift. Scientists can get the grave message out to the public by the media. We need more cooperation and coordi- nation, as we are at risk of pushing our climatesystem toward irreversible changes. The sooner we act, the lower the risk and cost. This was summed up well in the latest report from the IPCC. Nowhere do we see the impacts of climate change more evident than here in the Arctic. The region is warming 2 times faster than the global mean. The Arctic summer sea ice has shrunk by 14% per decade since 1979. Ice-free summers in the Arctic Ocean are \"very likely\" by mid-Century. We can see the eects right out the window. This fjord, \"Kongsfjorden\", or \"Kings Bay\", used to be an Arctic fjord covered by ice till early summer. Here, polar bears were trying to catch seal at their breathing holes. Not anymore, as today Kongsfjorden, like most fjords at the western coast of Svalbard, is almost com pletely open year round. These are poor conditions for ice-seals and polar bears. Hardly any ringed-seal pups survive their rst years in\"these waters anymore. I actually hesitate to talk about the polar bear in international meetings. The eects of climate change are worse in other parts of the world, where extreme weather threatens the livelihood andfood security in many countries. But the melting of the Arctic is not only a problem for polar bears - it is a global concern. The white Arctic sea ice is a good sun reflector, but the dark sea surface is less reflective. So when the ice disappears and the open waters absorb the sun's heat, global warming is amplied. As a result of this, the melting of the Greenland ice sheet is also accelerating. That might lead to a rise insea level with global consequences. The melting of Arctic sea ice also opens up economic opportunities, for exam ple new shipping routes and new areas for commercial shing. There is also discussion about oiland gas exploration up to the ice cap. The risks and consequences of ice melting count more than these opportunities. I strongly believe in having a generation perspective and not only a perspective that lasts to the next election. Norway will be a front-runner in the battle against climate change. Domestically, through policy incentives that drive innovation for a low-emission economy. And internationally, as a global leader for a strong international agreement in 2015: With mitigation numbers in Paris; With a support architecture that delivers results;A transformative agreement - building on green growth and climate resilience. Norway will remain a front-runner in international eorts to combat deforestation. Sustainable land use can deliver at least 20% and as much as 60% of the emission cuts needed by 2030 to stay below the 2 degree target. In addition, we will continue to create renewable energy in developing countries. We will combat short lived climate pollutants such as black carbon, a particular threat here in the Artic. Norway will continue to work for a right price on carbon, and the other side of that coin is subsidies on fossil fuels. Polluters should pay, not receive subsidies. Last October, I became a cabinet minister. Since then, my agenda has been extremely busy. It is therefore aprivilege to focus on 1 issue for two whole days. Even better, with leading experts from research, gov ern- ment, private sector and media. Better still, in a place where my cell phone will not work! My hope is that taking o your shoes and shaking you all together here in Ny-\u00c5lesund will create a goodenvironment for common thinking. Across disciplines. To discuss what are the best ideas, and how we can put them into practice. Former American president Mr. Abraham Lincoln once said; \"If we fail to prepare - we prepare to fail\". Failing to meet the climate challenge is not an option - so let us start preparing! This is a speech that was given by the Minister at the Ny-\u00c5lesund Symposium on 26 May Ministry of Climate and Environment www.regjeringen.no Tine Sundtoft, Minister of Climate & EnvironmentEnvironment 4647PROFILE The central parts of the Arctic Basin (the waters at and around the North Pole) may, in a few decades, be nearly ice-free during the warmest months of the year. This pro- vides new possibilities for transportroutes by water. However, thinner sea ice may provide new challenges for shipping in the Arctic due to increased variation from year to year in the extent of the sea ice. The expected growth in traffic will increase the risk of long-term damage to marine flora and fauna. As of today, the international regulatory framework is not in place to meet this challenge. Neither is the necessary capacity forrescue operations. At the Fram Centre in Troms\u00f8, Norway, a Flagship Research Programme, headed by the Norwegian Polar Institute, addresses these chal- lenges and opportunities. The German ship Beluga Fraternity was in 2009 the first non-Russian ship to pass through the North-East Passage (partly along the Russian coastline) on its way from South Korea to Western Europe. This was a milestone in inter- national shipping which provided an idea of the possibilities that lie ahead in an ice-free Arctic Basin. Polar nations are not yet ready to fully handle such a new shipping laneThe Arctic Basin - a challenging shipping lane between the continents, Norway included, but the likelihood that the Arctic Basin will be navigable for ships during parts of the year, for the next 10 to 20 years, is so big that finding solutions to the challenges of increased traffic is much needed. These challenges are both many and complicated. Safety, search and rescue are vital issues, as well as mitigating damages to the environment due to accidents. These issues are of crucial importance to all the 5 nations that border the Arctic Basin. More oil and gas installations may be constructed in the BarentsSea and in north-west Russia during the years to come, and this business activity will lead to increased navigation. Photo: Nick Cobbing, Norwegian Polar InstitutePerson on a pressure ridge in the Arctic OceanIn addition, less ice in these waters will attract more cruise-liners and lead to more scientific cruises and fishing.Traffic will be further increased as container ships and freighters make use of the new intercontinental shipping lanes across the Arctic Ocean. The Svalbard archipelago (with Spits- bergen as the main island) is the Arctic Basin's northern-most outpost of civi- lization. Due to its strategic geographical position it is easy to imagine the archi- pelago as a future base for monitoring, safety, search and rescue and oil pollution services. The issue of varying ice conditions between summers provides a special challenge. The thickness of the sea ice is now typically 2m, whereas is used to be up to 3.5m only few years ago. This thinner ice is to a greater extent driven by weather conditions. Hence, the weather will play a more important role in determining the ice conditions,meaning that there may be a practically ice-free Arctic Basin one season, while there will be a substantial ice cover the next. The years 2012 and 2013 were good examples of this; while September 2012 was an all-time low for known ice extent, there was an increase of 50% in September 2013. It may seem like a paradox, but this shows that with less sea ice in the Arctic, the need for ice prediction and knowledge about sea ice is growing. This means that the need for further climate research and technologydevelopment is increasing. The Nor- wegian Polar Institute has monitoredthe thickness of the sea ice between Greenland and the Svalbard Archipelago for 24 years. Starting in January 2015,the Institute's vessel Lance will be frozen into the ice north of the archi- pelago to serve as a floating platform for climate research.

Scientic information from the Polar Regions boosts our knowledge of the environmentalissues facing the world and is vital in order to grasp the challenges facing us, be it climate change,sea level rise or pollutants. Climate change \"Time flies\" is a saying which seems to become increasingly relevant, at least when it comes to climate change and mitigation. As Thomas Stocker, of the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), said: \"Continued greenhouse gas emissions cause further climate change and constitute multi- century commitment in the future\". The atmosphere is our common resource, and it should not be used as a dump for greenhouse gases all over the world.The IPCC has concluded that human influence on theclimate system is clear. For the rst time there are global and regional maps of climate change prognoses. The climate models have improved with better tech nology and tools. Hence, they give us a better notion of what may happen, although we still do not fully comprehend the system. There is still time to act. Measures taken by the year 2030 will be of great importance, as the need for actions beyond that year will be much more urgent and extensive, according to the panel. Sea level rise White surfaces on the Earth (ice and snow cover) reflect 80-90% of the solar energy (heat). Darker Image: Norwegian Polar InstituteEnvironment 49surfaces (open seas, land areas not covered by snow) reflect only 10-15%. As the extent of the Arctic sea ice diminishes and the Northern Hemisphere snow cover retreats, more open sea and vegetation will absorb more energy. This leads to a feedback loop of warming in the seas and over land. As the ocean warms up, it expands, as warmer water take up more space. This is one of the main reasons for the current sea level rise. The other is melting glaciers on land. The Greenland ice sheet, for example, is now losing mass at a rate which is 6 times higher than 10 years ago. Further, Antarctica has now aneg ative mass balance and Greenland and Antarctica combined influence global sea level more than all the rest of the world's glaciers. The exact contribution of melting glaciers to sea level rise in the future remains uncertain but will be signicant. Sea level rise is amajor concern not just for island states in the Pacic. Combined with more extreme weather, there is a threat to coastal states all around the world. We mustexpect more than half a meter sea level rise at the end of this century. Due to persistent circulationpat terns in the atmosphere and the ocean, sea level rise will be distributed unevenly around the globe. Ocean acidication Acidication of the world's oceans has become animportant issue in the Arctic. There is a decline of pH in the water as a result of increasing carbon dioxide (CO 2) in the atmosphere. The ocean absorbs more CO2, which in turn disturbs the balance of the marine ecosystem. Ocean acidication is of particular interest to Arctic countries, as the region is dependent upon sheries. Ecosystems have adjusted to changes in the past, but now the changes are taking place at a rate which makes it impossible for many plants and animals to adapt. Scientists working on a project ali ated with the Fram Centre in Arctic Troms\u00f8, Norway - for the Arctic Council's working group Arctic Monitoring and Assessment Programme (AMAP) - have found that the Arctic Ocean is particularly vulnerable as CO2is absorbed more quickly in cold water, and increasing quantities of freshwater entering the Arctic from rivers and melting ice are reducing the ocean's capacity to neutralise acidication.Pollution: plastic waste Another warning to the world has come through an international project to ght plastic waste in the seas. The Great Pacic Garbage Patch - approximately 3 times the size of Spain and Portugal - is one of several swirling garbage zones in the oceans. Tiny pieces of broken-down plastics, so-called micro- plastics, are a serious threat to millions of marine birds, sea turtles, sh and other organisms in the sea.They block the sunlight for algae and plankton, and many animals that mistake these and larger pieces of plastic for food end up dying with bellies full of indigestible material. The plastics may also contain hazardous substances. It has been estimated that 1 mil- lionseabirds worldwide die of plastic waste every year. In 2009, the UN released a report saying there may beas much as 6.4 billion tons of garbage added to the seas every year. Over the past 14 years the Norwegian Polar Institute's sta and colleagues have gathered 1500 tons of garbage on the beaches of the Arctic archipelago of Svalbard, for a project initiated by the Governor of Svalbard. A study recently published in the US has shown that there are also micro-plastics in Arctic sea ice. Melting of the sea ice may therefore contribute to even higher concentrations of micro- plastics in the sea. Studies in Svalbard in the 1980s showed that 30% of northern fulmars had plastic in their stomachs. In 2013 it aected as many as 90% of the northern fulmars in Svalbard. In the 1980s the plastic mostly originated from industrial activities, whereas the main source now is consumer related. A plastic bottle may last for 450 years in the ocean before it fully degrades. Consumers are not aware of this problem. It is, however, a clear message which most people in coastal regions can relate to, our experience shows. It is therefore all the more important to help sharing this www.npolar.noEnvironment 50Plan, Design and Build www.adjacentgovernment.co.ukAdjacent Planning and Building Control Today provides cutting edge policy analysis from experts combined with insight and opinions from local authorities and other professionals.

CONTACTeditorial@adjacentgovernment.co.ukThe national planning and building control publicationAdap ting to a changing Arctic Glen Peters, Senior Research Fellow at the Center for International Climate & Environmental Research in Oslo (CICERO) sheds light on changes in the Arctic and surrounding areas... Avast and rapid transformation of the Arctic and surrounding areas is taking place. There is a limited understanding of how climate, environmental, and socio-economic drivers interactin the Arctic or how those interactions will change in the future. Some interactions may amplify existingpressures, while others may bring new opportunities.As a consequence, decision making in a rapidly changing Arctic is dicult and uncertain To respond to these challenges and opportunities, the Arctic Council initiated the flagship project \"Adaptation Actions for a Changing Arctic\" (AACA). The project is conducted under the auspices of the Arctic Monitoring and Assessment Programme (AMAP) and has an overall objective to enable more informed, timely and responsive decision making in a rapidly changing Arctic. Current changes Changes in the Arctic are occurring at unprecedentedrates. The Arctic has been warming at approximately twice the global rate. The Arctic seas are projected tobecome nearly ice-free in summer within this century, and as early as mid-century. The duration, extent and depth of snow cover are changing, with some areas having increases and others decreases. Permafrost temperatures have increased by up to 2 degrees, potentially leading to surface destabilisation and releases of methane. These changes aect populations living in and outside of the Arctic. Livelihoods of indigenous peoples in the Arctic have already been altered by climate change,through impacts on food security and traditional livelihoods. Polar amplication, the stronger climatic response in the Polar Regions, may result in unexpected changes in weather patterns at lower latitudes.The rapid changes in the Arctic, particularly the declining sea ice, have placed increased attention onArctic resources. The Arctic is home to signicant untapped petroleum and mineral resources. The shorter travel distances between Europe and Asia have caught the attention of the shipping industry. As the sea ice further declines, there is likely to be increased external pressure to exploit these opportunities. Integration Conventional assessments of climate, environmental and socio-economic issues in the Arctic have mostly focused on single drivers: climate, acidication, health, oil and gas exploration and development, to name just a few. These assessments have provided valuable information, but there is currently little understanding on how these (and other) drivers of change may interact. In the Arctic, it is becoming understood that climate change is interconnected with environmental and socio-economic changes (demography, culture, development). It is the interactions that ultimately determine the physical, biological, and socioeconomic consequences of change. The combined rates of change may be faster than natural and social systems can adapt. Thawing permafrost and changing precipitation patterns may aect infrastructure, and this may becompounded by increased economic activities. Impacts on the natural and social environment may make traditional livelihoods hard to sustain. Somemarine species will shift their ranges in response to changing ocean and sea ice conditions. Existing vulnerabilities of terrestrial ecosystems will be increased. An influx of economic activity may bring new opportunities, but may also place unexpected pressures on existing natural and social systems.Environment 52Environment Responding An understanding of the interactions of these multiple drivers is necessary to inform stakeholders and decision makers as they respond to a changing Arctic. Adaptation actions are generally applied at the local level and AACA will focus on three regions: 1)Barents Region, 2) Ban Bay and Davis Strait Region, and 3) Bering, Beaufort, and Chukchi Region. All three regions will include both marine and terrestrial areas. The Barents region (Norway, Sweden, Finland, andNorthwest Russia) is the most populated with significant existing economic activities. Baffin Bay and Davis Straight (Greenland and eastern Canada) has signicant resources, but low population and expansive natural environments. The Bering, Beaufort, and Chukchi Region (Northeast Russia, USA/Alaska and most of Northern Canada) has extensive remote natural environments and low population. A pan-Arctic report will integrate the potentially contrasting ndings from these three regions and conduct a parallelpan-Arctic assessment linking to the global interest in the Arctic. An innovative feature of the reports will be a forward looking perspective. A focus on current interactionsin the Arctic improves the knowledge base, but does not meet the needs of future challenges. Adaptations depend on global and regional socio-economic developments, in addition to persistent uncertainties in predicting the future Arctic climate. The AACAproject will explore the consequences of key climate, environmental, and socio-economic uncertainties,covering short-, medium-, and long-terms. Summary The AACA project will break new ground by integrating knowledge from many dierent elds of expertise, and across regions with large cultural diversity, multiple users of local resources, and uncertaindevelopment plans. Capturing a comprehensive understanding of how the drivers of the rapidly changing Arctic are likely to interact will provide decision makers with the knowledge they need to respond to the challenges, and to prudently take advantage of opportunities. The AACA project will draw on and extend existing scientic knowledge to develop the assessment with the nal reports released during late 2016 and early2017.

Across the globe, the rst 6 weeks of 2014 saw an unusual amount of extreme weather, according to the UN's World Meteorological Organisation (WMO). In their 'Extreme Weather in Parts of the World' the WMO said: \"The UK has seenits wettest December- January period on record, with severe, widespread and prolonged flooding. A combi-nation of strong winds, storms and high tides caused damage and flooding in other coastal areas of Europe.\"1 The report continued: \"For the United Kingdom, in par- ticular, the series of winter storms has been exceptional in its duration, and led to the wettest December to January period in the UK since records began. Heavy rains combined with strong winds and high waves led to widespread flooding, coastal damage and disruption.\" Some scientists believe the recent weather phenomena is linked to the changing climate, but some argue there is nothing unusual in winter global temperatureextremes. However, while most of the UK experienced high temperatures in July, the south of the UK experi- enced flash flooding, with 43mm of rainfall in an hour. Omar Baddour, chief of the WMO data division, said the recent phenomena are almost certainly interlinked, with new computer models suggesting increased evidence of climate change.2 \"We need more time to assess whether this is unusual (on a global level) but if you look at the events in individual regions, like the heatwave in Australia or the cold in the US, it looks very unusual indeed,\" Baddour said. A report issued in March by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) suggested the eects of climate change are already being felt across the globe. Moreover, the report warned that numerous nations are ill-prepared for the risks that could occur as a result.A number of countries have already seen heavy floods, extreme heatwaves and torrential rain, which could all be attributed to the ever changing climate. The report by the IPCC 'Climate Change 2014: Impacts, Adaptation, and Vulnerability' details the impact of climate change, which has already aected agriculture, human health, ecosystems on land, and the oceans. According to the report, responding to cli mate change involves making choices about risks in a changing world. The report stated: \"The nature of risks of climate change is increasingly clear, though climate changewill also continue to produce surprises.\" It found that risk from a changing climate comes from vulnerability (lack of preparedness) and exposure (people or assets in harm's way) over lapping with hazards. Chris Field, Co-chair of Working Group II, who penned the report believes that adaptation to reduce the risks from a changing climate is now starting to occur, but the focus seems to be on past events rather than preparing for future challenges. \"Climate-change adaptation is not an exotic agenda that has never been tried. Governments, rms, and com- munities around the world are building experience with adaption,\" he said. \"This experience forms a starting point for bolder, more ambitious adaptations that will be important as climate and society mathe- matical models for everything that moves in time. Simple examples are springs and pendulum clocks. More complicated examples are the atmosphere producing the everyday weather and the solarsystem. These systems are determin- istic in the sense that the present state of the system completely deter- mines its future. In other words, prob- ability does not play a role. Since the seminal work of the mathe- matician and meteorologist E.N. Lorenz in the 1960s it is well known that even deterministic systems can be very unpredictable: small perturba- tions in the initial state may lead tolarge differences in later states. This phenomenon, which is colloquially known as chaos, hampers long-term weather forecasts and stimulatedthe development of mathematical research on nonlinear dynamics and chaos theory. Chaos is one of the most intriguing features observed in many nonlinear deterministic systems. A key question is how chaos can be distinguished from other types of dynamics. For example, a quasi-periodic time series produced by a periodically forced pendulum can already look very com- plicated, but unlike chaotic evolutions, quasi-periodic evolutions are not sen- sitive to changes in the initial condi- tion. Another important question is how chaotic behaviour can arise by changing system parameters model- ling external influences.The Johann Bernoulli Institute for Mathematics and Computer Science, based at the University of Groningen, has a longstanding tradition in the study of nonlinear deterministic systems. We develop and implement computational tools, such as power spectra, Lyapunov exponents, entropies, and fractal dimensions. These tools help to distinguish different types of dynamical behaviour. Our research is strongly interdiscipli- nary. We collaborate with biologists, meteorologists, physicists, and engi- neers to help them understand com- plex and unpredictable behaviour in their models. In very different models one can observe similar behaviour. This is an indication for the existence of universal properties which are shared by many systems. The Johann Bernoulli Institute is one of the key players in unravelling the mecha-nisms behind chaos.Prof Dr Henk W ScienceUniversity of GroningenUnravelling chaos A strange attractor detected in an atmospheric model and its power spectrum. The spectrum shows distinct peaks, which is typical for quasi-periodicity, and broadband spectrum, which is typical for chaos. For more information see: A.E.

After a century that has seen the widespread use of radioactive materials in industrialprocesses, and its subsequent disposal in landll sites, the hazards to human health from landcontaminated by radioactive material - known asradionuclides - is an issue that has only recently been addressed by government. Through the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Aairs (Defra), its executive body the Environment Agency, the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA), and the North ern Ireland Environment Agency (NIEA), the UK has now established a legal framework and practical guidelines to remedy and assign liability for this most dangerous and long-lasting type of pollution. These new powers have been introduced as a result of the need to comply with EU Directive 96/29/EURATOM which in 1996 addressed the dangers of radiation exposure from man-made sources by establishing strictnew safety standards. The Directive was introduced to provide greater protection to workers, but the UK statutory response has also introduced new envi ronmental protection measures. Work preparing the regulations revealed just how little informationthere was on the extent of the problem. The new legal framework had to be comprehensive enough to cover the potential risk to health from all types of radioactive land, but beyond the acknowledged sources of contamination such as nuclear plants, waste facilities and MoD sites, no one could even estimate how many sites there were across the country. For most of the 20th Century the hazards caused by the use and disposal of radioactive materials were not thoroughly understood, and were of little interest to government. It was not until the Radioactive Substances Act came into force in 1963 that the risks of contamination began to be addressed, and it wasEnvironment 58Environment not until the rst decade the 21st Century that a study was commissioned by Defra, the Environment Agency, and the Welsh Assembly to establish how much damage had already been done, and wherethe sources of that pollution might lie. 'Indicators for Land Contamination' was an independent report published in 2005.1It estimated that the number of contaminated sites was between 150 and 250,with an upper limit of anything up to 1000. While the report could only identify where the most likely areas of the most serious risk would be - such as former metal processing works and uranium mines - it did specify precisely the method by which the risks to health from the polluted land were to be identied. \"For most of the 20th Century the hazards caused by the use and disposal ofradioactive materials were not thoroughly understood, and were of little interest to government.\" The report established that it is not enough for the land itself to show evidence of radioactivity. To be ocially classied as contaminated land the source of the radiation has to cause harm, or pose a signicantrisk of harm to human health by way of a pollutant link known as a pathway. The report cites examples of pathways such as eating food grown on an irradiatedsite, breathing in airborne dust, and drinking from contaminated groundwater. In practical terms this means that the specialists cleaning up radioactive pollution have to be able to carefully identify and monitor the treatment of thepathways, not just provide the safe disposal of all the radioactive source material, because not all the radioactive material on a site, such as polluted soil,may be classied as a contaminating risk to health. The legal framework and guidelines that the government nally introduced between 2007 and 2012 makes this targeted treatment regime fundamental to any clean-up process.2To ensure this, and that plans for remedial work are cost eective, technically appropriate, and occur over a reasonable period of time without unrea sonable social or environmental cost, Defra's Environment Agency has been given complete control as the enforcing authority.Once land has been identied as contaminated, which is the responsibility of the appropriate local authority, it is for the Environment Agency to specify what reme dial treatments have to be undertaken, and who is liable for the cost. The Agency is legally bound to mitigate all the risks involved in the remedial work that may lead to exposure to radioactivity. For example the removal of soil may create a new pollutant pathway by releasing contaminated dust into the air. Giventhe existence of such a risk the Agency will ensure that the area of land to be treated has been clearly identied and demarcated, its access regulated, and a system of regular monitoring has been established to ensure that impact of the treatment is minimised. To ensure these procedures are justied and optimised to provide the maximum benet with the least detriment - which includes potential damage to land or blight to property, the Agency will take advice from experienced practitioners. The Agency though, has the right tochange the scope and focus of the remediation workif new information becomes available or the situation on the site changes. Given the Environment Agency's complete authority, it is not enough for a practitioner to be able to technically solve a contamination problem, it must also have the resources to adapt and meet the Environment Agency's stringent legally enforceable requirements. 1'Indicators for www.gov.uk/government/uploads/sys- tem/uploads/attachment_data/le/290711/scho0805bjmd-e-e.pdf 2To enable this Part 2A of the Environmental Protection Act 1990 was extended in 2006-7, with additional statutory Guidelines published and clean-upNuclear decommissioning and clean-up We have more than 3,300 nuclear specialists - some of the most renowned world experts in the industry - who support customers around the world by providing solutions to complex problems.

Poultry diseases greatly reduce the eciency of food production, both in developed and Third World countries. Governments regulate certain diseases where it is in the public interest to do so. Examples include epizootic diseases which cause major outbreaks throughout the world, and also some diseases which can spread to humans, known as zoonotic diseases, one example of which is Salmo nellosis. If we consider epizootic disease rst: An example of a major epizootic disease is Avian Influenza, which has major cost implications for the world wide poultry industry, as well as its eect on human health. One outbreak in Hong Kong in 1997 is estimated to have cost US$100s of millions, including knock on eects.Closer to home, there was a major outbreak in Holland in 2003 and there have been a number of smaller scale outbreaks in the UK over the last decade. Epizootic disease generally results in direct losses due to the death and culling of poultry and the disruption to the food chain; other associated losses can be as a result of reduced consumer demand, loss of income to farmers and retailers, lost genetic potential within the breeding pyramid and its eect on international trade. Poultry producers and government have a common interest in keeping out epizootic disease. The poultry industry in Northern Ireland (NI) is highly integrated and the Department of Agriculture and Rural DevelopmentAgriculture 62Agriculture (DARD) holds regular stakeholder meetings where matters of common concern are discussed including biosecurity and the level of risk posed by epizootic disease. They are also involved in contingency planning procedures and exercises for epizootic disease in NI.In the case of Avian Influenza which is also a zoonotic disease, the public health organisations are also involved. Because of this close co-operation, regulatory controls can be kept to a minimum, and where government controls are necessary, they have industry support. DARD provides biosecurity advice to the industry by leaflet, on their website, and when it has sta on theflockowner's premises. The poultry organisations also provide training and advice to their employees andtheir growers. This means that poultry workers are well educated and motivated. \"Epizootic disease generally results in direct losses due to the death and culling of poultry and the disruption to the food chain; other associated losses can be as a result of reduced consumer demand, loss of income to farmers and retailers, lost genetic potential within the breeding pyramid and its eect on internationaltrade. \" The principles of disease control are simple - prevent it coming in, and if it does get in, prevent it spreading, and eradicate it quickly. These principles apply at both state and farm level, so both government and poultryproducers have their role to play. Government's responsibility is to ensure that only safe produce enters NI, which it does by enforcing the import regulations. We are fortunate that we are partof an island with a common disease status and similar disease control strategies, and this helps to regulate the importation of live poultry and food. These controlsare enforced by veterinary service checks at the ports and airports. These checks include both commercial consignments of poultry as well as personal imports of food by travellers from high risk third countries. At the farm level, there is a mirror image of controlswhere the flockowner ensures that he controls therisks of diseases going onto the premises. While thesebiosecurity controls are necessary to control epizooticdisease, they also control many of the production diseases of poultry. In eect, a farmer's poultry prem ises is his \"fortress\" and he controls all movements of personnel, equipment, feed, and poultry onto his premises. There is also a requirement to report the presence of suspect cases of notiable diseases. This is required in legislation and forms part of our disease surveil- lance, an early warning of the possible appearance of an epizootic disease outbreak. This benets from having well educated and motivated poultry workers. However, in relation to other disease controls including zoonotic diseases, there is a regulatory requirement to sample poultry for salmonella under the National Control Programme which requires sampling on farms by the poultry operators as well as separately by the Department. These samples not only ensure flock health is monitored but also provide a food safety assurance to the public. There is a code ofprac tice in place to which the poultry industry have contributed, and this provides an assurance to the public and also to DARD that good biosecurity standards are being maintained by the industry itself. This in turn reduces the level of enforcement required by DARD. The good relationship between the Department and the poultry industry in NI is evidence that where stakeholders recognise the need to control disease, itreduces the need for direct government enforcement of biosecurity on poultry farms. The common govern- ment-industry interest in prevention, and if necessary, the prompt eradication of epizootic disease helps maintain a vibrant poultry sector www.dardni.gov.uk 63A Bio-secure future for poultry farms Biosecurity is an integral part of poultry farming to ensure a high level of health and welfare is achieved, here the European Rural Poultry Association (ERPA) explains why... European Rural Poultry Association (ERPA) was created in May 2007 to defend, support and develop the production of rural poultry in the European Union. ERPAs members are producers' organisations and breeders from Belgium, Spain, France, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Czech Republic and Romania. Rural poultry is highly diverse in nature and varies according to the country: Family poultry; Young stock sold alive directly or at markets; Poultry sold with national quality certication (like Label Rouge in France), under PGI or PDO, or reared organically; Free range poultry produced by organised outlets, etc.They concern 2 distinct sectors of production: poultryfor meat and eggs. All of the types of rural poultry are reared extensively, in accordance with animal welfare, and are from coloured rustic breeds with low growth rate. Slow growth and low stock density are important advan tages that ensure poultry is better adopted to natural envi ronments and increased resistance to diseases. Scientic works clearly show it. For example, according to Cesare Castellini from the Faculty of Agraria di Perugia who spoke at the General Assembly of ERPA in 2013, a correlation has been demonstrated between the influence of growth rate and the immunity of animals. Organic poultry production, with the use of rustic breeds, small farms, low stock density, and a high level of welfare, is a very good example of a rural poultry production system that promotes healthyAgriculture 64Agriculture poul try. ERPA is also providing a signicant support to organic production, with clear rules of dierentiation of the method of production, but adapted to thespecicities of farms, as well as to market constraints. In health terms, this production is strictly legislated and as well as conventional production, with rules of biosecurity and control on farms and at slaughterhouses. \"ERPA works in general to improve health, welfare and food safety in rural poultry farms, so as to entirely answer toconsumers who expect products of high safety and taste.\" In addition to these characteristics of rural poultry production, it is very important for poultry producers to implement biosecurity measures that can limit disease on farms. The farm economy depends directly on it. Europe is the area where health regulation is the strictest in the world. This regulation will also bestrengthened with the future EU animal health law. Between Member States, more precise rules arebeing applied, with the objective of limiting the spread of diseases. Some examples of actions inMember States are: In Belgium, in 2011 the Wallonia formalised a decree dening the minimum dierentiated quality criteria in poultry production. It denes rules relatives to methods of production - using for example coloured rustic breeds reared for a longer period -to environmental and health aspects, as well as to the principle of family farming; In Spain, guides of good hygiene practices of rearing poultry have been dened, including rural poultry; In Italy guides of good hygiene practices of rearing poultry have also been dened, and the totaltrace ability, from production to slaughter, has been established for 2 years; In France, the legislation species the recognised poultry farming methods, and denes the conditions, for example sanitary conditions, for the use of theterm \"traditional\" corresponding to rural poultry. And technical specications approved by the Ministry of Agriculture denes the criteria for Label Rouge poultry production - a part of rural poultry production. ERPA works in general to improve health, welfare and food safety in rural poultry farms, so as to entirely answer to consumers who expect products of high safety and taste. ERPA is an important forum of discussion on these issues for its members, to propose to the European authorities the principles to apply that ensure farms are well managed. In particular ERPA defends: use of rustic breeds; extensive farming with low stock ing rate; respect of animal welfare; simple and easily accessible poultry houses for cleaning and, disinfecting correctly. Each member of ERPA defends these positions in hiscountry, and can work with research institutes onthese issues, for example by organising exchanges and technical seminars need for the world's food products from animal origin, like meat, milk or eggs, will continue to grow in the coming decades. The main reasons are population growth and an increase in the numbers of people who can afford valuable food, like the fast growing middle-classes in China and India. The feed sector is an essential partner of the European food industry - sup- plying sufficient, safe, high quality and healthy foods like meat or milk. The feed and feed production technolo- gies also need to help the livestock sector - addressing the challenges of sustainability and resilience. Most of the challenges have a clear feed dimension as reported recently by the European Feed Manufacturers' Feder- ation (FEFAC): Improve the resource efficiency (in other words produce more with less) Contribution to animal health Socially responsible livestock farming (how to minimize the negative impactof livestock farming on the environment)The Swiss based company AGOLIN SA is serving the feed industry with innovative products based on plant extracts. Many years of research has resulted in specific blends of compo- nents for different species with clear benefits to the animals, the farmers and the environment. A contributionto reach the challenging targets of the feed sector. Feed conversion rate Different plant active ingredients are selected for the AGOLIN products.Added value to animal nutrition 66AGOLIN POULTRY contains pungent substances from pepper, which sup- ports gut health as well as essential oils with effects on pathogens. Proof of the concept is the perform- ance achieved in a German field trial of 40,000 birds (Ross). They were fed with a commercial feed and split in two groups (with and without the sup- plementation of AGOLIN). The birds fed with the AGOLIN supplement did grow 2% faster and the feed conver- sion rate was improved by 4.2%. (FCR = kg feed intake / kg weight gain)PROFILE Fefac targets 2030 - 30% feed conversion rate - Reduction of use for antibiotics - 20% greenhouse gas production - 40% Nitrogen and Phosporus excretion CONTROL AGOLIN57.456.4 CONTROL AGOLIN1.39 1.45Broiler Performance Daily Weight Gain (g) Feed Conversion Rate (at 1,500g)One of the researchers' focus when developing AGOLIN was the effect on Clostridia. Clostridia are organisms present in the digestive tract of mono- gastric animals and are one of the main reasons for growth depression. In vitroresearch carried out by top class Universities demonstrated a slow-down of the growth of Clostridium Perfrin- gens when components of AGOLIN were present in low concentrations. AGOLIN was also the first company launching a product with coated tan- nins. AGOLIN TANNIN is a unique, coated chestnut extract, which con- tains hydrolysable tannins. The prod- uct is designed to maintain a high level of feed intake and animal per- formance by using the special effects of chestnut extracts on the digestive system, with the main effect of improved litter quality as demonstrated in different institutes, like in the well known AVIFORMUM in Switzerland. Wet litter is a sign of an unbalanced gut ecosystem, and can be the reason for footpad lesions in meat poultry too. Greenhouse gas reduction A trial at INRA (Institut de Recherche Agricole, France) confirms the signifi- cant effect of AGOLIN RUMINANT to reduce the production of the green house gas methane in ruminants. Methane production is a natural process of rumen fermentation and represents an energy loss for the cow. Therefore mitigating the methane production has not only a positive effect on the environment but also on the performance. One example is the research trial carried out with 600 high yielding dairy cows by the University of California. The main finding was a significantly improved feed efficiency. With the same amount of feed, the Holstein animals fed with AGOLIN produced 3.2kg more milk as shownon the graphic www.agolin.com 67 PROFILE CONTROL AGOLINInfluence on Litter Quality DM on day 29 (%)70 60 5040 30CONTROL AGOLIN-32%281.8410.6Methane, l/day In research trials AGOLIN RUMINANT did show methane mitigating effects of at least 15-20%. By adding this supplement to the ration of all 23 million dairy cows in the EU-28 a decrease of over 500,000 tons of methane or about 10 million tons ofCO2equivalent, which represents 1% of the total CO2output of the EU.

These best-in-class products have been successfully introduced into Europe, Asia and the US. AGOLIN's quality management system (FAMI-QS) ensures safety and guaran- tees traceability. The company is a member of FEFANA,the Association of European feed additives and premixtures operators. AGOLIN's first took part in an EU research project in 2010 -SMEthane, a technologigal platform developing nutritional additives to reduce methane (FP7).Forests play a pivotal role in the environment, here Adjacent Government assesses how Switzerland's forests are maintained... Forests not only act as places of tranquillity and recreation, but also play a major role in providing essential services and resources for people, plants and animals. Across the globe, forests contribute substantially to the conservation of landscape diversity, as well as contributing to the greenhouse gas balance. Over the past few decades forest cover has increased in the EU. In Switzerland, approximately one third (over 75%) is covered in forest, with around one thirdof that located in the Alps. According to the FederalOce for the Environment (FOEN) in Switzerland, forests have 422 million m 3of growing stock in the country, and of this 33% is represented by deciduous trees and 67% by coniferous trees.1 Between 2007 and 2011, Switzerland's forest area increased by 2.5%, which is due to the reclamation ofagricultural and alpine pasture areas in the Alpine region and the Southern Alps. According to the FOENthe standing volume of the forests continued to increase by roughly 1.4% between 2007 and 2011. The total forest area in Switzerland is increasing, but changes occurring in the forest can vary signicantlyfrom region to region, with the biggest increase being seen in the Alps. The FOEN plays a major role in monitoring the country's forests and ensuring natural resources are used sustainably. In line with the sustainability strategy of the Federal Department of the Environment, Transport, Energy and Communications (DETEC), the central goals of the FOEN are: Long-term preservation and sustainable use of natural resources (land, water, forests, air, climate,Agriculture 68 Managing the forests of SwitzerlandAgriculture biological and landscape diversity) and elimination of existing damage; Protection of the public against excessive pollution (noise, harmful organisms and substances, non- ironizing radiation, wastes, contaminated land and major incidents); Protection of people and signicant assets against hydrological and geological hazards (floodingearth quakes, avalanches, landslides, erosion and rockfalls).2 In accordance with these goals, the FOEN has the responsibility for the environmental monitoring to provide a sound basis for the management of resources. Due to air pollution, Switzerland's forests are under huge pressure, and are becoming more sensitive to acute events such as drought, storms, diseases and pests. The most important protection measure is the Federal government's ban on deforestation, as part of the government's Forest Policy 2020. The Policy creates eective conditions for sustainable, ecient, andinno vative forest management and ensures that forests can carry out their various functions. The government aims to tap the sustainable, utilisable potential of wood, and the Wood Action Plan implements the government's wood resource policy. The action plan initiates and supported projects between 2009and 2016 that pertain to wood as a raw material and its exploitation. The Forest Policy 2020 is also used to conserve biodiversity by supporting forest reserves and conserving priority habitats such as forest edges and wooded pastures. Forest areas are very important for species diversity, and its management plays a key role in biodiversity and the stability of the 69 Forests and some of the services they provide have been promi- nently on the international agenda,gaining considerable public attention: conservation, biodiversity, carbon storage, recreation or wilder- ness are the most notable issues thereof. Although those services only came on the public agenda from the 1960s, they have dominated the set of positive perceptions that people have of forests. On the other hand, their perception of harvesting wood and fiber has become critical or even neg- ative - amplified by ongoing defor- estation -which is often attributed to forestry although it is mainly in effect of land conservation. This change in perception is contrary to the fact that the world consump-tion of forest products is about 0.5m\u00b3 per capita per year, with an upper limit of about 1m\u00b3 per capita per year in industrialised countries. This situation is creating a paradox that industri-alised societies have been developing quite critical attitudes towards har- vesting of natural resources, while positively perceiving immaterial services of forests. The present contribution aims to provide a quantity structure of the wood and fiber use, to argue that forest engineering is a main driver in improving the effectiveness and efficiency of forest resource use, and to outline some challenges that we are facing in making the supply ofwater and fiber more efficient and more environmentally sound.The worldwide wood production is about 3.5 billion m\u00b3 per year, which corresponds to about 0.5m\u00b3 per capita per year. This figure splits between about 1.6 billion m\u00b3 indus-trial roundwood and about 1.9 billion m\u00b3 which is fuel. According to the FAO statistics the largest producers are: the European Union with about 430 million m\u00b3 per year, followed by China with about 335 million m\u00b3, the United States of America with about 325 mil- lion m\u00b3, Brazil with about 270 million m\u00b3, and the Russian Federation with about 175 million m\u00b3. Those figures illustrate the important role forest engineering - the science to design the infrastructure systems for wood transportation, to layout and deployForest engineering, the backbone of timber and fiber supply 70harvest operations that are physically effective, economically viable, envi- ronmentally sound, and institutionally acceptable. In industrialised countries, fully mechanised harvesting systems have been the backbone of timber supply, whereas manual and motor-manual systems are still dominating in developing countries. The most sophisticated production systems rely on mathematical models that support and optimise the design, layout, and control decisions of harvesting operations. The public perception of harvesting operations is often 'romanticised', PROFILE following the imagination that crafts- men are doing a hard and dangerous job to fell trees, to delimb them, and to extract the logs with the use of gravity and animal power. Lay persons have been perceiving mechanisedharvesting systems as 'far fromnature' and as threatening, although they reduced the occupational accident rate dramatically, improve economic efficiency, and are continu- ously improving the environmental soundness of operations. This lack of acceptance is most prominent in urbanised areas, where people think that large machines are bad and that manual work is good, neglecting the fact that the educational accident rate of manual forest work is among the highest of all sectors. This change of public perception resulted in a loss of reputation of forest work and of the occupational status of forest workers. In industrialised countries, it has become more and more difficult to recruit talented people who are willing to spend their career as a forest worker or machine operator. We can see the same on the level of higher education, where many pro- grams in forest engineering, or areasof specialisation, respectively, have been disappearing. Australia is the most prominent example, where there is no longer any university program in forest engineering, and where industry has great difficulty to find forest engineering specialists with a sound educational background. Our previous thoughts focused on forest engineering and its core busi- ness, harvesting. Harvesting activities rely on a resource base, which is limited. Nowadays, one inhabitant of the European Union relies on an aver-age living space of about 1.2 soccer fields per capita, of which 35% are covered with forest, and which 25% is forest dedicated for wood production. Considering that the population will still be slightly increasing, and that a considerable part of the forest area is removed for biodiversity, nature reserves or wilderness, we are facing the big challenge 'to make more out of less forest area'. Additionally, there are several policy streams that are competing for the same forest area: (1) wood and fiber use, (2) bioenergy use, (3) carbon storage, (4) biodiver- sity, (5) quality-of-life services, such as protection, recreation, or leisure, and (6) the 'dream of wilderness'. The 'food and fiber use' policy stream does not seem to have political advo- cates, which are bearing the risk that wood production will further decline. Traditionally, well-ordered forestry has its roots in the overuse of forests in the 17th and 18th Century, whenstrategies and rules were introduced to follow a 'sustained yield forestry' philosophy. This overuse phenomenon, known as 'tragedy of the Commons',in recent years turned into the opposite in many European countries, and economists termed it 'tragedy of the anti-Commons'. The tragedy of the anti-Commons occurs, if a forest owner formally has the right to use his forest land, but is facing several agents who have a veto right to prevent his harvesting. Theequilibrium for such an arrangementis always on a lower harvesting levelthan in a non-veto-right regime. Our rough analysis of the problems and challenges that forest engineering is facing is raising the question, whatETH Zurich Institute of Terrestrial Ecosystems (ITES) www.ethz.ch 71PROFILE courses of action could improve the situation? In our point of view, there are four areas of action. First, there is a need to decouple the six policy streams - wood and fiber use, bioenergy use, carbon storage, biodiversity, quality-of-life services,'dream of wilderness' - by questioning the multi-functionality concept and by exploring segmentation strategies. Second, the 'tragedy of the anti- Commons' problem has to be addressed by exploring institutional arrangements that overcome the dilution of property rights (user rights and meet the rights are allocated to considerable number of agents). Third, a concerted, cross-national action is required to re-establish capacity building, particularly on a university level, where forest engineering programs have been continuously disappearing. Fourth, novel land-use concepts are required to 'make more out of less',among which precision land-use concepts are offering opportunities toconcurrently control biological, tech- nical and administrative processes in real-time for a whole supply network.Getting beyond the surface of blue growth potential Describing the benets of blue growth within Europe, Maria Damanaki, European Commissioner for Marine Aairs and Fisheries details the importance of acting now to build on existing progress... The \"blue economy\" is already creating new jobs in Europe. But we have only just scratched the surface of its potential. We have been thinking about how to build on existing progress and how wecan benet from new research insights to ensure that this maritime economy can continue to generate jobsacross Europe. As the European and global economies continue to navigate themselves out of dangerous waters, the world has to face up to twin challenges. How do we provide the economic opportunities to lift people outof poverty bearing in mind that there will be at least another billion of us on the planet in the next decade or so? And how do we address environmental risks that, if left unmitigated, could lead to a catastrophe in which we do not have the resources to provide the energy or food we need to live? Both questions need to be tackled without delay if we are to ward o disaster for the next generation. So unsurprisingly the European Union's focus is on supporting those areas which can address both the need for economic growth and the need to preserve our planet. This is why we are turning to the blue economy. Our recently adopted EU strategy on Blue Growth is where these twin challenges meet - it is all about prioritising the use of ocean resources sustainably as a driver for growth and jobs in Europe. Every year half the planet's sunlight falls on seas and oceans and half the organic matter is created there. The wind, the tides and waves oer energy thatdoes not contribute to global warming. Every year a higher proportion of new wind farms are alreadybuilt oshore whilst sh and shellsh, increasingly from sh farms, are the fastest growing source of animal protein worldwide. The blue economy is already creating new jobs in Europe but we have only scratched the surface of its potential. We have been thinking about how to build on existing progress and how we can benet from new research insights to ensure that this blue economy can continue to generate jobs across Europe. This year's European Maritime Day Conference, held in Bremen, Germany in May, was a big part of that thinking. Over 2 days ministers, industry experts,policy makers, and many others debated and swapped ideas as to how the dierent sectors in the maritime economy can work together catalyse the investment and innovation needed for sustained growth. Participants concluded that: There is a vast potential for jobs and sustainable growth in the maritime economy. To exploit it we need to invest more in knowledge and innovation and focus on placing sustainability at the heart of Blue Growth. The issues related to seas and oceans can only be addressed at international level - more global governance is of paramount importance. The EU's Maritime Spatial Planning and Maritime Security Strategy are good examples of what can be achieved. The timing of the European Maritime Day Conference was ideal, as it took place only 2 weeks after we unveiled our EU action plan to drive innovation in the maritime economy. If we are to exploit our waters in a sustainable way, a number of challenges need tobe overcome.SPECIAL FOCUS: Marine 72SPECIAL FOCUS: Marine For instance our knowledge about the sea is still limited and maritime research in dierent countries is not linked up. Unsurprisingly access to nance is also a recurring theme heard when out and about talking to researchers and entrepreneurs alike. We are doing what we can to cut red tape and incentivise investment across all industries. But we have also identied 3 issues that are particular to the blue economy - poor marine knowl- edge, fragmented marine research and shortage of skills. We will address those by reducing bottlenecks in accessing marine data, creating a multi-resolution seabed map of European waters and by making surethat we have the people with the right skills in place to ll the new jobs we hope to create. We don't just need to develop innovative products but also ensure that we continue to develop the skills and technology needed for the longer term. That's why we are extending programmes like Erasmus to include fostering cooperation in education and training and why, through our dedicated research and innovationfund, we will equip Europe's best scientists and inno- vators with the tools they need to do their work. The costs of cutting-edge research is greater than ever before, and even with our investment are often toolarge for individual organisations so we will encourage and incentivise co-operation and results sharing. Our seas and oceans, just like all other natural resources, are not innitely substitutable and global environmental and economic challenges are on anunprecedented scale. The way we respond to them will require greater levels of ingenuity and innovation than ever before. I am glad for having picked the brains of Europe's brightest minds in Bremen's Euro pean Maritime Day and seen the maritime sector to share ideas on how sustainable growth from the seas can bring Europe's economy back to safer waters and ensure that we leave a legacy of opportunity to for Maritime Affairs and Fisheries European Commission www.ec.europa.eu/commission_2010-2014/damanaki/index_en.htm 73 Driven by the ingenuity and innovational vision of its co-founder and now pioneer CEO, Skaginn's Super Chilling solutions offer a range of benefits. Through highly automated features, Super Chilling increases yield, preserves quality, adds to product value and can double shelf life. The efficient processing - now with a revolutionary high speed, gentle handling, quality controlled weighing and packing system - eliminates unnecessary product transport and thus reduces carbon footprint. Already an industry leader in Iceland when it comes to efficient pelagic processing, freezing and chilling solutions, Skaginn's growing reputa- tion for its adaptability to tailor make solutions to individual assignments if needed, is fast establishing the company as a key player in a fiercely competitive international environment. Skaginn and 3X join forces Skaginn's recent acquisition of an 80% stake in 3X Technology - another leader in its field in Iceland - has further fortified its position, coupled with an 1800 square metre expansion of its manufacturing facilities. The two companies, established in traditional Icelandic fishing towns, have a historySkaginn - Icelandic pioneers in Super Chilling 74of co-operation on a range of projects, making closer ties between them a logical progression. Only recently Skaginn has delivered two major pelagic processing facilities. One in Iceland, the other in the Faroe Islands. A key feature of the new facilitiesis the weighing and packing system supported by the combined use of weighing and vision techniques. The system creates an accurate batch of the pre-selected fish in a hopper weighing unit and then sends it to a bagging machine together with traceability information per batch for barcode printing. PROFILE A Skaginn technician makes final adjustments to ensure the production line delivers to its capacityEmerging markets In addition to its pelagic systems, Skaginn has commissioned a large- scale IQF freezing system for Regal Springs in Mexico, one of the world's largest tilapia producers. What makes the freezer unique is that it can beused for individual quick freezing while simultaneously used for super- chilling. Skaginn has also recently completed an IQF solution for scallops for Seatrade and Eastern Fisheries in Boston. The company is currently working with the local staff of Friosur in Chile to improve quality and to examine a potential overhaul of its production procedures. Volumes replaced by values Iceland's fishing industry has been through some tough years, emerging as not only one of the most modernin existence, but also one of the most progressive. When quotas are tight, values replace volumes. In an industry where there are no state subsidies and no safety net to fall back on, you have to push hard, break with convention, sometimes forgo tradition and break new ground. These are exactly the values that have driven Skaginn's innovative approach. About Skaginn Founded in 1998, the company's roots lie in the fishing industry, initially as a specialized department of the local shipyard in Akranes in West Iceland. Goundwork for the the development of sophisticated hi-tech solutions within the seafood industry simultaneously opened up channels into the meat and poultry industries. Skaginn's products include Pelagic Processing Solutions, 75IQF Freezers, Automatic Box Freezers, Fluid Ice Systems, Tup Tippers, Ice Clean cleaning systems and more. Skaginn's co-founder and now principal owner and CEO is Ing\u00f3lfur \u00c1rnason. Financially robust, the combined number of the group's staff is around 170.

Our process and products effectively eliminate and prevent the development of biofilm, thus reducing potential micro-organism attack and damage to thefish and seafood. This also controls and reduces the incidence of pathogenic (e-coli, listeria, campylobacter, salmonella) and spoilage bacteria (Pseudomonas) as well as fungi to give better shelf life and reduce the potential for foodborne disease. Controlling enzymatic reactions and oxidation also ensures thebest quality and higher yields. Further to the health benefits, our processes and products are safe to use and non-residual, which allows the food to retain its natural texture, appearance and taste. These factors are applied in the following stages: On board vessels and within factories to ensure that all tanks, pipework and equipment is keptfree from bacteria. In ice-making equipment to keep all of the equipment and process water clean and free from harmful bacteria.

The use of nc-fresh (rosemary blend) keeps the slurry fresh for as long as possible as blood, bacteria and enzymes from the fish will contaminate the slurry in time. This under-cooling slurry lowers the fish core temperature down to -0.5\u00b0C at the start of the process, and ends at \u00b10.0\u00b0C in around 10 hours. The natural-freshlong under-cooling method cleans, controls temperature, gives longer freshness and saves yield and gaping in the later processes. The gills are the first to breakdown due to blood and bacteria, therefore it is important to remove the head as soon as possible after landing. The stomach area is full of bacteria and enzymes, bringing negative consequences to the shelf-life of the product/raw material, whilst waiting for processing. Haddock is softer than cod and its stomach has stronger enzymes. By using our methods, it is evident that all kinds of white fish, mackerel and tuna retain more of the original, natural quality which results in a better quality product. The natural-freshlong under-cooling method does not increase the weight of the fish, as the fish does not absorb salt, water, nor rosemary residue. Neither does it lose protein (drip loss).

Sigurgeir Gu\u00f0laugsson CEO Zymetech Fiskislod 551 5400 siddi@zymetech.com www.zymetech.com Fisheries have always been a part of human survival, development and welfare, but there is a need to address the management of fish- eries resources, post-harvest handling and processing and aquaculture to achieve the UN sustainable development goals for the post 2015 development agenda. For the EU to implement its Blue growth policy it must look beyond its borders. A measure of the challenges in the sector is staggering: About 75% of landings from capture fisheries and over 90% of farmed fish come from developing countries1; About 10% of the world population depends to a large extent on fisheries for their livelihood; Fish constitute about 20% of animal protein consumed in developing countries, and about 25% in low income food deficient countries; Net export of fish from developing countries has grown rapidly and now exceeds USD 35 billion per year2; FAO estimates that about 90% of exploited fish stocks are either overfished or fully fished. An economic analysis of world fish- eries carried out by the World Bank in 2009 suggests that improved manage- ment in capture fisheries can increase economic rent by about 50 billion USDannually 3. Establishment of the UNU-FTP The United Nations University Fisheries Training Programme (UNU-FTP) was established in 1998 in Iceland when the UNU signed an agreement with the Iceland Ministry for Foreign Affairs and the Marine Research Institute (MRI). The MRI provides expertise to the UNU - FTP in stock assessment and fishing technology and partner universities and research institutes in Iceland pro- vide expertise in fisheries economics, food science, aquaculture and man- agement of fisheries companies. Professional development for the sustainable use of living aquatic resources Current handling and fish processing practices lead to post-harvest losses and compromise food safety. Improved education and skills training could minimise losses and increase the value of stocks while providing a base for dealing with overfishing. The UNU- FTP supports global research based capacity building by enhancing institu- tional and individual capacity to develop sustainable use of living aquatic resources, supporting part- ners in meeting their development goals. It is primarily funded by the Icelandic government, but also engages in capacity development activities on a cost sharing basis with partner countries and international organisa- tions. The UNU-FTP has increased professional skills and knowledge by working in the fisheries sector in nearly 50 countries since 1998.Professional development in fisheries The contribution of sheries to human well being 78The educational activities of the UNU- FTP comprise three interlinked areas complementary to one another. 1. Learning from each other - a six month post-graduate course in Iceland The core activity of the UNU-FTP is a six month applied programme in Iceland designed for practicing profes-sionals in developing countries. Professional development is at the heart of the programme which follows the model of education for sustain- able development as promoted by UNESCO 4. By 2014 286 fellows from 49 countries had successfully completed the six month course. The programme starts each Septem- ber with about 20 fellows from 12-14 countries. The aim for the first six weeks is for fellows to develop a wide perspective on fisheries and thedevelopment potential of their own fisheries. There has been a special focus on Sub-Saharan Africa and Small Island Development States. After one week of orientation is five week course which gives a globaloverview of fisheries and aquaculture. The multidisciplinary nature of the sector is addressed and fellows contribute and make presentations on various aspects of their fisheries and put them into regional and global context and discuss their develop- ment potential. During this part of the programme a number of visits are made to regulatory and research PROFILEinstitutions, private companies and fishing communities. Fellows must also formulate and defend their personal development goals for their work in Iceland. In the 7th week specialist training starts. A range of research Institutions and universities in Iceland are respon- sible for six week intensive courses, which are followed by a 14 week indi- vidual research project. The projects address an issue in their home coun- tries and are often based on data and other information fellows bring with them or collect during the project period. Each fellow has one or twosupervisors for their projects and UNU-FTP staff monitor progress through regular meetings with fellows and their supervisors. In some cases the fellows in the sixmonth programme are part of exter- nally funded projects in their home institutions and their work in Iceland. The final project not only promotes individual professional development but also contributes to the successful implementation of the project. 2. Learning together - short courses in partner countries Since 2004, the UNU-FTP and national, regional and international partners have developed and delivered short courses in many countries. So far about 30 courses have been held in 14 countries, many of them more than once, involving about 1000 participants. The courses are based on local case studies, often from final projects in thesix month course. Former fellows are involved in the development, preparation and delivery of the courses, in coopera- tionwith colleagues from Iceland. The short courses are based in local training institutions and universities. \"Current handling and fish processing practices lead to post-harvest losses and compromise food safety. Improved education and skills training could minimise losses and increase the value of stocks while providing a base for dealing with over- fishing. \" 3. Further learning - scholarships for former fellows The UNU-FTP offers scholarships to selected former fellows to study towards either MSc or PhD degrees at Icelandic universities. The research project must in part be carried out in the candidate's home country and must always address issues of particular importance to the home countries. So far 11 MSc and 13 PhDscholarships have been awarded. Learning to transform oneself and society During the 16 years since its establish- ment, the UNU-FTP staff, fellows and partner organisations have gained a unique view of the status and devel-opment of fisheries, in particular in developing countries.

Curio Ltd. produces fish processing machines for heading, filleting, skinning and sharpening. The Curio machines have won awards for good use and their popularity and reputation is rising steadily. Curio processing machines can be set to suit different fish species of different sizes. Curio strives to provide excellent service and maintain a full range stock of spare parts at all times. Collaboration We customise the Curio machines to meet the different needs of each cus- tomer. While one customer primarily processes haddock another customer can focus on tusk, Atlantic wolfish, salmon or trout, therefore requiring totally different processing solutions. Curio History Founded in 1994, Curio started out in traditional machine production, but in recent years we have focused on fish processing machines for heading, filleting, skinning and sharpening.In 2008, our new line of machines for fish processing was introduced and it instantly became a success when we finalised our first header midway through 2008. During 2008-2012 our production capacity was 3-4 machines per year, but following the transition to our current location the capacity increased to 12-24 machines per year. Our Curio technicians and designerscarry on a constant and ongoing development regarding the lifetime, usage and speed of our fish processing machines. It should therefore come as no sur- prise that the Curio machines have already won awards for good usage and their reputation continues to rise. Production The production of Curio machines starts with cutting and machining each individual part using high precision CNC machinery. A state of the art laser positioning system welds the machine frame together assuring that it meets the strict design specifications. Once the frame has been assembled it is given a special chemical treatment along with all the machine covers and guards, giving a smoother surface with higher resistance to the elements. The machine components are then assembled by highly trained person-Curio ehf Eyrartr\u00f6\u00f0 4 220 Hafnarfj\u00f6r\u00f0ur Iceland Fish Processing Machines Curio produces Awarded high-tech, ecient and elegant machines for the processing of sh 80nel, carefully placing each part to its designated place and making sure that the machines are set to the customer specific requirements.

The idea is to control the water flow through the trawl doors and guide the trawl doors and the complete fishing gear to a preferable position in the sea for the most effective fishing results. The trawl doors are constructed from aerodynamic shaped wings - a total of 6 wings, 3 on the upper section and 3 on the lower section. By moving the wings, or part of the wings of the trawl door, the water flow can be controlled. The trawl doors can be guided to operate with either a little spreading force or its maximum spreading force and also controlled close to the surface or deeper in the sea. Greater efficiency This revolutionary idea, where each wing can be controlled individually, can move the fishing gear to the optimal position to catch the school. This is very effective when combined with other fish finding equipment in the fishing vessels. During the test tows, with maximum doors spread and all wings closed for minimum flow of water, the door-to- door distance was 72m and when adjusting to minimum doors spread with all the wings open for greater flow of water, the door-to-door distance was reduced to 54m.The power output to the propeller dropped from 510kW towing at 4.8 knots down to 455kW when the spreading force was reduced. Fuel consumption during towing with the doors adjusted in maximum spread was 163litres per hour and was reduced to 138litres per hour during minimum doors spread. Environmental friendly trawl doors We expect that use of remote control- lable trawl doors will have a huge effect on trawl fishing for the benefit of more economical operations and several environmental issues: Less fuel consumption - when there is no or little fish concentration, the doors can be controlled to reduce door-to-door distance and the complete fishing gear will have much less resistance; Greater catches - with high fish concentration, the doors can be controlled to the optimal position to increase door-to-door distance so the fishing gear will catch more fish;Polar Fishing Gear Ocean Cluster House Grandagardi 16 101 Reykjavik Iceland Tel +354 568 50 80 atlimarj@polardoors.comPoseidon Remote Controllable - the Poseidon remote controllable trawl doors and the total fishing gear can be guided to work 'off the seabed' with no bottom contact at all.

At the same time, per capita protein con- sumption is expected to rise heavily, especially in populous growing economies like China and India. The challenge for agriculture and fisheries industries to keep up with demand is profound. Fish populations and land will likely remain virtually unchanged, stressing the importance of one imperative factor: raw material utilisa- tion. Specifically, the global fisheries and aquaculture output is around 150 million tons and rises steadily. Incre-mental changes in product yield can translate into massive increases in the global supply of protein. 50% goes wasted Technological advances in commercial fisheries sectors have brought consid- erable improvements in product yield. For instance, Icelandic producers of cod fillets have seen their product yield increase by as much as 20% over the past two decades2. However, the fillet only makes up 35 to 45% of the cod's weight. The remainder is head, bones, skin and intestines - raw mate- rials that garner far less obvious choices for products. However, due to strict fisheries management regula- tions, Icelandic fisheries have beenforced to innovate and invent prof- itable ways to exploit these by-prod- ucts. And have: sincethe 1990's, the utilisation of fishery by- products has increased 30-fold, the export value per cod kilogram hasrisen by a factor of 4 and the array of different marine products has multi- plied. Today, Icelandic cod producers typically make use of up to 95% of their raw material. According to the Iceland Ocean Clus- ter's 3research, the average raw mate- rial utilisation rate of cod in Europe is just over 50%, meaning that about half of each fish's weight goes wastedin the production process. Clearly, the opportunity for other nations to learnfrom Iceland's experience and increase the world's protein supply (and fisheries' profits) through betterutilisation is substantial. The technology is here At Ocean Excellence we share a common vision that new technologiesThere's no such thing as fish waste 84and processes can enable any seafood business to improve utilisa- tion and expand profits without increasing raw material supply. For instance, recent advances in fish drying technologies allow small andlarge fish processors to make use of by-products in a quick and highly cost- effective way. In fact, new technolo- gies make drying the most energy efficient method to process and pre- serve seafood. Aside from drying, sev- eral companies profitably make food products from liver, roes, heads and intestines. More advanced ways to utilise by- products include enzyme technolo- gies, nanofiltration and various biotechnological methods that isolate valuable ingredients from fish.PROFILE Dried fishOcean Excellence Tel: +354 664 7000 office@oceanexcellence.is www.oceanexcellence.is 85Around the North Atlantic, fish is increasingly being transformed into omega, vitamins, collagen, gelatin, chitin, protein, peptides and other supplements.

Tel: 0843 504 456087Sigur\u00f0ur Ingi J\u00f3hannsson, Minister of Fisheries and Agriculture in Iceland considers the role the shing industry plays on the Icelandic economy... For most developed countries wild capture sheries are not economically very signicant, but Iceland is one of the exceptions. Fisheries have for a long time been the backbone of the Icelandic economy. In 2012 some 1.5 million tonnes of sh were caught around the island with an export value of \u20ac1.7bn. Fisheries and sh processing represent some 11% of GDP and 27% of the total export earnings. New research indicates that, if the various sectors supporting the sheries sector are taken into account, their contribution to GDP might be as high as 26.7%. Today, sheries in Iceland are sustainable, ecient and highly protable. How did this come about? In Iceland, like most other coastal states, there was no perceived need for sheries management in the early days, when landings just kept on increasing year after year. International acceptance through UNCLOS (UN Convention on the Law of the Sea) of the 200 mileExclusive Economic Zone nally gave Iceland full control of its shing grounds. After the \"cod wars\", when foreign fleets were excluded from Icelandic waters, shing was free and practically unrestrained for all Icelanders. Around 1977 signs of overshinghad become undeniable. Something had to be done.To deal with the problem, Iceland, like most other nations, opted for \"input controls\" such as \"days at sea\" programmes plus various other technical options to curb the shing power of the fleet. However, this proved to be ineective. The fleet was quick to increase its shing eciency within this framework, so overshing persisted. Fishing was really driven by erce competition for the sh, regardless of quality and market conditions. To catch the most the fastestwas the name of the game. As an example, 70% of the cod (representing over 50% of the value of total sh exports) was caught in a period of 3 months in the summer, often leading to very poor yields and poor quality. Iceland ic fisheries: Sustai nable and efficientIn 1984, permanent quota shares of the annual total allowable catch (TAC), decided by the Minister of Fisheries, were allocated to individual shing vessels. This meant that each shing vessel could now catch its share of the dierent sh stocks in its own time. The benets soon came to light, such as saving fuel by not racing to the shing grounds, staying in harbourin bad weather, using the most ecient vessels etc. Quotas became transferable between vessels in 1990, leading to a market system for shing quotas thatwere nevertheless subject to certain restrictions. On the whole, this led to an important transformation of the industry: From a quantity mentality to that ofquality and value. The quota system also led to vastly improved eciency: Only 9,000 people are nowdirectly employed in shing and sh processing. Thiscorresponds to 5.3% of the Icelandic workforce, but new jobs have been created in specialised industries serving the sheries sector, driving the change to more eciency every year. Improvement in productivity has been achieved by constant streamlining and the use of automation and robotics, as well as incentive schemes of various types. As a result, the real value of cod products over the last 30 years has doubled due to higher yields, better quality, value-added products and morefocussed marketing. By-products, which were formerly considered as waste, such as sh heads, livers, sh frames, skin etc. are now processed. From a political point of view many view the system as being \"unfair\". Cases have been brought to the courts of law, even international courts, to test various aspects of access limitations to this common resource of Icelanders. There is an on-going debate on how high the resource rent or shing fee should be. Admittedly,the system has not proved to be perfect. Many of the remote villages around the island have faced severe diculties, e.g. when shing quotas have been trans ferred to vessels operating in other parts of the country. It is a system under constant development and various measures have been taken by the govern ment over the years to counteract the negative aspects. Yet, it is clear that the nation as a whole is the biggest beneciary of an ecient sheries management system. That is the fact that should be kept in focus - the rest is all about ne tuning a wellfunctioning system. The gures about eciency speak for themselves. The industry is eciently managed, rather than (top down) regulated, and it is not subsidised. Over the years, vessel ownership has become more concentrated through the transfer of quotas and a vertical integration of companies has taken place. Most importantly, management decisions are moving towards long-term harvesting rules and discards are forbidden. All decisions of this kind are now based on the best available science, a policy that is supported by most of the industry. The outcome has been that sh stocks are now generally at good levels.

Every year, about 40,000 metric tonnes of precip- itated silica go to waste in the geot- hermal plants in Iceland. GeoSilica aims to extract some of this silica to produce purified silica sols for use in novel silica healthcare products, where the price of one kilogram of very pure precipitated silica can reach US$2,000. The disposal of waste water and the sustainability of geothermal power What is done with all the waste water from geothermal power plants? Generally, as much of it as possible is returned back into the geothermal reservoir by pumping it into re-injection boreholes of various depths. This is cru- cialfor the sustainability of the resource, because in most cases, the natural recharge of the reservoirs is limited. However, this is often difficult and costly because the silica, having precipitated out of the fluid when it cooled, tends to clog the re-injection wells which are very costly. Thus, for power companies, the silica is not a blessing but a curse. There are other valuable minerals besides silica in geothermal fluid. An example is lithium. As boreholes get deeper, it is expected that the concen- trations of such metals, and even pre- cious ones such as gold, will increase substantially. Extraction of such metals from the fluid has to be done down- stream of silica extraction. Burkni Palsson CTO GeoSilica 571 3477 burkni@geosilica.com www.geosilica.comImproving the utilisation of the geothermal resource in Iceland The large scale extraction of silica from geothermal waste water would make it easier to reinject it back into the geothermal reservoirs, thus improving the sustainability and theutilisation of the resource, while at the same time, enabling the extraction of other precious metals. GeoSilica is currently looking for funding in order to scale up its productioncapacity and bring its products to European and other international markets. GeoSilica strives to be a socially responsible company and intends to improve the society by conducing towards healthier environ- ment, creates new jobs, maximising the utilisation of the geothermal resource in Iceland and contribute toEU sustainable objectives. GeoSilica Iceland, an Icelandic start-up company, aims to improve the utilisation of the geothermal resource in Iceland by extracting valuable minerals from themineral rich waste water from geot- hermal power plants. There is more to the utilisation ofgeothermal power than using the thermal energy of geothermal fluid for heating and passing the steam through turbines for power generation. Much more. The utilisation of geo - thermal power produces, like most industries, its own by-products, andthese could then be utilised further downstream of power production. What is the main by-product of geo -thermal power plants? It is generally called geothermal waste water. It is the geothermal fluid originally drawn up from the depths of the convection zone of the geothermal reservoir, after heat has been extracted from the liquid phase, and electricity produced from the steam phase. The waste water is very mineral rich since the originally extremely hot fluid has dissolved a lot of minerals from the hot rocks, and this is reflected in its chemical composition. The major mineral in geothermal fluid is silicon dioxide, more commonly known as silica. Initially, the silica is in its dissolved form of silicic acid, but as the fluid cools, the silicic acid polymerizes to form precipitated silica. Precipitated silica is a valuable The importance of maritime safety throughout Europe Markku Mylly, Executive Director at the European Maritime Safety Agency (EMSA) details how they work with the European Commission to maintain safety and implement EU legislation... For Europe, maritime transport has been a catalyst of economic development and prosperity throughout its history. Maritime transport enables trade and contacts between all the Europeannations. It ensures the security of supply of energy,food and commodities and provides the main vehicle for European imports and exports to the rest of the world. Almost 90% of the EU external freight trade is seaborne. Short sea shipping represents 40% of intra-EU exchanges in terms of ton-kilometres. The quality of life on islands and in peripheral maritime regions depends on good maritime transport services. Each year, more than 400 million passengers embark and disembark in European ports. Overall, maritime industries are an important source of employment and income for the European economy. The maritime industry is crucial to Europe in many ways and the health of that industry depends onmaintaining the highest possible standards of safety.EU countries have worked hard to ensure that their own flag fleets have a good safety record and to apply high standards to other ships by inspecting themwhen they enter EU ports. Generally, the maritime safety record in Europe is good, but everyone can remember the occasions when things have gone disastrously wrong; the names of the Erika and Prestige, the Estonia and most recently the Costa Concordia, are familiar to all. Working with the European Commission to maintain safety and implement EU legislation EMSA's creation came in a package of EU legislation that was developed in response to the Erika casualty. The Agency's founding regulation1establishes it \"for the purpose of ensuring a high, uniform and eective level of maritime safety, maritime security, prevention 90 SPECIAL FOCUS: MarineSPECIAL FOCUS: Marine of, and response to, pollution caused by ships as well as response to marine pollution caused by oil and gas installations.\" \"The maritime industry is crucial to Europe in many ways and the health of thatindustry depends on maintaining the highest possible standards of safety.\" The Agency's tasks are set out in the Founding Regulation and reflect the added value that can be achieved by cooperation between EU countries. The basis for this cooperation lies in a body of EU legislation coveringa range of safety issues, such as EU recognition of classication societies that survey ships on behalf of Member States; the coordination of inspections of ships in EU ports; standards for seafarer training, certication activities and various technical standards such as those for domestic passenger ships and ro-roferries that operate from EU ports. The Agency assists the Commission in the preparatory work for updating and developing such legal acts and in their eective implementation, in particular byvisit ing Member States and inspecting classication societies and third countries that train and certify seafarers. The results from a series of these visits and inspections are analysed across the board to identify any potential improvements to the legislation. In addition the Agency works with the Commission and Member States to organise relevant training activities, provide supplemental pollution response resources and in providing technical assistance tocontribute to the work of the technical bodies of the IMO, the International Labour Organisation, and the Paris Memorandum of Understanding on Port State Control ('Paris MoU'), with regard to matters of EUcompetence. At an operational level EMSA has developed and oper ates information systems such as the EU Long- Range Identication and Tracking Data Centre and the EU's Maritime Information and Exchange System (SafeSeaNet) which can provide vital ship data andtracking information for use in an emergency or to facilitate measures against threats of piracy and or other intentional unlawful acts. The Agency also helps to improve the identication and response to unlawful discharges by using the European Satellite Oil Monitoring Service (CleanSeaNet) to monitor theextent and environmental impact of such pollution. The Agency analyses safety investigation reports prepared by Member States to identify added value at Union level in terms of lessons to be drawn, and provides reliable and comparable statistics, information and data to enable the Commission and the MemberStates to take the necessary steps to improve their actions, and to evaluate the eectiveness and cost- eciency of existing measures. Challenges involved in maintaining eective levels of maritime safety Shipping is an international business and the ships that visit the EU are, more often than not, flagged in non-EU countries and subject to the legal regime of their flag state. EMSA's activities help the Commission and the EU Member States to ensure that all ships that visit or operate in EU waters can expect uniformly high standards to be applied. The activities of monitoring ships and illegal discharges, developing and hosting systems such as THETIS, which is used to coordinate port state inspections, and contributing to the devel- opment of cost-eective standards at an international level, all help to full this aim. 1Regulation (EC) No 1406/2002 of The European Parliament And Of The Council of 27 June 2002 establishing a European Maritime Safety Agency, as (EMSA) www.emsa.europa.eu 91Investing in future energy Adjacent Government outlines how the UK is investing in renewable energy projects to create a benet to the economy and reduce greenhouse gasses... Renewable energy can come in a number of different forms, but can have the same impact on the environment and energy bills. Using renewables can help to create jobs and secure economic growth in communities, and help to reduce carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. Manyrenewable technologies exist on the energy market, including: solar PV; wind turbines; hydroelectricity; and, ground source heat pumps. Since 2012, the UK has made great progress towardsthe government's 2020 renewables target to deliver15% of our energy demand from renewable sources. In 2012 more than 4% of the UK's energy came from renewable sources - which was above the government's interim target.1 According to the government's 2013 Renewable Energy Roadmap, renewable energy is continuing to support economic growth, through green jobs andinvestment. Since 2010, \u00a331bn worth of private sector investment in renewable electricity has beenannounced with the potential to support over35,000 jobs across the UK. Renewable energy projects in the UK, such as oshore wind farms, have the ability to create up to 4.5GW of electricity for the national grid. They are crucial to creating new jobs, and helping the UK to meet European targets. In April the government furthered their commitment by pledging support to 8 major renewable energy projects in the UK. Five of the schemes backed are oshore wind farms, which are said to be worth up to \u00a312bn in private sector investment. In July a further \u00a3200m was made available for renewable energy projects as part of the government's reforms to the electricity market. In July 2014, Energy and Climate Change Secretary Ed Davey said: \"Our plan is powering growth andjobs in the UK economy. We are building a secure, sustainable energy system for the future, dealing withan historic legacy of underinvestment and neglect that threatened to undermine the whole economy. \"The funds we invest now in keeping the lights on could , in future be available to support cheaper projects that deliver lasting reductions in peak electricity demand.\"2 The government recently set out details for the rst \u00a310m Electricity Demand and Reduction auctionfrom a \u00a320m budget. The funding will be available to businesses and projects that reduce electricity demands and cut carbon emissions. \"I want to unlock the untapped potential of better eciency in electricity use - so that more ecient kit can compete with building new power stations in thefuture,\" said Davey. \"Our \u00a320m pilot will fund schemes that will help to reduce our demand - not only saving business andtheir customer's money, but reducing the amount of electricity we'll need to generate.\" The government hopes that by stripping away barriers to investment in the energy market, it will create benets for the UK economy and It's hard to believe that it has now been over a decade since the UK construction industry has truly had the freedom to select an independent alternative to the local electricity utility - for example WPD, UKPN, Scottish & Southern Energy etc., (now known as Distribution Network Operators, DNO's) to provide the new connections to their developments. Prior to this, developers and main contractors seeking new electrical connections for their developments could only do so through the DNO's. This, usually because of high demand, was often time consuming, expensive,problematic and frustrating. Although the provision of competitive connec- tion facilitators had been developing for some time, it was not until late 2003 that the sector saw a real break- through, when an accepted industrywide standard of accreditation for Independent Connection Provider's (ICP's) came into place. The revolution began... The revolution was underway... the new system not only satisfied the DNO's that standards of quality and safety would be upheld when an accredited ICP undertook to deliver the electricity connection for a devel- opment project, it also helped to open up a whole new area of competition, meaning that developers had a choice. This in turn meant that these compa- nies could focus on the interests of the client!Today, the ICP's role is to provide competition alongside the DNO's in the provision of assets required to connect new load to the distribution networks. The opening up of this activity was a direct result of persistent lobbying by user groups consisting largely of developers and main con-tractors frequently frustrated by poor service levels. \"Over the past ten years Power On has provided new electricity supply connec- tions totalling over 1000MW on over 2500 contracts, with a current repeat order suc- cess rate of over 80%. These include many landmark developments across the regions' cities, major city living projects as well as a growingtrack record with national developers for distribution hubs across central England.\" In more recent years Independent Distribution Network Owners (IDNO'S) have provided additional competition in that they would own and operating these newly connected assets. This new arrangement presented our clients with additional benefits of reduced contributions as each connectionhas a future recognised value to the asset owners. Attitudes are changing...

Andy Platt, Cabinet Member for Green Enterprise at Stoke-on-Trent City Council outlines the project and its benets... The whole of the UK faces a mounting challenge to protect consumers from the ravages of a volatile energy market while simultaneously increasing the use of renewable power and cutting carbon emissions. Stoke-on-Trent's circumstances are no dierent. It would be easy to argue that, having invested tens of millions of pounds in retrot energy saving improvements for local homes in recent years, as well as supporting the creation of the multi-million pound Centre of Refurbishment Excellence in the city, the council has done all that it could to meet this challenge - particularly at a time when nancialconstraints pose a threat to our core services. But we are determined to go much further than this andbring to fruition our own unique vision for localised energy security. The scale and urgency of the escalating energy price challenge have forced us to look in greater detail at how the city's energy needs are likely to shape ourcommunities and our economy. Stoke-on-Trent has traditionally been home to some of the UK's most energy-intensive industries, and although the commercial landscape has changed signicantly in the last 30 years, reliance on plentiful energy is still an important economic consideration.In the absence of clear national consensus, we have resolved to take matters into our own hands to shield vulnerable businesses and communities from the excesses of the energy market. Faced with anincreasingly stark choice between capitulation and innovation, we opted for the latter. Surveys indicate that Stoke-on-Trent is situated about two kilometres above a naturally occurring source of geothermal energy, enabling us to tap into heat from within the Earth's crust to warm buildings on the surface. We are condent that, with nancial support fromthe Department for Energy and Climate Change, we will be able to tap into this abundant renewableenergy source, pump it to the surface and distribute the heat direct to the city's university and further education colleges, commercial and business premises, council-owned buildings and homes. According to our projections, from 2018 locally produced geothermal energy will supply heat at apre dictable, attractive price on an 11 kilometre network spanning the city centre, the Etruria Valley business park, the University Quarter and Stoke town. The availability of up to 45 gigawatt hours of renewable energy will cut Stoke-on-Trent's carbon emissions by an estimated 12,000 tonnes a year. But more importantly, it will also oer unparalleled energy price stability, removing much of the uncertainty which continues to dog the wider domestic energy market. Earlier this year, our vision for local energy security took a huge leap forward when the city council, along with our partners in Staordshire County Council and the Stoke-on-Trent and Staordshire Local Enterprise Partnership, signed a momentous city deal with the government worth about \u00a3113m over the next 10 years. The centrepiece of this deal was a \u00a320m government funding pledge towards the \u00a352m cost of creating the District Heat Network. The early instalments of this nancial support are already trickling down from Whitehall, enabling us to focus on strengthening our business case so that we can put our proposal to the market in order to line uppotential commercial partners with the necessary expertise. This partnership approach will enable us to access and extract the subterranean hot water and, by means of a heat exchanger, use it to energise a district heat network that will serve buildings in the public and private sector. There are still many steps to go through in the process of getting the District Heat Network up and running, and every groundbreaking infrastructure projectencounters its fair share of challenges on the journey from concept to completion. However, it is heartening to note that Stoke-on-Trent secured the second largest injection of government funds out of the 20 wave two cities - particularly considering that bids were assessed against their feasibility and commercial viability, as well as expected environmental and social benets. We believe that our proposal has the potential to transform our city's economic prospects and help to accelerate Stoke-on-Trent's renaissance as an emerg ing national hub for renewable energy research and innovation. What is becoming increasingly clear is that ministers share our view and are responding to the city council's growing condence in its regeneration strategy. The District Heat Network is about far more than securing short-term energy price stability. The success of this unique project will send a clear signal to poten tial investors, central government and regional drivers of growth that Stoke-on-Trent is an innovative city with the focus, the leadership and the will to takecontrol of its own destiny and claim its rightful place as a future German Engineering 10 Year Manufacturer Guarantee Exclusive 40mm Clay Core Controllable Heat Refers to energy usage when used with our electronic thermostat over a 24 hour period as per independent tests in the UK, conducted by BSRIA. *Bathroom heaters.the future is electricTM \u0087\u0003Instant heat for the whole house \u0087\u0003Modern room temperature control system \u0087\u0003Wireless, intelligent room thermostat \u0087\u0003Rated IPX4 water VSODVKLQJ\u0003FHUWL\u00c0\u0003FDWLRQ \u0087\u0003Modern, 110mm slimline storage heaters \u0087\u0003Easy to install - uses 13 amp \u0087\u0003Low input smart storage heatersChoose a heating system that's easy to install with no wiring or pipework required.

Steve Tanner, General Manager at SWIGA discusses what its guarantee can oer the consumer... With many energy saving insulation solutions readily available for homes and businesses large and small, there really is no excuse not to insulate. Although months away from winter, the Solid Wall Insulation Guarantee Agency (SWIGA) is advising that now is the perfect time for property owners to invest in insulation and combat rising energy costs and climate change sooner rather than later. The way a building is constructed, insulated, ventilated and the type of fuel used, all contribute to its carbon emissions. A worrying fact is that a signicant proportion of the money spent on energy is literally being thrown out of the window as a result of inadequate levels of insulation, with around 58% of the heat being lost through the roof and walls alone. By simply insulating with SWI savings of up to \u00a3460* per year can be achieved. The Solutions Solid walls can be insulated with either; External Wall Insulation (EWI), Internal Wall Insulation (IWI) or a combination of both and either option will greatly increase comfort, while also reducing energy bills and the associated environmental impact. IWI typically consists of either dry lining in the form of laminated insulating plasterboard (known as thermal board) or a built-up system using brousinsulation such as mineral wool held in place using astudwork frame. IWI has the advantage that it can be installed room by room with the tenants in situ. It increases internal surface temperature within a room and also improves response to heating input when heated intermittently. IWI can also be installed in any weather and cost can be kept to a minimum if combined with other works,e.g. if internal repairs or rewiring is required.Energy 98Energy Laminated insulated plasterboard can be used in many situations and is xed directly to the existingbrick. Depending on the system, thermal boards can either be screwed or glued using a dry wall adhesive directly onto the brick work just like standard plasterboard. It is normally thinner than studwork systems due to its better thermal conductivity, although thereare instances, such as uneven existing walls where a studwork based system may be more suitable. EWI comprises of an insulation layer xed to theexist ing wall, with a protective render or decorative nish including real brick slips or brick eect nishes. EWI increases the thermal quality of the building - particularly relevant when refurbishing non-traditionalhousing. It also overcomes moisture and condensation issues, protects the existing building envelope canreduce heating bills by up to 25% as well as greatlyimprove the appearance of the building. EWI is a tried and tested method of upgrading the thermal performance and external appearance of existing properties which are literally transformed into warm, energy ecient and attractive homes and buildings. Improving appearance is of particular signicance to many local authorities targetinghous ing projects in poorer areas. Adding EWI on a whole street basis will raise residents' morale andgive a sense a pride in their community. There are many benets of EWI including the fact thatno living space is lost. There is minimum disruption for the residents as the work can be carried out while they are in their homes and it also adds a water- proong layer to the outside of the property which will last for decades with minimal maintenance required. There are a lot of things for the consumer to consider during the installation of IWI or EWI. Good quality detailing in design and installation is key and dierent materials and systems are available each with distinct benets. Not only does SWIGA provide consumer protection with our independent 25-year guarantee, we can oer the consumer independent industry expertise - our membership includes all major system designers who we can draw on, but we also have an independent approach and can oer expert opinion on client projects.We dier from insurance companies in that in the unusual event of installation issues, we will arbitrate on any disputes and get remedial work done, then deal with the contractual aspects between our mem- bers afterwards. Our prime focus has always been and is on prevention, not cure. Our Quality Assurance framework is key and our pre-vetting procedures do more than any other to avoid issues from the outset. The government's Green Deal Home Improvement Fund and the Scottish equivalent are a big step in opening up the market for individual householders living in solid wall homes but these schemes won't beenough on their own though. It is vitally important that the proposed changes to the Energy Company Obligation are decided upon and communicated to the industry and other stake holders as soon as possible. SWIGA hopes that government increases the Solid Wall Insulation minima from the original proposal otherwise there will be a large gap in their CO2commitment, and a large impact on the SWI industry, with many jobs at risk.

To say that CCS has been on a rollercoaster ride in the UK over the last few years would be an understatement. Following the collapse in 2011 of the rst competition launched in 2007, the government was quick to launch a new competition - the CCS Commercialisation Programme - in April 2012. The name of this competition indicates an outcomes- focussed competition, with the aim of enabling CCS to be cost-competitive with other low-carbon technologies in the 2020s. By March 2013, 2 projects were selected as preferred bidders and both of these are now pro- gressing with Front End Engineering and Design studies (FEED), which is great news indeed. These projects arethe White Rose project at the Drax site in Yorkshire and the Peterhead Gas CCS project in Scotland. TheFEED studies for both projects are expected to last forapproximately eighteen months - after which nal investment decisions will hopefully be taken and the projects should be operational by 2020. So, the rst 2 CCS projects in the UK are progressing well. However, 2 projects do not an industry make. For CCS to full its role in tackling climate change whilst becoming cost-eective with other low-carbon technologies in the 2020s, we will need a steady roll-out of projects. In fact, the government have already stated (in their response to the CCS Cost Reduction Task Force) that a second phase of CCS projects will be needed before CCS is likely to be cost-competitive with otherlow-carbon technologies. Crucially, it is recognisedthat this second phase may need to be developed in parallel to the 2 projects in the current competition. This is an important point - if we were to wait until the competition projects were built, plus perhaps afew years of learning lessons before second phase projects are built, it could be 7 years or more before further projects see the light of day. This is too large agap and is not a sustainable roll-out pathway for CCS. Developers will have moved on, skills will be lost and the supply chain will not develop as necessary. Fortunately in the UK, potential second phase CCS projects are already under development. There are at least 2 projects which were not selected in the competition that are now desperately trying to nd a route to market. Whilst these projects do not havethe benet of the \u00a31bn capital grant that is allocated to the competition, in principle they should be able to access a Contract for Dierence (CfD) under the Electricity Market Reform framework. However, thereis currently very little clarity on how CCS projects beyond the competition can access a CfD and whether there is even sucient funding available for non-competition projects in the overall budget (the Levy Control Framework) of \u00a37.6bn by 2020/21. In the next few months we urgently need to see commitment from government on these crucial issues, otherwise there is a very real danger that these projects willcol lapse - and the impact on the entire CCS industry could be devastating. Investment in these non-com- petition projects would provide a seamless transition to the second phase of CCS in the UK, which would begin to realise necessary cost reductions and deliver the outcome of the Commercialisation Programme - CCS that is cost-competitive with other low-carbon technologies in the 2020s. Whilst CCS faces some real challenges at the moment, the prize is also great. Earlier this year, the Carbon Capture and Storage Association published a joint report with the Trades Union Congress setting out the Economic Benets of CCS in the UK. The report concludes that a decarbonised electricity sector by2030 which includes CCS delivers real benet to the consumer - an \u00a382 reduction in household bills per year compared to decarbonisation scenarios where CCS is not included. An ambitious roll-out of CCS has the potential to create 15,000-30,000 jobs annually by 2030, with a cumulative market value of \u00a315bn-\u00a335bn. These numbers show that CCS is not just an essentialtool in the ght against climate change, it is good business as well. The next few months will show whether the UK can grasp the CCS opportunity and realise the signicant benets that this crucial Policy and Communications Manager The Carbon Capture & Storage Association Tel: +44 (0)20 3031 8750judith.shapiro@ccsassociation.org www.ccsassociation.org Energy 102103PROFILE Industries from chemicals to biofu- els, oil refining to steel, lie at the centre of Teesside - the industrial heartland of the UK. Teesside, in Tees Valley, is home to the largest integrated chemical complex in the UK and the second largest in Western Europe. All types of base chemicals are represented, producingthe raw materials that ultimately go into the manufacture of all kinds of plastic goods, fertilisers and pharma- ceuticals. The area is a world-class centre for the petrochemicals, energy, bio-resources, steel and advancedmanufacturing industry. Teesside is supported by world- leading infrastructure to help maintain these industries, including a deep water port, the Central Area Transmission System (CATS) pipeline bringing in gas from the North Sea, as well as excellent road and rail connections. Support for growth is provided by Tees Valley Unlimited, the Local Enterprise Partnership for the area, assisted by the Centre for Process Innovation (CPI) at Wilton, NEPIC, a clustering support organisation that represents industry and its supply chain, and the Tees Valley Enterprise Zone, which offers enhanced capital allowances for major investment. In addition there is a significant advanced engineering industry that can design and maintain large-scale industrial plants. With more than 1,400 companies directly involvedTransforming industrial heritage into a high value low carbon future or in the supply chain to the process industry in the region, the sector contributes over \u00a31bn/year to gross value added (GVA) in Teesside, as well as contributing to the North East being the only net-exporting region in the UK (2012). World Leader Across all sectors, Teesside is at theforefront: supplying offshore wind projects in the North Sea; exploring opportunities for industrial plants to integrate; pioneering opportunities to use household waste to create chemicals; developing new biotech-nologies; creating a cluster of biomass and biofuels plants; leading on carbon capture and storage technology; and supporting the growth and develop- mentof the major international companies based in the area such as Huntsman, INEOS, SABIC, GrowHow and Sembcorp. Teesside's economic vision is to build on this existing cluster to establish Teesside as an integrated carbon- efficient industrial hub, achieving economic stability and growth through the production of low carbon energy and products. A modern Teesside will be one where plants are as energyefficient as possible: where waste replaces hydrocarbons to produce chemicals; where heat and energy is shared between chemical plants and is also used to reduce household energy bills; where carbon is captured and stored underground; and where green hydrogen is produced and used in hydrogen vehicles. At the forefront of this vision are the development of a CCS (Carbon Capture & Storage) network and the deployment of novel district heating schemes. Industrial Carbon Capture & Storage The Process industry is one of the only a few exporting sectors in the UK. The Teesside Process cluster is one of the largest in the UK covering a diverse sector base of chemicals, petrochem- icals, steel and energy companies.This cluster directly employs over 9,000 people, with exports of c. \u00a34bn per annum (2013). However theseindustries also make Teesside one of the most carbon intensive locations inthe country. The companies in Teesside have invested over a considerable number of years to reduce their carbon emis- sions, however where emissions ofcarbon dioxide are an inherent part of the process, a real step-change can only be made by implementing carbon capture and storage. This is not only essential for the UK to meet legally binding carbon targets, but also to supply increasing consumer demand for low carbon products. For example major international corpora- tions, such as Coca-Cola and Tesco, are demanding low carbon raw materials for their plastics. In the future, companies who cannot meet this demand will not win the contracts. A CCS network will allow companies to compete for an increasing market share for low carbon products and will act as a unique selling point for the UK, ensuring the future viability of an integrated industry. Industrial CCS is a cost effective mech- anism for the UK to meet its carbon targets, which could create 4,000 high value jobs and safeguard \u00a34 billion worth of exports every year. In addition, CCS decarbonises the UK's agricultural sector, produces green hydrogen and low carbon plastic and decarbonises the second largest blast furnace in Europe (SSI). Using City Deal funding agreed in December, Tees Valley Unlimited are developing the business case for the full chain (capture, onshore transportation, offshore transportation and storage) with four key industrial emitters that currently produce around 7 million tonnes of CO2per year. Teesside is the only place in the UK actively developing an industrial CCS network. District Heating Teesside is dominated by large energy intensive industry, much of whichemits low temperature, low pressure heat for which there is limited indus- 104PROFILE105PROFILE trial use. Firstly, this low grade heat represents wasted energy which could be used to heat homes and busi- nesses, and secondly it represents a lost opportunity to increase industrial energy efficiency. By utilising this wastedenergy, the companies in Tees Valley become more efficient and competitive, and businesses and homes benefit from heat at a lower cost than conventional gas central heating. Teesside is in a unique position to exploit its industrial assets with two ambitious industrial heat-powered district heating schemes: Compared to other clusters of energy intensive industries in the UK, Teesside's industry is in close proximity to residents, commercial operations, and public sector buildings resulting in a compact network; The Teesside industries were originally developed to have a self-sustainingenergy supply providing an estab- lished infrastructure of interconnect- ing services including heat which can be exploited by a new network; Companies who generate the heat are already supplying closely located users with commercial agreements in place; Parent companies of the heat suppli- ers have experience of mixed use district heating schemes outside of the UK. These companies operate in highly competitive markets which constantly drives them to reduce their energy costs. The councils in Tees Valley are currently developing these schemes, which could save homes and businesses 10-15% on their energy bills and reduce carbonemissions even further. Collectively these schemes could save over 50,000 tonnes of CO 2every year, and would start operating from 2017/18.Tees Valley Unlimited is ideally situated to capi- talise on the predicted future demand for hydrogen, already producing 50% of the UK's output. The increasing use of hydrogen-based technology in the automotive industry, amongst others, puts Tees Valley at the forefront of this emerging fuel source. Teesside has the opportunity to convert excess renewable energy into hydrogen for use in fuel cells, or to produce it from household waste, and from the appli- cation of CCS. Teesside is also the only place in the UK which could store the hydrogen in underground salt caverns. Building on its industrial heritage, Teesside now leads the UK in low carbon economic growth: securing jobs, bringing in investment and developing the region's long-term prosperity. Tees Valley Unlimited is the Local Enterprise Partnership for the five local authorities of Darlington, Hartlepool, Middlesbrough, Redcar and Cleveland and Stockton on Tees. The public and private sector organisation is respon- sible for driving forward the local economy, working in partnership with industry.

To have good industrial collaboration, we aim to carry out research both on full and pilot scales for avoiding theproblems in up-scaling and to have immediate solutions for companies.The latest process we have been developing deals with the CO 2seques- tration and storage by mineral carbonation, using steel slag (a by-product from steelmaking) as a raw material. The principle of our carbonation process is simple. We first dissolve the calcium from steelmaking slag with an ammonium salt solvent selectively, and then, bubble or spray the Ca-rich solution with CO2containing gas. In 2011 Aalto University Foundation, together with Abo Akademi and Rautaruukki Oyj, successfully secured a patent for a technique that pro-duces calcium carbonate (CaCO3) from alkaline by-products. This CCSapproach aims to reduce CO 2emis- sions by using alkaline industrial waste materials and by-products andflue-gases rich in CO2to create a CaCO3 product that is marketable to the paper or plastic industry for example. The conventional production of this precipitated pure CaCO3 requires limestone to be mined, transported and then submitted to highly energy intensive calcination processes that also emit CO2, but by substituting limestone as the raw material with industrial alkaline by-products, thispatent method extinguishes the needfor such wasteful activities. Before we can begin to think about up-scaling to an industrial scale, it is imperative that the processes are first understood at every level in the pilotplant. We need to test all the process parameters. This way we will find out the actual energy consumption, the chemical consumption, the steel slag residue's quality, as well as the quality of the end product (PCC), and the amount of CO 2we can fix. In order to sell CaCO3 as a filler or coating material, it is essential that the end product is up to scratch. During the spring 2014 we were able to produce several successful batches of CaCO3 from the new pilot plant at the Aalto University - and it is working really well. Once the process has been opti- mised at every level, we can begin to translate the method to a larger scale. We are currently looking for the best ways,and new partners to grow towards production on a commercial scale.

How should young Londoners gain work without experience if they cannot gain experience without work? This conundrum is sadly faced by many young people and the Mayor of London, Boris Johnson believes that volunteering may be at least a part of the answer. Youth unemployment currently stands at just under 20% and yet businesses are reporting recruiting challenges. There is clearly a mis-match. Time after time when the Mayor and I meet business leaders the overwhelming message is that this challenge is not simply an issue of literacy or numeracy, but it is the 'work-readiness' or 'soft skills', which many of our young people lack. The basics in condence, com munication, leadership and teamwork mean not only are they challenged to secure a job, but once they have one, they struggle to succeed. In Team London, the Mayor's volunteering programme, we believe we have the start of a solution. As the school leaving age rises to 18, we want to equip ouryoung people whilst they are still at school with theskills to compete. We believe that providing them the opportunity to volunteer does just this. When they engage in a volunteering project with a local charity they learn how to plan, to show up on time, to workwith and communicate to those of dierent ages anddierent backgrounds as a part of a team, to deal with challenging situations, sometimes to lead in their own way. They also gain valuable experience to draw on when they are sitting in an interview or writing a UCAS form. Over the last year my team has been working with youth charity The Challenge, and communicationsexperts AGL Young People to develop a programmewhich demonstrates that volunteering really can be a route to work for young people. HeadStart London oers 16- 18 year olds employability workshops, com munications coaching and a guaranteed interview for part-time or seasonal work - once they have given 16 hours of their time volunteering in their community. What we have seen through our fantastic businesspartners New Look and Starbucks - who have oered interviews to the young people for part-time or seasonal work - is that those who have volunteered are much more successful at interview than those who haven't. Starbucks were so impressed at thelast assessment day that they oered 11 out of 13 young people a job, from their normal recruitment pool they deem 1 in 5 as work-ready. \"We believe that providing them the opportunity to volunteer does just this. When they engage in a volunteeringproject with a local charity they learn how to plan, to show up on time, to work with and communicate to those of dierent ages and dierent backgrounds as a part of a team, to deal with challenging situations, sometimes to lead in their own way. \" At a recent event with business, Emmanuella a graduate from the HeadStart London programme spoke con- dently and calmly in front of an audience of senior business leaders about how her volunteering role in a charity shop had supported her to take on her rst part-time job at New Look. This is all adding to her skills, condence and experience as she looks to pursue a career in fashion in the future. Prior to the programme, she had not been self-assured enough to speak to an audience, which shows just how much of a change even a relatively small amount of volunteeringcan make to a young person's condence. We believe that through this programme not only do we have the opportunity to change the course of the next generation's futures but, even better, we are oering them the opportunity to change their owncourse. Together we can start to tackle youth unem-ployment, one of the largest challenges that we facein London and across the country. For a future workforce that is able to compete in an ever-competitive global marketplace, young people need to be prepared for the dening moments of their life with the right communication skills, workexperience and volunteering experiences. They will be better aware of the world around them, comfortable working alongside those of all dierent ages and backgrounds. 73% of employers say that they would rather hire someone who has volunteered and 78% of employers cited employability skills as one of the most important factors when recruiting young people. We are working with businesses large and small toensure they recognise this volunteering experience in their recruitment processes and also enable their own sta to volunteer, giving them a minimum of 1 day a year to give their time to support the next generation to develop their skills. Over 20 businesses have already committed to support the Mayor in this mission. Whilst youth unemployment may seem a huge challenge, young people like Emmanuella are now telling the next cohort of 16 year olds that the answer is simple - volunteer today.

It is a very dicult time to be young. The recession has hit young people particularly hard, with youth unemployment hovering just below a million and not showing much response to the green shoots ofrecovery. In addition there are regular reports from business and employers groups that young people are illequipped for the world of work. The academic emphasis on our education system is leaving young people lacking many of the key attributes which go to make desirable employees - the ability to work in ateam, to get on with people, to empathise. Last year,the National Youth Agency established a commission into youth work in formal education, and found thatbringing youth workers into schools helped develop these 'soft' skills which employers often cited were hard to nd in today's new recruits. These types of skills have been shown to be important not just for employment, but also in building a better society for us all. An evaluation of the National Citizens Service found that improving teamwork, communication and leadership, improving social mixing and encouraging community involvement - all crucial characteristics of this team-led social action programme - contributed to a more responsible, cohesive and engaged society. There is evidence that young people are seeing theopportunities that volunteering or social action oer.According to ocial national statistics there has been a signicant increase in the proportion of young people aged 16-24 years (up from 25% to 31%) whohad volunteered in the last 12 months compared to 2005/06. In addition, rising youth unemployment may have an impact on young people's volunteering. A study byyouth charities BeatBullying and MindFull found that nearly half of young people who do not volunteer would be likely to do so if it led to a job or training. 54% of those surveyed who already volunteered would do more if it oered the prospect of employment ortraining. Getting young people involved in social action, orvol unteering, lies at the heart of many National Youth Agency programmes. We are a key partner in the NCS Network, which oers young people a four week programme that culminates in a social action project, beneting both young people and society. We also manage Think Big, a \u00a31.5m youth programme, supported by Telefonica UK/O2. The programme provides young people with opportunities to set up projects to make a dierence to their own lives and to the well-being of theircom munities.Another programme which takes the best of both of these was our Social Action Fund project, supported by Think Big and the Cabinet Oce. The aim was to engage young people who have completed the NCS programme, as well as some who hadn't any previous experience, and encourage them to continue volun- teering and engaging in positive volunteering activity. It worked. An evaluation found that of the young people who had never previously been involved in volunteering 84% agreed that they would continue to do so. Of those young people who had previously volunteered often 96% reported they would do more. Our current Social Action Journey Fund project,focuses on a younger age group, disadvantaged young teenagers, aiming to establish a pattern of volunteering from late childhood. Running alongside all these programmes is the skill and experience of youth workers, dedicating their time to helping young people in their personal and social development, and equipping them with the practical skills they need to be resilient. In these challenging times, young people are nding their own ways to get essential employment skills and experience, and we are developing a new generation of socially minded young people who see the power of volunteering, as a 242 7350 nya@nya.org.uk www.nya.org.uk Education and Training 110Education and Training 111Structured insulated panels (SIPs) for schools Matthew Evans, Technical Manager at Kingspan TEK explains why structures insulated panels (SIPs) oer a great solution for school building construction requirements... By 2022, the Department for Education estimates there will be a further 949,000 students in state funded schools1. The construction of new schools or extension of existing buildings is thereforeessential; however these projects are often amongst the most challenging to manage, combining strict site restrictions, limited construction space, tight com pletion deadlines and high energy eciency targets. Structural Insulated Panels (SIPs) oer a straightforward solution for all of these requirements. SIPs A typical SIP comprises 2 OSB facings either side of arigid urethane insulation core. Whilst frequently used in structural applications, the lightweight construction of the panels also makes them highly suited for cladding applications, either tted in-board or out-board of a steel or concrete structural frame. SIPs can achieve U-values of 0.20 W/m2\u00b7K \"out of the box\", or better U-values with an additional insulation layer, and their factory engineered joints ensure high levels of insulation continuity at junctions. Their inher-ent jointing arrangement can also form an eective air seal, preventing unnecessary air loss and allowing buildings to achieve air-leakage rates as low as 1m\u00b3/hour/m\u00b2 at 50 Pa. As a result, the desired level of fabric performance can be accomplished with a minimal SIP thickness, helping to maximise classroom sizes and avoid space loss from the surrounding play grounds. As SIPs are factory pre-engineered and cut to the building plans for each project, site waste is minimised and a weathertight building envelope can be erected in a matter of days, allowing follow on trades tobegin on site much earlier than with other forms ofconstruction. Their predictable installation programme is particularly benecial at active school sites, where construction has to be carefully planned around classes. Case Study To accommodate up to 210 more pupils, a new 2storey learning block was constructed at the Ravenor Kingspan TEK\u00ae Cladding Panels offered a thinner solution to achieve the desired thermal performance, when compared with a traditional masonry construction, helping to maximise space within the internal classroomsSchool in Ealing. Wooden packers were bolted to the outer face of the building's steel frame and 142mmthick SIPs were then xed to these with headlock screws. To allow vertical movement, the screws sit at the top of 18mm holes drilled through the panels. The bottom plate of the SIPs was also nailed to the sole plate and a breather membrane was tted totheir outer face. SIPs support a wide range of exterior nishes and thefa\u00e7ade of the centre was formed through a combina- tion of bre cement cladding panels and high gloss rainscreen fa\u00e7ade panels, installed on an aluminium rail and bracket system. The 2 storey high SIPs were designed and pre-cut with a lead in time of less than a month and were fully tted in just 3 weeks through the use of a mobile crane and elevating platforms. The learning centre has been pre-assessed as 'Very Good' under the 2011 version of BREEAM New Construction - Education, with an external wall U-value of 0.20 W/m\u00b2\u00b7K. Brighter Future With the economic recovery continuing, the short to medium term demand for new school buildings is another positive for the construction industry. By using SIPs it is possible to reduce the pressure in design and construction phases, whilst also delivering space and energy saving benets throughout the building's lifespan. 1 National Pupil Projections: Future Trends in Pupil Numbers, Department were installed in just three weeks on the steel frame of the new two storey learning block at Ravenor Primary School in GreenfordEducation and Training 112113 E-learning - alterna tive to norm Alastair Creelman, Vice-President at EFQUEL sheds light on why e-learning is no longer an alternative form of education... The concept of e-learning is in danger of soon becoming redundant. In today's digital society, where the European Commission forecasts that 90% of all jobs by 2020 will demand digital literacy, any course that doesn't involve the use of technology may been seen as irrelevant. It's time to stop seeinge- learning as an alternative form of education and focus on developing new models and structures for education and learning that fully exploit the opportu-nities of today's digital revolution. \"Teachers and students today have a wide range of tools and methods at theirdisposal, both traditional and digital, andwe are only now beginning to see howthese can be used pedagogically. \" E-learning, the use of information and communication technologies (ICT) in education, arose as an alternative for students who were unable to participate in traditional classroom education. Typically such courses werelargely based on guided self-study with a linear progression through modules consisting of recorded lectures, course literature, written assignments and multiple-choice self-tests. This model is still in use today, especially in many of the popular MOOCs (Mas sive Open Online Courses) oered by major universities. Technology has so far been used to simply reproduce traditional methods such as building closed virtual classrooms and oering recorded lectures rather than investigating what new pedagogies and paradigms digital technology can enable. E-learning has often been viewed as a compensatory phenomenon oering a \"second best\" solution for those not able to attend a regular course. There has also been a tendency in the e-learning community to focus on the technology, tools and devices rather than a discussion of how digital technology can enhance learning and how we can develop new pedagogies to fully exploit these opportunities. New technology does not lead tobetter learning; it's what you do with that technologythat can make a dierence. Education and TrainingToday we have a wide range of free or easily aord- able tools that enable us to do things previously unimaginable, both inside and outside the classroom: invite an expert guest to appear in class via Skype, publish class work and projects globally via blogs, wikis and e-books, create communities of interest ona national or international scale, write collaborative documents and projects, engage in dialogue withsub ject experts and students around the world. Teachers, librarians and educational technologists must work together to design stimulating collaborative learning environments for students and this involvesquestioning traditional practices and developing new skills. Teachers and students today have a wide range of tools and methods at their disposal, both traditional and digital, and we are only now beginning to see how these can be used pedagogically. The educational debate of recent years has often tended towards an unnecessary either/or polarisation (classroom/computer , physical/virtual, book/e-book) rather than an inclusive view where both traditional and digital tools and methods are all available and valid in the right setting. There are many arenas for learning available today, from the classroom to social media and virtual worlds, and the challenge for all in education is choosing the right arena for the right purpose. Education is moving from the traditional information transfer model focused on content to the acquisition of skills such as teamwork, critical analysis andentre preneurship that are increasingly demanded by employers. New forms of assessment and examination are needed to measure these new competences and new validation procedures are essential to ensure the international validity of new credentials. This demands new roles for both teachers and students and extensive support will be required to help them acquire the necessary digital skills. Educational institutions and authorities will need to thoroughly revise their qualityassurance systems to accommodate these changes. We are now moving from seeing e-learning as an alternative solution, with its own quality criteria, to full integration with mainstream education. The integration of technology into all forms of education is a reflection of the global digitalisation of society and it is essential that we have international cooperation around qualityassurance, new forms of assessment, examination and credentials. EFQUEL has for almost 10 years beenone of the leading European stakeholders working for innovative quality assurance and excellence models in e-learning and has, through various EU-supported projects, developed quality certications for both institutions and programmes/courses. One particularly relevant initiative we are involved in at present is the SEQUENT project together with ENQA (European Association for Quality Assurance in Higher Education) and EADTU (European Association of Distance Teaching Universities) to map out paths for integrating existing e-learning quality certications into mainstream university quality assurance. Through this and other initiatives we hope to contribute to the full integration of e-learning into European educational Alastair Creelman, Vice-PresidentEducation and Training 114115PROFILE Learning is an important social and economic factor in community development. Due to changing parameters and continuously increas- ing amount of knowledge learning has to change also. This opens up for new learning methodologies and learning environments. At Technische Universit\u00e4t Chemnitz, Germany, a new learning approach has been developed based on three mayor key ideas: Evaluation, mobility and individualisation. Evaluation: With evaluation different learning methodologies and environ- ments including e-learning, blended- learning and distance-learning can be analyzed. A new structure oriented valuation model (SURE) has been defined and used for evaluation of existing learning methods. SURE model reflects complex structures of multi criteria optimisations. Stakeholder's interests are considered as well as learner's and teacher's needs. Thus strengths and weaknesses can be identified which are valuable informa- tion for optimisations and direction of new learning approaches. Mobility: The second key issue which has been found is the need of mobile learning environments. Here technology can be introduced. Tablet computers and smartphones are well known examples. However we have found that technology has to be combined with new learning methods because mobility introduces new learning parameters. For example, the average time slot for learning with a mobile device is reduced to 10 percent of reg ular learning intervals. In our approach thelearning situation is analyzed using the mobile device's sensors. With this information the learning lesson can be adapted to the situation. Additionally, learning agents can be introduced.Varying situations due to mobility may interrupt the learner. Main tasks of learning agents are to track the learning progress and to support the learner in returning to his lesson. This bindstogether virtual learning environments which are accessed by mobile devices and real life situations. Individualisation: The third key issue we identified is individualisation. Learners have different social back- ground as well as different education. This individualises two points. First, the learning entry has to be chosen. If necessary this can be supported by a questionnaire which is helpful to find out the own learning level. The learning environment has to adapt to this situation. Here we use knowledge system based approaches to adapt the actual learning situation. Second, the learning progress is subject to individualisation. We distinguish between the order of learning lessons and the time schedule of learning lessons. Both are individualised in future learning environments. If the learner can choose the order of lessons the motivation for learning will be maximised, which is a key issue for learning success. Individual timeschedules allow learning progresseven if classmates have not reaches the personal learning level. This maximises learning progress because waiting periods for classmates or teaching terms are eliminated. Prof Dr Wolfram Hardt Professor This new learning approach finds application in international master programs, postgraduate professional education and in-service training. The introduced technologies in hardware and software enable evaluation, mobile learning and individualisation. In this way diversity in terms of cultural background, language and education are overcome in a common learning approach. Nurturing maths throughout Europe Adjacent Government highlights the work of the European Mathematical Society (EMS), and how it's helping Europe to remain a global player in that eld... Last year, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) reportedthe European Union on the whole was seriously lagging behind in mathematics. The gures showed there had been no progress in improving the percent age of low achievers at EU level since 2009. However, the OECD also reported that Estonia, Finland, Poland, and the Netherlands are among the top performing countries globally, having reached a low achiever rate below the EU benchmark of 15%. The report also acknowledged that signicant progress - more than 2 percentage points - had been made in Bulgaria, Ireland, Croatia, Latvia, Austria, and Romania.1In response to the results, Androulla Vassiliou, Euro pean Commissioner for Education, Culture, Multilingualism and Youth, commented: \"I congratulate those Member States which have improved theirper formance, but it is clear that the EU as a whole needs to work harder. \"Member States must sustain their eorts to tackle low achievement in school education to ensure that youngsters have the skills they need to succeed in the modern world. The results are a reminder that investment in quality education is fundamental for Europe's future.\" Supporting mathematics is vital if Europe is to remain a global player in the eld. The European MathematicalEducation and Training 116Education and Training Society (EMS) represent mathematicians, and promotes mathematical research throughout member states. With around 60 national mathematical societies, 40 research centres, and 3,000 individual members, the society will celebrate its 25th anniversary next year. EMS provides membership for both corporations,and individual members. Speaking during the 6th European Congress ofMath ematics, EMS President Marta Sanz-Sol\u00e9 outlined the importance of the subject. She commented: \"Like many other disciplines, mathematics has reached a degree of extreme specialisation. Nevertheless, there remains a need for keeping its unity as a scientic discipline, for resisting fragmentation, and for main taining and even increasing fluid communication between its domains. A holistic structure will better contribute to genuine progress of scientic knowledge. \"As for other theoretical or experimental areas, scien tic, social or humanistic, the most signicant mathematical advances and breakthroughs involve a complex and sophisticated combination of ingredients, expertise and techniques from dierent elds. \"By keeping our minds wide open, and nurturing the desire of exploring beyond the boundaries of one's specic research speciality, we will have a better chance to be at the forefront of the scientic advances in ourdiscipline.\" 2 The society is undoubtedly the main voice for mathematics in Europe, oering a platform for the subject, and bringing together experts. Promoting research is a key facet of the EMS. In 2001, the society launched its Publishing House. EMS PH prints peer-review journals to disseminate mathematics research within the community. The society currently publishes 18 journals, and has also printed books, newsletter, and e-books on the discipline. In a Europe Physics news journal article, published in the summer last year, Sanz-Sole outlined how the EMS supported mathematics and the described the dierent ways the society helped to promote thesubject. She highlighted the role of societies like EMS to continue to develop the eld. She said: \"In the global world, international learned societies are more than ever of strategic importance to support the advances of disciplines and to promote indispensable interactions. \"The current political structures in Europe and its strong historical identity, provide full meaning to and show the strong necessity for the existence of solid scientic umbrellas, platforms and networks within Europe. We can proudly state that EMS is playing this role for mathematics in Europe.\"3 Mathematics is undoubtedly the life blood of research, underpinning multiple elds. Without signicant promotion of the subject there is a concern that the next generation of scientists may fall behind on this subject. Europe has a duty to ensure all its students perform well in mathematics, and continue to extend targets to ensure improvements occur. Societies such as the EMS play a pivotal role not onlyin the promotion of the eld, but in ensuring research is pushed to the centre stage via respected andpresti gious peer-review publications. Sanz-Sole has worked hard to push her eld to the forefront, and to break down perceived gender barriers within thedisci pline. When Sanz-Sole reaches the end of her tenure as president next year, it will certainly be inter esting to see what direction her successor takes the society - and the eld - the last few decades, there has been a tendency to invest in applied science rather than in fun- damental research. This happens everywhere around the world, and it is a logical consequence of the budget restraints and the demand for very fast profit. Fundamental research is not profitable, at least not in the short term. And in the long run, the profit does not come from where the main research was performed. In fact, fundamental research sometimes meanders its way to applications very slowly, not at all foreseeable, and certainly not on command. So, in recent years, we have seenmany positions for pure mathematicschange into positions for applied mathematicians, or computer scien- tists. This mainly happened in depart- ments where pure and appliedmathematicians live together. In Ghent University, we have a single department for \"Mathematics\", teach- ing pure mathematics. The non-pure mathematics is concentrated in another department, the Department of Applied Mathematics, Computer Science and Statistics. So you would think pure mathematics is safe and can run its own business. But another issue is slowly taking us down. The financing according to the number of publications a university, faculty, or department produces. Although it is commonly known that the publication culture strongly differsfrom area to area, not many adminis- trators take this into account. Take pure mathematics. First of all, there are very few authors on a publication. Secondly, the average number of publications per person is considerably smaller than in other fields of science, although the number of pages per article can be larger. Therefore, com- pared to fellow scientists of the same faculty, but a different field, the math- ematician is seen to underperform if solely based on the amount of publi- cations they produce. \"Fundamental research is not profitable, at least not in the short term. And in thelong run, the profit does notcome from where the main research was performed. \" This results in a continuous shrinking of the Department of Mathematics. Nevertheless, the research groups perform valuable work. With nine mathematicians, we try to cover the most important areas, and publish influential papers. Historically, it has been so that the research group \"Inci-dence Geometry\" could profit from the performance of its founder, Prof. Em. Joseph A. Thas. That was reflected in four full professor positions, currently held by Bart De Bruyn, Leo Storme, Koen Thas and myself.

PROFILEHealth 119Improving health in the community Professor Kevin Fenton, National Director of Health and Wellbeing at Public Health England provides insight into how local authorities are helping to improve health and wellbeing in the community... The average person in England is overweight and 1 in 4 is obese. If we don't tackle this epidemicmore eectively, we'll increase the odds of chronic diseases, which include heart disease, type 2 diabetes, breast (in postmenopausal women) andcol orectal cancer. We have to make it easier for people to make healthier choices in their diet and activity levels. But we know that our lifestyles are heavily influenced by habit, how we were brought up, how we live our lives and by the local environment - from access to green spaces to how we travel and the type of shops in our neighbourhoods. If we want to shift unhealthy behaviours, we've got totake action across all these areas and more, Public Health England's role is to work with local authorities to help make this happen. Our social marketingprogramme, Change4Life, helps families to improve their health in ways that t in with daily life, one small step at a time: for example swapping sugary drinks to \"sugar-free\" or lower fat milk or water. Local government can play a big role in giving these campaigns more prominence. Leeds City Council, for example, ran its own local Smart Swaps campaign with over half of community venues displayingChange4Life campaign materials. But there are lots of other examples of what local communities are doing to help improve diets. In temples: the Shree Jalaram Hindu Ji Sikh Gurdwara in Wolverhampton, thousands of weekly visitors are served free vegetarian meals that have lower salt and saturated fat, through a British Heart Foundation project, which could poten tially be used in other Gurdwaras and Mandirs.The PHE's Change4Life Smart Swaps campaignIn the London Borough of Havering, a group of public sector caterers delivering food to local schools, care home residents, universities and public sector workers, is setting high standards for food purchasing -exceeding mandatory national food and nutrition standards for schools. \"If we want to shift unhealthy behaviours, we've got to take action across all theseareas and more, Public Health England's role is to work with local authorities to help make this happen. Our social marketingprogramme, Change4Life, helps families to improve their health in ways that fit in with daily life, one small step at a time... \" Local authorities have many other ways - from meas ures to local transport plans - to influence the current and future health of local residents. For exam ple, St Helen's Council has a policy of restricting planning approvals for fast food outlets that are close to schools and sixth form colleges. Training and guid ance for local businesses can also have an impact. For example, the Chartered Institute of Environmental Health together with the Greater London Authority and the Association of London Environmental Health Managers has developed a healthier catering scheme, providing advice on healthier food preparation for local businesses. Of course, food and calorie intake is only one part of the equation. The other half of the equation is physical activity. Here too, there's a lot that local authorities can do. For example, 20mph speed limits in priority urban areas (as well as other measures such as trac calming) can help to improve road safety, creatingmore opportunities for walking and cycling. Schools can work with local authorities on school travel plans to encourage more children to walk or cycle to school. There are also lots of examples of how communities have transformed public spaces into gardens and places where local residents can garden, exercise, or just play. In some of Dudley's parks, for instance, outdoor gym equipment has been installed as part of 'health hubs'. In Plymouth, the city council has foundways of supporting people living in deprived areas to take advantage of green spaces through volunteer-led'walking for health' groups. These are just a few examples of the vision, determi- nation and collaborative spirit that communities are showing in promoting the health and wellbeing of residents. Now that local authorities are responsible for the public health of their local populations, there's an unprecedented opportunity to strengthen the links between public health, planning, transport, education and other sectors. Working together across local and national boundaries provides us with exciting opportunities to put the community voice at the centre of our work. If we're going to crack the obesity epidemic across the population, we need to start in the neighbourhoods in which we live, work Fenton National Director of Health and Wellbeing Public Health England Tel: Professor Joep Perk of Linnaeus University, and a member of the European Society of Cardiology, speaks to Editor Laura Evans about the importance of reducing cardiovascular diseases in Europe and how this can be achieved... In Europe, cardiovascular diseases cause over 4 million deaths and over 1.9 million deaths in the European Union, which equates to 47% of all deaths inEurope and 40% in the EU. According to the European Heart Network,1death rates from cardiovascular heart disease (CHD) are generally higher in Central Europe, whereas death rates from stroke are much higher in Central and Eastern Europe. Overall CVD is estimated to cost the European Union economy\u20ac196bn a year. Cardiovascular diseases are all the diseases of the heart and circulation, including coronary heart disease (angina and heart attack), heart failure, congenital heart disease and stroke. There are many factors that increase the risk of developing a cardiovascular disease including; smoking, weight gain, diet, and lack of exercise. Member of the European Society of Cardiology, and Clinical cardiologist and Professor of Health Sciences at Linnaeus University, Professor Joep Perk speaksto Laura Evans about the problems cardiovascular diseases can cause throughout Europe, and what more could be done to decrease fatalities. \"If we go back some way in time, cardiovascular diseases were fairly uncommon in the beginning of the past century,\" Professor Perk begins. \"In Western Europe they started to show up in the 1930s and 40s and culminate around 1970 and 1980. In Western European countries there has been a steady decrease over the past 20-30 years. Research has shown that, of the 6- year increase in life expectancy between 1970 and 2000, 65% of the increase - or almost 4 full years - is due to reductionsin CVD mortality alone. As positive as this scenario is,heart disease remains the leading cause of death and the new epidemic has the potential to threaten the advances made to date. Europe is currently facing a series of emerging trends, such as the growing ageingpopulation, that could create new challenges forhealthcare systems.\" \"In Sweden, premature and early mortality in heart diseases has reduced to a third of what we had in the 1980s, which is a tremendous dierence. At the same time as we see this lowering in Western Europe, we see some parts of Eastern Europe still experiencing problems.\"Professor Perk explains there are some areas of Europe where cardiovascular disease is still rife. For example in Eastern Europe, the problem seems to be bigger than Western Europe, which Perk believes is due to lifestyle dierences. \"Cardiovascular diseases are becoming a problem in middle and low income countries like India, Pakistanand Brazil, with 80% more early cardiovascular deaths being recorded. \"It is very much to do with public health; smoking, physical activity, what you eat, stress and our sleeping habits. In several Western European countries we have seen two thirds of a drop in mortality over the past 25 years, which is due to the fact that people are smoking less, and are slightly more physically active. \"A country like Bulgaria for example has a huge prob lem. People are getting fatter, they are smoking more, move around less, and have more stressful lives which leads to a direct increase in mortality.\"The dierence in mortality rates has a lot to do with developed countries having more eective treatment to hand. For underdeveloped nations, mortality rates are higher due to eective treatments or quality of care not being available, as Professor Perk explains. \"If you look at the risk factors, the number of peopleoverweight and smoking is a bigger problem in richer countries. In poor countries, the quality of care, espe cially the follow up, is still undeveloped. For example, if you have a heart attack in Bangladesh, thesurvival rate is far worse than if you had one in the UK. If you look at the risk level for the average Britishcitizen who is overweight and less active, when they have a heart attack they still have a better chance of surviving than the lean non-smoker in Bangladesh.\" Cardiovascular diseases remain the prime cause of premature deaths under the age of 75, and ProfessorPerk believes if we can tackle the problem head on, 80% of all cardiovascular diseases could be eradicated which is a huge achievement in itself. Perk believes that education and legislation could playa key part in eradication. If people had the correct information and knowledge about these diseases, mortality rates could be a lot less. \"On a political level - more legislation on smoking, the amount of salt in food, access to fresh fruit and vegetables and physical activity is needed,\" said Professor Perk. The EACPR issued an interesting paper about this. 2\"People need to be informed that heart attacks aresomething that at least 80% of people can influence through their own behaviour. We recently conducteda study and discovered the basic knowledge on how people could prevent this disease is lacking. There is a need for good public knowledge so people can take responsibility for their own health. \"On these 2 levels (public and personal) we can further eradicate cardiovas cular disease. We know there is a signicant dierence of cardiovascular disease between the higher and lower income countries. If you make fruit and vegetables a lot cheaper, you give people with less resources a better chance of getting anti-oxidants into their diet, which can help to keep you healthy.\" Perk believes it is important to try and eradicate cardiovascular problems now, in order to prevent the next generation from developing the diseases. \"The main aim is to help the next generation who Iwould like to see active in sports. They have a body that has a reasonable guarantee to get to 90 years old. We have lots of children that are failing at school, theydon't sleep enough, and they don't eat the right foods, and that is one of the main challenges in Europe. \"Because I am professor of health science I work mainly on trying to transfer the knowledge we already have. We need to educate people and tell them these diseases are a waste of our time and we don't need them.\" 1http://www.ehnheart.org/cvd-statistics.html 2Population-level changes to promote cardiovascular health. Eur and Professor of Health Sciences Linnaeus University, Sweden, and member of the European Society of Cardiology joep.perk@lnu.se www.escardio.org Health 122Health 123Strengthening Danish Healthcare Adjacent Government discusses the approach Danish Minister for Health Nick Haekkerup aims to take in order to transform the healthcare system in Denmark... Over the last few years, Denmark has developed a reputation as a leader and a pioneer in health. Under the auspices of the former Minister for Health and Prevention Astrid Krag, Denmark has successfully grown its digital programme, pushing it to the forefront of healthcare in Europe. New minister Nick H\u00e6kkerup certainly has some big shoes to ll when it comes to developing innovation in the Danish healthcare system. Despite only beingin power since February, the Minister has yet to really get his teeth into his agenda. However, the Minister recognises the importance of tackling health inequali- ties in the nation, and understands that there is not a one size ts all approach when it comes to healthcare. In comments made to the Danish newspapers - \"Frederiksborg Amts need a dierent approach if we are to transform the Danish population's habits and lead them in a healthier direction. \"I agree that when we discuss health, there is a need to move away from talking about the client and instead focus on directly speaking to citizens and listening to their needs.\" Minister Haekkerup was very open about being asocialist and driven by the desire for equality in the Danish healthcare system. He believes the government has a moral obligation to act. \"The free and equal access to healthcare is one of the crown jewels of the Danish welfare state. I have therefore taken the initiative to strengthen eorts to combat health inequalities\", he said.\"We need to treat people dierently in order to treat everyone equally well. We should accept that as citizens we are dierent and that our needs are too - and this must be reflected in our healthcare system.\" Like the UK, Denmark's healthcare system oers free and equal access to services, as well as universal coverage for all. In 2011, 9.3% of gross domestic prot (GDP) - 1.5% higher than in the UK - was spent on public healthcare expenditure alone. Minister Haekkerup would like to see healthier choices available for Danes. He believes that a dierent approach to healthcare can help transform the popu- lation habits, and lead then in a healthier direction. \"We aim to ensure that the proposals in the healthcare system are more tailored to the individual's need,\" he explained. \"It is also about designing healthcare to be able to oer varied services for people. \"Depending on their health and lifestyle needs, citi- zens should be allowed to determine and contribute to their own health, without being lectured .\" The comments in this article were taken from comments made by the Minister in \"Frederiksborg Amts diagnosis is a must for rational therapy, and nuclear medicine offers a unique instrument. As opposed to conven- tional diagnostic imaging with x-rays or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), molecular imaging provides under- standing and quantification of molec- ular processes in the body. By tracking from outside the body the distribution and fate of molecules inside the body and being up to a million times more sensitive, molecular imaging offers early and more correct diagnosis and staging of disease and, in addition, monitoring of treatment response. As such molec- ularimaging is the prerequisite of 21st Century personalized medicine. Positron emission tomography (PET) is the heart of molecular medicine.Positrons are cyclotron produced radioisotopes. When attached to amolecule, these become detectableand quantifiable by a PET scanner. Modern PET/CT or PET/MRI hybrid scanners provide molecular and struc- tural information of the entire body. The most common tracer is a modified glucose molecule called FDG, which accumulates in cells with increased metabolism, e.g. cancer cells. By FDG- PET/CT most cancers and their metas- tases can be accurately detected. The error rate is about 10% as compared to 33% with conventional imaging. This has enormous implications. Increased glucose metabolism is a hallmark also of inflammation, whether infectious or non-infectious. Inflam- mation is the major reason for \"false\"results with FDG-PET/CT. Due to different dynamics, changes caused by cancer and inflammation can often be sepa- rated. Inflammation is considered \"the mother\" of many diseases. PET can detect inflammation at an early stage, when it is still curable. This as opposed to cancer, which is no longer considered a curable but a chronic disease, which, at best, one may diewith instead of from. The major role of inflammation was demonstrated by PET in psoriasis, whichDepartment of Nuclear Medicine Odense University Hospital University of Southern Denmark Tel: +45 65 41 29 81 www.ouh.dk/wm370265A new horizon in molecular imaging - inflammation affects 2-3% of all women and men, and also in deep vein thrombosis, which is the fore-runner of pulmonary embolism. In psoriasis, PET surpris- ingly disclosed that patients, besides inflammation of the skin, may have inflamed major vessels inside the body and abscess-like changes in various organs. In venous thromboembolism, the blood may clot in the leg veins during long-distance flights or pro- longedbed rest. This is a serious con- dition, since fragments of the clot may dislodge and wedge in the lungs as pulmonary emboli. Anticoagulant therapy is effective, but carries a risk of haemorrhage causing stroke or bleeding stomach ulcer. In thesepatients, PET ensures the correct indi- cation for therapy. Since inflammation is a key factor in diseases like arte-riosclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, chronicobstructive pulmonary disorder and maybe even cancer, molecular imaging may cause a paradigm shift in their management.

Europe's drugs problem is becoming increasingly complex, with new challenges emerging that raise concerns for public health. This is according to the European Drug Report 2014: Trends and developments released by the EMCDDA on 27 May 1. This annual review of the drug phenomenon describes an overall stable situation regarding the more established drugs, where some positive signs are observed. But this iscounter-balanced by new threats posed by syntheticdrugs - including stimulants, new psychoactive substances and medicinal products - which are becoming more prominent in a changing Europeandrug market. Commenting on the report, European Commissioner for Home Aairs, Cecilia Malmstr\u00f6m said: \"I am deeply concerned that the drugs consumed in Europetoday may be even more damaging to users' health than in the past. There are signs that the ecstasy and cannabis sold on the street are getting stronger. I also note that the EU Early Warning System, our rst lineof defence against emerging drugs, is coming under growing pressure as the number and diversity of substances continue to rise sharply\". The report shows how the rise in the number, type and availability of new psychoactive substances (NPS or 'new drugs') in Europe shows no signs of abating. In 2013, 81 new drugs were notied for the rst time to the EU Early Warning System, bringing the number of new substances monitored by the EMCDDA to over 350. New drugs may be produced in clandestine laboratories inside Europe. More commonly, however, they aresourced legally as powders mostly from China and India, and imported into Europe where they areprocessed, packaged and sold as 'legal high' products or 'research chemicals', as well as sold directly on the illicit drug market. The Internet continues to play a key role in shaping the NPS market. In 2013, the EMCDDA identied some 650 websites selling these substances to Europeans. With regard to heroin, global production remains high, but latest data on the demand for treatment and on seizures in Europe point to a downward trend in the use and availability of this drug. There are an estimated 1.3 million problem opioid users in Europe, mostly heroin users. The report raises concerns over heroin being replaced by other substances, such as synthetic opioids. Illicitly produced or diverted from medical sources, these include highly potent fentanyls and substances used in opioid substitution treatment(e.g. methadone). \"Looking at the big picture, we see that progress has been made in Europe on some of the major health policy objectives of the past\", comments EMCDDA Director Wolfgang G\u00f6tz. \"But the European perspective can obscure some important national dierences.Our latest data show how encouraging overall EU trends on overdose deaths and drug-related HIVinfections, for example, sit in sharp contrast to worrying developments in a few Member States\". Overall, around 6 100 overdose deaths (mainly related to opioids) were reported in Europe in 2012, compared with 6,500 reported in 2011 and 7,100 in 2009. Never theless, the report shows how overdose deaths remain high in Europe, and are increasing in some countries. Over the last decade, large gains have been made within the EU in addressing HIV infection among people who inject drugs. Yet the latest ndings show that developments in some countries are impacting negatively on the long-term decline in the number of new HIV diagnoses in Europe. \"Outbreaks of HIV among drug users in Greece and Romania, together with ongoing problems in some Baltic countries, have stalled Europe's progress in reducing the number of new drug-related HIV infections\", states the report. Cocaine remains the most commonly used illicit stimulant drug in Europe, although most users are found in a small number of western EU countries. An estimated 14.1 million Europeans (15-64 years) have used the drug; 3.1 million in the last year. A number of indicators suggest that cocaine use maybe on the decline; for example the number of clientsentering treatment for the rst time in their life for primary cocaine use in Europe decreased from apeak of 38,000 in 2008 to 26,000 in 2012. Use of amphetamines (a term encompassing amphetamine and methamphetamine) remains overall lower than that of cocaine in Europe, with around11.4 million adults reporting lifetime use and 1.5 million last-year use. Of the 2 drugs, amphetamine is more commonly used, but there are growing concerns around methamphetamine. The report describes how methamphetamine seizures in Europe, while still small in number and quantity, have increased over the lastdecade, suggesting increased availability of the drug. And use of methamphetamine, historically low in Europe and mainly limited to the Czech Republic and Slovakia, now appears to be spreading. Also high lighted in the report is the re-emergence of high-quality ecstasy (MDMA) powders and pills. Cannabis continues to be the most commonly used illicit drug in Europe, with around 73.6 million Europeans having used this drug at some point in their lifetime,and 18.1 million in the last year. An estimated 14.6 million young Europeans (15-34 years), report last- year use. Cannabis use in Europe overall appears to be stable or declining, especially in young age groups, although national trends appear more diver gent. Public health concerns are greatest for Europeans who use the drug on a daily, or almost daily, basis (around 1% of adults, 15-64 years). Europe's drug phenomenon is clearly dynamic and continues to evolve. This leaves no room for com placency as new threats emerge to accompany residual and long-established problems. 1European Drug Report 2014 package www.emcdda.europa.eu/edr2014 and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA) Tel: +351 211 21 02 00 info@emcdda.europa.euwww.emcdda.europa.eu Health 126Health re prod uctive health fo r all Marleen Temmerman and Rajat Khosla from the Department of Reproductive Health & Research at WHO discuss the importance of access to reproductive health services worldwide*... Reproductive and sexual health is fundamental to individuals, couples and families, and the social and economic development of communities and nations. The International Conference on Population and Development in 1994 ushered a new era for the work on reproductive health by emphasising a comprehensive approach to reproductive and sexual health. It empha- sises that reproductive and sexual health is closely associated with sociocultural factors, gender rolesand the respect and protection of human rights. Since the adoption of this comprehensive approach 2 decades ago there have been numerous achievements . Countries have devised innovative strategies and programmes, to advance the sexual and reproductive health agenda. Reviews point out that progress has been made in several areas. These include: reduction in the rates of new infection for HIV in many countries, an overall 50% reduction in maternal mortality, and increases in the use of modern contraception. Despite these promising advances, signicant gaps in ensuring universal access to reproductive health remain. Sexual and reproductive health problems represent one third of the total global burden of disease for women between the ages of 15 and 44 years, and violence against women and girls remains the most frequent human rights abuse worldwide. Worldwide, 222 million women are estimated to have an unmet need for modern contraception and the need is greatest where the risks of maternal mortality are highest. In 2008, globally an estimated 500 million new (incident) cases of curable STIs (gonorrhoea, chlamydia, syphilis and trichomoniasis) occurred. In addition, people are estimated to be living withincurable herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) infection. Approximately 291 million women have an HPV infec tion at any given point in time, and it is likely that the numbers of HPV-infected men are similar. When we examine the reasons behind these gaps it is clear that there are structural factors which impair progress. One key factor is rising inequalities. There is clear evidence that inequalities and inequities in theaccessibility and quality of health systems across andwithin countries continue to persist. Poverty is one of the biggest reasons behind inequitable access to health systems, particularly sexual and reproductive health. As evidence shows, the burden of reproductive and sexual ill-health is greatest in the poorest countries where health services tend to be physically inac cessible, poorly staed, equipped, and beyond the reach of many poor people. Too often, improvements in public health services do not reach poor and other marginalised groups. Within many middle- and high-income countries, pockets of weak and poor health system coverage or low-quality serv ices abound for certain areas or populations, such as for the poor, older persons, rural residents and residents of urban slums, and for uninsured or undocumented persons. Another key dimension behind slow progress is poor quality of care. Sexual and reproductive health services should be, but often are not, provided at a level of quality that meets human rights standards. In addition to medical ethics and the public health imperative, the right to the highest attainable standard of health obligates governments to ensure that health facilities,goods and services, including sexual and reproductive health services, are of good quality.\"The burden of reproductive and sexual ill-health is greatest in the poorest countries where health services tend to bephysically inaccessible, poorly staed, equipped, and beyond the reach of many poor people. \" To address these challenges and to meet the repro- ductive and sexual health needs of people all around the world, the WHO Reproductive Health Strategy (2004) recommends a comprehensive approach. Guided by human rights principles, the Strategy recommends that to accelerate progress countries should address the 5 core aspects of reproductive and sexual health are: improving antenatal, perinatal, postpartum and newborn care; providing high-quality services for family planning, including infertility services; eliminating unsafe abortion; com bating sexually transmitted infections including HIV, reproductive tract infections, cervical cancer and other gynaecological morbidities; and promoting sexual health. Because of the close links betweenthe dierent aspects of reproductive and sexual health, interventions in one area are likely to have a positive impact on the others. It is critical for coun tries to strengthen existing services and use them as entry points for new interventions, looking for maximum synergy. It further suggests the need to strengthen healthsys tems capacity including through sustainable healthnancing mechanisms, human resources and quality in service provision. The strategy also calls for the need to ensure supportive legal and policy environment and to strengthen monitoring and evaluation systems and mobilisation of political will. As the world leaders meet to dene the new vision for international development, we must recommit ourselves to these principles to ensure the realisation of reproductive and sexual and health needs of people around the world. *The views expressed here are those of the authors themselves and they do not necessarily represent the views of Health & Research Rajat Khosla Human Rights Adviser - Department for Reproductive Health & Research World Health Organisation (WHO) reproductivehealth@who.intwww.who.int/reproductivehealth/en/Health 128Health 129Reducing the barriers for deafblind people Adjacent Government looks at how technology such as hearing aids can help people with deafblindness lead independent lives... In the UK alone it is believed that there are around 250,000 deafblind people - which is a combination of sight and hearing impairment. The disability is one with very little understanding, and public awareness of how it aects people's abilities is low. We rely on our sight and hearing for everyday tasks, and the world around us can present many challenges for deafblind people. For people who are deafblind, the barriers they face can be a lot more challenging than people who have just a single impairment. Blind people, to a certain degree, can compensate by using their hearing - andvice versa. However, multi-sensory impairment raises many challenges, and many deafblind people rely onsensory aids to help tackle everyday tasks. Speaking to Adjacent Government in February, Gill Morbey President of Deafblind International high lighted some of the causes for sensory loss:\"Causes of deafblindness vary across countries,\" she said. \"They can include infections during pregnancy, prematurity, rare syndromes, such as Usher and CHARGE, illness and accidents, and sensory loss in old age. \"In the UK, vaccination has almost eradicated rubella however in some parts of the world the absence ofvaccination programmes such as MMR means that children are still being born with the entirely preventable Congenital Rubella Syndrome (CRS).\"1 Morbey pointed out that no matter what the cause is, deafblind people have a unique set of needs and require specialist support. Hearing aids can be a substantial benet to people who suer with sensory loss. Quality of life can be greatly improved especially for elderly people who have mild or moderate hearing loss. Sense, the national charitythat campaigns and supports people with deaf blind- ness, estimates 63.5% of people aged 70 or over have a mild or moderate hearing loss problem. Many deafblind people rely on their hearing aids for environmental cues to help navigate outside their homes and give them condence to leave the house.In a recent study carried out by Sense and the Ear Foundation, deafblind people were found to be reliant on their hearing aids, with 94% wearing them all the time. Suering from both hearing and vision loss increases with age, with estimates suggesting that 220,000 people aged 70 or over currently suer from duelsensory loss. It is thought the number will more than double by 2030. 2 Living independently can become near impossiblefor a deafblind person. Without specialist support, just carrying out one-on-one conversations are a difficult task. North Staordshire CCG recently launched a consultation about their proposal to stop providing hearing aids toadults with mild to moderate hearing loss. However, concerns have been raised by Sense about the negative impact this could have on quality of life. The concerns raised by Sense following the consultation includes that early intervention of hearing aids for progressive cases of hearing loss, such as presbyacusis, can allow people to maintain existing communication methods or provide them with the auditory input theyrequire to develop new ones. Sense also believe that restricting hearing aid provision will aect the ability of deafblind people to accesshealthcare in terms of communicating with health professionals and obtaining appointments. For example a deafblind person without a hearing aid might nd it dicult to hear instructions for their prescription or even make GP appointments over the phone. Hearing aids also provide deafblind people with envi-ronmental help in regards to hazards around them.For many people the aids provide them with a senseof security around the home and also in the outside environment. Technology has had a great impact on the lives of people with duel sensory loss. As well as hearing aids, braille systems, computer aids and screen readers are just some of the examples that help deafblind people live independent lives. \"Advancements in communication technology have had a huge impact on deafblind people,\" added Morbey. \"At last, through computers and tactile displays, deaf blind people can be supported in employment and complex tasks through to simple but important things such as directly contacting friends. \"More advances in technology have the potential to make real life changes for people who are deafblindand disabled.\" Lack of access to technology such as hearing aids could considerably impact on the independence of a deafblind person, and reduce their condence to leave their house. For more information regarding the consultation please visit Could you shed light on the term deafblindness? Individuals born with congenital deaf- blindness suffer with serious visual and auditory impairments, which influence all aspects of their lives, particularly access to information, communication and language. These people experience dual sensory loss before they developed a language. There are thousands of people with congenital deafblindness in the Netherlands, many of whom are not diagnosed yet because they are infacilities for people with intellectual disabilities and expertise on deaf- blindness is still very scarce. I may be the only professor in the world tohave a special Chair solely focused on communication in people with deafblindness. Through what means do those with deafblindess communicate and what problems does this method pose? Persons with deafblindness don't use words to communicate, because most of them cannot speak. Their methods of interaction and communication can be described as 'conversations with bodies'. Participation in these 'bodily conversations' requires a high level of sensitivity, special insights and consid- erable skills for the hearing and sighted caregivers. You can imagine that in daily practice mutual misun- derstandings easily can lead to severeemotional problems and challenging behaviours. Daily communication with their caregivers is extremely important for the mental wellbeing and social functioning of people with deafblind- ness. However, in practice, persons with deafblindness and their hearing and sighted caregivers experience serious difficulties in expressing their intentions and creating mutual understanding. How will your research projects help to improve communication methods for deafblind individuals? In my research programme we try to develop high-quality communication methods in which caregivers learn new insights and skills in such a waythat persons with deafblindness can share their ideas and thoughts with others about all kind of topics relevant within and outside the direct here and now context. The running PHD projects are more focused on meaning making. Every project is focused on different aspects of the first two layers of intersubjec- tivity and is performed with children and adults. What theoretical basis underpins your research? We are calling upon previous theoret- ical and empirical research to baseThe key to communication Professor Marleen Janssen outlines how her team of seven PhD students is breaking new ground in unlocking communication methods for those with congenital deafblindness our projects - some of which was completed by my self. Our studies focus on intersubjectivity - a concep- tual construct used to describe the interactional relationship between individuals. Within the concept, com- munication is described as having certain layers. At the bottom is basic communications - asking for a drink, for example - with subsequent levelsinvolving higher level and more in-depth and abstract communication. These further levels often involve greater use of symbolic communication and language. The research, conducted by the PhD students explores the first and second levels of intersubjectivityso far. What will the future hold in terms of real-life improvements for patients? For me, this means that caregivers need intensive communication coaching on a more permanent basis. Only with the help of a communication coach, caregivers can be trained in a way and on a level that the person with deafblindness can develop his or her potential for communication. Caregivers very much enjoyed discov- ering their own strengths and weakness with the help of video- analysis and feedback. They learned quickly when they saw themselves on video and were able to adapt their approaches. All caregivers learned from these interventions, althoughthere were individual differences. In all cases positive effects for the people with congenital deafblindness were found with also very interesting individual differences. How will your research evolve in the coming years? Five PhD projects on high-quality communication will finish in 2014. These studies will deliver 20 articles in international peer-reviewed journals and 5 dissertations. I hope that these publications will support policy makers and managers in the clinical field in providing them with the necessary evidence base for new communication methods to implement. The practical application of the research is obviously something that has been of interest to the private sector, with the Royal Dutch Kentalis - an organisation in the Netherlandswho provide diagnostic treatment andspecialist care for the deafblind - funding a number of the projects.In addition to financial support, the researchers are able to use the facili- ties and expertise of the Deafblind- ness Centre of Excellence owned and managed by Royal Dutch Kentalis. This state-of-the-art facility is interna- tionally renowned for those with congenital deafblindness, providing researchers with access to the best equipment and experts in the country. Additional partners, including Bartimeus and Royal Vision, two Dutch organisa- tions specialising in care for the visually impaired, are supporting the projects. With such important and influential partners, knowledge transfer can be optimised. Furthermore, I want to expand the research program for high-quality communication internationally, focus- ing on testing the theory of tertiary intersubjectivity and language acqui- sition and follow some cases in different countries for five years in collaboration with European clinical institutions and other universities.Prof Dr H J M Janssen Congenital and Early Acquired Deafblindness Department of Special Needs Education and Youth Care University of Groningen PO Box 72 9700 AB Groningen The Netherlands h.j.m.janssen@rug.nl www.rug.nl/staff/h.j.m.janssen www.kentalis.nlBIOGRAPHY Marleen Janssen has served as Profes- sor (Tenure Track) at the Department of Special Needs Education and Youth Care at the University of Groningen since 2008.

Paediatric Rheumatology includes conditions which cause inflammation of the joints or soft tissues (such as arthritis), autoimmune condi- tions that can aect every organ in the body (such as lupus, dermatomyositis, vasculitis, scleroderma), fever syndromes, hereditary disorders of connective tissueand mechanical joint problems. We still do not know how these conditions arise in children, but recognise interplay of genetic susceptibility and environmental factors. Many of the diseases are chronic with no cure, thus having a huge impact on the child and family at a crucial time of development. Management within a specialist multidisciplinary team with expertise in paediatric rheumatology is crucial to addressthese issues. Children are not simply 'mini-adults'. It is important that children and young people are cared for in a suitable environment by an appropriate teamto ensure that the best possible long-term outcome is achieved through early recognition and aggressive treatment. It is a very exciting time to be involved in paediatric rheumatology with current research covering all keyareas from laboratory research to clinical trials of new drugs. Basic science research is focusing on the roles of the innate and adaptive immune systems and genetics of these diseases (including gene expression pathways, genome-wide association studies andresearch into gene-immune phenotype of disease). Translating knowledge gained from the laboratory to new treatments for these children and determiningbiomarkers of disease activity is key in reducing themorbidity from these disorders. The advent of new biologic drugs oers a major step forward in the spec- trum of disease modication that was not available to patients a couple of decades ago. New legislation by the European Union makes it mandatory for newdrugs to have clinical trials in children if deemed appropriate. In the UK we have very good infrastructure established by the National Institute for Health andResearch (NIHR) to enable us to be at the forefront of these clinical trials globally through the Medicines for Children Research Network (MCRN). More research is needed to understand the interactions with the environment that leads to developing arthritis. Impor tant research is looking at safe eective use of vaccines preventing infectious diseases in children on immunosuppressive medications used to treat rheumatic conditions. The UK is leading internationally in undertaking the rst large scale clinical trial in children with sight threatening eye disease secondary to arthritis. This study is supported by the research arm of the NHS (NIHR) and a charity (Arthritis Research UK). We are also pioneering new laboratory research in lupus (a disease which can aect multiple organs in the body). These and many other current and new trials andstudies planned in UK mean that children with rheu- matic diseases in the UK can have the best possible therapies at the earliest possible timeframe. Each paediatric condition is rare, with some conditions only occurring in a few children per million per year. National and international collaboration is essential to answer questions such as the genetic and immuno- logical influences on disease phenotypes and which treatment works for which patient/disease. The UK paediatric rheumatology community is exemplar in supporting collaborative research and works fullyintegrated with international research partners. For international collaboration, all clinicians need to be talking the same language and signicant eorts have taken place through established networks to workcollaboratively on diagnostic criteria for individual diseases, as well as criteria for dening disease activity and disease remission. This allows the development of standardised measures to use in clinical trials. Research needs to focus on long-term outcomes of disease, including decreasing the risk of cardiovascular disease in later life due to inflammation, and how this can be addressed and prevented in younger years. There are many continuing challenges involving a postcode lottery regarding access to care, includingearly diagnosis and access to therapies. The British Society for Paediatric and Adolescent Rheumatology (BSPAR) has produced standards of care for children with arthritis in an attempt to address this issue that have been recognised internationally as exemplar.This year, EU funding has led to the establishment of a European collaboration, Single Hub and Access Point for paediatric rheumatology in Europe (SHARE), with the aim of dening a Europe-wide minimal stan dard of care. Despite major advances in paediatric rheumatology,many children and young people continue to suer signicant pain and disability, with consequential signicant impacts on their quality of life, sleep, education, and future employment. A key challenge is targeting research to address issues that are impor tant to patients and their careers. In the UK, prioritisation of clinical research strategy has been developed through a comprehensive consultation process including consumer involvement through the NIHR MCRN / Arthritis Research UK Paediatric Rheumatology Clinical Studies Group (CSG). The multi disciplinary CSG itself has 10 \"Topic Specic Groups (TSG)\" that are disease or theme focussed that support a wider group of stakeholders who directly input into the evolving strategy of the CSG and support development of specic study applications. Patient/parent representatives are key members of the CSG and each of the TSGs, and so directly influence research priorities. Work is on-going to dene better patient/parent reported outcome measures as it is recognised that current measures of disease activity do not necessarily capture all issues relevant to patientsand their carers. The CSG works in close partnership with BSPAR in achieving its goals.It is essential to ensure that we encourage the next generation of doctors to enter into this exciting specialty. The Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health has a key role in directing training, supportedby the Rheumatology Clinical Specialty Advisory Group. In addition, involvement of Allied Health Professionals in research is vital to ensure holistic care. A clinical-academic ethos that has developed inthe UK units promotes discussion for new research ideas between clinicians and academics, and ensures true translational research. This, together with patient/parent involvement, sets a fantastic platform to test research ideas through established collaborative networks. The future is bright for paediatric rheuma- tology and the specialty is likely to continue to grow from strength to Paediatric Rheumatology Bristol Royal Hospital for Children & Royal National Hospital for Rheumatic Diseases, Bath.

Previously the care of these patients was undertaken by interested adult rheumatologists. However, the National Service Frame- work for children recognised that children should be seen in child-friendly areas by staff trained to look after children. In the UK, there are not enough Paediatric Rheumatologists to see all of these patients, and many are still seen by adult rheumatologists, or are seen by non-specialists. This is no longer acceptable practice. In the last 20 years arthritis treat-ments have emerged which have brought fundamental improvements to the outcomes of children. These improvements can be measured not only in the number of adults who are not consigned to life in a wheelchair, but less demonstrably the even greater numbers whose functionality has been maintained through their school days, enabling them to fulfil their potential in life. However, the distribution of areas of best practice is lamentably poor, creating an inequality of access to care. There is no overall grasp of the problems that the current lack of systems throws up. Specialist commissioning is, to a certain extent, addressing some of the issues, but is itself overwhelmed by the huge task it has been assigned. As a paediatric subspecialty, Paediatric Rheumatology has 2 major drawbacks: paediatricians were not historically taught how to examine the muscu-loskeletal system, and many of the emerging drug treatments are more familiar to oncologists or immunolo- giststhan to paediatricians. Therefore, paediatricians are often unfamiliar with the skills to look after these patients and do not have a ready source of training to close the skills gap. At the moment, there is no added incentive for District General Hospitals (DGH) to provide paediatric rheumatology clinics, and many paediatricians are unwilling to take on the responsibility of caring for these patients. The conditions that paediatric rheumatologists look after are chronic conditions that are considered to be rare:the commonest of these is Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA) with an incidence of 1 in a 1000 children. DGH Paediatricians who start to see children with arthritis are often surprised by the number of patients (80 to 100 per DGH) they see. These children need to be seen frequently within the firstPaediatric Rheumatology in 2014 year of their diagnosis (and when their arthritis flares), as well as every 3 months once their disease is under control to monitor their growth and ensure their joints are developing normally. Added to this cohort will be children with musculoskeletal aches and pains that mimic arthritis: most DGHs should be running a regular Paediatric Rheumatology clinic. BSPAR (British Society for Paediatric and Adolescent Rheumatology), in conjunction with ARMA (The Arthritisand Musculoskeletal Alliance), have published Standards of Care for JIA which have been internationally recognised. These describe the support that children with arthritis need access to: this includes access to physiotherapists, specialist nurses and occupational therapists. Paediatric musculoskeletal physiotherapists are needed for children with muscu- loskeletal aches and pains, whether they are due to arthritis or the more common biomechanical problems (such as a muscle imbalance). This care should be provided locally: at the moment, the specialist centres are trying to plug this gap and are being overwhelmed. Patients with difficul- ties in activities of daily living (due to disease or pain) should have the support of an occupational therapist to help with access to schooling or to help them maintain their independence at home. The patients with arthritis, and other inflammatory diseases requiring immunosuppressant med- ication, should have the support of a clinical nurse specialist to help them understand their disease, their med- ication and to oversee the monitoring of the medication. At the moment, most of this care depends on Paediatric Rheumatology Centres that have developed in a hap- hazard way. Each centre has been built up by an interested doctor, withno regard to population numbers or geography. Each centre has developed its own model of care with varying levels of support local to the family. Not all patients have access to a spe- cialist centre and these will often be looked after by adult rheumatologists. This inequality in care leads to a widevariation in outcomes: research has shown that delay to diagnosis is a poor prognostic factor for good outcome inmany inflammatory diseases. Arthritis is often viewed as an unexciting condition which is not life-threatening. Children with inflammatory diseases are at risk of life-threatening events, which are often poorly recognised until too late. Paediatricians, quite rightly, set great store in whether achild looks well or not. Unfortunately, these children often look relatively well, with only the blood tests indicat- ing the severity of their underlying condition, until they collapse and end up in intensive care. Though this only occurs in the smaller number of chil- dren with systemic illness (rather than illness restricted to just the joints), the early stages are eminently treatable. Even with children whose disease is restricted to just one joint, such as the knee, the joint damage caused by arthritis leads to an inability to walk, leg length discrepancy and secondary spinal deformity. Children with multiple joints affected used to end up severely disabled with stunted growth, often in wheelchairs and unable to lead independent lives. The advent of better medication in the last 20 years (methotrexate and then biologic agents such as etanercept) has improved outcomes enormously by controlling inflammation and allow- ingnormal growth and development to take place. Teams looking after these patients have seen a shift fromRheumatology Department Level 6, Southwood Building Great Ormond Street Hospital Ormond gos-tr.Rheumatology-Gosh@nhs.netwww.gosh.nhs.ukstruggling to keep these patients moving despite their joint problems, to supporting patients to regain normal strength and to maintain full access to their education. There is a financial as well as a human cost in failing to provide proper care in the early years of disease. Stinting on preventive treatment in early years multiplies exponentially the cost of support and care in the rest of life.Existing Paediatric Rheumatology Centres are all oversubscribed and specialist commissioning aside, there is no attempt by government or the NHS to address the lack of an overallstrategy to save children from unnec- essary lifelong hardship. Paediatric Rheumatology teams are keen to improve the care of the children, but lack the time to train local teams to set up, and maintain, appropriate care. The tools exist, but we are failing our children by not enabling them to be put to use. 136PROFILESocial Care 137Germany - promoting a healthier nation Adjacent Government gives an overview of Germany's impressive healthcare system, and their priorities for improving wellbeing in the nation... During a recent interview with the New Osnabr\u00fcck newspaper in July, German HealthMinister Hermann Gr\u00f6he praised the system for providing over all good quality, but added \"evengood things can be better.\" 1 Germany certainly does boast an impressive healthcare system that is dedicated to improving the wellbeing of its citizens. In a recent report carried out by The Commonwealth Fund, Germany's healthcare system was ranked 5th out of 11 of the world's wealthiest country.2 Unlike the UK, healthcare in Germany is funded viainsurance. This is paid via statutory contributions, although private insurance is also available. Payments are split between the employee and the employer. This grants citizens access to free healthcare through insurance funds. According to the gures, approximately 90% of Germans have statutory health insurance3. Services are separated into inpatient and outpatient. Outpatient services are overseen by independent physicians who are contracted to statutory healthinsurers and practise on a freelance basis. They are registered with the regional Association of Statutory Health Insurance Physicians. In Germany, hospitals can be broken down into 3types: public, voluntary, and private. Public hospitals are the responsibility of local authorities, whilst volun tary facilities come under the remit of the church or non-prot organisations. Private hospitals are inde pendently run, free commercial enterprises. Undoubtedly, one of the things that makes Germany's healthcare system impressive is the governmentswill ingness to embrace technology. As a country thatboasts an incredible science base, it is little surprise that technology has been embraced and utilised in their health system. Since taking power as Germany's Federal Minister for Health, Grohe has pushed technology in healthcare signicantly. eHealth has become a huge eld globally, one that is capable of revolutionising the way in which healthcare is delivered to people. Telemedicine and telematics, in particular, both have the ability to reduce costs, and remove pressure from key primary services. Germany's eHealth Initiative aims to \"enable broad access to medical expertise, especially also in rural areas,\" which will \"ensure both the quality of care and the quality of the rural location in question.\"4 However, despite the benets of eHealth, Federal Minister Gr\u00f6he recognised that often telemedicine ideas were not able to develop past the funding point. To ensure the opportunities created by the industry were better utilised, Gr\u00f6he has worked topromote the eld. Under Gr\u00f6he, the Federal Ministry of Health introduced eHealth Cards, which stores the patient's administration information. The card works with the electronic healthcare network (telematics infrastructure) to gain patient information safely and rapidly. The card will eventually enable the safe exchange of medical data, no matter where the patient is in the country. From the 1st January this year, every citizen wishing to use medical services in Germany was required to submit the card as proof of entitlement. In the future, it is hoped that data relating to the patient such as pre-existing conditions or allergiescan be uploaded to the card. In emergency situations doctors or paramedics would have instant access to this information, which could save lives. Patients willbe able to choose how much or how little information is stored on the card. Gr\u00f6he's ministry is also committed to looking beyond its own borders. Recognising the challenges brought by the increased mobility of people, goods, and serv ices, the ministry notes the risk of failing to tackle health on a global level. The ministry stated: \"Globalisation promotes, on the one hand, the homogenisation of consumption habitsand living conditions worldwide. On the other hand, this homogenisation is accompanied by a rising prevalence of chronic non-communicable diseases,especially among the middle class of many threshold and developing countries. \"Avoidable deaths from infectious diseases and, increasingly, from chronic non-communicable diseases exert a negative eect on economic growth and devel opment opportunities as well as on the social and political stability of entire regions. \"They are a principal cause of poverty, lost development opportunities and the ensuing conflicts.\"5 Recently, epidemics and pandemics have shown just how important it is to look at healthcare on a global scale. Disease can spread rapidly, and can aect thou sands of lives. The ministry recognised this, stating that: \"Owing to international air trac, travel and trade relations, new risks of infection are able to reach every corner of the earth within a few hours or days. \"In a very short space of time, epidemics are able to produce serious, protracted economic consequences.\" 6 But Gr\u00f6he's ministry is also quick to note the positive outcomes of global health, such as access to medicines, new technologies, and knowledge - all of which have made research easier to conduct. Global health policy in Germany focuses on 5 main areas. Protection against cross-border health risks, enabling the development of global healthcare systems, improving and expanding intersectoral cooperation, developing health research, and strengthening global health architecture. Over the last 14 years, Germany has more than tripled its expenditure on bilateral and multilateral development cooperation in the health sector. Com pared to its European neighbours, Germany is one of the leading donor countries, spending more than \u20ac700m per year on health. Gr\u00f6he may have more to do in terms of developing healthcare in Germany, but it currently does many things well. The forward thinking of the minister will certainly enable the system to flourish and remaininnovative. The continued use of technology in its services will undoubtedly improve and create a more eective service for the 138139PROFILE The system of mental healthcare in Germany requires more than medical-technical innovation - it requires innovative policy reform. In 2012, healthcare expenditures in Germany exceeded \u20ac300bn,1account- ing for 11.3 % of GDP - 2% higher than the OECD average. Nearly a third of these costs were from the hospital sector, while spending on prevention programs accounted for less than 7% of healthcare costs.2Despite above average healthcare expenditures, Germany ranks below average in the EU in key health and well-being outcomes.3These figures reveal a system that reactively spends massive amounts of resources to achieve relatively poor outcomes - making it clear that the healthcare system is an illness-care system. \"Innovative policy reforms have the power to affect social systems and improve social outcomes. The public can pave or block the road toward innovative policy. \" Mental health, in particular, is an area where the spending-to-outcomes paradox and the lack of innovation are particularly striking. Over the last 2 decades, the German mental health system has experienced a paradig- matic split - with the acute carebranch of the system moving towards an increasingly hospital-based andpharmaceutical-driven approach, andthe community-based care approach moving into an integrative, commu- nity based support and preventive direction. As the differences between these branches have grown, mental health outcomes in Germany havesuffered. Creating a more unified approach to mental health care has the potential to improve outcomes. New Zealand, for example, has invested in a strategy based on prevention, early intervention, skill building and community-based support, resulting in marked decreases in the very areas where the German system has faltered.4,5 While prevention-oriented strategies have the potential to improve mental health outcomes, investments in such work have been cut significantly over the last decade. The lack of demandA New Model of Social Change in Mental Health in Europe The Importance of Framing Change in Mental Health for these services among the public is at least part of the explanation for these cuts and the fact that the pre- vention work that remains is focused narrowly on only the most high-profile areas - such as sexually transmitted diseases and smoking. Improving mental healthcare and devoting more resources to prevention is made even more challenging because mental health is simply not on the public's radar as a social issue.6Public awareness efforts that have been made appear to have been ineffective in get- ting this issue onto the public agenda and expanding public understanding. Over the last five years, the Pfalzk- linikum, located in the south west of Germany, has attempted to improve mental health outcomes by providing services that focus on early intervention, coping skill development and support- ingindependent living. Unfortunately, a significant part the Pfalzklinikum's efforts have been spent paddling against the current - managing mis- trust with the so called cost-bearers and working with clients, trying to bridge the gap between the role as a 'patient' and as a citizen. Over the last five years it has become clear that communications challenges are imped- ingthe Pfalzklinikum's efforts to improve mental health outcomes. Thinking seriously about the impor- tance of communications research led the Pfalzklinikum to the AlbertaFamily Wellness Initiative in Alberta, Canada. Here, the Pfalzklinikum found an approach to communications that took seriously, and empirically, the role of public understanding in improvingsocial outcomes. The Alberta Family Wellness Initiative was using an inno- vative strategy to combine scientific knowledge with communications research to improve mental health policy and practice. They were working with a non-profit communications research organisation called the FrameWorks Institute. As members of the Pfalzklinikum began to study and observe the work of the Alberta Family Wellness Initiative and the FrameWorks Institute, they became convinced that improving mental health outcomes in Germany would require more than new medical, therapeutic or pharmaceutical innova- tions - it would require investments instrategic communication as part of a larger social innovation strategy. So we have to answer the question: Why is investing in communications research a vital part of improving social outcomes and social innovation in mental health? \"Despite above average healthcare expenditures,Germany ranks below aver- age in the EU in key health and well-being outcomes. 3\" Public understanding is a key driver of the policy and programmatic innova- tions that are essential to sustained change and measureable improve- ments in social outcomes. As Mauss and Wolfe wrote almost 40 years ago: \"There is no such thing as a social problem, until enough people, with enough power in the society, agree that there is. Social problems are produced by public opinion, not by particular social conditions, undesirable or otherwise.\"7 We would take this further and argue that there is no social solution until there is both space in public opinion for new ideas and public will to drive reform. Innovative policy reforms have the power to affect social systems and improve social outcomes. The public can pave or block the road toward innovative policy. Where there is robust public understanding and support for solutions, there emergesa demand for new policies. Public demand for change puts immense pressure on policy makers and practi- tioners to make and implement change. On the other hand, where there is notspace in public discourse, efforts to enact policy change will stall and languish, never gaining the momentum of the public will required to change systems and, in turn, improve lives and outcomes. In this way, public opinion is the harbinger of the policy and programmatic change that experts and advocates know is necessary to improve social outcomes. If public understanding is so impor- tant, what can advocates and experts do to shape and expand the 'organ- ised mass'8 of public thinking in ways that open up space for more produc- tive discussions of and support for better policy? The answer lies with the idea of 'culture in mind.'9 As members of a common culture, people sharefoundational ways of looking at the world - what anthropologists call'cul tural models'. These models might include the assumption that indi- vidu als, through their exertion of willpower are responsible for their outcomes and the improvements thereof, or the implicit understandingthat social problems like poverty and injustice are simply too deeply engrained to meaningfully change. These shared expressions of culture in mind influence the way that people process and react to information. Culture in mind has the power to make certain solutions hard to engage with and get behind and others easy to support. 140PROFILE141PROFILE The fact that these cultural under- standings can complicate efforts to change systems is frustrating to those who seek new approaches to improve outcomes. However, cultural models are flexible and responsive to information cues and patterns of presentation - understanding is frame dependent.10 Communication has the power to open new avenues of public thinking and translate information in ways that allow for meaningful engagement and more space for productive debate. This is the science of Framing. In its ability to help experts and advocates navigate the landscape of public understanding, framing holds the key to leveraging the role of public understanding in systems reform for sustained social change. By studying public understanding and empirically testing framing strategies, the FrameWorks Institute seeks to translate scientific and expert infor- mation in ways that expand public discourse. The FrameWorks Institute pursues a portfolio of research proj- ects investigating how Americans view issues including, health access, immigration, obesity, mental health, child development, climate change, racial disparities and public safety. Primarily working in the United States, but also internationally, FrameWorks has created an approach to commu- nications research that is grounded in the cognitive and social sciences, using a multi-disciplinary process that pays attention to the public's deeply held worldviews and widely held assumptions. The approach is designed to help experts and advocatesleverage their work to change the public discourse and pave the way for social change. We have found that thinking seriously about communications is a vital front- end activity for those working to change systems and improve outcomes. When communications are taken seriously and empirically, experts and advocates can create and sustain public support for the changes necessary to improve outcomes. Surrounded by this support, their efforts can gain traction, changingsys tems and improving outcomes. This is why public understanding matters and why an empirical approach to communications is one of our most valuable tools in creating and sustaining the systems changes that lead to better social outcomes.

My focus is to help make adult social care the best it can be for today, tomorrow andfuture generations to come - after all, we all might need to be cared for one day. As the regulator,we cannot make this happen by ourselves - lots of ushave a part to play. People who are using residential and home care serv ices deserve to receive care that is safe, eective, caring, responsive to individual needs and is well- led. It has to be good enough for my mum, your mum or anyone's loved one - and it is vital that this common purpose is shared by everyone who delivers, commissions and regulates this fast growing sector. From October, the Care Quality Commission (CQC) will be launching a new and transformed approach to the way we monitor and inspect adult social care services - one that sets out explicitly what standards weexpect to see, and explains the characteristics of what good and outstanding care looks like. We will continue to respond to concerns raised with us by sta, people using services, their relatives and local agencies. The new regime will also see more specialists, like our Experts by Experience, join us on our inspection work and enable people and their families to share their experience of care with us in a much more meaningful way. Autumn will also be the time when we start to ocially rate every single adult social care service so that people can be absolutely clear about what we think. We will identify and celebrate the good and theout standing care that we see day in, day out. But we will also shine a spotlight on services that require improvement or are inadequate, and when we do, we will expect providers to tackle the problems eectively.Social Care 142Improvi ng an d enhancing adult so cial care England's Chief Inspector of adult social care, Andrea Sutclie, sets out how providers, commissioners and partners alike have a responsibility to champion high-quality adult social care services...Social Care All of this work is underpinned by strengthened regu lations that providers must follow so we can be condent that the right care is being delivered to suit people's individual needs. We use the regulations to determine whether we need to take action against providers if we nd any breaches. The regulations arechanging, and we are changing our approach to what we will do about breaches. Laid before Parliament and enshrined in law as the Health and Social Care Act 2008 (Regulated Activities)Regulations 2014, the new requirements will be more commonly referred to as the 'fundamental standards' of care. This is because they are part of the government'sresponses to the recommendations made by Sir Robert Francis QC following his public enquiry into the tragicfailings of care at Mid Staordshire Foundations Trust. There are 11 fundamental standards and they are more focused than the regulations that they will be replacing. Importantly, they include the widely publicised 'duty of candour' requirement (Regulation 5) and the 't and proper person' requirement for directors (Regulation 20) requirement. These will oblige providers to be open and honest when things go wrong and ensure directors are held to account when care fails people. The government intends to introduce these 2 require ments from next April (subject to Parliamentary process) for Adult Social Care - along with the rest ofthe new regulations. These changes are signicant.And if you are registered with CQC to provide care,you will be obliged to follow them. While it will be up to providers to decide on how they should meet the new regulations, it will be up to CQC to make sure that they do, and if they do not, todecide on what action to take. Where services fail the very people they should be supporting, we will use all powers available to us and take appropriate action to make a positive dierence. We have set out guidance on how we think providers could meet the new regulations. The guidance is not prescriptive but it does indicate what we consider to be best practice to ensure that people receive good care. If you work in a leadership role within any organisation that provides adult social care - or indeed anyone with an interest in our work - now is the time to share your views. We want to know whether you think we are clear on how providers could meet the regulations; whether we have we missed anything out; or, whether there is anything in there that shouldn't be. Not only will our nal guidance help us decide if a regulation is being followed, but it will help to guide all providers on how they can meet the new regulations.

Following healthcare reforms last year, the role local authorities' play in public health has signicantly grown. Social care is at the heart of the reforms and The Care Act, which will come into eect in April 2015, will further cement this. The Care Act is one of the most signicant reforms to the social care system in more than 60 years. The Act hopes to make a substantial dierence to the lives of some of the most vulnerable people in society, and help them to live more independent lives. Aiming to place more emphasis on prevention, the Act will help to make the care system clearer and fairer for those that use and need it. Carers for therst time will be put on the same level footing as the people they care for. It will also simplify the process to enable older people to be looked after by another local authority, without interrupting their care. Following a speech delivered at the LGA conference in July, Editor Laura Evans spoke to Health Minister Dr Daniel Poulter MP , and CEO of cloudBuy Roland Duncan, on how The Care Act will impact local authorities and the role ICT plays in supporting independent living. \"Undoubtedly the Care Act will have a very positive impact, not just for local authorities but also the people they look after. For the rst time we're goingto have a National Aordability Care Assessment, which means if a person being cared for is moved from one local authority to another, their level of carecan be reassessed without it being interrupted,\" explains Poulter. The Act will not only benet local authorities, but also carers and the people that are cared for. A total of\u00a33.8bn will be made available for councils across the 144 Social CareSocial Care UK to help improve their services and transform the way care is delivered. Poulter said: \"There are some real benets for the people who are looked after and the local authorities themselves. \"The \u00a33.8bn Care Fund will transform the way that care is delivered. It is about making sure that people with long term conditions such as dementia, heart disease, or disabilities are looked after in a much more personal way and receive better support in their own home and communities.\" In order to help people live more independently,tech nology plays a significant role, delivering effective support to help deliver the right care. \"There are many care providers that are not doing it to be millionaires, but are doing it to pro vide better care. They work more like charities than private sector companies, and the new technology is making it a lot easier for them to administer services. This is an important aspect because if you can streamline services - it makes for better care.\"Intelligent use of technology allows people to manage their own care at an early stage and reduce theamount of emergency NHS admissions. The Better Care Fund aims to help local authorities do this by managing services in a more ecient and eective way, as the Minister explains: \"It reduces the impact on acute services for the local authority and NHS. It is also good community care. People will have support at home rather than having to turn up in crisis in A&E. \"From a cost perspective there is a real opportunity for local authorities as well. At the moment they are often assessing someone's care needs, and the NHS or social services will often be doing the same. \"Putting money into place will help to reduce some of the duplication of processes and administration. Investments in the right technology will help to support people in their own homes, as well as with the delivery of the care budgets.\" The Better Care Fund will be distributed via an arrangement between the NHS and local social serv ices, based on the needs of local areas. The two sides will work together in order to determine where the main priorities lie. However, the Minister believes the Better Care Fund is building on work that is already there. \"It is about breaking down the barriers between the NHS and local authorities and prioritising quality of care. If it hadn't been for the Better Care Fund, much of the challenges would still be institutional barriers\", he says. Duncan concluded that the technical hurdles have been overcome such as budgets, and its now aboutgetting people working together in partnership to deliver the care that is needed. A consultation has been opened by the Department of Health for local people to give their view on how local authorities should deliver care and supportreforms. More information can be found of London Your care is our care There is sadly no single answer to the difficulties of dementia. It is recognised that the increasing numbers of, principally, the elderly are suffering from some form of dementia. More research reveals that the underlying causes of this disease are many and there are often multiple causes rather than a single cause. The Care Act is attempting to address many of the present problems and is well intentioned. When it comes into force, next year, local authorities are being asked to anticipate what their service users will require. From their present position that is a big ask and with their constrained finances only significant savings will encourage them and it will take time. The NHS trusts are struggling still with the concept of paying for care out of the hospital in the home for patients who would otherwise be bed-blocking. Their payment processes in many instances are not yet in place Meanwhile the care industry has to deal with what is. The overwhelming belief of us in the industry is that the finance is the main cause of the difficulties. From the district nurse to the care worker pressure is put on the front line workers to get more from less. In the public sector the time available per client is reduced, the transport allowance is cut back, the number of care assistants is reduced in this relentless need to reduce costs. The politicians offer more for less with the best of intentions but reality is different.Social Care and Dementia www.companionsoflondon.com Where possible the elderly should be allowed to stay in their own homes or moved to sheltered accommodation. Some will not move but if moved when they can still engage socially with others the elderly society that develops within sheltered housing provides support which appears to delay the onset of dementia. A well run, well designed complex will provide this. The new residents can bring their own furniture and life with them. There are resultant cost savings to the community as the residents are often keen to help each other. And any outside care required can be spread over the community residents. The loneliness that is so prevalent amongst the elderly ceases to be such a factor in their lives. The community will support the couples when one departs. Where the elderly are unwilling to move to a new place the pressure on the carer must be relieved. It cannot be right for carers to be time limited in their visit to those who desperately need their services. At Companions of London, as with a growing number of agencies, there are no short term visits. We operate a minimum 3 hour rule for any assignment. This is for the benefit not just for the service user but also for the carer. The carer can provide the companionship and the observation required to ensure that the health and mental state of the service user is noted. Dementia is progressive, not necessarily at constant rate, but in steps. To care with those suffering a good and well directed carer will understand the development and will be able to anticipate the progression. This requires time, observation and understanding.

Over recent years the European Commission has been working hard to shape a new vision that puts people in control of their health and wellbeing. At the wheel are the patients, on the road towards ecient and eective healthcare. Thebenets are a triple win: putting the patient in control, saving on costs and eciency, and creating huge opportunities for innovative services and start ups.This is the ethos behind our European InnovationPartnership 1for Active and Healthy Ageing. I attended the eHealth Forum2in Athens in May, which put this vision on the public stage at a time of substantial market opportunities. One of the keyissues we discussed was the emergence of mobile health, or mHealth, dened as the use of mobile phones, tablets and other wireless devices in healthcare. These are smart devices for disease self-managementand remote monitoring, leading to prevention ratherthan cure, and more independent living; tools oering tness and dietary tips as well as lifestyle and wellbeing apps. These new technologies can all help healthcareprofessionals treat patients more eciently, get citizens more involved in managing their health and diseases and help Member States deal with tight budgetary and human resources, while facing an ageing population. One example of a mHealth service is the EU-funded REACTION project which developed a mobile system that helps doctors and nurses within the hospital to treat patients with diabetes. Via sensors, the systemmonitors vital signals such as blood glucose levels and administered drugs and gives therapy advice; the data stored on a server are shared via tablets used by the medical sta. This has signicantly reduced the workload, increased the autonomy of nurses and improved the quality of care of diabetes patients. Booming business The mHealth market is rapidly developing: around 100,000 health and well-being apps are alreadyavail able across Apple's AppStore, Google Play and on other global platforms. So far, more than 200 million individuals have downloaded sports, tness andHealthcare Innovation 148Healthcare Innovation health apps. The rise of mHealth is unstoppable and we want to ensure mHealth reaches its full economic and social potential and contributes to high-quality healthcare. This will create huge opportunities for innovative services, start-ups and the app economy. Beyond mHealth, the market for digital health and wellbeing technologies is also growing rapidly. The global market for telemedicine alone is set to growfrom \u20ac7.2bn in 2010 to \u20ac19.3bn by 2016. At the same time, the convergence between wireless communication technologies and healthcare devices and between health and social care is creating innovative newbusi nesses. And as our population ages, the 'silver economy' is emerging as a highly promising market. Overcoming barriers On 9 April, the European Commission published a consultation on mHealth to ask what should be done to increase user trust and patient safety in order to boost mHealth's contribution to high quality healthcare. We want to know whether this should be done region- ally, nationally or at an EU level. We want feedback on issues related to ensuring that health apps meet citi- zens' demands for quality and transparency. mHealth services must adhere to strict data protection rules,and we should be intelligent about how we use the data: we could prevent an epidemic in the future. For all eHealth systems to work seamlessly across national borders, the many dierent systems used byhospitals and other healthcare providers need to be able to communicate with each other. While projects such as epSOS have taken great strides forward, this is not a widespread reality. On top of that, both patients and professionals need to learn to use these new systems. But perhaps the biggest challenge is the required change in mind-set: getting used to managing our health and care in a dierent way, from emailing your doctor to using devices to track your daily activi ties and levels of tness. Connected Continent In order to benet from the great advantages which eHealth oers us, we of course need fast, reliable broadband networks, as well as a quality guarantee for high-quality connections end-to-end - the connec- tions that new healthcare innovations may depend on. Our proposed safeguards for the open internet mean providers cannot just decide to block or throttle any content, application or services, including new health apps or services. And the successful vote of the Connected Continent regulation in the European Parliament back in April is a huge step forward in achieving this & responsible for the Digital Agenda European Commission http://ec.europa.eu/commission_2010-2014/kroes/ 149 Neelie Kroes Vice President & responsible for the Digital AgendaActive and Healthy Ageing (AHA) is a main direction in the HORIZON2020. One of the basic tasks is to face the challenge of turning existing research efforts to reality for healthy and chronic diseased elderly people across Europe. Existing flexible ICT solutions could assist elderly users in organising, carrying out and completing daily tasks and functions having been part of their life for years and provide essential stability and adjustment factors for continuing to be and feel independent. Thus, within AHA we will need to develop all-around, personalised, multi-faceted existing ICT solutions and services addressing diverse daily activities (shopping, eating, physical activity, commuting, mental stimulation, communication, social interaction, etc.) to elderly users taking largely intoaccount cognitive impairments and their carers living in their own home or in care centres. Current practices As aforementioned, ICT solutions are existing applications and services which will be improved and most solu tions are considered to be at tech nology readiness level 7 and above. Several solutions are already commercial or open source products and available for use and others were developed within the framework of European projects and are prototypes. It is expected that we start from a rel- ative mature level 5 (levels: 1-9) for themajority of tools and we anticipate to reach a TRL of 7 more for around 75% of tools within the next 7 years. It is clear that the needs and require- ments for the addressed user groups at an early stage of developing chronic diseases or changing states in their organism functioning are essential and are a cornerstone within an extended and flexible evaluation framework. For example in the case of cognitive impairment, the main user groups are: 1. Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) people are usually elderly who have lost cognitive functioning on at least one aspect, with no sign of dementia, and who still function in daily activities. People with MCI are estimated to account for 20% of the elderly over 65. ICT solutions as interventions might have more potential for people with mild cognitive impairment, as these are still in the early stages of forget- ting and are still active, eager, and can learn new functionalities. 2. Early stages of Dementia, people have been diagnosed with dementia but they are still maintaining some aspects of their daily functions (early signs of dementia are apparent) and users have been diagnosed by spe- cialists (i.e. neurologist, neuropsychol- ogist) and might be under medication. The improvement in daily functioning is usually rather limited compared toMain strategies in active and healthy ageing in Europe The importance of identifying the users groups and their proling 150the deteriorating effects of the disease. Since early and moderate dementia users can still carry out certain activi- ties with assistance. 3. Cognitive impairment as a co- morbid condition , users with other conditions and diseases with cognitive impairment as a co-condition is a common situation among the elderly. Increased medical co-morbidity is evi- dent in elderly. High rates of medical co-morbidity are evident in elderly living at large urban areas due to low socio-economic status (SES) and poorer access to health services. 4. Caregivers, either formal (i.e. healthcare, social, etc.), or informal (i.e. family members and friends) that need to be empowered with knowledge and tools to support the elderly intheir everyday life activities. Informal caregivers often struggle combining work and caring for their relatives, resulting in strains on their own health and coping mechanisms. In addition, there are many stake- holders with an interest in, but not a direct involvement in day-to-day care provision. Some main stakeholders, are described briefly below: Regulatory authorities on local, national or international level, regulating a wide range of aspects from device safety and essential performance, via legal, ethical and privacy related issues. This groupPROFILEincludes an Ethics Control Board with external expertise and representatives from all the pilot sites for ensuring applicable regulations are respected. User interest organisations work to serve the interest of their members. This group involves care centres and organisations for elderly people and dementia centres with experience in working with and for users with cog- nitive decline. Standardisation bodies are organ- isations that define how AAL care systems should work in a consistent manner (i.e. members of Continua Alliance). Furthermore, another important standardisation body is INFOTERM, aiming to promote and support standardisation actions in the AHA area. Public bodies, insurance compa- nies and care organisations are important as they define care stan- dards offered and the reimbursement levels provided. We need to interface these stakeholders primarily via on- site care centers, outpatient clinics, hospitals, organisations, dementiaresearch centers and their networks. It is in the domain of consumers' study that the move away from the 'medicalisation' has been more radical with the introduction of the conceptof resilience in opposition to that of frailty. The concept of resilience can be defined and measured along two dimensions: a) capacity to function interms activities of daily life or of dis- ability-free status; and b) Socio-Eco- nomic Status (SES), where we includenot only more tangible dimensions (income, education attainment) but also social support and networks. Using these two dimensions we can determine the taxonomy. We identify four archetypes (so in qualitative and ideographic fashion) that have different needs, should be the target of different interventions, and possibly of more granular monitoring indicators. For the sake of simplicity we describe the four segments considering the extreme (low/high) and neglecting the nuanced and intermediate situations. Dependent. These are individuals with low SES and with poor health severely hampering the capacity to function. They may also suffer from isolation and lack of social support, which means little or no access even to informal care. They need publicsupport for immediate care. Assisted. These are individuals with good SES yet suffering from health related limitations. Since they can afford it, they are likely to seek qualityof life improvements and can afford to buy care and other support, or can rely on social support and networks. They can potentially demand and payfor assisted living and other aides to independent life. They may be the target of some of the services that can be brought to market and can afford to pay for them. At risk. These are individuals with low SES but holding onto normal life due to their good health status enabling resilience at least in one dimension. They are at risk in the sense that lack of SES resources may bring them easily in the condition of the dependent elderly, when and if, a health problem emerges and limits their functioning capacities. They may be the target of pre-empting public policies such as for instance healthNicos Maglaveras PhD Professor of Medical Informatics Director of 151awareness and prevention services or skills building measures Active elderly. These are individuals with high resilience they are ageing well and actively and we could also call them the 'discerning old'. They are likely to seek quality of experience and demand for luxury goods and leisure such as smart homes. Based on the above baseline for user profiling, the main innovation that is needed is to estimate the real life depiction of a large-scale effort to esti- mate the potentially positive effect of ICT solution on AHA such as in cognitive decline and multi-morbid elderly for statistically adequate number of users which reflect the diversity of real users with actual cognitive impairments for a long period of time. Ensuring theinclusion of significant indicators for assuring successful assessment and investigation of the Quality of Life indicators ensures the extrapolation of findings and the viable transfer of knowledge to business modelling and health service provision with measure- able and generalisable indicators as ROI and SROI have been accepted to be. PROFILEPatients presenting to the Emer- gency Department (ED) with undifferentiated shortness of breath (SOB) can be among the most challenging in terms of the diverse underlying pathology and urgency of appropriate treatment. Until a clear diagnosis is made, several pathways may be pursued simultaneously, resulting in tests ordered with low clinical yield. A patient in extremis may be unable to provide an adequate history, and physical exam findings key to diagnosing causes of shortness of breath may be less reliable. It is unfortunate that most definitive diag- nostic tests used for the work up of shortness of breath cannot be resulted in the first critical minutes of a patient's presentation. It is our belief that the BRIPPED scan, aids Emergency physicians in rapid evaluation of potential causes of shortness of breath. The BRIPPED scan is a standardised ultrasound evaluation of the below components. These Emergency ultra- sound (EUS) applications were chosen based on literature review and per- sonal experience with ultrasound and considered to be likely to provide diagnostic clues about the cause of patients' SOB. The BRIPPED scan takes less than 6 minutes to perform. Our data suggests the BRIPPED exam is also valid if deconstructed to include some of its components. If, for example, a deep venous thrombosis (DVT) is absolutely not a considered potential diagnosis, the lower extremity scan will not influence the final differ- ential ranking and can be omittedwithout affecting the final differentialranking. By omitting this component, the BRIPPED exam would be performed in under 4 minutes. The BRIPPED scan develops a rapid, accurate, standardised approach to using emergency ultrasound in the evaluation of shortness of breath in the Emergency Department. BRIPPED influenced physician differential diag- noses to the same degree as routine laboratory, ECG, and radiographic testing in the evaluation of this patient population. Additional research is needed to evaluate the BRIPPED scan's influence on patient outcomes, complications, and associated costs. Components of the B-RIPPED Scan B-lines: Sonographic thoracic B-lines are found undifferentiated dyspnea correlate with conges- tive heart are artifact created fluid filled alveoli. BRIPPED utilises any anterior mid- clavicular fields, with one image taken on each side. Preference is given to apical views, as many patients with dyspnea were unable to comfortably lay flat. RV strain: A PE, acute right ventricle (RV) infarct, CHF, pulmonic stenosis or pulmonary hypertension can cause right ventric-ular strain. The goal of BRIPPED is not necessarily to definitively differentiate between these conditions, but to risk stratify patients for need of further testing or admission. RV strain is awell-documented risk factor for early mortality in PE. For simplicity, we have chosen to use a RV to LV size ratio of 1.0 or more as abnormal as measured from an apical 4-chambered view.PROFILE Pericardial effusionIVC-size res- piration, or dilatation greater than 2cm is used under the BRIPPED protocol. Pneumothorax: For pneumothorax, bedside ultrasound has been proven to be similar or more accurate than supine chest x-ray and with diagnostic ability approaching that of CT. Pneumothorax is documented in 2 points, one on each side, simulta- neously with B-line documentation per above. Pleural effusion: Ultrasound can detect as little as 20mL of accumulated pleural fluid. Such a minimal amount is unlikely to cause immediate danger to the patient, however, the presence of pleural effusion warrants further work up to determine its etiology. The BRIPPED protocol evaluates lateral anterior mid-axillary lines, one view each side. This visualises the bilateral costophrenic angles, areas commonly associated with fluid accumulation inan upright patient.Pericardial effusion: As it is an integral part of the Focused Abdominal Sonography for Trauma (FAST) scan, most ED physicians have adequate experience in using bedside ultrasound to determine the presence of pericardial effusion. In experienced hands, it is the gold standard to detect pericardial effusion. In this BRIPPED protocol, a parasternal long-axis view will be used to determine if pericardial effusion is present. Subcostal views are used during FAST examination, and may be utilised, however patients must be supine for optimal scanning. In the pilot study, it was found that many patients presenting with short- ness of breath were unable to lie flat comfortably, and on review of images many subcostal ultrasound viewswere suboptimal, likely due to posi- tioning and patient habitus. Ejection Fraction: Emergency physicians trained in the use of ultrasound can differentiate between normal, decreased or severely decreased left ventricular ejection fractions. The BRIPPED scanVirginia M Stewart MD RDMS RDCS RDMSK Department of Emergency Medicine Eastern Virginia +1 757 510 8197 vms0419@gmail.com www.evms.edu 153utilises a parasternal long axis view to estimate ejection fraction. DVT in lower extremities: Diagnosing DVT and PE can be very challenging in the ED as the symptoms can be nonspecific. In this BRIPPED protocol, only views and compression of the common femoral and popliteal veins are used. PROFILE Virginia M Stewart, MD RDMS RDCS RDMSK A pulmonary edemaAiredale NHS Foundation Trust details how telemedicine is helping to provide solutions for some of the most challenging healthcare problems... Digital healthcare uses information technology services, to help address some of the challenges faced by an aging population and to support people to live independently with clinical support. Airedale NHS Foundation Trust has a unique digital healthcare solution, which has been developedin a range of settings by their consultants working to meet the needs of patients. Some of the most pressing challenges facing the UK today are the increasing costs of healthcare, nite budgets and an aging popu lation. Telehealth allows healthcare professionals to provide patient care from a remote location. The term Telehealth is used as the overarching term forall 'tele' technologies. Last July, a unique telemedicine joint venture called Immedicare was formed between Airedale NHSFoun dation Trust and technology company Involve using a Telehealth Hub, based at the hospital site run by the Trust's specialist nurse and consultant teams. It is the provision of remote secure and encrypted video consultations between clinicians, patients, serv ice users and carers for diagnosis; review; assessments and interventions to minimise the severity of a patient's condition, deal with deterioration, assess future care needs or provide routine out-patient and follow up services. Airedale was the rst hospital to use the acute module of TPP's SystmOne, which allows a patient's GP and hospital care record to be shared. The joint venture Immedicare now provides a full end-to-end service - clinical expertise and the technology - to nursing and residential care homes, patient homesand prisons throughout the country. The Immedicare partnership also provides telemedi cine to 108 nursing and residential homes - and a fur ther 114 in the pipeline (July 2014) - throughout the county. Between April 2012 and March 2013 in nursing and residential care homes, telemedicine resulted in a 35% reduction in hospital admissions and visits to A&E dropped by 53%. The service is also used in patients own homes, typically people with Coronary Obstructive Pulmonary Disease, (COPD) heart failure and to provide end of life care. Airedale also provides a remote consultant-led service including full trauma, orthopaedic and dermatology clinics, to 16 prisons across the country. 154 Healthcare in the digital ageHealthcare InnovationHealthcare Innovation Case study Ninety-three-year-old Ernest Towers is a resident at Sutton Lodge - one of 200 care homes to be provided with a telemedicine service through Immedicare, aunique partnership between Airedale Hospital and technology company Involve. The residential home, based in Sutton-in-Craven, is linked to the Telehealth Hub, based at Airedale hospi tal, which is run by the Trust's specialist nurse and consultant teams. This means that Ernest and hundreds of other residents can get on call face-to-face specialised medical care around the clock, albeit remotely via secure video link - without having to leave the comfort of their home. Michael Hebden, manager of Sutton Hall, is delighted with the face-to-face, albeit remotely, specialised medical care. He said: \"It's brilliant, we really appreciate having back-up from the consultants and their medical team. We can always call if we have any doubts or queries about our residents or need a second opinion and that makes our sta feel more comfortable - especially out of normal surgery opening hours. \"Anything that reduces the time that our residents spend in A&E is good for us as it's so stressful for them to travel to hospital. \"We've used it for advice on breathing complaints, a head injury, rashes, chest infections and the patient can be seen so clearly on screen.\" Rachel Binks, nurse consultant for outreach and critical care at the trust, adds the high denition cameras and screens, linked by the NHS's secure N3 network, provide a very clear view of the patient. \"We can see whether they are having a problem, say with their breathing, and we can use other equipment like telemonitoring to assess them.\" Rebecca Malin, deputy director of business development and investment at Airedale NHS Foundation Trust,said: \"For many elderly people, unplanned admissions to emergency departments or even routine hospitalappointments can be hugely disruptive. \"Our patients, their relatives and the nursing or care home sta say they would prefer to receive more specialist care without having to leave their home - so it's been down to us to change the way we work to meet their needs.\"The message we hear back constantly is that patients and carers feel assured just by having access to telemedicine from their home and knowing that if they need to see a nurse they can at the touch of 155 Traditionally, for many decades, voice and data services have been provided by separate infrastructures both internally and externally to an organisation. Voice services were, and still are to a large extent provided by circuit switched technologies. This means that when a telephone call is made a circuit with dedicated bandwidth is opened between the source and destination of the call. This provides a very reliable connection, but it is inefficient in bandwidth usage (the circuit remains open even if there is silence on the call). Circuit switched networks are unsuitable for data communications because of the inefficiency, which is why packet switched technologies were developed starting in the 1960's to support computer to computer communications. Historically, speech communication dominated business interactions, but today businesses and customers demand a plethora of differenttypes of business to business and business to customer interactionsincluding voice, email, SMS, web technologies. Sophisticated, highspeed converged data networks have been developed to supporttheses interactions. Technology and business drivers for network convergence Technically, voice processing has become less of a challenge to support within modern data networks. The standardisation and widespread adoption of the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) has been keyto enabling voice to be successfully integrated into data networks. However, the key inhibitor for voice integration into data networks inthe early 2000's has been the lower reliability - or perceived reliabilityof data networks. Yes, it was technically feasible, but data networkswere simply not as reliable as traditional circuit switched telephony. So, it is the improvement in reliability of data networks in the last decade that has truly enabled network convergence to be a realisticgoal for enterprises. The reliability of a network can be measured by: Quality of Service - Converged networks must have predictable delay, jitter and latency. High availability - Converged networks must target availability levels equivalent to ISDN systems which are exceptionally reliable. The business driver and the real prize for implementing a converged network is the cost savings of maintaining a singlenetwork infrastructure which support all media types.Implementing converged networks In a series of articles, we will explore various aspects of implementing a fully converged network by reference to an example of an acute NHS hospital trust making the transition towards convergence: Infrastructure resilience Converged network architecture IP telephony in the cloud Ultra high WAN resilience Infrastructure resilience The trust's data infrastructure comprises a central data centre housing core network and server infrastructure with approximately 20 communications hubs around the hospital housing edge switching equipment and patch panels for connecting end user devices. Security and environment Very often, especially in older buildings, data networks were not planned into the buildings from the start. Sometimes communication hubs can be found in cupboards, riser rooms, loft spaces and other locations which are not ideal for active equipment. It is usually expensive and impractical to move a communications room, but as a minimum, air conditioning and security must be addressed to provide a truly high availability converged network. Our upgrade program specified air conditioning with temperature and humidity monitoring as well as secure swipe card access for all communications hubs. Fibre resilience Prior to the upgrade, each hub was connected back to the data centre via 1GBit fibres. The trust had suffered some data outages when fibres were broken during refurbishment work as workers accidentally cut through unmarked fibre routes. A new fibre infrastructures was specified and deployed using armoured 10Gbit fibre in a ring architecture so that each communications hub had 2 diverse routes back to the data centre (Fig x). This means that two fibre breaks are needed to isolate a communications hub and it has therefore dramatically reduced the possibility that a communications hub can become isolated by a fibre failure.Voice and data convergence, also known as Network Convergence refers to the provision of telephony, video and data communications services over a single network. www.completenetworks.co.ukNetwork ConvergencePower resilience Probably the most common cause of failure of a communications hub is loss of power. Although, in this case study, the entire hospital wasbacked up by generator, isolated fuse board failures were a significantcause of loss of service. This is an important point when comparingservice levels for separate voice and data infrastructures. Typically,traditional voice services are provided directly from the data centre ortelecommunications hub without the need for active hubs (that haverisk of power failure) for distribution. In order to achieve equivalentresilience in a converged data network it is important to ensure there is resilient power supply at each active hub. In our case study example, each hub was upgraded with power feeds from two separate distribution boards. In addition, two UPS units were installed in each hub and redundant power supplies fitted to all installed data switches. Security and environment Very often, especially in older buildings, data networks were not planned into the build from the start. Sometimes communication hubs can be found in cupboards, riser rooms, loft spaces and other locations which are not ideal for active equipment. It is expensive to move a communications room, but as a minimum, air conditioning and security must be addressed to truly provide a high availability converged network. Our upgrade program specified air conditioning and secure swipe card access for all communications hubs. Network monitoring Usually, a large organisation will have an internal IT help desk which responds to calls from users regarding service disruption. However, itis possible to monitor converged networks very closely these days. Inour case study example, we installed a network monitoring system tomonitor vital signs not only in the data centre itself, but also in theevery communication hub around the hospital trust. As a minimum,the following vital signs are monitored at each communications hub: Temperature/Humidity UPS health Dual 10Gbit fibre links back to data centre All data switches Data switch power supplies Wireless access pointsWhen redundancy is built in to a network it is, in fact, essential to monitor both the primary and backup functions. If this is not done it ispossible, for example, for a primary power supply to fail without anyimpact on service because the back power supply takes over. However,the loss of resilience must be detected by network monitoring andrestored before the backup system fails. The result of comprehensive service monitoring is that the IT department are usually aware of any service disruption before the first help deskcall is received from an end user. This leads to faster time to fix and abetter service to end users.The figure above shows a standard communications hub rack layout fed from two separate power distribution boards, with dual UPS, dataswitches, RPS units to provide backup power to the data switches, patch panels and horizontal cable management panels and vertical cable management trays. Finally, please keep it tidy! Day to day maintenance of a communications hub is kept much easier if short, colour coded patch cords are used to patch from data switches to patch panels.

In April this year, MEPs and governments from the 28 EU member countries agreed a new law to regulate tobacco sales which will also regulate e-cigarettes across the European Union for the rst time. This regulation is both flexible and robust, and will ensure that consumers can be assured of thesafety and quality of e-cigarettes which are a new product on our market and ones which are attracting large numbers of new users. Up until now, e-cigarettes have been subject to no regulation in the UK beyondbasic product safety law and when the UK MHRA (the medicines regulator) examined a number of e-cigarette products, it found a range of problems which led tothe UK government to argue for a tougher regulatory framework. Other European countries have introduced piecemeal regulation on e-cigarettes, including bans in some country, but the new EU law will mean consistent regulation across Europe. The USA is also examining similar legislation. \"The outcome of negotiations on this new law ensures that safety and quality controls for consumers are treated withhigh priority. I believe this is an outcome that the vast majority of European citizenscan support. The new law will take eectfrom 2016. \" Under the new law, E-cigarette manufacturers have the option of having their products regulated like tobacco products, meaning they can be sold freely as long as they meet certain safeguards, but like other tobacco products they will be subject to advertising restrictions and health warnings on the same basis as cigarettes. Alternatively, e-cigarette manufacturers who wish to do so can apply for a licence to have their products treated like other smoking \"quit\" productssuch as patches and chewing gum. If this option (often referred to as the \"medicines route\") is chosen, manufacturers would be able to advertise their prod ucts, have them available in pharmacies, on prescription by doctors, and sell stronger strength products. Two major e-cigarette companies in the UK have already announced they will seek a medicines license in this way. Throughout the process of deciding this new law, I and other decision-makers were aware of the potential benets of e-cigarettes for regular smokers who want to cut down or quit smoking. But we were also mindful that there are safety issues with e-cigarettes which need addressing and a need to ensure they do not become gateway products into nicotine addiction for young people. A number of governments in the EU,including the UK government, originally wanted to make all e-cigarettes subject to a medicines licence. But a majority in the European Parliament objected and we therefore steered a middle way path, avoiding over-regulation, keeping e-cigarettes on the market but within a reasonable regulatory framework which responsible manufacturers can accept. The outcome of negotiations on this new law ensures that safety and quality controls for consumers are treated with high priority. I believe this is an outcome that the vast majority of European citizens can support.

When it comes to the thorny topic of electronic cigarette regulation, policy makers would be well advised to exercise caution, lest they inadvertently create a verschlimmbesserung. It is essential to remember that electronic cigarettes are a disruptive technology, and that they are compet- ing with a dangerous established incumbent: smoked tobacco cigarettes. Over-zealous regulation of the chal- lenger product (ecigs) shows increasing signs of creating regulatory protection of the disrupted, dangerous product (tobacco cigarettes). Consumer pro- tection should be paramount, but clearly there is a balance to be struck. Before any regulatory measures are contrived, policy-makers should have been asking themselves a vitally important first question: \"What is the problem we are creating regulation to address?\" In some instances, (ecigs quite probably being a case in point), it may be the most prudent thing for regulators to simply leave well alone. In any event, mechanisms exist to weigh-up the risks and benefits of regulatory interventions, and it is agreat shame that these have not been properly employed during the process of many of the regulatory proposals and, indeed, measures which havebeen introduced into law. There are negatives as well as positives with reg- ulation, so the precautionary principle needs to be considered fully - from both sides of the equation, i.e. if we do something, what will the impact be, and if we do nothing, what will the impact be? Unless policy-makers have clear evidence to support both of these, they will be more likely to make mistakes. Even seemingly erring on the side of caution may not actually allow enough caution to be applied (ironically). Proponents of medicines regulation for electronic cigarettes ('ecigs') have suggested that ecigs need to be offered on prescription to help the poorest and most vulnerable in society. Indeed, the Stop Smoking Services(SSS) in the UK were deliberately designed to target those people affected by the inverse care law, i.e. the poorer you are, the worse the health care you can expect to receive. Unfortunately, however, this argument falls down in 2 key areas: firstly, SSS are only accessed by a paltry 1-2% of smokers, and secondly because ifthe poorest in society can afford to smoke, they can afford to buy their own ecigs - as firmly demonstrated by the lack of social demographic difference in ecig users: \"None of the demographic variables entered demonstrated strong associ- ation with current e-cigarette use,though due to the imprecision of If it ain't broke... ...be cautious not to x it until it breaks estimates we cannot exclude the possibility of moderate associations that this analysis failed to detect.\"1 Clearly, it is not only the more affluent who are switching in their millions to ecigs; the poorer in society are choosing this route, too. As Dr Hayden McRobbie, an international expert on nicotine and tobacco, said recently: \"We don't need medicines regs to be able to advertise, and get to peoplewho smoke. [...] This has been an interesting field in which people are using these without us [tobacco control] even interfering, and so why not just let it be, and let that spread through the community? People talk to each other.\" 2 And what has this mass migration away from smoking and onto vaping led to? Approximately a 33% increasein successful quit attempts within the past year, with a drop in smoking prevalence to 18.7%, according to data from Professor Robert West's Smoking Toolkit Study. This is an unprecedented improve- ment in population level public health outcomes, and one which is not to be sniffed at. Tobacco Control measures over the past 5 decades have not achieved such dramatic improve- ments in such a short space of time, and have actually plateaued in recent years. That stubborn core of hard-to- persuade smokers was resolutelystuck at around 20% of the popula- tion, but this is now coming down. If policy-makers and regulators apply the precautionary principle only to the side of the equation relating to pro- tecting consumers from potentially dangerous products, and ignore the growing body of evidence which sup- ports that electronic cigarettes are a) not killing people; b) being used by millions of smokers and former smok- ers around the world; and c) dramati- cally improving smoking prevalence rates and successful quit rates, then surely they are missing out the very significant precautionary approachwhich ought to be applied to any regulatory intervention which might change any of these factors. Setting the regulatory barrier too high will create a dangerous black market. This is simply a fact - and well- supported by regulatory enforcement officers who have to deal with the fall-out from such problems. Black market products will not necessarily have the appropriate safety and quality standards in place, so we could see consumers beginning to be killed by substandard products.Many consumers are law-abiding citizens who would not buy from a black market, so the only alternative for these people might be to return to smoking. Indeed, we have seen a tragic example of this in Spain recently, where one ill-informed doctor spread some egregious lies about electronic cigarettes through the media, including suggesting that ecigs are as dangerous as continuing to smoke, and an alarming number of former smokers gave up their ecigs and went back to smoking tobacco cigarettes! If regulation protects the dangerous product (tobacco cigarettes) from the disruptive new technology (ecigs), then smoking prevalence rates will go back up, successful quit attempts will fall, and we will be back to square one, with about 20% of the population continuing to smoke, with no hope of a 'get-out-of-disease-free' card. What is broken here? What are we seeing that requires a draconian regulatory response? What will happen if regulators are over-zealous in trying to fix mythical problems at the expense of the documented population level public health gains we are currentlyKatherine Devlin President ECITA (The Electronic R., Bauld, L., and McNeill, A., (2013), E-Cigarettes: Prevalence and Attitudes in Great Britain, Oxford Journals, Nicotine & Tobacco 161Regulating Web editor at Adjacent Government, Amy Caddick gives an overview of how the European Medicines Agency (EMA) supports the development of new innovative medicines and therapies for healthcare... The pharmaceutical industry has a pivotal role to play in the treatment of disease. Over the years, many breakthroughs in the eld have enabled complex conditions to become eradicatedcompletely, whilst helping other life threatening diseases to become manageable. The regulatory body for pharmaceuticals in the European Union is the European Medicines Agency(EMA). It has a signicant part to play in advancing innovation in the eld. One of its main long-term strategic goals is to 'foster research and the uptake of innovative methods in the development of medicines'. 1 EMA is dedicated to creating safe and eective med icines for all patients. It also seeks to ensure high quality medication reaches the market in a timely fashion. One of the ways in which the EMA supports the devel- opment of new therapies is through collaboration.Working closely with experts in their respective elds is vital to ensure progress, and prevent duplicationof research. In 2004, the EMA and the Committee for Medicinal Product for Human Use (CHMP) set up a think-tank group dedicated to innovative drug development. The group consisted of members of the CHMP , and focused on identifying high quality emerging science in the pharmaceutical industry. The group oered a place to enable stakeholders topresent and discuss their views on evolving strategies in drug development. It also worked to identify bottlenecks in the process - both at the research and development (R&D) end of process, as well as the academic side. It also brought together large multinational companies, and smaller enterprises. It enabled the EMEA to examine areas that required improvement within theindustry, and to strengthen relationships between the key players in the European pharmaceutical sector. Furthermore, in 2010 the EMA published its 'Road Map to 2015', which set out the strategic vision for the agency, building upon the existing strategy. In the area of emerging science, the road map acknowledged the role of new elds such as personalised medicine, nanotechnology, novel drug development, regenerative medicine, and synthetic biology. The document stated that emerging science was \"becoming increasingly established as part of the new wave of medicines development,\" and that there had to be \"new ways toaddress current unmet medical needs\". The Road Map also noted that part of the process of dealing with innovative and emerging medicine wasthe careful consideration of the legal and regulatory frameworks, as well as the benets and risks of devel oping these drugs. The Road Map said there is \"a need for debate on how best to support and translate the new science into regulatory requirements. Further thought willalso have to be given to aspects such as ethical and environmental considerations. Such important scientic progress will require regulators to be attuned to the new technologies in both human and veterinary elds, and to learn from research and experience in other industry sectors.\" 2 Supporting small and medium enterprises ( SMEs) in their endeavour to develop new innovative medicines has also been part of the EMA's strategy. Undoubtedly,smaller enterprises have a signicant role to play in the development of innovative medicine. Research published in Nature3('Regulatory watch: Where do new medicines originate from in the EU?') into the origins of new medicine, found that SMEs often created more new substances than academia, although the latter still plays an important role in the industry. In fact, the results showed that between 2010 and 2012, a total of 27% of medicines containing a new active substance, recommended for marketing authorisation, came from SMEs. However, SMEs only accounted for 13% of the marketing-authorisationholders. Comparatively, only 17% of these medicines originated from academic institutions, public bodies, and public- private partnerships. These three organisations are no longer involved in marketing-authorisation applications. Furthermore, 61% of medicines with an orphandesig nation originated from SMEs, with marketing- authorisation holders standing at 22%. Only 11% ofthese drugs originated from academic institutions,public bodies, and public-private partnerships. The authors of the research said: \"Understanding the factors that could aect drug innovation, such as the nature of the organisations involved, could help indeveloping strategies to catalyse further advances.\" \"This analysis shows that SMEs, academic institutions, public bodies and public-private partnerships represent an important source of innovation and bolster the product pipelines of larger companies.\"4 Recognising the role of SMEs in the innovation process, the EMA developed a programme to support these organisations throughout all stages of pharma- ceutical development. Speaking earlier in the year, Head of the EMA's SME oce Melanie Carr said: \"This analysis underlines theimportance of the support that the EMA oers early in development, which should facilitate and promote the emergence of innovative medicines.\" 5 Another way in which the EMA has worked to further progress the development of innovation in Europeanpharmaceuticals is via the Innovation Task Force (ITF).This was put in place to improve coordination across the agency, and to assist SMEs by identifying scientic, legal, and regulatory issues relating to emerging therapies through early dialogue. The ITF also provides recommendations regarding the eligibility of innovative or borderline human medi cines for the agency's pre-authorisation scientic services. This is done free of charge, and recommen- dations are provided within 60 days of receiving a request from an applicant. Improving current medication for life threatening diseases, and creating new products is imperative in the continued ght against disease. It is clear that smaller pharmaceutical companies have a signicantrole to play in advancing drug therapies, but it is also obvious that these organisations require much more support from agencies like EMA. Undoubtedly, EMA have their own part to play in facilitating the advancement of emerging drugs, help ing with the development of the industry, and ensuring regulations are in place. Furthermore organisations like the EMA have the ability to bring together experts, and improve the route from thelaboratory to the market place. 1 http://www.ema.europa.eu/ema/index.jsp?curl=pages/special_topics/ editorial@adjacentgovernment.co.uk www.adjacentgovernment.co.ukHealthcare Innovation 162163PROFILE Millions of people have bathed in the mineral rich geothermal waters of Iceland for the beneficial effects of the water's silica on the health and beauty of skin. Now an Icelandic start-up company aims to bottle it for con- sumptionas a supplement for an even wider range of benefits. GeoSilica Iceland is an Icelandic start-up company specialising in the production of novel silica healthcare products produced directly from the silica rich geother- mal waste water of geothermal power plants in Iceland. The supplement, in the form of very pure colloidal silica of natural geother- mal origin, is produced by concentrat- ing the silica in the geothermal water of the Hellisheidi geothermal power plant, and then purifying it by removing everything but the silica from the water using sophisticated techniques. The colloidal silica in the supplementis a source of the element silicon, which is often called the \"forgotten nutrient\" on the basis of how little people are aware of how essential it is for the body. The importance of silicon for our health In 1970, a research done by Edith M. Carlisle, PhD, showed that silicon is an essential mineral for bone formation and bone mineralisation, independent of vitamin D. Her research was con- firmed by several other scientists shortly after. Since 2002, there hasbeen steadily increasing research regarding the role of silicon in a variety of tissue including bone. It is now a known fact that silicon plays a vital role in the formation of collagen, the major constituent of connective tissue, and furthermore, that silicon acts as a cross-linking agent, forming chemical bonds between collagen and the major macro molecules of connective tissue, thus making con- nective tissue stronger and healthier. Bones, cartilage, ligaments, tendons, skin, and blood vessels are examplesof tissues consisting largely of, and supported by connective tissue. It is thus not surprising that silicon is essential for strong bones, strong and elastic blood vessels, and healthy and beautiful skin. Silicon supplementation has also been shown to make hair stronger, nails less brittle, and even to lower the frequency of sport injuries. Much of the recent research on silicon is focused on silicon supplementation as a means of treating or preventing osteoporosis, particularly in women. 1 in 3 women over the age of 50 are estimated to have osteoporosis. Do we get enough silicon from our diet? For the majority of people in the west- ern world the short answer is \"No\". Epidemiological studies report that dietary silicon intake of more than 40 mg/day correlates with increasedBurkni Palsson CTO dietary supplement Made from 100% natural Icelandic geothermal silica bone mineral density, but the average dietary intake of silicon is 20-30 mg/day for the typical western world diet. Silicon uptake from diet decreases as we get older, and because of this post-menopausal women average approximately 18 mg per day. The company is currently looking for funds in order to scale up the production and bring the supplement to European and other international markets. GeoSilicastrives to be a socially responsible company and intends to improve the society by conducing towards healthier environment, creates new jobs, maximising the utilisation of the geothermal resource in Iceland and contribute to EU sus- tainable objectives. Working 'smart' in wound care Salla Sepp\u00e4nen, President of the European Wound Management Association discusses the challenges faced in wound care... Wounds are a major problem to patients and health care systems. A single chronic wound can cost between \u20ac6,650 and \u20ac10,000 to treat, and it is estimated that around 1-1.5% of the EU-population has one or more of such wounds. Of the total healthcare expenditure in the EU, wound management alone is estimated to make up 2-4%1. Ultimately, it is the patients who suer when theyhave a wound; therefore, ensuring that they receiveproper care is important. A major challenge in wound care, however, is the lack of united services aimed at addressing all the health care needs of individualswith wounds 2. Demand for healthcare is growing at a rate correspon- ding to an increasingly elderly population and an increase in the number of individuals with chronic disease, which is likely to grow further in future; it is obvious that the systems are under pressure. A lookat the growth in healthcare costs over the pastdecades bear witness to this 3, 4. In other words, in order to prevent a future breakdown of the healthcare sector, especially in light of the recent recession, it ispivotal to nd ways to cut costs. These health economic considerations are already causing a drive towards an earlier discharge of hospi talised patients. As a consequence, more patients suering from complex pathological conditions, including those with wounds, are being treated at home5, 6. In essence, what we are observing is a shift in the location of service delivery, e.g. wound care, from secondary care to primary and community care. This development makes it even more important that social and health care professionals communicate eectively with each other and that well-dened carepathways integrating specialised and primary careservices according to the patients' condition and needs exist. Wound care in the community requires educated professionals and multi-professional co-operation to ensure that individuals with wounds receive proper care. Evidence-based practice and education With resources being limited and the demand on service delivery increasing, the success of the health service is dependent on choosing the most appropriate treatment available. The prevention of avoidable health-related complications, such as pressure ulcers, is more important than ever, and one of the means to increase the value for money is to implement evidence-based practice and guidelines in everyday care delivery by health professionals7. However, to be able to meet clinical demands from evidence-based guidelines, health professionals who take care of individuals with wounds need to have access to education and training. This is the only way they can develop and maintain the required competences in wound prevention and management and make well- informed decisions about wound care. The team approach In 2 newly released publications by the EuropeanWound Management Association 8, 9, it is argued that a multidisciplinary team approach to wound care is fundamental to maximising health and social gains. No profession has all the skills required to address the complex needs of individuals with wounds, and therefore health professionals, social caregivers, and family members should be included in the care team with the patient at the centre of all decision-making. In fact, well-orchestrated interdisciplinary careincreases the chances that patients do not experience unnecessary and often harmful complications andHealthcare Innovation 164Healthcare Innovation inconveniences like amputation, pain, and malodour; circumstances that can lead to social isolation and inthe worst cases, death 10. Collaborating across profes- sional borders with the patient and family membersin focus also requires that wound specialists develop the right skills for teamwork and communication.Part of the challenge is to inform and educate the patient and caregivers about the condition, and provide information such as how to use a specic dressing and how frequently it should be changed. It is also crucial that everyone in the team is aware of when to consult a specialist if, for example, the wound is deteriorating. Other challenges are patient compliance and making information about the patient and the treatment available to everyone in the team. Communication and new technologies A new and promising development is the use of telemedicine that enables the exchange of information about the patient condition and treatment choices between patients and professionals, and between different groups of professionals and care providers. By providing distance expert evaluation and guidancefrom wound specialists to home care nurses andthereby possibly reducing risks of insucient/wrong treatment and care, patient visits to outpatient clinics and hospitalisations, the implementation of these technologies in wound care may provide opportunities to improve patient care and save health care costs.However, recurring issues with data security and exchange of personal information pose a challenge. Telemedicine and other eHealth solutions for woundcare are still not generally implemented throughout Europe and the benets are still being evaluated;cur rently, 2 large-scale, EU-supported projects: Renewing Health and the United4health project (www.united4health.eu) in which EWMA participates as a partner organisation, are examining the potential eects for dierent disease areas. Conclusion The number of people with wounds and the demand for health services will continue to increase due to changing demographics and an expected rise in the number of people with chronic diseases. As a consequence, healthcare systems are facing a major challenge. Investments in education and the develop- ment of strategies for implementation of communicationpathways and evidence-based guidelines are necessary to enable prevention of wounds as well as in making well-informed decisions in wound management. The team approach is focused on enhancing outcomes for individuals with wounds and a high degree of self- management. New technologies are helpful tools in realising eective wound care across professional borders, but we are still faced with the challenge of making relevant data available to everyone involved in the care team.

What is the most eective way to reduce incidence of amputation in the diabetic foot? Diabetes Metab Res www.ewma.org 165We all know that populations are ageing, obesity and diabetes are increasing to epidemic proportions and healthcare demands are escalating. Against this backdrop, it is clear that effective wound care improves lives, reduces suffering, speeds recovery and saves money. A major area of expenditure for health care providers in both the acute and primary care sectors is wound care. Posnett and Franks (2008) calculated that two hundred thousand people in the United Kingdom had a chronic wound with an estimated cost of treatment being \u00a32.3-3.1bn per year.1Additionally the National Prescribing Centre (2010) approximated that wound dressings accounted for around \u00a3120m of prescribing costs in primary care in England alone each year.2 As life expectancy continues to rise and surgical operations are performed on an ever ageing population the prevalence of co-morbidities and chronic disease increases and we conclude that the cost of wound care will also continue to rise . In fact in the United Kingdom, the fastest growing age group in the population are those aged 80 years. Therefore appropriate choice of cost effective wound dressings with reliable evidence to support choice is vital. Added to this is the importance of maintaining and promoting a good quality of life for the patient, including pain management; prevention of dressing related trauma; prevention of post-operative wound blistering; management and prevention of infection and the effective management of wound exudate. M\u00f6lnlycke Health Care is a global provider of healthcare solutions. It consists of a wound care and a surgical division, two separate yet complementary areas of the company working together to benefit patients and healthcare professionals alike. M\u00f6lnlycke Health Care has a history of developing innovative wound care dressings for nearly 70 years. Over that period our aim has been to improve the quality of lifefor millions of people. Our wound care products are based on the concept of gentle and effective care to deliver novel, patient- centered, trauma and pain-free solutions that prevent, protect and provide an optimum environment for awound to be healed. Our wound care product portfolio includes; advanced wound care dressings, such as foam and anti-microbial dressings with Safetac \u00aetechnology, surgical dressings, dermatology products and a negative pressure wound therapy offer. Partnership is a term that can be thrown around quite loosely, so what does being a wound care partner truly mean? For M\u00f6lnlycke Health Care it means taking the time to understand each customer individually and help them meet the challenges that they are facing so that the quality of care that a patient receives remains best in class. We don't believe that one size fits all, we believe that all of our customers should be treated uniquely so that that they can receive the right level and type of support needed. By understanding the rapidly changing market and our customers challenges we aim to help them meet their objectives with the best in value and quality products, initiatives and programmes. We listen to those who can contribute to our insight and knowledge. We also use our experience to analyse complex problems and understand a condition, a diagnosis or type of wound. With the prevailing pressure ulcer crisis we recently decided to help address the problem by specialising in developing a solution to help reduce the risk of pressure ulcers occurring when they were avoidable. M\u00f6lnlycke Health Care offers support to the health care sector in a variety of different ways; to name a few we aim to provide our customers with clinical education and resources, most of our solutions come complete with a wide range of evidence, both clinical and value justification and we aim to support in controlling costs and meeting their financial objectives.WHAT BEING A WOUND CARE PARTNER TRULY MEANS Clinicians who treat patients with wounds need access to the resources that will enable them to deliver the best and most appropriate treatments. Education is an increasingly important issue and we try to fulfil the demand for training and provide clear, comprehensive outcomes to educational objectives with a wide range of courses, seminars and online learning. We run a Wound Care Academy whereby we produce educational materials and best practice documents through the working of Special Advisory Groups. A significant number of our field staff are clinically trained with registered nurse status. We share our clinical expertise by giving advice and our best practice to our customers. Continuously creating and delivering clinical education and evidence is one of the most important ways of securing that the products we offer are both safe and efficient. With economic constraints on health care budgets, meeting financial objectives has become increasingly tough. We aim to provide our customers with the most cost effective wound management and when considering the cost of wound care it is important to consider all aspects of the patient pathway and not simply the cost of dressing products. It is important to realise that 'least costly dressings' are not necessarily those with the 'lowest price'3. Dressings only account for 15-20% of the total costs of woundcare management4. NICE and the National Prescribing Centre support the use of 'least costly dressings'; they recognise that the costs of dressings are dwarfed by the wider costs of caring for people with wounds . Assessing the costs incurred across the whole pathway is the only way to deliver best value for money. The English QIPP wound care comparator (net ingredient cost per item) focuses on 'least costly dressings' not solely 'price' - recognising that more frequent dressing changes and wastage have a larger impact on costs. Our range of dressings with Safetac \u00ae Technology aim to reduce pain at dressing change reducing the need for analgesia and deliver a longer wear time compared to traditional dressings; reducing staff time and costs. This may help the NHS to deliver both improvements in quality and productivity through a range of innovative products. Innovation is part of our DNA and we will continue to invest in the future of wound care to keep delivering new cost effective solutions. To ensure that expected efficiencies are being actualised, M\u00f6lnlycke Health Care use an analyticalcomputer programme for comparing existing product usage against alternative products from the M\u00f6lnlycke Health Care range and highlighting potential savings. The reports produced clearly show; pricing, the exact products that have been compared and use a traffic light system to flag any direct alternatives, those with minor differences or those that are not direct replacements. Our next article in November will provide a more detailed and specific feature on Patient Care, for now we will leave you with a video of Helen Taylor, triathlon enthusiast and business woman, who shares her experience of living with a cavity wound following cancer surgery and the positive difference NPWT with Avance\u00ae Solo made to her day-to-day life and wound management.

Each year millions of people world-wide experience wounds that arise through multiple causes including surgery, burns, accidents, poor blood supply to the legs (venous leg ulcers), a consequence of diabetes (diabetic foot ulcers) and through illness, and poor mobility (pressure ulcers also known as bed sores). Regardless of the cause, wounds that fail to heal are a signicant problem to patients and health services. Pressure ulcers may cost the NHS almost 4% of its annual budget to both prevent and treat, but for individuals living with a wound this often entails pain, social isola tion (often as a consequence of malodour or where fluids leak from the wound), and a signicantly reduced quality of life. Given the heavy costs both financially for healthservices and for the lives of patients, there has been great interest over recent years in new approaches both to prevent wound development and to speedwound healing. Over the past 5 decades technology has been innovated through synthetic materials, cellular based therapies and molecular diagnostics.However innovation in wound healing is not limited to new product development. Innovative working among clinicians and researchers has increased given recent developments, both in communication technology and social media. For example, clinical guidelines for the prevention and treatment of pressure ulcers will be released in the late summer of 2014, which have been developed jointly by 3 organisations working in the United States, Europe and in the Pan-Pacic region. Thesenew guidelines will help to standardise the care patients receive to help reduce the occurrence of pressure ulcers across a large part of the world, a development that would have been possible without the availability of easy methods to communicateface-to-face frequently across multiple time-zones.Innovation in wound care can go far beyond thetradi tional models of care delivery in hospitals or GP surgeries. The Lindsay Leg Club Foundation support a growing number of Leg Clubs across the UK, Europe and Australia. A Leg Club is a unique partnership between local nursing services and their communities, and operate in non-healthcare settings, including community and church halls with a body of community volunteers running them and nurses attending todeliver lower leg treatment mainly for venous leg ulcers.

Stem cell science has come of age over the past 20 years - thanks, in no small part, to research funded by UK taxpayers. The rst dedicated UK institute for stem cell research(ISCR) was established by the University of Edinburgh in 2000. But its origins go back a further 10 years, having started life as the Centre for Genome Research (founded by the Agriculture and Food Research Council - a forerunner of BBSRC) with a broad remit to develop and exploit techniques in transgenic biology, such as germline and stem cell manipulation, and genetic manipulation by mutagenesis, of relevance to agriculture, medicine and mammalian biology. The ISCR achieved early success in the identicationof proteins that controlled the ability of embryonic stem cells to replicate limitlessly, as well as identifying a signalling pathway that promoted stem cell multipli-cation. The ndings were useful in understanding how the fate of stem cells could be influenced. Over the same period, and, by coincidence, in the same city, scientists at the BBSRC-supported Roslin Institute were studying nuclear transfer in sheep. The subsequent birth of Dolly provided the rst demonstration that all the programming needed to transform a fertilised egg into a living, breathing animal was contained within a somatic cell - any cell in the body other than sex cells or stem cells. But, despite such rapid advances in cell technologies, there were major technical hurdles that needed to be overcome in order to realise the full potential of stem cells and to facilitate their safe application in healthcare. Building capacity In 2002, the UK government announced the provisionof \u00a340m to 5 Research Councils to support research on stem cells, including funding to establish the UK Stem Cell Bank. The Bank was established to ensure that research using human embryonic stem cells wasethically robust as well as to provide a repository of each and every human embryonic, foetal and adult stem cell line derived in the UK. Today, it provides quality controlled stocks of these cells, which researchers worldwide can rely upon to facilitate high quality and standardised research. It also prepares stocks of EUTCD-Grade cell lines for use as starting materials for the development of cellular therapies. Then, in 2005, Sir John Pattison led a high-level review to formulate a 10-year vision for UK stem cell research. His rst recommendation was to establish a public-private partnership to explore the potential of using stem cell-derived cell cultures in the early, high- throughput toxicology screening of potential new medicines. The consortium, Stem Cells for Safer Medicines, represented the rst signicant investment by 'big pharma' in UK stem cell research. AstraZeneca, GlaxoSmithKline and Homan-La Roche were founding members along with the Department of Health, the Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills (now Business, Innovation and Skills), the Scottish government, BBSRC and the Medical Research Council (MRC). Maintaining public consensus In 2007, BBSRC and the MRC co-ordinated the UK's biggest ever public consultation on stem cell research, funded by the UK government's Sciencewise scheme. The project captured the opinion, aspirations and ambitions of 200 members of the public on the scienceand ethics of stem cell research, as well as canvassing the views of nearly 50 stakeholders from elds such as science, medicine, industry, ethics and religion. The dialogue revealed that both professionals and the public valued investment in basic research that could,for instance, address obstacles to the development of treatments. But their support for translating research into treatments was conditional on ensuring that public funding was focused on 'serious' medical conditions rather than cosmetic uses. Future platforms A \u00a325m UK Regenerative Medicine Platform (UKRMP), funded by BBSRC, EPSRC and MRC, was launched in 2012 to address the scientic and technical challenges required to support the development of regenerative medicine therapies for a range of applications. This included \u00a34.5m to establish a new 'hub' for pluripotent stem cell research. Induced pluripotent stem cell (IPSC) technology is away of restoring the flexibility of embryonic cells (which can turn into any type of cell) to adult stem cells. It is a particularly exciting area that provides the opportunity not only to develop therapies matchedto a patient's own cells but also to establish more accurate cellular models of diverse human diseases based upon the genotype of aected individuals. The renement of methodologies to achieve cell reprogramming in the production of IPSCs, for example through a better understanding of epigenetic memory - an area where UK researchers are world-leading, could open up further applications and therapeutic options. Continued investment in the eld of stem cell research and its applications is vital to ensuring that the potential of this exciting eld is realised for the UK - beneting the health of the public and Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC) Tel: +44 Research 170171PROFILE Life expectancy in the western world has been on the rise, leading to an upshift in median age that will continue in the next decades1. As a consequence of popu- lation ageing, the incidence of ageing- related ailments has escalated; notonly degenerative diseases such as Parkinson or Alzheimer, but also the number of people affected by cancershas risen drastically. Notwithstanding its impact on society, the underlying mechanisms are still not completely understood, translating into relativelycoarse and unspecific cancer treat- ments. Only in the last few years has the treatment of some forms of cancer evolved into a more guided approach, and years of investigation will still be needed to design intelligent treatments for a wide variety of cancers. Stem cell biology of cancer Stem cells have a central role in most if not all ageing-related ailments. In most of the diseases studied, the depletion of stem cells and reduction of their proliferative capacity seems to be the main cause of tissue degener- ation. In cancer, however, excess growth is the central underlying mechanism. The role of stem cells in tissue home- ostasis depends on the equilibrium between differentiation and self- renewal. Whereas stem cell differen- tiation into more specialised cell types is the mechanism that produces the somatic tissues, self-renewal assures the maintenance of an undifferenti- ated cell population that maintains aproliferative capacity. In cancer, the equilibrium between differentiationand self-renewal is disturbed, provok- ing the accumulation of a population of poorly differentiated but highly proliferative cells. The identification of a stem cell popu- lation at the heart of tumor growth 2 comprises yet another link between ageing and cancer; the role of stemcells in cancer is just as important as in degenerative diseases. Whereas stem cell depletion and their uncon- trolled growth appear unrelated phenomena, they are in fact closely related; whereas a proportion of stem cellsare lost during ageing, theStem Cells and immunity Stem cells, Chromosomal instability and Cancer surviving stem cells have an increased chance of chromosome alterations. Chromosomal Instability (CIN) A key difference between healthy, normal stem cells and tumor cells is the acquisition of genomic alterations by the latter. Most carcinomas present some form of genetic instability, either as an accumulation of intragenic mutations or as a large-scale alter- ations -translocations, deletions and numerical changes -termed chromo- somal instability (CIN). Although the hypothesis that CIN itself can cause cancer has taken a long time before being accepted, CIN is frequently detected in tumors before intragenic mutations and thus comprises a driving force in carcinogenesis3. Curren t theories suggest that CIN can induce cellular transformation through gene dosage or gene translocation; the genome fragments gained or lost in CIN frequently contain hundreds of genes, each of which can affect a pathway regulation step. The extra copies of many genes in CIN cause a gross imbalance in cellular regulation, which easily spills over into other pathways including cell cycle control4. Pathway interconnectedness thus appears to be the Achilles\u00b4 heel of genomic stability in mammals. Stem cells, CIN, and cancer therapy Because of their unique role in tissue renewal, stem cells have a combina- tion of characteristics that renders them susceptible to genetic damage, transformation, and tumor initiation. Stem cells not only undergo rapid growth and division, but also seem to be tolerant for gene dosage effects that would induce apoptosis in other cell types. Notwithstanding their resistance, cancer stem cell theory clearly indicates that this population must be targeted to treat carcinomas efficiently. Traditional anticancer therapy depends on tumor cell eradication by cytotoxic drugs, through the induction of addi- tional chromosome defects that lead to apoptosis or necrosis. Although the efficacy of the classical cancer treatments has advanced tremen- dously, they still suffer from side effects, such as the shutdown of stemcells in skin, intestine, and immune system. Thus, a drawback of many chemotherapeutics is the low capacity to distinguish between cancer cells and rapidly dividing non-cancer cells. In addition, most of the chemothera- peutic compounds favor selection of resistant and aggressive cancer cells. The last decade has seen the develop- ment of new therapies, aimed at a more specific elimination of cancer cells while reducing toxic effects. One phenomenon in particular, oncogene addiction, might yield novel targets foranticancer therapies 5. In oncogene addiction, the cancer's need for survival leads to activation of the corresponding signal pathways, to an extent where cells become completely dependent. Oncogene addiction has been characterised in only a few types of cancer so far, but preliminary results are promising. Oncogene addiction seems to increase withtumor progression, so targeting sur- vival pathways might be the way to treat advanced cancer, where classical therapies loose efficiency. For example, the high level expression of HER that characterises the most aggressive forms of breast cancer is exploited for treatment with the neutralising antibody Herceptin\u00ae, improving the prognosis of HER-positive tumors. Novel targets in signaling pathways must be seen as an addition to classical therapies for now, but further charac- terisation of pathways might help to treat a wide range of cancers. Especially the targets that overlap with stemness and differentiation are interesting, for the possibility to attack cancer stem cells. Karel van Wely Antonio Bernad Carlos Martinez-A Department of Immunology and Oncology National Center of Biotechnology - CSIC Campus de Cantoblanco Madrid www.cnb.csic.esConcluding remarks The fundamental way in which cancer is treated is just recently being mod- ernised. New therapies will hopefully be able to discriminate better between cancer cells and healthy stem cells, and be tolerated better by the patient than current treatment schedules. The combination of data from stem cell biology, tumor evolution, and genetic analysis of patient material has greatly improved our understanding of cancer biology. Still, continued efforts are needed to use this knowledge for the benefit of cancer patients. References 1http://www.ageing.ox.ac.uk/ 2Gupta et al. (2009) Nat. Med. 15:1010-1012 3Pihan et al.

We have a long-standing expertise in studying the biology of pluripotent stem cells in mice and non-human primates (NHP), with a strong emphasis on the regula- tion of the cell division cycle. More recently, we began studying the biol- ogy of pluripotent stem cells in rabbitsand Humans. We have derived the first embryonic stem (ES) cells and the first induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells in rabbits and rhesus monkeys in Europe. We are most interested inhow these cells can be used to study gene function and generate animal models of human genetic diseases. Our work with ES and iPS cells aims togenerate new cell lines with a better controlled proliferation and increased genetic stability. These cell lines can then be used to interrogate the safety and efficacy of cell therapies in animal models of neurodegenerative diseases. We achieve our goals thanks to the expertise of the Stem Cell and Brain Research Institute (SBRI, Inserm U846) co-directed by Drs Colette Dehay and Henry Kennedy, in areas as diverse astranscriptome analysis at multi and single cell levels, stem cell engineering, CRISPR technology, targeted genome modification, iPS cell technology, nano - biotechnologies, controlled reproduction in NHP, NHP adult electro- emission tomography.

Rhesus monkey pluripotent stem an important biolog- ical characteristic: it causes cells to divide, or 'proliferate' in an uncontrolled fashion. Most current cancer therapies use drugs that interfere with one or more of the mechanisms of cell proliferation.These treatments are based on the assumption that healthy cells proliferate at a much lower rate than tumour cells. But healthy cells do still proliferate, so current therapies are highly toxic and cause many side effects, especially in tissues or organs where cells are regularly replaced, such as the hair, blood, or lining of the intestine. Most importantly, although these drugs initially manage to reduce the size oftumours, many cancers still remain incurable and relapse occurs in a large number of cases. Are stem cells the cause of cancer relapse? The cancer stem cell (CSC) theory explains relapses by suggesting that tumours are maintained by a special sub-population of cancer cells. Accord- ingto the theory, these cells are the only ones within the tumour that can self-renew (copy themselves) and maintain the tumour. Because of their particular stem cell characteristics, these cells would be largely unaf- fected by standard therapies. Instead, they would survive and continue to divide, which would lead to the reap- pearance of the tumour with time. This could be compared with the effects of chemotherapy on other tis-sues, like the hair: the differentiated cells that form most of the hair are killed during treatment, but the stem cells responsible for hair growth survive. When the therapy is over, hair re-grows normally. The CSC theory therefore argues that tumours are stem-cell based tissues, very similar in their architecture to other tissues in the body, but with a disease-causing fault. This point ofview implies that studying the rapidly dividing differentiated cells which generally make up the bulk of a tumour might not tell us much about the cause of the cancer. Instead, we need to study the less rapidly dividing cancer stem cells, which maintain the tumour. A theory with a history Although it was proposed almost 50 years ago, the CSC theory has only begun to gain acceptance in recent years. The existence of CSCs has been demonstrated in many types of human cancers. Still, there are many opponents to the theory, particularlyamong clinicians. They argue that the theory mainly represents a laboratory artefact due to our technological inability to transplant tumours into experimental animals so that 100% of the cells are always transplanted. Inthis regard, I would argue that the fun-damental concept essential to the CSC hypothesis does not have anything to do with the exact number of cells within the tumour. Instead, the CSCA focus on Stem Cells and Cancer Contemporary cancer research 174idea is that a tumour is made up of a mixture of cells with different func- tions, with only a certain set of cells in the tumour able to initiate and main- tain malignant growth in the body. Nevertheless, there are many types of cancer and some do not seem to follow the CSC model. Significant implications for future therapies and research The existence of CSCs has a tremen- dously important therapeutic implica- tion: only by completely eliminating the cancer stem cells can we avoidPROFILE Dr Isidro S\u00e1nchez-Garc\u00eda is a scientist working in the Institute of Molecularand Cell Biology of Cancer at theCSIC/University of Salamanca, Spain, to debilitate cancer. While his research has focused on different haematolog- ical cancers, his work into targeting malignant stem cell populations to eradicate cancerous tumours may have a major impact on the concepts, therapies and methods for assessing treatment efficacy of cancer biology and development across the board. growth of cancer depends on CSCs with such oncogenes turned on, it will be important to know how to turn off the reprogramming process (see Figure 1). In my personal opinion this is an important area on which to focus research efforts. The formation of tumour cells as a result of genetic reprogramming represents a new explanation of how cancer cells are formed and maintained. The practical implications that this new point of view has for cancer therapy are obvi- ously enormous. What is clear is that CSC-based therapies must not replace, but rather complement the current approaches. Elimination of the bulk of the tumour is required in the initial stages of any treatment, whether or not we are also able to target cancer stem cells. The coming years will show whether optimism about new treat- ments based on the CSC theory is wellfounded, or whether the immense complexity of this disease will con- tinue to confound our best endeav- ours to treat it. relapse and achieve a definitive cure. In order to do this we must be able to target CSCs specifically, discriminating them from the normal stem cells that maintain normal tissues. Therapies that also kill normal stem cells would be lethal to the patient. This remains the biggest challenge for the coming years. \"CSC-based therapies must not replace, but rather complement, current approaches.\" Looking to the future, there is new evidence suggesting that human cancer could be caused by a kind of reprogramming of cells. In other words, particular cancer-causing genes (known as 'oncogenes') are turned on in cells and this 'reprogrammes' them to behave differently - to turn into cancer stem cells.

Tremendous advances have been made since the original establishment of human embryonic stem cells lines (hESC)1. Their isolation and culture paved the way for the establishment of novel procedures that allowed researchers to dierentiate such pluripotent stem cells (hPSC) into almost all possible developmental lineages. The maintenance of hPSC in their pluripotent and undierentiated state allows for their expansion until the desired number is obtained. Thereafter, precise and ecient dierentia- tion protocols need to be conceived that would allowobtaining the nal cell product of choice with quality controls that can satisfy an unmet clinical need 2. Even though hPSC are considered immortal and donot seem to become old, during their expansion, close monitoring of their genome integrity is required, as they are susceptible to mutational events, whichcall for the development of improved methods for their derivation and culture 3. Ethical considerations are not the only concern, but also immunological issues, since perfect histocompatibility between adonor hPSC and a host that would benet from any cell/tissue product derived from the original hPSCpool, may not be achievable. Therefore, to circumvent such obstacles, alternative methods have been conceived to generate hPSC, such as reprogramming of somatic cells, known as inducible-pluripotent stem (iPS) cells 4, and somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT)5. The SCNT methodology appears to resemble most the naturally-made hESC6. There is, however, a lot of work to be done to render clinically-acceptable protocols to generate histo-compatible cells for regenerative purposes. Autologous use of adult stem cells in tissue engineering technologies is also a promising avenue7. Aging of stem cells within the body Aging is dened as the gradual reduction of body function with time. The causes giving rise to aging processes act in parallel in all organs, but the ultimate reasons remain elusive and are a matter of exhaus- tive clinical research. Accumulation of senescent cells is thought to be a driving factor. Aging has arisen asan anti-tumour mechanism to prevent cells that have accumulated damage beyond repair within those tis-sues, from becoming immortalised. Cellular damage can also be counteracted by programmed cell death or apoptosis mechanisms. The loss of cells will have the consequence that a compensatory process is initi- ated whereby adult stem cells are recruited from the vicinity or from distant reservoirs, to dierentiate into those cells that have been damaged and lost, to keep adequate homeodynamics within the given tissue. The constant renewal of cells as a compensatory mechanism has the drawback that at a given point in time, the stem cells either proximal and/or distant, will fail to eciently proliferate and dierentiate, giving rise to a clinical pathology and disease. There are many recent examples in the scientic literature where aging of the adult stem cell compartments has been documented 8, 9. Therefore, it is becoming evi- dent that the body's demise, as a consequence of the natural aging program, is due in great part to theexhaustion of stem cell regenerative potential. There are several strategies one could envision being applied to counteract stem cell exhaustion with time: 1. Prevent or reduce damage from occurring, to allow the stem cells to function for longer periods; 2. Eliminate the aged, dysfunctional stem cells by the useHealth Research 176Health Research of a unique biomarker(s) or targeting procedure; and/or 3. Replenish the loss of stem cell function or tissue function by means of transplanted, preferably young or at least younger histo-compatible cells that can compensate for the defects. Progress is being made in each one of these areas. A vast amount of work lies ahead to investigate the eects of physical, philosophical and nutritional hormetins that bring about hormesis eects to thestem cell compartments. Hormesis is a state whereby favourable biological responses are achieved to low exposures to a single stressor or a combination of them. The old saying of \"some bad will do some good\" is not always applicable because some compoundspresent in our environments should be preferably avoided as they trigger senescence. Advances in quantitative measurement of old cells, as well as biomarkers of cellular aging, are being made. This has led to several interesting ndings, includingevidence for immune-surveillance of old cells by immune system cells, as well as targeted destruction of genetically-manipulated old cells 10. Regenerative medicine protocols to help replace a defective tissue or organ due to an abnormal pathology are being pursued. Replenishment with young stemcells or young systemic factors to counteract thedetrimental eects of aged stem cells for rejuvenation purposes and ameliorating aged-associated patholo- gies is gaining ground 11,12. Aging of stem cells in cell culture outside the body As soon as stem cells lose their pluripotency after becoming dierentiated into multipotent stem cells, also known as adult stem cells, they exhibit a nite replicative lifespan in culture. This poses an additional constraint, as cells start gradually becoming senescent, or old in vitro. Isolation and establishment of various classes of adult stem cells in culture taken directly out from the human body, deprives the cells from their intrinsic conditions (e.g. hypoxia, survival factors, cell-cell contacts, etc.), also known as the stem cell niche, resulting in rapid aging. Therefore, carefulmanipulation of stem cells outside of the body,attempting to reproduce the conditions that they have in vivo (within the body), would help to extend their functional lifespan, and be useful for stem cell replenishment strategies. Conclusions Quantitative analysis of the presence of pre-senescent and senescent stem cells during cell culture expansion needs to be taken into account when addressing regenerative therapy trials. Their presence would impact negatively the overall function of the cellpop ulation10. When greater stem cell numbers are needed suchas in whole-organs transplants, the ideal way is to expand histo-compatible hPSC in an as error-free, reproducible and ecient way as possible, followed by dierentiation into the desired lineage and seeding onto tailor-suited biocompatible matrixes. Despite a number of hurdles, experience has been gained that will lead the way to eventually full the long-expected goals of regenerative medicine. 1Thomson et al.

Regenerative medicine aims to augment, repair, replace, or regenerate tissue and organs dam aged by disease, injury, or the natural aging process. It encompasses a wide array of novel technologies and therapeutic approaches, which include cell therapies, using stem cells; genetic manip ulation; small molecules and biomolecules; and synthetic and bio-based materials that act as a scaold for cell or tissue growth. While a vast majority of currently available treatments for chronic and fatal diseases are palliative or delay disease progression, regenerative medicine is uniquely capable of alteringthe underlying disease mechanism. Although regenerative medicine is in a relatively early stageof development, a signicant number of products, particularly cell therapy (CT)-based products andtissue engineered (TE) products, are already commercially available on the market. Cell therapy to fuel regenerative medicine market growth Cell therapy is the largest and the highest revenue-generating segment in the regenerative medicinemarket with nearly 50 cell therapy-based regenerative products approved and marketed in at least one country. Cell Therapy is primarily of 2 types, namely cell-based immunotherapies that involve dierent approaches to manipulate (e.g. induce, enhance, or suppress) cells of the immune system to combat diseases, and stem cell therapy that facilitates theself-replication of embryonic or adult stem cells even after periods of extended dormancy, unspecialised in function, and able to dierentiate into various specialised cell types under appropriate conditions. Organogenesis' Apligraf - comprised of living cells, proteins, and collagen, and used for wound healing invenous leg ulcers and diabetic foot - was the rst celltherapy-based product to be approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and launched in 1998. The recent FDA approval of Dendreon's Provenge, a cell-based immunotherapy for the treat ment of late-stage prostate cancer in 2010, has initiated signicant resurgence in the eld of immunotherapy and personalised medicine. Currently, there are no licensed stem cell products approved by the US FDA although a handful of products are commercialised in other regulated markets such as Europe and South Korea. Collectively, the top 20 cell therapy products treated over 500,000 patients in 2011 and nearly 140,000 patients in 2012, generating revenues of $730m and $900m respectively. Nearly 80% of commercially available cell therapy products target skin/non-healing wounds and musculoskeletal conditions. Dierent cell types are being evaluated in over 1,900 clinical trials globally for a wide range of indications and include primary cells, progenitor cells, adult stem cells, embryonic stem cells, and recently, induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). According to the Alliance for Regenerative Medicine (ARM), in 2012 nearly 60,000 stem-cell trans plants were performed worldwide and over 160,000 patients were treated with cell therapyprod ucts, generating revenue of over $900m. 2012 witnessed the approval of the highest number (7) of cell-therapy products by regulatory agencies globally, while 5 such approvals were granted between 2009 and 2011, and none from 2002 to 2008. Clinical activity buzz to increasingly attract investors Given the increasing approval rates and clinical activ ity, regenerative medicine proves to be anHealth Research 178Health Research extremely attractive sector for investors and managed to raise a combined public and private investment of over $1bn in 2012. Currently, more than 2,500 regenerative medicine clinical trials are on-going,investigating a host of new product candidates for a myriad of clinical indications such as cardiovascular disease, peripheral vascular disease, diabetes, stroke,central nervous system (CNS) disorders, spinal cord injuries (SCIs), ocular disease, musculoskeletal disorders , wounds and soft tissue damage, cancer, and several other debilitating autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. 2012 garnered an investment of over $900m from private investors and public markets besidesearning grants of over $300m, totalling approximately $1.2bn. Furthermore, industry consolidation in the form of acquisitions of protable cell therapy compa nies by big pharma and strategic investments in up-coming cell-based therapy organisations are increasing in an attempt to embrace future technologies and stay competitive in the industry. Critical unmet need and potential game-changing strategies Given the rapid rise of the aging baby boomer popula tion and increasing prevalence of chronic diseases, it is certain that regenerative medicine will play an important role in patient care, particularly intherapies that avoid traditional drugs, devices, and surgery. However, the lack of consensus and strategic interaction at various levels of the regenerative medicine community (government, industry, academia, insurance payers, patients and physicians) warrants the establishment of a common point of contact at the national level acting as a liaison between FDA, CMS, NIH, NCHS, other federal agencies, and the private sector. Moreover, insurance payers are not convinced of the overall cost benets, particularly for indications such as wound healing and skin substitutes. Hence, it is extremely important to create an exclusively dened list of critical therapeutic indications withunmet needs that represent national priorities in healthcare and establish a more ecient reimbursement coverage framework that will work in coordination with an accelerated clinical approval process. Furthermore, the time, cost and complexity of clinical trials pose a challenge with regard to attracting investment from big pharma and gaining approval from regulatory authorities. Enabling better clinical trial design by expanding geographic access as wellas enabling more eective utilisation of historical data from the NCHS, CMS, CDC, and other relevant agencies could be a potential solution. Thus, governments all over the world are working to support the development of regenerative medicine by framing and implementing legislative policies favouring the establishment of centres of excellence, manufacturing infrastructure, research networks, and AiswariyaC@frost.comwww.frost.com & SullivanNext Generation Bioban king Professor Berthold Huppertz CEO of Biobank Graz discusses the next generation of biobanking... The hype in biobanking and the boost of biobanks in the last 2 decades has led to the development of a huge number of biobanks around the globe. The number of human biobanks has especially grown, culminating in a total amount of about 200 million specimens currently stored in these. These human biological specimens include tissues(xed and embedded in paran or stored at very low temperatures as cryo samples), bodily fluids (blood and derivatives, urine, saliva, but also liquor, follicularfluid, seminal fluid, etc.) and isolated biological structures (DNA, RNA, proteins, primary cells). Each and every biobank needs to connect samples to their associated data. In human biobanks these com prise mostly clinical data; however, data may also be derived from experimental data (e.g. data from omics technologies) or data related to demographic, environmental and social parameters of the donors. Of course, all this data needs to be saved and connected to the samples in a way ensuring protection of any personal data of the donors. At present, the biobanking hype is still ongoing, especially in the eld of human biobanking. This caneasily be seen from the following data: Looking at the biobanks present today, more than 75% of them have been established since 1990*. At the same time, morethan half of all biobanks (55%) are still quite small andstore less than 10,000 samples*. Very few biobanks have already reached sample numbers of more than a million. Lack of Denitions Like any hype, due to its fast development biobanking has generated quite a lack of defini tions that can be related to the pool of \"How\" questions related to this. To name a few: How is the collection strategy of a biobank dened? How is sample integrity preserved during sample collection? How is sample quality maintained during sample storage? How is the direct link between sample and data secured? 180Health Research How can the highest quality of data and samples be achieved and conserved? How is the privacy of donors protected? How can the samples be made available for academic and industrial research partners worldwide? How can scientists nd the quality and quantity of samples needed for their studies? How can sustainability of biobanks, especially academic biobanks be assured? Although there is the need to dene a collection strategy, there is no requirement to standardise collection strategies in dierent biobanks or the amount of samples stored in a single biobank. At the same time, a single aliquot in a freezer should not be termed a biobank per denition as is true for specic countries. Higher level of Communication The further development of the eld of biobanking in the next decade is crucially dependent on a deep analysis of problems and challenges. High levels ofharmonisation and quality standards need to be set up to guarantee data and sample qualities in biobanks that match the needs of the new developingassays, especially the - omics technologies. This can only be achieved by communication on a very high level. International biobank networks, organisationsand societies (including BBMRI-ERIC, ISBER and ESBB) as well as superregional biobanks will be heavily involved in setting up the framework of denitionsand standards for the harmonisation of biobanking activities. In this framework, dening standards of SOPs (standard operation procedures) for sample anddata handling, securing personal rights of donors in a networking world and certifying quality management procedures especially in biobanks are essential steps towards harmonisation. Next Generation Biobanking Although the private companies start to set up their own biobanks again, in a survey from 2010 the vastmajority of biobanks was owned by universities, national and regional agencies or non-prot founda- tions, while only 3% were privately owned*. The same tendency can be found when looking at the projects that use samples from such biobanks. Only a very small minority of the above biobanks (7%) releasessamples and data for all kinds of studies including public, private and clinical research*. The above numbers clearly show that today most ofthe biobanks are publicly owned small biobanks that were created for public and clinical research only. This data points toward the fact that such biobanks are not prepared to work with the private sector and hence may not be allowed or structured to give samples to industrial partners. This is in contrast to the new development in Europewhere there is a drift towards the comprehension that private partners are recognised as full partners in research. A respective cooperating of publicly owned biobanks with commercial partners from the private sector is anticipated and hence new ways to commu- nicate and cooperate in joint projects need to be established. The integration of industrial research and partners into public biobank activities presents an important aspect to achieve an innovative and sustainable benet for both, private partners and biobanks, to nally bring medical research into newhorizons and advance health care for the population in general. * Data are taken from the JRC Scientic and Graz www.medunigraz.at/biobank 181Controlling dengue fever remains a dicult task, here Dr Thomas Walker Lecturer at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine sheds light on current approaches to eliminating the disease... Dengue fever is a mosquito-borne disease that results in signicant mortality and morbidityin developing countries. The dengue virus, composed of 4 serotypes (DENV1-4), is transmittedbetween humans principally by the mosquito Aedes(Stegomyia) aegypti. It is estimated that 40% of the world's population live in areas at risk for infection and as many as 400 million cases are thought to occur each year in more than 100 countries. Dengue outbreaks result from rapid urban epidemics in many countries of Southeast Asia and South America. However, rare cases have been documented in the US and Southern Europe, and climate change is likely to expand the geographical range of transmission. The prevalence of dengue has increased signicantly in the past 50 years due to factors including population growth, urbanisation in tropical and subtropical coun tries and proliferation of mosquito breeding sites. Early recognition and supportive treatment canhelp lower the risk of severe morbidity or mortalityalthough diagnosis is often dicult in developing countries. Mosquito vector control has been the only way to prevent transmission, as there are currently no vaccines or drugs available for dengue. Successful mosquito control for dengue has been problematic for several reasons. Aedes aegypti mosquitoes are anthropophilic (preferring to bite humans) and are extremely well adapted to living inurban environments in close proximity to dense human populations. This species of mosquito has apreference for laying eggs in articial containers (e.g. water tanks and unused tires) so widespread larval source reduction is dicult to implement. Another widely used method has been outdoor spraying of insecticides such as DDT and malathion. Singapore isa good example of how dengue continues to persist even with a strictly implemented control program. 182 An alter nativ e appro ach to dengue controlHealth ResearchHealth Research Dengue was rst reported in 1960 and government interventions through integrated mosquito controlprograms reduced the incidence of transmission by the 1970s. However, Singapore has recently seen resurgence in dengue and cases are still reported despite a signicant control program targeting mosquitoes. It is thought that re-introduction of the virus occurs through an influx of people from endemic regions (either as tourists or migrant workers). If acountry like Singapore is unable to prevent dengue transmission, current vector control methods are clearly not working and novel methods need to be developed. The options for developing new technologies for mosquito control fall into 2 major strategies. Population suppression aims to reduce or eliminate the wild mosquito population. Conventional methods such as insecticide spraying and larval source reduction aim to reduce mosquito populations. A novel suppression strategy that is showing great potential has been the generation of genetically modied mosquitoes thatcan be released to 'crash' the existing wild population. The British biotech company Oxitec are currentlyworking in dengue endemic countries such as Brazilwith a strain of mosquito that they are hoping can achieve population reduction or even elimination. 1 Oxitec have genetically modied mosquitoes to createsterile males (RIDL-release of insects with a dominant lethal) that are then released to mate with wild females. The resulting progeny inherit this 'lethal gene' and donot survive to adulthood. Oxitec are able to rear the mosquitoes in insectaries by providing a repressor(tetracycline) in the diet that prevents lethal eects. This approach has the advantage of being very species-specic and has no long lasting eects the target species (Aedes aegypti) as the aim is to eliminate the population in the release area. Critics of this strategy would question the cost-eectiveness of this strategy as repeated releases may be required if re-immigration of mosquitoes into the release area occurs. However, a larger issue for Oxitec's approach has been the concern regarding releasing genetically modied insects despite the many studies showing this approach is unlikely to have any major negative eects on the environment. An alternative approach to dengue control is to replace the wild mosquito population with mosquitoes that are unable to transmit disease. Genetically modiedmosquitoes that are 'refractory' to dengue transmission have been developed. However, concerns over theeects of GM on mosquito tness, crucial if releasing to compete with wild mosquitoes, has prevented any large-scale trials. A novel approach that shows great potential is the use of endosymbiotic bacteria to prevent dengue from replicating within the mosquito. The 'eliminate dengue' project2based in Australia has been able to demonstrate that Wolbachia endosymbiotic bacteria can prevent dengue transmis- infects more than 65% on insectspecies and successfully transfer of Wolbachia from Drosophila fruit flies to Aedes aegypti mosquitoes has formed the basis for a biocontrol program that is now being implemented in dengue endemic countries such as Vietnam, Indonesia and Brazil. The advantage of Wolbachia is that these bacteria results in arepro ductive phenotype that allows rapid invasion of uninfected mosquito populations. The 'eliminatedengue' project has undertaken successful trials demonstrating that Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes established in release areas in Far North Australia. The aim is to provide an economical and environmentally friendly strategy that can be implemented by simply releasing mosquitoes that contain this naturally occurring bacterial endosymbiont. The Wolbachia- based approach, like any other novel mosquito control strategy, requires signicant further experiments todetermine if this strategy would actually reduce, or even eliminate, dengue transmission in endemic countries. The likely increase in the geographic range of Aedes aegypti mosquitoes (and therefore dengue transmission) through climate change suggest novel control strategies will play an important role in preventing dengue outbreaks in and Sir Henry Dale Wellcome Trust/Royal Society FellowDepartment of Disease Control London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine Tel: +44 (0)207 927 2164 www.lshtm.ac.uk 183It is often said that many of the world's most dangerous animals, the living monsters that populate our nightmares, do not fully deserve their villainous reputations. Poisonous snakes, spiders and crocodiles; all are perhaps more frequently subject themselves to the terrors of man's encroachment on their habitats than embodying the merciless persecutors of our imagination. Sadly, the same cannot be said of the hands-down winner of the 'world's most dangerous animal' competition: the humble mosquito. One of our most ancient foes, the number of debilitat- ing and often life-threatening diseases that mosquitoes pedal amongst us is bewildering. And far from being a victim of mankind's technological advances, many mosquitoes seem set to thrive and spread in an increasingly inter-connected world, while climate- change and increasing urbanisation are in fact rapidly expanding the habitat of warm-loving, urban-dwelling pests like the dengue mosquito Aedes aegypti. Recently, this mosquito has been making headlines in Brazil, where it has been responsible for a dengue epidemic of frightening proportions. It is the reason that many travelling fans to this year's World Cup were warned of returning home with something rather more serious than memories of a football competition. But this is not the only justification forthis particular mosquito's infamy.Because the dengue mosquito is also a primary vector for another, lesser known, disease, Chikungunya; and it is this plague which is currently cast- ing its shadow over Central America and the Caribbean. High fever, rash, agonizing aches and pains; the list of symptoms for Chikungunya will be ominously familiar to anyone who has seen or experi- enced dengue fever. Indeed, Chikun- gunya is often mis-diagnosed as its better-known relation. It frequently leaves its own particular calling card, however: a crushing joint pain (arthral- gia)which can persist in victims for months or even years. After remaining largely under the radar of most health authorities, Chikungunya burst onto the global health scene in 2005-6, when an epidemic in La Reunion affected 40% ofA battle on two fronts One mosquito, two crippling diseases: dengue and chikungunya 184the population in a matter of months, and caused over 200 fatalities1. Since that time, public health officials have warned of the potential for a major outbreak of Chikungunya in the Americas, where both carriers of the disease - Ae. aegypti and its cousin, Ae. albopictus - abound. But it was not until December 2013 that the first cluster of victims was reported in St Martin. Over the last year, that small pool has swelled to a flood of cases throughout the Caribbean and in Central America. According to the Pan-American Health Organisation (PAHO), the latest count was 355,000confirmed cases, with thousandsmore added week on week 2. Unlike the outbreak in La Reunion, Ae.aegypti, rather than Ae. albopictus, this time is the primary culprit. Othercountries throughout the Americas remain at high risk: with imported cases being reported in Brazil, VenezuelaPROFILE Blood feeding Aedes Aegypti. Dengue and chikungunya are transmitted through the bite of an infected mosquitoand the US, it is perhaps only a matter of time before the disease establishes itself on a continent-wide footing. Nor is Europe immune to the threat. A recent risk assessment from the European Centre for Disease Preven- tion and Control (ECDC) warns that, with the holiday season in full-swing, the risk of imported cases is high3. The presence of Ae. aegypti in Madeira, and Ae. albopictus throughout much of mainland Europe, mean that a European outbreak remains a distinctpossibility. With no vaccine, and no specific treat- ment, tools to combat the advance of Chikungunya are distinctly limited. Just as with dengue fever, halting the seemingly inexorable march of the dengue mosquito is our best option - and the only solution capable of combatting these twin scourgessimultaneously.Of course, that is no easy task. The dengue mosquito thrives in dense urban environments, where it is adept at commandeering any standing wate r to rear its young - which it produces at a prodigious rate. But with Oxitec's radical technology a new weapon has appeared in the pest control arsenal. By using genetically modified malemosquitoes to seek out and prevent wild-females from reproducing, Oxitec has ranged mosquito against mosquito - a system perfectly adapted to con- trolling these elusive pests. It is an approach which has already proved highly effective in Brazil, which earlier this year granted to the technology the World's first ever commercial license for a genetically modified insect. There are now thought to be over 300 million cases of dengue fever each year. As if that were not sufficient argument, the evolving Chikungunya pandemic serves as a potentOxitec Ltd Tel: +44 (0) 138 info@oxitec.com www.oxitec.com 185reminder of how desperately such new tools are needed in the fight against the dengue mosquito.

Over the last few years, the public sector has faced some of its biggest challenges for decades. Unprecedentedly signicant and immediate public expenditure cuts have been accom- panied by an ever-rising increase in demand for core public services including health and social care. And whilst the public (rightly) seeks higher quality outcomes and more responsive services, so too is technology transforming the ways in which the public can and do interact with many public services, with social mediaand the internet in particular making citizens and service users better informed and more challenging. So, a period of rapid change - and of uncertainty, with the only certainties being that there will be still more change, and that the pace will increase further. Against this backdrop, the challenge for public sector leaders and other leaders in the business, social andvoluntary sectors who nd themselves engaged inservice design, commissioning and delivery is, to saythe very least, formidable. Specically, how to achieve change that is sustainable, aordable, accords with public expectations, and remains true to some senseof public service ethos. Given the level of cuts already made and planned(and we should not forget that the majority of the cuts resulting from the 2010 Spending Review are yet to be implemented) and the strong expectation ofmore to follow the 2015 general election, it is inevitable that some services will simply disappear whilst others will become hollow shadows of theirformer selves. Every organisation with any sense of ambition and public (or indeed, private) purpose will wish to improve continuously. Of course, sadly some arecon tent to stagnate but thankfully, most are not. And the reality is that most of the public sector and mostpublic services can no longer look to some smallscale, incremental improvement if they are to thrive 186 Human ResourcesHuman Resources and survive. The challenge I have outlined above specically requires that leaders should be inspiring their organisations to 'thrive' and proactively evolve, not just survive. Addressing this challenge demands new thinking and innovation; productivity has to improve; new ways of doing new things to secure better outcomes are required; and long term problems with their long-term costs have to be addressed intelligently and swiftly to improve both the quality of life for people but also to save money. Many of these long-term social, economic and environmental challenges are complex and require interventions and contributions from more than one sector or organisation. Given this fact, plus the needfor nancial restraint and the public's desire for responsive and seamless services, it is both inevitable and obvious that services and agencies will have tocollaborate and share resources. Articial, egotistical, professional, institutional and bureaucratic barriers must be torn down. The imperative to both innovate and collaborate, and indeed for innovation and collaboration to mesh together, forms the building block to any future strategies if signicant social, economic and environmental issues are to be eectively addressed; and if increasingly scarce resources are to bedeployed in an optimum manner. At rst glance innovation and collaboration and the necessary conditions to make them happen mayappear to be dierent. However, in fact, they have much in common. Both require inspired leadership, focused on outcomes for people rather than institutions. They require empowerment of service users, sta and others to facilitate flexibility and exploration of solutions. Rather than processes, procedures and manuals - they depend on people at all levels (politicians and profes sionals, and senior executives, managers and frontline sta) having the right mind-sets and behaviours, as well as the space and time to explore, experiment and simply to 'talk' to each other, serviceusers and the public.Public service leaders must personally champion innovation and collaboration. This has to be more than slogans, project and job titles, and vague concepts.These leaders must themselves adopt and practice the behaviours consistent with eective collaboration and innovation. They need to be part of the solution -not part of the problem. It is still too common to hear so called 'leaders' in all sectors claiming to be in favour of innovation and/or collaboration. But during a short conversation, it soon becomes clear that those initial right words and platitudes are in fact covering up a lack of any real understanding, dysfunctional behaviours, and a wholesale failure to embed the concepts in their organisation. In other words, such so-called leaderslack 'authenticity'. Excellent leaders create and foster a culture of improvement, change, experimentation, looking beyond the organisation itself, learning and listening. They ensure that innovation and collaboration areencouraged and rewarded, and are 'core' to theirorganisation - not some 'add-on' or delegated as the responsibility of the 'innovation' or the 'collaboration /partnership' team. They invest in training and support for their sta and partners. They remove restrictive rules, regulations and procedures that get in the way of eective collaboration and innovation. They are ready to accept some failure as part of the natural learning process, and their rst instinct is to learn rather than to blame. Collaboration and innovation are not ends in them selves but they are vital to maintain the necessary momentum of change and continuous improvement such that public services do not just survive, but 328159 john@johntizard.com www.johntizard.com 187Ihave a confession to make... I am a failed filing clerk! I hate to admit it, but if the success of your organisa- tion depended on my ability to admin- ister records, then trust me - it's not looking good. But there again, if my clients depended on our Financial Controller (FC) to create effective, compelling and timely solutions, most of their staff would have retired by the time he'd finished his initial analysis of the problem! But I can turn a solution on a sixpence and the FC can produce complex reports easily.What we are looking at here are the two issues that make the difference between a team that's just getting by and a High Performance team that not only delivers, but regularly exceeds targets. The first issue is FLOW: When I'm designing a solution, I'm totally in flow. I am highly effective and productive. But when I have to -for example -\"do my expenses\" I am out of flow, seriously ineffective and afflicted with a recently diagnosed syndrome DBSO (Distraction by Bright, Sparkly Objects). This of course refers to absolutely anything other than expenses that comes into my gaze and needs therefore to be handled immediately. The second issue is TALENT:Each of us has a unique talent that when har-nessed correctly, allows us to shine brightly. It is not a static object, but a flowing force, like electricity. When connected, it can be directed to create extraordinary results. Talent is not just what you do well. It's what you love doing well. That's why so many of us aren't even aware of just how valuable we are, because when we are having fun, or feel ful- filled with a task, we do it with ease. Having the right people in the right roles where they are able to complete the work easily and enjoyably in FLOW using their natural TALENTS is absolutely normal for a high perform- ance team, and that's what we can help you to do.

Of no particular value, it is about to go for a song when someone comes out of the audience, picks up the bow and plays it. Its true worth now revealed, it is valued afresh and is auctioned for a thousand times the initial bid.

Companies need to listen to and engage with customers as never before Businesses that focus on the customer relentlessly are more likely to survive in this harsh climate rather than those that purely focus on their internal operations. World class innovators possess a relentless focus on growth; continually transition their revenue source; and solve customers' problems - before the customer even knows it's a problem. \"Innovation moves from more than just new product or service development, to process, structure, capability and speed\" The fact is, we now live in a time in which we have to build new relationships with customers, because everything about the customer relationship has changed. With the increasing trend in the use of social networks with feedback and commentary on interactions with a company, customers have more access to comment on their customer experience -and it is not always complimentary. They can render a brand new product instantly obsolete if it doesn'tmatch their expectations - as witnessed withtablets from both Blackberry and HP. It is no longer acceptable for the customer to'think' they are getting value - they need to be sure. So, involving your customers in your endeavours will pay huge rewards in the long run. The Voice of the Customer truly is the most vital ingredient in business development and performance. In a recent survey of many business sectorsincluding; manufacturing, nancial services,healthcare, government, distribution there wereseveral key points noted:Key Findings Process professionals still favour the \"Voice of the Business\" when identifying and prioritising process improvement projects but to a lesser degree than in a similar 2009 survey Over 30% of companies reported themselves to be \"ineective\" or \"highly ineective\" at using and acting on Voice of the Customer data Organisations are their own worst enemy: data not being shared internally was cited as the biggest overall barrier to developing an eective VOCprogramme (21.8% of respondents said it was theprimary barrier while nearly 60% of respondents said it was one of the top three) Customer complaints is a widely-used method for gathering Voice of the Customer feedback but those companies that rated themselves \"eective\"or \"highly eective\" used it less often to evaluate and prioritise process improvement projects than those organisations that consider themselves \"ineective\" or \"highly ineective\" Creating a data-driven, problem solving culture in the wider business was seen as a key enabler to being able to better evaluate and respond to customer feedback in a proactive and constructive way Even though eciency came out as the top driver for process excellence, for those companies where improving customer satisfaction was a stated aim, process improvement eorts were more likely to be rated as successful or highly successful.The Voice of the Customer is getting louder! Put simply, listening to the Voice of the Customer (VOC) means understanding your customers and aligning your business services and products to serve them better. It means you have a way of observing and understanding both spoken and unspoken customer needs - not just assuming thatyou know what they want. There are a number of proven methods and way of doing this. Some are simply methodical - such as Six Sigma's emphasis on understanding \"Critical toQuality\" (CTQ) metrics or Lean's emphasis on removing non-value added activity dened as anything that customers would not be willing to pay for. These proven process improvement techniques oer practical tools that organisations can use to hone their business operations and improve valueboth for customers and for shareholders. \"Over 30% of companies were reportedly \"ineective\" or \"highly ineective\" at using Voice of the Customer\" As organisations reel from on-going uncertainty, the margin for error is getting slimmer. That means that truly knowing and understanding what your customers want can no longer be a \"shot in the dark\" - true insight is now business critical. Overall, how eective would you rate your company's ability to collect and understand customer requirements/sentimentsand translate that feedback into action? \"58.3% of respondents cited data not shared eectively between internal teams as one ofthe top 3 barriers to collecting and using Voiceof the Customer\"The second most common barrier to eective use of VOC was the diculty of linking customer feedback to specic processes for improvement (19.3% citedit as the primary barrier and 51.3% overall). Some of the specic challenges around linking feedback with process improvement were rst knowing what to dowith it - i.e. \"what is this telling us?\" or \"how do we x this?\" - and then actually implementing a solution. When conducting VOC you need to be very clear about what you want to know, and carefully construct your questions and methods in order to answer those questions. Once you get reactive data, then we can get clearer about the questions andhone in on unbiased requests to get data back and feedback. \"If your process takes too long or is too cumbersome, customers will stop complaining and just walk away\" In the survey, nearly 70% of companies without any formal process improvement program for instance, rated themselves as \"highly ineective\" at translating customer feedback/sentiment into action with only a little over 30% of companies who have undertaken process improvement activities for one or more years reporting their VOC program to be \"highly ineective.\" RECOMMENDATIONS #1: Evaluate your processes from the customer's point of view Look at your business processes from the perspective of customers in order to understand key \"touch points\" (i.e. the places where a customer interacts with your company such as a retail outlet,on your website, via e-mail, by telephone, etc.) and how your processes aect their experience. #2: Encourage a culture of experimentation Many companies cite the diculties of linking VOC back to specic processes for improvement. They can identify the problems - they just don't know This is where the tried and tested scientic method comes in. Evaluate the data, come up with a hypothesis and then design an experiment to test your assumptions. If it works, continue with the solution. If it doesn't, try something else. PDCA - Plan, Do, Check, Act - is a very eective way of identifying and implementing solutions. The simple, but very eective methodology will generate signicant courses of action towards solutions #3: Create cross functional teams and train them in basic process improvement tools The process of collecting, evaluating and acting on VOC needs to involve representatives from dierent business units. It cannot be the sole preserve of an isolated group (such as a process improvement group) coming up with solutions and then imposing them on the business. Customer process problems likely cut across departments and you want to ensure that plugging a hole in one area doesn't endup creating new problems in another part of the business. As with all process improvement work, this is good practise anyway, but it's all the more important when trying to come up with solutions to multi-faceted problems that impact the customer. #4: Senior leadership needs to encourage a data-driven, problem solving culture Company leadership has an important role to play in creating the right conditions for customer-focussed and proactive problem solving organisations. Leadership's rst response to problem should be \"we've got problems, how can we solve them?\" and not, \"we've got problems, who's to blame?\" What best describes your approach to process excellence?Interestingly, process improvement programs thatare \"top down\" (i.e. driven and supported by senior leadership) rather than either the \"bottom up\" or \"middle out\" were much more likely to be associated with \"highly eective\" VOC programs (see above chart). This could be an indication that leadership understands the importance of making decisions based on data and believes in process improvementas a means to action. INTERESTED IN LEARNING MORE?

Before taking up my current job I'd never heard of change management, although I had been using its concepts in practice for years. Now it seems to be everywhere, and that is because if you manage change properly, the commitment you gain from your sta will make your change stick. People in every organisation want change to be managed well, the question is, what does that look like? The University of Bristol's Change Team has 2 main strategic objectives: to ensure that the University getsthe fullest return on its investment in projects and change initiatives, and to support managers across the University to manage change better themselves. Colleagues in sta development complement this byproviding training through a range of management and leadership development programmes. The Change Team focuses on key practical changes happening across the University, working with sta from senior leadership level down to every last aected person to provide tailored support, positive challenge and 2way communication. Change is around us constantly at work. By building sta's resilience in the face of change, and helping everyone see the benets of the change in their role, their team's remit and their wider organisation, youare far more likely to see lasting results. True engage- ment is getting people on side because they want to be, and is the only way to change peoples' behaviour Human Resources 194Human Resources 195and actions. Many projects achieve their outputs but a few months later no one can see any real dierencein terms of improved outcomes - this is where the sustaining and embedding activities of change management can make all the dierence. The key to change management is in its ability to make engagement and consultation real and eective. We kick this o through 1:1 interviews with samples of sta aected to nd out in advance what they see as benets or diculties to their roles, in what is being proposed. This can inform the design and rollout of the change. It also means that those who really arekey to success are identied and included early on. Secondly, we stress straightforward and honestcom munication using the most appropriate medium - ask sta how they like to be communicated with andyou will soon build a picture of the best routes. This depends on the type of organisation, geographical location of sta etc. but, here in Bristol we know weneed to place emphasis on 'live' face to face commu- nications, through team meetings, champions,some times roadshows, presentations and training. Depending on the audience, newsletters, emails, and social media can also come in handy. \"True engagement is getting people on side because they want to be, and is the only way to change peoples' behaviourand actions. \" Identifying where there might be issues or resistance before the change goes live is also critical so that this can be dealt with before it takes root. And nally, really making change happen involves a long tail of follow up work, talking to sta to nd out what is working, identifying areas that need more support, puttingreviews in place and ensuring that you really have changed behaviours in the desired ways. Listening to issues means that they can be addressed and dealt with.A common misconception is that everyone needs tobe on board to make change happen, but in fact youcan use the 80:20 rule. Key influencers do need to be on board but not all people need to be with you right now. Others will adapt to the change in due course,and with support where it is needed - for example, through further training, a 'top tips sheet' or simply byallowing them time. Ultimately, your leaders and sponsors need to drive change from the top and their absolute visible commitment to a vision is a key building block. But, these messages need to be translated so that all sta aected can see the benets to their role and their team because if they see why it makes sense, or why certain (and particularly unpopular) choices had to be made, then they will understand and act. This also needs commitment in terms of resource - whether you train people from the business to act as change managers or whether you deploy a specialist change manager on a consultancy type model as we do at Bristol, it will cost. Not only in salaries but also in terms of funds to make and print leaflets, training materials, hiring rooms and allowing time for sta to participate in events. However that investment will pay dividends in terms of embedding and achieving long term, sustainable of Bristol Tel: +44 (0)117 33 18024 Naomi.logan@bristol.ac.ukwww.bris.ac.uk/hr/changemanagementThe only constant in business, private or public, is Change ; and most people whether they admit it or not do not like change enacted upon them. It is therefore important as you approach designing and implementing a Continuous Improvement (CI) programme that you fully recognise and manage the change aspects. Continuous improvement is not a new concept, well promoted in manufacturing businesses; it requires intensive teamwork with team members that have the delegated responsibility to improve the processes they are part of. Leadership is key in selling the vision of the future beyond the proposed improvements and designing a reward and recognition scheme that has a personal dimension to it. Change Management is multi-dimensional including education and training, business process modelling, and communications. All of these elements are then designed to match the organisational culture. External Intervention and facilitation can be effective, in challenging thestatus quo, providing analysis tools and programme management; but sustainability can only be achievedfrom within and enthusiastic partici- pation can only be guaranteed if the process is enjoyable. Making this process enjoyable requiresthat you ensure that each of the participants: Has a sense of control over the out- come. Understand their personal benefit. See how they will improve their skills making them more employable inside or outside the organisation. Receive recognition of their achieve- ments through the monitoring of benefits and the difference the change has made. Why does this make it enjoyable? Firstly, if you can see and feel in con- trol of your own destiny you are morelikely to participate in changing it. ThisMaking business improvement enjoyable and sustainable Benetting from business process management means leaders need to be able to project a vision of where they think continuous improvement is going to take the business, and then what part the participants will play in it. Leaders also need to emphasise and promote the personal benefits such as training as well as monetary rewards. For example demonstrating that by participating in programmes such as this so they can progress within the business and in some cases this pro-gression might be significant enough that they move out of the business into a new career. Sustainability requires that the busi- ness: Provides a strategic framework in which continuous improvement is 196PROFILE197PROFILE managed through process improve- ment targets set over a 3-5 year period. Provides for the monitoring of these targets as part of departmental 'business as usual' activities. Continues to provide training in analysis, communication and deci- sion making skills perhaps using the early practitioners to develop others. Communicates regularly describing how the business is progressing and the contribution from CI. What are the key elements of a successful CI programme? We consider the corner stone to be a dynamic business process model. By understanding the present maturity of the processes, comparing to best practice provides the 'Gap' that must be closed by the CI programme. We debate process performance in a qualitative manner in cross-functionalworkshops. The maturity of these processes will vary and this will lead to different categories of improvement such benchmarking, step change and break through. When redesigning processes we take into account that different processes have different values within the busi- ness, therefore there should be little discussion about streamlining activi- ties and removing rework from back office processes and can be set to a 'best practice' standard; whereas 'added value' processes need careful design to ensure we deliver the most beneficial outcome. The benefits model of the continuous improvement programme will directly be related directly to these processesalso. Executive workshops enable senior managers to define the type of benefit and the degree of difficulty to achieve it. We use 3 categories Displaced Costs, Improved Productivity and Increased Revenue; and three degrees of diffi- culty High, Medium and Low to enable mangers to allow for the level of control they have in implementing the process improvement. This qualitative method engages managers better than tradi- tional single target benefit measures. Throughout a CI programme a signifi- cantlevel of honest communication is required, all stakeholders need to be understood and communication will vary from results notification to visioning. All the communicators will need to have a good level of skill and beable to address their work col- leagues and senior managers in equal measure. This ability requires structured training and to ensure good 'internalisation' of change we use workshops to engage the change agent in all participants; other skills training will include the ability to communicate with colleagues, facilitate workshops and present analysis and assessment results to senior managers. The senior managers role in this is to be listening, facilitating and mentoring, guiding; not managing and implementing. In Summary Throughout the next 12 months we will be looking at some of these tech- niques and approaches in more detail, but in conclusion the implementationand management of a successful continuous improvement programme requires good planning, a shared vision of the future, skilled internal change agents and extensive open communication.

In addition do not think you can delegate the whole process to outside agencies though they can help to pro- vide tools and techniques and create initial momentum. For example there are many examples of where a change have been made without performing business modelling and in some cases this has resulted in extremely effective , short term cost reductions in head count, but an inability to perform the processes effectively after the programme stops. Finally CI should be seen as redirecting your resources to add more value in activities that you may not be able to perform effectively because they are either not recognised, there is not enough resource in the business to do them or they are being protected by departmental approaches to process design and management that are ineffective in today's agile business climate. Human Resources 198Developing essential health and safety in the workplace Eective health and safety training at work can make all the dierence, here Jo Carter Information Services Ocer at the Institution of Occupational Safety and Health (IOSH) explains why... Accidents in the workplace have been at a record all-time low, with 133 fatalities recorded in the UK from April 2013 to March 20141. However this doesn't mean that we become complacent about safety at work - the numbers of accidents is still too high. On top of that, consider occupational health: In 2011/2012, there were an estimated 450,000 new cases of occupational-related ill health and a further estimated 12,000 deaths each year caused by past exposures to harmful substances at work.2 A poor health and safety culture within the workplace encourages an atmosphere in which not complyingwith safe working practices is acceptable; this doesn't help the organisation to take eective action to solvehealth and safety problems. It can be challenging to influence a positive attitude on a workforce and canbe dicult to alter attitudes and beliefs 3. A positive health and safety culture often develops slowly and over time; this can lead to increased productivity and product quality, improved nancial control and improved health and safety performance. Research supported by the Institution of Occupational Safety and Health (IOSH) measured the eectiveness of training in promoting a positive OSH culture. A total of 10 companies were sampled, including SMEs and large organisations. Researchers found that training interventions were designed and implemented within all companies sampled, and that accidents were signicantly reduced, leading to a more positive safetyHuman Resources 199climate over time. Their ndings were that safety interventions can have a signicant long-term impact on a company's safety culture4. Eective training within the workplace can contributetowards making employees competent in health and safety, can help businesses avoid the distress that accidents and ill-health cause, and can help to avoidthe nancial costs of accidents and occupational ill-health, such as damaged products, lost production and de-motivated staff 5. Firstly, employers should show their commitment to employees so the people being trained recognise that training is important. Whether an employer, self- employed, a manager, a supervisor or an employee; everyone will be required to have some health and safety training within the workplace. The type oftrain ing depends on the requirements of the job being carried out; most external training providers can advise on the needs of the business and some training can be carried out 'in-house'. Training willneed to be properly prioritised and planned for the workplace and competent assistance may be required to help or assist. The HSE states there are 5 steps to planning health and safety training 5, these are: Step 1 - Decide what training your organisation needs; Step 2 - Decide your training priorities; Step 3 - Choose your training methods and resources; Step 4 - Deliver the training; Step 5 - Check that the training has worked. There have been devastating accidents that have occurred due to the lack of eective training in the workplace; an exceptional violation includes the Cher nobyl disaster in 1986 which was the result of a flawed reactor design, operated by inadequately trained personnel. The disaster which occurred in the Chernobyl 4 reactor killed 2 plant workers on the night and a further 28 people within a few weeks asa result of acute radiation poisoning. The lessons learnt from this dis aster have resulted in improved safety reactor designs and the development of a safety culture6. It is the law to ensure that training is carried out by employers, this is to ensure that people are aware of hazards and risks and ways to control them. The health and safety at work etc act 1974 places particular duty on the employers to provide whatever information, instruction, training and supervision is necessary to ensure, so far as is reasonably practicable, the health and safety at work of employees. This is also dened in the management of health and safety at work regu lations 1999, which identify situations where health and safety training is important when people start work, on exposure to new or increased risks and where existing skills may have become rusty or need updating5. Providing eective health and safety training will notjust mean you are meeting legal duties to protectemployees but will ensure people know how to work safely and without risks to health. This will impact on the safety culture providing a positive working environment where health and safety practices canbecome second nature ocerInstitution of Occupational Safety and Health (IOSH) www.iosh.co.ukThe actual origin of the term Behaviour Based Safety (BBS) is variously attributed to a number of psychologists. What is clear is that several people were working in the field of understanding the rela- tionship between risk taking behav- iours linked to accidents from the 1970's onwards. Their work built on the publications of Heinrich1and Lewin2 as far back as the 1930's. There was a flurry of publications in the mid to late 1990's by several key names in the field in the USA3-6. Simultaneously the original research on Behavioural Safety, in the UK was undertaken at UMIST in the 1990's by a team including Profes- sor Dominic Cooper, Dr Tim Marsh and others. Dr Marsh founded Ryder Marsh Safety Limited in 1997 and the company has become established as a leader in the field in the UK with implementations worldwide. 1990-2005 Initially the most common question encountered was simply \"What is it?\" A brief explanation that it identifies the motivation for risk taking and suggests changes to the working environment to change behaviours; or that it was about the psychology of industrial safety would usually be a good start. 2005-2010 Whilst a small number of professional practitioners developed a body of good practice and BBS gained popularity the term was often adopted and mis- applied by others to any and everyattempt to enforce rules without any understanding of the underlying science and psychology. When imple- mented in the style of \"I've told you the rules, now BEHAVE!\" it just reinforces outmoded management styles and creates or perpetuates a blame culture. Quite rightly the unions in the US and UK condemned poorly implemented BBS initiatives and Unite lead a campaign under the banner \"Beware Behavioural Safety\"7. 2008-2014 Perhaps as a result of this or maybe just out of a desire to adopt best practice from about 2008 onwards, as organisations had either implemented some form of BBS or at least consid- ered an implementation the more common question became \"How do we do BBS well?\" There was a great deal of interest in benchmarking and comparing initiatives evident both in dialogue with our customers and papers being presented at relevant conferences. In many ways, of course, this evolution follows a similar pattern to the way Quality Systems and \"classic\" health and safety management systems emerged and matured in the latter decades of the 20th Century. A well designed BBS implementation embraces the principles laid out in the core literature in the references. That is, it's based on scientific principles of data collection, analysis, hypothesis/design of change, implementation of change to environment or procedures, Behavioural Safety Past, Present & Future Paul Bizzell, Operations Director at Ryder Marsh Safety Limited, explains the background to Behavioural Safety and briefs on current thinking about Safety Culture... collecting new data and testing that the designed solution actually works (all of which needs to be done with proper engagement and input from the workforce in an environment that is seen as fair and consistent). The guiding principle when implementing a good BBS system is to remember that if you can make the safe way easyfor the person doing the work then why would anyone not do it that way? Contrast that with the traditional approach to compliance which identi- fies a risk and then imposes \"control measures\" that often impose an addi- tional burden of effort, training, con-centration and time. 2014 onwards In the last couple of years, again pos- sibly in the light of the adverse press generated by poorly designed andheavy handed implementations, the emerging question is very much\"What comes after BBS?\" The answer is a more holistic approach covering the all elements of a safety culture rather than just behaviour. This approach, Cultural Safety, addresses the four main components of a Safety Culture. They are Beliefs, Behaviours/Rituals, Language and Artefacts/equipment. Sociologists and Anthropologists would say that any significant difference in any single area indicates a different culture. The advantage of taking a cultural approach is that as well as the 200PROFILEbehaviours (Rituals) we also look at the things that have the most signifi- cant effect on behaviours so we are dealing with root causes and not just symptoms. Once established, a cul- tural solution will be much more deeply embedded and long lastingwhilst many changes to behaviour can be quite temporary and revert once ashort-term stimulus ends. There are established tools to assess the relative strength and development of each element. By undertaking a Safety Culture survey an individual organisation's relative strengths and weaknesses can be established and a programme developed to bolster the least developed. Rather than simply focussing on worker behaviour this often shows up fundamental weak- nesses in areas such as Leadership &management, values, processes, con- tract terms and other systemic flawswhich left unaddressed create mas- sive inefficiencies in an organisation never mind the risks to safety. Since many of the tools used in the data collection, analysis and change management parts of a Cultural Safety implementation are also used in other process improvement methodologies it is often possible to align with initiatives traditionally aimed solely at efficiency, such as Lean and Six Sigma, which leverages previous investments. The advantage of approaching process improve- ment from the Cultural Safety angle is that making processes safe and easy at the same time both reduces risk and improves productivity. Current thinking on safety culture is best summed up in the recently publishedbook by Dr Tim Marsh 8. 1 Heinrich, H. W. (1931). Industrial accident prevention: a scientific approach.

(2014) Total Safety Culture: Organisational Risk literacy Ryder Marsh Safety Limited Author: Paul Bizzell, Operations Director. Ryder Marsh Safety Limited 201PROFILEAlmost 7 million EU workers experience an accident every year, costing families, employers, governments and societies a staggering \u20ac55bn or more. The solution to the problem is not more management and process - it is leadership and culture. Effective safety leadership is known to strengthen safety culture and deliver financial benefits. It positively impacts employees' safety behaviour and attitudes, reduces injury rates, reduces insurance premiums, and increasesproductivity by eliminating production bottlenecks. Organisations that are good at managing safety also tend to manage operations well - in other words, operational and safety excel- lence go hand-in-hand. Safety leadership is characterised as \"the process of defining the desired state - setting up the team to succeed, and engaging in the discretionary efforts that drive the safety value\". In practice, this results in executive leadership teams deciding what safety excellence means, and what it looks and feels like; developing, resourcing and implementing end-to-end plansto achieve success; and all leaders consistently displaying their commit- ment to achieving safety excellence. Ineffective safety leadership is known to be a major contributor to work- place incidents. Primarily, ineffective safety leadership stems from confu- sion about the organisations' safetymanagement systems and associated policies. This means leaders do not know their responsibilities, or how much authority they have to fix things. To overcome such problems, it makes sense to clar ify and define the desired safety leadership behaviours, and develop a 'Competency Matrix' linked to the elements in the safety manage- ment system. Following-up with high quality education ensures all leaders are informed about the organisations safety management expectations. Pro- viding leadership training workshops also helps leaders to competently demonstrate the desired behaviours, and ongoing organisational support enables each leader's success. Leadership approaches Although different people tend to prefer one leadership approach over others, these should be adapted to suit the demands of the situation, the requirements of the people involved, and the challenges facing the organi- sation. There is, therefore, a time and place for leaders to use different approaches, with none being good or bad. It's how they are used that determines success or failure: Good leadership is much more about meet- ing follower's needs to ensure their success, than satisfying the leader's needs. The main leadership approaches are transformational, transactionaland servant. Transformational leaders shape the culture of an organisation by visualis-Strengthening Safety Leadership 202ing, describing, and directing people's efforts. They know where they want to get to and can describe a compelling vision of the future that motivates others to action. They describe the conditions necessary for success and encourage employee participation to achieve collective goals. Using positive language to sell the benefits, they try to connect their follower's sense of identity with the organisation's vision to provide real hope for a better future by promoting a 'can-do' attitude . Challenging and questioning prevail- ing assumptions, they constantly seekto drive change and move people beyond their own limitations. When talking to others, they include at least one question that causes people to think about safety in a new way (e.g. why is safety important to you?). This style of leadership is about driving change. Transactional leaders embed the cul-ture into the organisation by clarifying relationships between performance requirements and desired outcomes.They consider followers to be fully responsible for their work, and use performance monitoring with conse- quence management (e.g. praise, coaching, providing support, etc.) to reinforce people's behaviour. This style of leadership is about helping to ensure compliance to safety rules and regulations. Servant leaders sustain cultural change by building personal relationships and conveying support to individualsPROFILEthrough open 2-way communication, coaching, and unleashing people's potential. In turn, this helps to create a supportive environment which increases employee engagement that in turn positively affects team performance. This style of leadership is about setting people up for success by facilitating employee needs. Evidence-based research shows that transformational and transactional safety leadership styles moderately influence employee engagement and people's safety behaviour, which in turn reduces incident rates. Servant leadership, on the other hand, creates a supportive environment, which exerts a much stronger positive influence on employee engagement, safety behaviour, and incident reduction. Reducing known hazards Unfortunately, the presence of known, uncontrolled physical hazards and risks suppresses the impact of all three safety leadership approaches. They neutralise supportive environments, decrease employee engagement, and increase unsafe behaviour, resulting in higher incident rates. This is best explained by employee scepticism about leadership's true commitmentto safety. When known uncontrolled hazards and risks are present, employees struggle to believe leader- ship is sincere. People then withdraw from the safety process and behave more unsafely. If leadership is to make a difference, therefore, it is vital that known hazards and risks be eliminated or reduced to as low as reasonably practicable (ALARP). Facilitating this means providing a supportive environment and suffi- cient resources for individual leaders to ensure they have the means to maximise the impact of their efforts. Known hazards and risks left in an uncontrolled state are often the result of the 'last mile' problem, where inten- tions are not converted into action due to time and/or budget issues, a lack of an efficient system for addressing them, and/or an unwilling- ness to put effort into resolving them. An effective leader will constantly challenge the 'status quo' and ask basic questions about what is stop- ping the issue(s) from being resolved, and driving any corrective actions. He/she will also keep people informed about the proposed solution(s), progress on completion, and the results of any evaluations once implemented.Dr Dominic Cooper summary, effective safety leadership adds to the bottom-line in so many ways that organisations would be foolish not to implement an efficient safety leadership initiative. Successful safety leadership strategies deployed by BSMS that have reduced incidentsby an average 35% include executive leadership coaching, workshops, train-ing and cloud-based leadership software. Reducing high risk levels presented by known hazards also leads to much higher compliance with safety, and significantly boosts the impact of leadership on performance. In turn, employers, governments and societies can reap the benefits of lower incident rates and an improved safety culture, as well as achieving spill-over benefits in quality, produc- tivity, asset integrity, and cost-savings. PROFILE Dr CPsychol, CEOFrom leaders to leadership Ksenia Zheltoukhova, Research Adviser at the CIPD - the professional body for HR and people development, discusses whether leadership skills are utilised enough... Leadership is often viewed as a business holy grail, engaging people and, ultimately, contributing to greater productivity. But, have organisations been looking for leadership in the wrong places? In a recent CIPD survey,1we raised a number of important challenges to the current approaches to leadership and management development in the UK. We wondered, for example, why 72% of organisations are concerned with a decit of management and lead ership skills, although 66% of them provide some form of training for managers. Our research showed that gaps in the quality of training provide only part of the answer; in addition many managers conrm that they are simply not able to apply their skills in the organisational context. Leadership skills are, therefore, rarely utilised in full, undermining the investment of the training spend.Too often leadership development programmes sit rmly at the individual level, formulating a 'recipe' for an eective leader (driven to deliver, empathetic, engaging, a future executive, and so on). Although valid for growing individual capability, this approach misses an important consideration of what happens to those individuals when they leave the classroom and face the organisational reality, where everyone plays by the old rules. Hierarchy and bureaucracy are characteristic of many organisational structures, particularly as a way of managing risk and assigning accountability. Counter- intuitively, a top-down decision-making approach is sometimes cited as a response to the increasing pace of change in the world of work, as it ensures that theentire organisation is singing from the same hymnsheet. In the long run though, lack of empowermentHuman Resources 204Human Resources results in the lack of buy-in and leadership behaviours among middle managers and the front line. \"'oo often leadership development programmes sit firmly at the individual level, formulating a 'recipe' for an eective leader (driven to deliver, empathetic,engaging, a future executive, and so on). Although valid for growing individual capability, this approach misses an important consideration of what happens to those individuals when they leave theclassroom and face the organisational reality, where everyone plays by the old rules. \" Short-term, bottom-line focus and individualism are linked to the focus of reward and performance management processes on individual task-related objectives, as the only measurable indicator of success. There is an implicit - and often unwanted - incentive for managers and employees to adopt ahands-on approach and forego teamwork in order to retain control over the delivery of outcomes to adeadline. At a larger scale short-termism contributes to conflict of priorities between siloed departments. 'Us' and 'them' mentality reflects an inability of organi- sational processes and systems to embrace diversity and allow for more than one 'right' way of working.In a bid to ensure consistency of approach to all sta, some organisations have created overly-prescriptivepolicies. These policies can restrict the ability of individual leaders to apply discretion and do the rightthing for the customer or a fellow employee, taking into consideration the specic circumstances. Of course, the leaders themselves are expected to be driving organisational change. However, being impacted by the organisational system, they are often confused by the contradictions of their own interests, the organisational goals, and the needs of their teams. Research shows that, employees often feared that challenging leadership behaviours would be 'career-limiting' in an organisational environment, where oering an alternative opinion is equalled to being disruptive. The world of work has already experienced one lead ership revolution, where it has increasingly been acknowledged that individuals at all levels of an organisation can be leaders. Even employees at the front line, particularly those in the customer-centric roles, are likely to face situations where they need tomake leader-like decisions on behalf of the business, often without time to consult up the organisational hierarchy. The next leadership revolution for businesses is raising leadership development to the organisational level. While training of individual managers is crucial to grow the talent capacity and productivity in abusi ness, it must be complemented by organisational design and development, ensuring that the organisa- tional design, job roles and performance management systems are enabling leadership to development (0)20 8612 6200www.cipd.co.uk 205 wa y in Buckinghamshire Buckinghamshire Country Council details how it is recruiting leaders of tomorrow and its success in training and retraining sta... Alison Bulman is living proof that Buckinghamshire County Council acts on its proud declaration that it is passionate about recruiting the 'Lead ers of Tomorrow'. For she is now a key member of the Council's senior management team, 13 years and 7 jobs later afterjoining the authority as a homecare supervisor. Welsh-born Alison drives each day to Aylesbury from her home in Portsmouth - setting o at 6am. But the epic round-trip of almost 200 miles does nothing to diminish her enthusiasm for her job as Service Director (Service Provision) in Adults & Family Wellbeing. \"I started at the Council in 2001 and love working here. I really feel part of the Bucks family that has turnedthings around in terms of social care,\" she said. \"What's interesting is that when I rst joined the coun- cil, we were named and shamed as a failing authority.Now, we're surpassing national performance statistics for adult social care and we have other authorities coming to us for advice and guidance. That speaks vol- umes, because we're obviously doing something right.\" Alison, 37, who previously worked for the private care sector in Swansea, says she originally joined the Council as a 'bit of a side-step' to support her husband'scareer move. \"Since then I've had seven different roles as the Council has looked to play to my strengths and support me in my career progression,\" she said. \"Where possible we look to support, develop and progress from within. But that doesn't mean we're not looking for people from outside to help us continue in the work we're doing. We're always looking for people with the right skills who are keen to join a council thatembraces those who have a passion and enthusiasmfor what we're trying to achieve.\"Human Resources 206Human Resources Alison says she was initially 'apprehensive' when she was asked to cover the role of service director in 2012. \"It was a huge challenge for me,\" said. \"However, I soon settled in to the role and now thrive on the challenges the job presents on a daily basis. \"To secure the job permanently I had to go through anextremely rigorous selection process and was thrilled when I was told I was successful. That's mainly because I was keen to carry on and build on what wehad already achieved within the service. I'm extremely proud to work for Buckinghamshire County Council, a pride that I don't think many people get to experience about their work anymore.\" Her rise to the top echoes the words of Council Leader Martin Tett who has spoken repeatedly of his desire to recruit the 'Leaders of Tomorrow'. In an article in Adjacent Government in February,Mr Tett told why, despite 'tough times' and the need to make millions of pounds in savings, he continues to champion a project to invest in graduate trainees. This year, Buckinghamshire County Council has recruited 6 high-calibre trainees in a scheme that will cost \u00a3300,000 over 2 years.\"I believe investing in youth is worth every penny and is something that, quite frankly, other councils should be also doing. We will be rotating all of the trainees around the organisation to build their skills andexpe rience,\" he said. Mr Tett went even further than this after the articlewas written to show his faith in his apprentices. When Buckinghamshire was shortlisted for the Best Achieving Council in a national awards contest, he was asked to make a presentation to a panel of judges. He broke with the norm and threw caution to the wind by asking graduate trainee Audrey Marshall to attend and introduce the presentation on behalf of the Council. \"I wanted to show the judges that Buckinghamshire trusts its junior sta, and Audrey repaid my faith by wowing the panel with a brilliant introduction that set the scene for me and our Chief Executive to expand upon.\" His faith in youth was further vindicated when the Council was Highly Commended in the awards at the end of June, a clear sign that his graduate traineehad impressed the judges. He added: \"I think Alison Bulman's success and longevity here shows just how important training andretaining our own sta is. If we get it right, there will be many more senior managers in the future with a similar career progression to her.\" To find out more about jobs within Buckinghamshire Director in Adults& Family WellbeingSMEs in international trade: get rid of red tape Jan Eggert, Director-General of the Foreign Trade Association (FTA), underlines the value of SME's for economic and social development in Europe... Overall, global trade grew signicantly over the last decades, triggered by unprecedented waves of liberalisation of trade rules and the use of innovative technologies. The process of globalisation helped to bridge physical distances and provided an ideal breeding ground for long-term growth and increase of welfare. In this context, many large companies rolled-out internationalisation strate gies to respond to the challenge of growing global competition and to access new markets. Small and medium-sized enterprises (SME) have evidently also taken part in this development and are actively looking to secure their share of the cake. This is particularly true in the retail sector which is increasingly relying on global value chains and imports of consumer goods from all around the world . SMEs play a crucial role in operating this complex supply chain, including all relevant steps from product development and manufacturing to sales, marketing and retailing. Long-established expertise of interna- tional markets and solid business networks built over time and on trust are the trademarks of many of these smaller trading companies. However, the situation for SMEs, often a family-run business, is far from perfect. An important number of trade obstacles still limit the ability of these companiesto unleash their full potential and achieve a higher level of integration into the world market. In many aspects, they are disadvantaged in comparison to multinational enterprises. The main reason very simply lies in the nature of SMEs - their size. For decades, cross-border trade was strongly hampered by obstacles such as taris and quotas, a costly but relatively stable and transparent system to cope with. Today, realities are far more complex and the sharp rise of technical barriers, like product quality require ments, employment law, licence regimes and packaging condi tions, is a serious impediment to global trade. In other words, to trade internationally it is increasingly important to develop a high level of understanding of technical regulations and to invest substantial resources in complying with these rules. Given their size and limited means, SMEs are particularly vulnerable to the eects of red tape and the opaque tangle of legislation impacting trade in goods. A few examples, referring to both developing countries and the EU, illustrate these challenges. Vietnamese legislation narrowly denes and frames the conditions for employing foreigners with the objective to substitute foreign sta by domestic personnel. Recent legislative changes limited the duration of work permits for foreigners to 24 months. In this context, SMEs have to compete with western multinationals - often a lostFinance and Growth 208Finance and Growth cause - for trained labour in a country with shortage of skilled workers. Investment protection legislation in China does not yet correspond to international standards. Ordinary and investment legislation is characterised by structural shortcomings and current arbitration mechanisms have proven to be inecient and time-consuming. It goes without saying thatsmaller companies, with little nancial resources and less economic weight, will be particularly reluctant todefend their legitimate case under these conditions. Looking at the EU, the increasing array of highly tech nical legislation, such as REACH, the Biocides regulation and the timber regulation, threatens to overburden SMEs. Despite goods intentions, many of these legislative projects voted in recent years created detrimental eects on business while only generating limited improvements for consumers and the environment. In the eld of customs, the economic reality of global supply chains should lead to a net simplication of EU rules of origin. However, the current system, which is characterised by a high level of com plexity, remains burdensome and time-consuming leaving it to economic operators to not lose track of the latest developments. What is the solution? Obviously we cannot expect SMEs to change in nature. Therefore, it must be the explicit duty of the legislator and administrations to shape a trade environment suitable for smaller enter prises. There are 3 elements that are central pillars in real ising this objective. Firstly, the EU trade policy should systematically incor porate SME specic targets, instruments and cooperation platforms, all designed to respond to the very needs of SMEs. The discussion within the transatlantic trade partnership (TTIP) of including achapter dedicated to SME issues points the right way. Secondly, European legislation on product safety and environmental protection should nd the right balance between improving protection and avoiding - disproportionately - strong burdens and costs for companies. Every legislative measure should be assessed on its impact on the capacity of smaller enterprises to trade internationally, and thus gobeyond the current analysis of eects on the internal market only. Thirdly, the EU should work hard for improving busi ness conditions for SMEs at the international level. The World Trade Organization (WTO) is theideal stage to promote and impose a simplied and harmonised trade rulebook. Strong emphasis has also to be given to preferential trade agreements and regulatory cooperation to help developing countries remove technical barriers. SME's are the backbone of economic and social devel opment in Europe. In this respect, the increasing internationalisation of them will undoubtedly promote domestic growth and foster the competitive position of the European economy. Consequently, the current EU policy term 2014-19 should giveSMEs a strong helping hand and keep pace with the transforming business realities.

New technologies, new products, new services and whole new industries have emerged. Yet the call for innovation in business has never been more intense. It is a hugely challenging and competitive time forbusinesses, so what is Ireland doing in this space? Enterprise Ireland is the Irish government agency charged with developing and promoting Irish enter- prise. It partners with entrepreneurs, businesses, and the research and investment communities to develop Ireland's international trade, innovation, leadership and competitiveness. The ultimate objectives areincreased exports, employment and prosperity in Ire- land. Enterprise Ireland is also the agency responsible for helping Irish companies and researchers to partici- pate in the EU's 7th Framework Programme (FP7). The key research and innovation priority for Ireland's Presidency of the European Council 2013 has been toachieve political agreement on all the measures within Horizon 2020 (2014-20), the EU programme forresearch and innovation, and successor to FP7. Hori-zon 2020 can play a decisive role in helping to create jobs, growth and the European economy of the future. The programme seeks to secure major invest-ment in key technologies, bridging the gap between research and the market, and promoting real com- mercial partnerships between member states and the private sector. Linking in with other EU programmes,it aims to increase participation by SME's from 15% to 20% in Horizon 2020. SMEs have in recent years proved themselves to be the engines of economic growth and the principle sources of new employment. They are the backbone of the Irish economy and key contributors to growth and employment. SMEs make up over 99% of busi- nesses in the enterprise economy in Ireland andaccount for almost 70% of people employed. 210 Getting Ireland innovatingFinance and GrowthTheir ability to exploit new technologies, and to respond quickly to changing market needs, gives SMEs a pivotal role in the success of the Irish econ-omy. Support for the creation of new ventures and spin-os from research institutions and large compa- nies, as well as the removal of barriers to their rapidgrowth and support for the transfer of know-how, also deserve to be aorded the highest priority. Enterprise Ireland's client companies achieved recordlevels of exports in 2012. Total export gures, at \u20ac16.2bn, were the highest ever annual export gain achieved by Enterprise Ireland clients. Driving this isresearch and innovation; for many of our client com- panies, science and technology is what they are all about - it's in their DNA. For others, innovation is a tool they will employ more strategically, for example, for new product development, to make manufactur- ing or business processes more ecient or to respond to disruptive waves.This is why innovation is at the heart of everything Enterprise Ireland does - providing nancial incen- tives from \u20ac5,000 Innovation Vouchers to suit asmaller company beginning their journey on the road of innovation, right through to support for major R&D projects from larger companies, involving investment in the million-plus category.

Boosting economic growth in our cities is the only route to building a strong and sustainablerecovery for the UK as a whole. The UK's 64 biggest cities - ranging from London to Hastings - occupy just 9% of the UK's land, but by being hometo over half of all businesses and 3 quarters of high skilled jobs, make an enormous contribution to the national economy. The performance of the UK's cities is mixed, with some, such as Brighton, Reading and Milton Keynes, being star performers. Others, including the majority of our largest cities, trail the national average on a number of key indicators. The fact they are punching below their weight is bad for the people who live there, and for the national economy. While London continues to stand out on the international stage, we need more high-performing, large-scale cities to drive longer-term growth all across the country.The scope for cities to improve their economic fortunes is made more dicult because of the over-centralised nature of the UK (and English, in particular) state. With Westminster holding onto the lion's share of funding and powers, UK cities often lack the capacity to respond to the opportunities and challenges that they face, compared to their international counterparts. Giving UK cities the scale, authority and fundingneeded to improve their economies and quality of life should be central to any credible plan to increase national prosperity. There are many ways in which UK cities, with the right tools and flexibility, can improve their performance, including: connecting rms, workers, suppliers and customers with good transport and telecommunications links; providing a pleasant and attractive public realm; making sure workers' skills match those of the local labour market; and, enabling the expansion ofresidential and commercial property supply in response to increased demand. For city leaders across the globe, delivering policies that address these and other issues is simply 'business as usual'. But in the UK, while city leaders can see the problems and opportunities they face every day, they don'thave the levers of power or funding at their disposal in order to solve them. In recent years, City Deals, and now Local Growth Deals, have started the UK down the path to addressing this problem. Greater Manchester's flagship 'Earnback'City Deal, in particular, oers an opportunity for the city to connect the virtuous circle of investing, and reaping and reinvesting the proceeds of successful city economic investment. By using the nancial and economic gains from improving its transport system, the city will be able to, for example, provide training and apprenticeships for young people, which will further boost future tax revenues and reduce welfare expenditure. The New Development Deals in Newcastle, Sheeld and Nottingham should also give these cities the freedom to invest in critical infrastructure using tax increment nancing, and enable them to borrow against future business rate income in key develop- ment zones. However these cities remain exceptions to the rule.Despite the signicant progress of City and Local Growth Deals, there's still a long way to go before UK cities can claim to have real autonomy over the policy levers that aect their local economies. The good news is that all 3 of the major parties appear to recognise the importance and urgency of the situation, which is why we have seen so many recent announce-ments from all sides of politics promising greater devolution. Over the past few weeks, George Osborne, Nick Clegg and Ed Miliband have all conceded that our cities don't have the tools they need to build stronger local economies, by capitalising on their strengths and addressing their weaknesses. This emerging political consensus about the need to revitalise city economies across the country is very welcome. The challenge for the political parties is to set out how this can be achieved, and what a more decentralised system of government would look like. At the very least, a more devolved system would provide cities with the opportunity to introduce a democratically accountable Metro Mayor, the powers and funds to take the big decisions on jobs andgrowth at the level of the real economy, and introduce a London-style integrated transport system, capableof supporting more people to access jobs, shops andservices. Each of these initiatives would need to be enabled through giving cities greater scal and nan cial freedoms and incentives relating to council tax, business rates and other local revenue streams. Cities in the UK, like they do in other countries across the world, could do so much more to drive national prosperity. They just need to be given the opportunity by Whitehall to full www.centreforcities.orgwww.twitter.com/CentreforCities Andrew CarterHead of Research Finance and Growth 214215PROFILE For those involved at a strategic level in economic development, placemaking as a tool is not new but its time is certainly now in view of the significant transformation towards a knowledge based economy which is taking place. The most important component of this transformation is a much greater reliance on intellectual capital and its application based on significant advances in communica- tion and other technologies and the management of data. The importance of placemaking is that it plays a much more significant role in current deci- sions affecting economic development than ever before. As investment and people are now more mobile than ever before so does the consideration of the quality of a place become much more important. Quality places retain and attract skilled and talented people. Talented people like places with natural, community, social, leisure, creative and cultural activities for themselves and their families and therefore, combining this with effective professional networks, access to resources and opportunities is even more attractive to the entre- preneur inclined to exploit intellectualcapital. Investment decisions are made by people in terms of their time,talent or money based upon an assessment of the anticipated benefit or return. Investment decisions are also made by institutions and businessesaccording to their own interests andbalance sheet objectives but even these interests are increasingly being directly influenced by place. \"It is crucial that support is provided to create the right environment for entrepre- neurship and technology transfer and to retain and attract talent to those smaller and medium sized places which can offer as much of a complete if not more affordable package to secure growth in investment and employment...\" Determining what a place based strategy should focus on starts with identifying what key assets, services and growth opportunities does thelocation provide which shape day to day life and economic opportunities. There is a series of challenging ques- tions to be answered - are the basic and hopefully higher level elements of living, working and developing the community firmly established? Arethe various forms of infrastructure adequate or a real factor in supporting a competitive commercial environment? Is there evidence of an enviable com-parable quality of life to recognisedsuccessful locations? If not then why would someone consider investing their time, knowledge and expertise or money (including persuading others) in your location with the associated risks connected with each of theEconomic Development It's about placemaking shortcomings? Why would anyone wish to invest in a place that cannot demonstrate a will to invest in itself? Charles Landry emphasises the importance of place to the economy, where places need to be \"distinctive\", have a recognisable \"variety\" of people, business, culture, buildings and \"flow\" where people can choose their own pace and path. The physical and cultural characteristics of the place are most clearly linked to the attraction of talent, business and investment. The principles and benefits are not complicated but the execution of an effective place based approach has inherent challenges in view of the complexity necessary. In terms of the knowledge economy, are smaller and medium sized cities better placed to rise to these challenges? There are key characteristics which are so similar to the \"Ideopolis\" concept promulgated over the last decade in that ideally an economically successful city based economy comprises of the following aspects: high levels of economic success and knowledge based activity; a diverse industry base including distinctive specialist niches; one or more high level research and education based institutions that havea mutually beneficial relationship with businesses; strong communications infrastructure; a variety of good transport links with and to other cities with multi-modal options; public and private sector institutions working together; strategies to ensure all communities benefit from the economic success. \"For those involved at a strategic level in economic development, placemakingas a tool is not new but its time is certainly now in view of the significant transfor- mation towards a knowledge based economy which is taking place.\" To illustrate this discussion, the wider Exeter economy has much of this approach established. Its economic performance pre-, during and the signs post recession are of a place making approach with credible examples of success. Some aspects are in need of further investment and its most recently approved economic development strategy certainly embraces this approach as funda- mental to making its transition to a knowledge economy. Following this approach has resulted in independent studies identifying the city as out- performing larger cities within the UK and confirms its beneficial regional economic impact. The creation of high value employment opportunities, attracting and retaining highly skilled workers and graduates and capitalising on existing strengths and assets areespecially important as the city con- tinuesto strengthen its economy. Encouragingly, Exeter is outperform- ing the South West and England in terms of the % increase in qualifica- tions amongst workers in the area over the last 10 years. There are key drivers to establishing a successful knowledge economy inex-tricably linked to place making which the new economic development strategy for Exeter is based upon: creating the physical requirements - having the architecture and accom- modation that businesses and workers require; building on what's there - recognising the city's existing strengths and weaknesses and playing to these; 'smart specialisation' - focussing on the range of economic specialismsfor which there are credible oppor-tunities, particularly in sectors related to big data, climate change mitigation, health, water science andagri-tech; attracting and retaining high skill organisations - organisations that rely on productivity through high quality jobs and highly skilled people; an acclaimed education sector - linking closely with the city and businesses; distinctive 'knowledge city' offer - for businesses and people who are considering investing, working and living in the city, supported by a diverse cultural offer; maintaining and improving strongRichard Ball Assistant Director Economy Exeter City Council richard.ball@exeter.gov.uk www.exeter.gov.ukconnectivity within and outside the city economic area with major economic hubs; strong leadership - around an economic vision supported by proac- tivenetworks and partnerships; a business friendly and pro-growth local administration. It is crucial that support is provided to create the right environment for entrepreneurship and technology transfer and to retain and attract talent to those smaller and medium sized places which can offer as much of a complete if not more affordable package to secure growth in invest- ment and employment away from the massive metropolitan areas. It's not about spreading the jam thinly but focussing on the value for money return such locations really do offer. Just maybe the more localised approach through the LEPs will enable this to happen.

The London Pensions Fund Authority (LPFA) is one of the largest in the UK, providing pension fund benets to around 55,000 employees and pensioners in the Greater London area. The fund hasa value of \u00a34.8bn and works with 23 authorities in total, sharing expertise and providing a range of pension administration, communication and payroll services. In January, Susan Martin, who has 20 years' experience in senior management roles, was announced as the new CEO of the LPFA. Martin has been with the LPFA since 2007, and has a vast amount of knowledge in pensions, mergers, organisational change and acquisitions across private and public sectors. Here, she speaks to Editor Laura Evans about what shehopes to achieve in her new role. \"I am very keen to ensure that the Local Government Pension Scheme (LGPS) is a sustainable pension scheme in the future, and because of that I have been working with colleagues to promote the concept ofasset and liability management (ALM)\". She explains that it's \"Not just looking at the assets, but also looking at your liabilities and making sure you understand them. Knowing what you need from your assets ensures you have the cash to pay pensions when they are due.\" Martin has been quoted as saying 'we've got people now saving for a pension that we'll be paying in the next century,' and believes that it is important to think long-term with regard to strategies, rather than just what's happening now. The 89 LGPS funds are facing a combined \u00a350bn decit and Martin believes the way to tackle this isthrough partnership between individual funds \"We had a 20 year target when we began our strategy. We look at the long term view of both asset and our liability management. Moving to ALM Partnerships is a way for organisations to voluntarily come together to pool their assets and to access the benets of liability-driven investment,\" Martin says. \"Having the right people at the right time in the right role is important, as is achieving the vision of making sure we have a sustainable long term pension fund as a responsible investor of public sector money. Working in partnership with other funds can also create a UK citizens wealth fund that is then invested to ensure the UK economy is competing with thebest in the world.\" In response to the government's recent consultationon the future of the LGPS, LPFA has put forward a detailed proposal for voluntary ALM Partnerships. Pooling resources and investment allocation decisions whilst retaining strong local accountability could drive savings and access to asset classes which better match scheme liabilities - something which Martin is keen to see happen. \"ALM Partnerships would build on the collective investment vehicle approach but do not constitute merged funds. The partnerships would see funds coming together for asset and liability manage- ment, but the historic liability would remain the responsibility of the originating pension fund. The partnership would however, take the role of determining what cash flow is required so we can then determine the asset allocation strategy.\" she explains. \"The partnerships would include the understanding and management of the data and the liability. In addition, they would examine the assets and take that longterm view ensuring we are in a position to invest to match these liabilities. ALM Partnerships would bring together people from all partner funds who haveexperience in running pension funds and managing investments in-house. They would be governed by a joint committee which could be made up of nominees from each fund which joins the partnership. This approach would enable all LGPS funds to invest in assets that smaller funds are not normally able to access. \"I am very keen to ensure that the Local Government Pension Scheme (LGPS) is a sustainable pension scheme in the future, and because of that I have been workingwith colleagues to promote the concept of asset and liability management (ALM).\" \"We would be managing the investments directly or in a co-investment, meaning more emphasis on liquid assets, good equity management and hedging liabilities to address the impact of interest rates and inflation.\" Knowing what investments to make and where your liabilities lie is vital, but ensuring the investments are made responsibly can add to the pressure. Martinbelieves that liability management is an important factor to take into consideration when investing otherpeople's money. \"It's about looking at your liabilities and looking at what cash you need, understanding the market, and having a flexible asset allocation that allows you to invest in dierent asset classes,\" she explains. \"By and large, if you're investing through other people, you need to have good negotiation skills to get the fees down and to manage their performance eectively. It is important to really engage with partners and nd out what they are doing with your money on your behalf.\"It's about ensuring that you don't just claim our asset allocation is 'X' in this portfolio and 'Y' in that, you need broad benchmarks that have the flexibility to exploit opportunities if markets are changing. It's important to be aware of inflation and interest rate risks and ensure you are protecting an element of your fund by hedging.\" With LPFA reporting fund growth of \u00a3480m in 2012-13, Martin suggests that people should not look at the headlines, but look beneath them at whether your liabilities have grown. \"Even though a fund reported growth, it is not necessarily good news if your liability has grown more,\" Martin explains. \"We topped the LGPS chart in reducing our liabilities last year, so we've reduced our decit by \u00a3387mbetween 2010-2013. For us it's not just about asset growth, it's about making sure we are able to meetour liabilities.\" Despite successful recent years, there are still challenges ahead for the pension fund, with new schemes that require embedding and new legislation to take into consideration. However, Martin is condent that moving forward with ALM Partnerships is a key element of future success for the LGPS as a whole. \"We still have more work to conclude on ALM, and we're not sitting still on that because it's a key part of our beliefs in our business. Moving forward on ALMPartnerships is a key aspect for us as is governance, understanding your business and working in collaboration 7369 6118 enquiries@lpfa.org.ukwww.lpfa.org.ukFinance and Growth 218Finance and Growth 219 Reducing procurement costs across the NHS The e-Procurement strategy will signicantly reduce costs and help NHS trusts work more eciently, explains Chris Doyle, Industry Marketing Manager for Healthcare at GS1 UK... The way the NHS manages its annual \u00a330bn of non-pay spend is a topic never far from the headlines. The NHS possesses the greatest purchasing power of any business in the UK, but the way in which it manages it's spend is inecient. It is estimated that trusts can save \u00a31.5bn by the end of 2015-16 through taking a cohesive approach to procurement based on global standards, national infrastructure and local delivery. The Department for Health's recently published e-Procurement Strategy set out what trusts must doto achieve this. Introducing this scale of change obviously brings chal- lenges, but precedents exist in the global healthcare sector and the UK's banking, manufacturing and retail sectors through the way in which they have utilised technology to revolutionise their business operations. Some of the changes introduced by the strategy aredetailed below. NHS GS1 Datapool Master data relating to the things NHS procures lies at the core of the strategy. Master data is dened asall the information about a product necessary to perform business transactions. A datapool is a central repository for this data which is stored and accessed in a standardised way by suppliers and buyers. The use of a datapool ensures unequivocal identication of products and provides a synchronisation capability ensuring that buyers have up-to-date information at all times. NHS PIM Solutions There are a number of datapools around the world linked by what is known as the GDSN (Global DataSynchronisation Network). In order to ensure that Trusts' product catalogues only contain the data they need, a system which interfaces with the datapool. PIM (Product Information Management) solutions willbe provided centrally by the Department for Health. NHS GLN Registry While a datapool helps to identify products and services (the 'what' of procurement), a GLN (Global Location Number) registry identies the 'where'. GLNs uniquely identify legal entities, delivery and storage locations. A registry of GLNs means that the physical location of where to deliver goods and the destination of all business messages is also unambiguous.Purchase to pay The combination of accurate master data, good catalogue management and consistent location iden- tication enables a fully automated purchase-to-pay process with little human intervention. Systems like these have been used for many years in retail environments and are estimated to save the retail industry \u00a311bn each year through error reduction, better stock availability, more accurateforecasting and myriad additional benets derived from increased visibility. Direct Patient Benets The general benets that the retail industry experiences from the use of this technology often translates fairly directly into the healthcare environment, but the true value of these systems is improved care delivery andbetter outcomes for patients. The procurement systems outlined above, when integrated into other systems, can deliver benets far beyond the purely logistical and commercial. Considered in the light of correct patient identication, Electronic Health/Patient Records (EHR) and widerhospital systems the impact on better care delivery becomes clearer. Patient Identication Parents often retain the wristband issued to their children when they were born. The light blue and pink bands featuring a midwife's neat handwriting mayprovide a sentimental reminder of a happy event, but as the basis for a rigorous and unequivocal method of patient identication they are little use. Since October 2013 it has been a required standard (NHS ISB 1077) for NHS hospitals in England to issue patients with printed wristbands bearing a GS1 DataMatrix barcode. This identication wristband can be used as the key to accessing a patient's EHR, to conrm identication before drugs are dispensed and to uniquely allocate instruments used for implants given to the patient, and is fundamental to enabling the wider benets of automated procurement systems. In addition, the NPSA has for a long time recognised the safety benets of consistent patient identication on the wristband and the positive impact this can have on a range of never events.What next? Most hospitals in England have made some progress with the adoption of GS1 standards. Many patient identication systems, surgical instrument decontami- nation systems, robotic pharmacy systems and inventory management systems rely on GS1 standards (commonly without realising it). To fully implement the new strategy each trust will be required to adopt a board-approved GS1 standards adoption plan. This plan will drive 4 main activities which can be started now: Identication of people (patients and care-givers) of places (using GS1 GLNs); Identication of things (assets in the hospital and, through supplier engagement, products supplied to the hospital); Integration of systems using GS1 as a global language. Locations and people are the best place to start; supplier engagement is the best next step and integration of systems will come with consistency in upgrading and replacing existing systems. GS1 UK have produced template plans which will be shared through the newly launched www.gs1ukinhealthcare.org website. GS1 UK will support suppliers and trusts to ensure that the e-Procurement Strategy not only delivers increased value and better care into the NHS but also enables manufacturers and suppliers to realise the supply chain and security benets of +44 (0)20 7092 3500www.gs1uk.org Finance and Growth 220www.adjacentgovernment.co.ukAdjacent Digital Politics Ltd is pleased to oer a free subscription service to all our products including our regular newsletters.

The UK has extensive and sophisticated infra- structure that has been developed over hundreds of years. Because of this, unsurprisingly, a large proportion of it is nearing the end of its projected operational lifespan. The reality however is that oureconomic infrastructure assets are very rarely decommissioned at the end of their predeterminedlifetime and must continue to perform and operate - supporting society and the economy and the changing demands placed on them through factors such as population growth. It is vital therefore, that these assets are managed properly throughout their entire lifetime and not just repaired or upgraded once a problem occurs or presents itself - as is often the case for strategic assets such as roads, rail and water systems. This reactive approach can result in major disruptionto the network, aecting society and the economy. Italso means that asset managers are often asked tolook after critical infrastructure with little available information about the asset, and, there are short-term budgetary restrictions due to the more reactive repair and upgrade culture. In these conditions there may not be sucient opportunity to assess options, let alone the longer term risks associated with the chosen strategy or the future costs associated with such a choice. A step change is needed in the way we manage our infrastructure assets through their life time. \"Asset management\" considers assets over their entire lifetime. It incorporates the comprehensive management of an asset from initial demand identication through planning and design to procurement, construction, commissioning, operation, maintenance, enhancement/ rehabilitation and nally to decommissioning, or renewal and re-commissioning, in order to optimise 222 A rob ust approa ch to as set ma nagement Infrastructure Asset ManagementInfrastructure Asset Management the whole-life return on investment from both capital and operational expenditure perspectives. Asset management principles and philosophy serve as a good basis for delivering a consistent, robust approach - and I believe should be understood and wholeheartedly implemented at all levels by organisa-tions - commissioning bodies, delivery/service providers, and professional bodies - and individuals. Our former President, Professor Barry Clarke, described asset management and its benets very succinctly: \"Asset Management creates this holistic focus, viewing our economic infrastructure over its entire lifecycle, and provides the basis for a coordinated and coherent approach. It also ensures our essential infrastructure receives appropriate investment and attention, has the appropriate resilience to meet newchallenges and can sustain our economic prosperity.\" Encouragingly, the government's National Infrastruc ture Plan appears to agree with that approach - high lighting the necessity for strong, coordinated and strategic investment in the UK's essential infrastructure. The plan aims to ensure that the most is made of any new infrastructure, and rightly also prioritises themaintenance and smarter use of existing assets. There are published techniques to assess the eciency of asset management systems adopted by individuals and organisations and compare these with existing best practice. One such tool is the PAS 55 standard, which was created by the Institute of Asset Management to provide objectivity across signicant aspects of good asset management from lifecycle strategy to everyday maintenance. It enables the integration ofall aspects of the asset lifecycle - from the rst recognition of need continuing through to design, acquisition, construction, commissioning, utilisation or operation, maintenance, renewal, modication and/or ultimate disposal. This is further emphasisedthrough the recent publication of the international standard ISO-55000. At ICE, we know we too have a role to play in developing and promoting best practice for the management ofinfrastructure assets throughout the civil engineering profession - after all it is civil engineers who, right across the world, play a pivotal part in developing, operating, and maintaining the economic infrastructure networks we use on a daily basis. Our Management Panel, a joint initiative with the Chartered Institute of Civil Engineering Surveyors (CICES) recently created the \"Guiding Principles of Asset Management\", which has been well received bythe industry. The report aims to develop the knowl- edge and understanding of the factors and processes aecting assets throughout their lifetime. It also iden ties the key principles to ensure civil infrastructure is kept at the forefront of advancement, benetting our membership, the engineering profession and thepublic as a whole. The Institution has also produced a paper entitled \"Leveraging the Relationship between BIM and Asset Management\" which importantly, explains the mutually supportive relationship between Building InformationModelling (BIM) and asset management. They should not be isolated practices, they must be consideredtogether to realise the full benets. ICE will continue its work in this area to promotebetter understanding of asset management. We will also continue to engage with the Government, indus try and other professional bodies to ensure the engineering community has the foundation necessary to develop a coordinated and strategic vision for man aging infrastructure assets within the UK and Panel Institution of Civil Engineers (ICE) Director, Asset Management at CH2M HILL Tel: +44 (0)20 7222 7722www.ice.org.uk 223With the new dynamics in the Rail Industry Asset Management has become a very important topic. The leading European Rail companies are organising themselves to cover Asset Management as an integrated part of their operations. Several as guidance use ISO 55000. This article gives the outlines why it is used. ISO 55000 is the new international standard for asset management, released in January 2014. Simply put, the essence of this standard is value realisation from your assets, which achieves the desired balance of risk, cost and performance. It will provide assurance that the right things are being done right, and that these activities support the achievement of the mission and objectives of your organisation. ISO 55000 requires that an Asset Management System (AMS) be developed and documented which is the \"Set of interrelated or interacting elements to establish asset management policy, asset management objectives and processes to achieve those objectives\". Asset Management (AM) is defined as the \"Coordinated activity of an organisation to realise value from assets\". The organisation's assets, which are within the scopeof the AMS, must be identified. The standard calls out the following benefits that organisations will achieve from adopting ISO 55000: Marcel van Velthoven is the managing director of ZNAPZ (www.znapz.com) an IBM partner that sells and supports Asset Management systems for Rail and other industries.

Leadership: ensuring that the asset management leadership is put in place by top management, the asset management policy has been defined and reviewed, and the AM leadership is given the authority, responsibility and resources to achieve the identified objectives. Planning: ensuring that risks and opportunities are identified and plans are put in place to address them and support the achievement of the organisational objectives. These integrated plans should address what will be done, when it will be done, by whom and how it will be undertaken and evaluated. These plans should address risks and opportunities and howRail and ISO 55000: An Overview they change over time achieving a balance of risk, cost and performance. Support: ensuring that competent resources required to achieve the plans are made available, the information systems are available to support the process and the information is documented, controlled, communicated and auditable. Operation: ensuring that the plans, implementations and processes are reviewed and controlled, including any activities that are outsourced, and encompasses change management activities as well. Evidence that the organisation carried out the plans and processes is required. Performance evaluation: ensuring that the asset performance and the effectiveness of the AMS is monitored, measured, analysed, evaluated and auditable. Top management should review the AMS for suitability, adequacy and effectiveness. Improvements: ensuring that non-conformities or incidents with respect to the assets, asset management or the AMS are documented and evaluated, and corrective action is taken. Asset management and the AMS should be continually improved. Asset Investment Planning and Management (AIPM) AIPM is focussed on solving the problem of how to realise the highest value from your assets while balancing cost, risk and performance. If you want assurance that the right things are being done right, and that these activities support the achievement of the mission and objectives of your organisation, then AIPM is a best practice to help you decide what are the right things to do. In the case of ISO 55000, the right things to do arethose that collectively create the most value for the corporation given the cost, risk and performance objectives. Investments must be evaluated based on how they contribute to the achievement of the corporate objectives. AIPM efficiently identifies the optimum mix and timing given a myriad of potential investments and their alternatives and any organisational constraints or timing requirements.Realising value from your assets with AIPM starts with: Bringing all the knowledge within the organisation to bear on the decision-making process in an integrated manner: what risks you are facing and how will these risks evolve over time, the opportunities that are possible, and creating a risk-informed evidence-based approach to decision making Understanding the corporation's values, defining these items explicitly and adopting them as your decision-making criteria Identifying \"the right things to do\" with your scarce resources that will deliver the highest value Efficiently create, compare and contrast multiple what-if scenarios to understand the risk, value and benefits of various investment strategies Gaining organisational buy-in through collaboration and transparency in decision-making Arriving at defensible decisions using a rigorous, consistent, repeatable and auditable process Learning all along the way, to continually improve based on: evaluating how you are doing, and how you did, with respect to the value creation you planned to achieve and the actual cost to achieve it. AIPM supports every aspect of the process above and Copperleaf's C55 is an excellent example of how to realize that today. Marcel van Velthoven Chief Executive Officer Tel: +31 402 668 636 Marcel.van.velthoven@znapz.com www.znapz.comA digital police revolution Police and Crime Commissioner for Hampshire and the Isle of Wight, Simon Hayes, gives an overview of how technology is improving police services... When appointed as Police and Crime Commissioner for Hampshire and the Isle of Wight in November 2012, Simon Hayes acknowledged the need to enable Hampshire Constabulary to fully integrate and exploit the benets of digital technology. As with all police forces, there is a very real need to continue delivering the highest quality service while facing unprecedented cuts to public services - making modernising policing a priority. The need to embrace digital technology is accelerated by criminals becoming increasingly sophisticated and innovative in their pursuit of criminality, and the pressure to evidence criminal activity and build trust in the police. Thanks to vital funding from HM Government's Police Innovation Fund, Hampshire Constabulary pilotedand rolled out the use of Body Worn Video (BWV) cameras - leading the way both nationally and inter nationally. BWV has helped gather high-quality evidence to help convict criminals; it deters anti-socialbehaviour, and is a useful tool in obtaining a visual record of occurrences like domestic abuse and public order incidents. Independent research conducted by Portsmouth University's Institute of Criminal Justice Studies has found that 90% of 1,200 people surveyed believed BWV cameras would help gather evidence, identify criminals and lead to more guilty pleas and successful prosecutions. The use of mobile data technology (MDT) reduces the time ocers spend in the station dealing with administrative tasks, as they have access to systems while on patrol. MDTs enable ocers to access vital intelligence to assist them when responding to ICT 226incidents, allowing them to deal with incidents more eciently than they would have done without that background knowledge. Electronic witness statements (EWS) from victims or witnesses of crime can be taken and authenticated at the scene through MDT. This ultimately helps to speed up the criminal justice process, especially ascourts are moving to digital case les. This has theadded benet of improving victim satisfaction. A new electronic tagging scheme is also being trialled in Hampshire with the aim to support the rehabilitation of oenders leading to a reduction in crime. Code named START (Short Term At Release Tagging) is currently being run as a one year pilot and is available to oenders given a custodial sentence of less than one year. Its ultimate aim is to change the oender's behaviour and support them through the rehabilitation process and prevent reoending. Equipping ocers with cutting edge smartphones or tablets, while complying with the necessary security standards, also provides greater flexibility and improved eciency with the ability for ocers to deliver more while 'on the move'. As the digital revolution evolves, Hampshire Constabulary is continually developing or redesigning Apps that will allow ocers to accurately and eciently complete 'stop and search' information, search internal data recording systems and the Police National Computer (PNC) to obtain the most accurate information. Simon Hayes comments: \"Investing in digital technology and innovation has a vital role to play in modernising policing. As PCC for Hampshire and the Isle of Wight, I am committed to listening to the needs of police ocers and the public, reviewing best practice internationally and nding solutions that build con dence in the police and help ocers carry out their duties to of the Police and Crime Commissioner for Hampshireopcc@hampshire.pnn.police.uk www.hampshire-pcc.org.ukwww.twitter.com/Hants PCC 227 Simon HayesPolice and Crime CommissionerICTThe needs of public safety organ- isations are evolving. Police, fire and ambulance services, as well as other public service agencies need to be more efficient and effective than ever before if they are to be successful in an environment of on-going austerity and fast-paced technological evolution. Work is already underway to address these challenges through the police-led Digital First programme, which aims to enable police officers to record evidence digitally whilst on the beat and upload evidence to their local and national systems. By digitally capturing and storing evidence at the point of reporting, officers can start to build a case file, which can later be drawn from by the Criminal Justice System (CJS). The overall aim is for the complete end-to-end Criminal Justice System to be digital and of coursemuch of this starts on the front line with our police officers. Digitisation challenge The British government estimates that the digitisation work done to date, if fully implemented, could see up to 4.5 million man-hours saved across all forces every year - the equivalent of over 2,100 officers back on the beat. It is therefore vital that new police systems, such as body-worn video cameras, tablets and touch screens used on patrol, produce evidence that is made immediately available to the CJS. However, local and national police systems were initially designed to meet specific business needs and, aside from notable exceptions such as the Police National Computer (PNC), are rarely integrated. A variety of tech-Delivering the digital policing transformation A shift to completely digital, paperless operations transforms policing and delivers cashable savings 228nologies have been employed to try and resolve some of the operational challenges by allowing information tobe passed electronically to and from the front-line. To be effective, these technologies require wireless connectivity, which can be limiting due to patchy mobile coverage and limited bandwidth. Moreover, many of the mobile appli- cations developed for PDAs and other mobile devices used by police officers are only addressing a specific process. In practice a single incident can trigger several processes meaning that multiple data needs to be captured and shared between a number of agencies. Airwave's Pronto Pronto, delivered by Airwave's wholly owned subsidiary Kelvin Connect, is adigital document and information management tool. It has been designed to significantly reduce the amount of time police officers spend in the back office, and instead allows them to spend more time in their communities. It provides officers with the tools they need to complete a range of activities in the field, rather than having to request information through a third person, or travel back to the station - the so-called 'yo-yo policing' effect. Combining seamless access to national and local databases Pronto gives officers the ability to conductPROFILE online searches in real time anywhere there is wireless connectivity, and complete all processes digitally in an asynchronous (offline) fashion when there is patchy or no wireless network coverage - mitigating the impact of poor coverage areas. Nominal information, validated from national systems such as PNC, on a vehicle, person, object or location can be shared multiple times into as many processes as required, based on what the incident is, and submitted into appropriate back-office systems. This alleviates the need for officers to rekey data or return to the station. Pronto is device agnostic and works on a number of platforms. This alone gives forces the flexibility to use exist- ing technology without the need to purchase new devices. It includes a range of tools that can be tailored to the needs of the force, with an electronic notebook (eNotebook) comprised of a set of smart forms covering all areas of operational police business processes. The application suite includes an Electronic Witness State- ment (EWS) application developed in partnership with the Home Office, it enables officers to capture information and images in electronic format. EWS files can be sent wirelessly to a police station or partner agencies such as the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS), and are admissible in a court of law. Common operational picture The processes dealt with by the police rarely end at the police station back office. There is almost always an onward step - be it a sudden death report that has to be completed and submitted to the coroner's office or information concerning a vulnerable child or adult that needs to be sharedwith social services or the local authority. Typically, the process of get- ting that information to the necessary agency entails the manual entry of information into a paper form thattakes several days to arrive at the intended destination. With Pronto, information captured digitally can be shared in real time to provide a common operational picture across all agencies, subject to agreed information sharing protocols. This means that all agencies can have relevant information to support accurate and timely decision making. Operational benefits, cashable savings It is expected that Great Britain's police forces will have had their budgets cut overall by 50 per cent by the next government. As a consequence, forces are spending money to boost their efficiencies, maintain a high level of visibility within their communities, as well as deliver against the Digital First agenda. A quarter of all police forces in Great Britain now use Pronto to support them in these objectives. And the gains are significant. Forexample, the time savings in the back office are as much as 8 to 10 minutes per item, with an additional saving of between 25 and 30 minutes when a crime is recorded digitally. In addition, there is a reduction in the number of requests handled by the control room as officers no longer need to call in for details as the information is available on the device. This means that critical activity can be prioritised and responded to more efficiently, and officers save on average two hours per shift which was previously spent on station-based administration.Mohammed Rafiq Customer Marketing Manager Airwave Tel: 08000 11 33 99 www.airwavesolutions.co.uk 229Surrey Police is the first force in Eng- land within the national Electronic Witness and Digital Signature Pilot Project to present notes and a diagram drawn on an eNotebook's screen as evidence in court. With witness' signa- tures digitally captured, the vast sums of money invested in re-visiting victims and witnesses to take statements can be reduced dramatically. From a storage perspective, current mandates mean the seven-year reten- tion of forms and notebooks in a warehouse, as well as additional costs in terms of securely printing forms and disposing of older ones. Con- versely, Pronto provides the option for digital documents to be stored in a secure server room. With the entire end-to-end process digitised, Pronto eliminates activities that are not value-added, avoids instances where data is replicated or re-keyed into multiple business processes, and prevents officers from having to return to the station to com- plete paper forms. As the digitalisation of policing and the CJS transformation continues, Pronto technology ensures resources can be focused where they are needed most - on the front line. PROFILEDesigned to counteract the devastating mine blast forces at the belly plate of the vehicle, the Advanced Blast & Ballistic Systems AMPS (Active Mine Protection Systems) technology is being developed to pro- vide the ultimate form of armoured vehicle protection against under-belly mines and IEDS's. A purely British development, fully protected by patents that are being pursued worldwide, the AMPS tech-nology can deal with both the floor deformation and the global accelera-tion threats to the vehicle occupants. Given that the belly plate is not pene- trated, the ABBS systems can provide complete protection from the serious injuries which normally result fromeven relatively small mines or IED's under vehicles. The lighter the vehicle, the more severe are the global acceleration effects (the whole vehicle being blown into the air) Roger Sloman Managing Director Advanced Blast & Ballistic (Active Mine Protection Systems) The Ultimate Active Mine Blast Protection System is Coming 230 PROFILE and the effects can kill, so the ability to essentially eliminate this effect is critically important, and will extend full mine blast protection to even the lightest Special Forces and VIP vehicles. Equally, the heaviest current military vehicles can also benefit from ABBS's AMPS technology, which is in its final development phase, with full scale vehicle testing due to take placebefore the end of 2014. The results will be reported in the next editions of Adjacent Government as they become available, but it is already clear that this technology will save many lives and serious injuries, and eventually will change the way that armoured vehicles are designed. Defence 231Searching for the solution Tony Hall, Defence Journalist, outlines the latest developments from the Norwegian Ministry of Defence for their search and rescue requirements... In November 2013, the Norwegian government began nal negotiations with helicopter manufacturer AgustaWestland for the delivery and through life support of its AW101 aircraft, answering a requirement issued by the Norwegian All Weather Search and Rescue Helicopter (NAWSRH) project. The choice of the AW101 came at the end of a process that began in 2007. In that year, Norway's Ministry of Justice and Public Security began preparatory work to replace the ageing fleet of Westland Mk43b Sea King Search and Rescue (SAR) and medical evacuation helicopters, which had been in operation since 1973. Management of the project was a collaborative one from the beginning, reflecting the cross-agency funding of search and rescue operations in Norway. SAR isregarded primarily as a police responsibility, with a lead being taken by the Ministry of Justice. The helicopters also act as air ambulances and as such are part funded by the Ministry of Health. Norway's Ministry of Defence provides personnel and operational support from the Royal Norwegian Air Force (RNoAF), and the Norwegian Defence Logistics Organization (NDLO). The RNoAF's 330 Squadron has been the unit responsible for providing SAR and medical evacuation services since their introduction in the 1970s, and will be the unit introducing the NAWSRH helicopters into service when they begin delivery as scheduled from 2017. The squadron currently operates around 12 Sea Kings in 4 flights from 5 bases across Norway, enabling ahelicopter to reach almost any part of the country in 90 minutes. The importance of the RNoAF bases in providing a support infrastructure to the NAWSRHproject was emphasised during the procurement process. All candidate companies for the new contract were informed that it would be vital for them to famil iarise themselves with each base as part of the bidding. The need for this breadth of coverage is due not onlyto size of the country - Norway is 1800 km north to south - it also reflects the fact that SAR has to be able to respond to emergencies o the coast and beyond the Arctic circle, encompassing both the increasingly important oil and gas elds, and the sheries within Norway's economic zone which extend out to sea for a distance of up to 400 nautical miles. These challenges were detailed in a concept studycompleted by the Ministry of Justice in 2010, which assessed specic requirements of the NAWSRH project in preparation for the acquisition that began formallywith an oer of bids in October 2011. 1 The study found that since the SAR service began, demand had doubled every 10 years, with an estimated increase of up to 50 call-outs per year by 2030. Given this acceleration in demand, increased levels of economic activity expected in the oil and gas industries o shore, and the age of the existing Sea King fleet, itwas recommended that life of the Sea Kings not be extended any further and that new fleet of all-weather rescue helicopters be acquired, to operate into the 2050s. The helicopters would be large, between 10-20 tonnes, long range, capable of operating in mountains and as fast over sea as they were over land. The acquisition cost would be around NOK 12bn, with total life cycle costs of up to NOK 39bn over 30 years. As the project began there was an expectation that costs would be mitigated through a joint procurementagreement with Iceland, which was also looking to acquire at least 3 new SAR helicopters. The agreement had been signed in 2007, but in September 2012 Iceland was compelled to withdraw due to domesticnancial problems, leaving the NAWSRH as a Norwegian-only project. From the beginning of the bidding process there was a requirement that NAWSRH would provide a commercial o-the-shelf solution. Pre-qualication information stated that the aircraft type submitted should have been in operation for at least 5 years, having logged 15,000 flying hours. Candidate companies could pres ent both military and civilian types. In December 2012 4 bids had been received from Eurocopter, NHIndustries, Sikorsky, and AgustaWestland. By July 2013 the Ministry of Justice announced thatAgustaWestland's AW101 Merlin and Eurocopter's EC225 Cougar had been shortlisted. In September Kongsberg Defence Systems added weight to AW101 bid, signing an agreement with AgustaWestland to provide long-term maintenance and testing support to ensure up to 50 jobs and up to NOK 200m a year for Kongsberg, a Norway-based company. On November 13th the Ministry of Justice announced that the AgustaWestland had been chosen as the preferred bidder. Its statement read: 'The aim is that the contract following nal negotiations will be concluded by the end of the year. The contract includes 16 new SAR helicopters with an option for further 6, and ensures that the Sea King will be phased out across the country by the end I'm sitting next to my severely wounded soldier comrade waiting impatiently for the field ambulance. A traumatic situation for all of us - what to do? We are in desperate need to do something for our friend and also for ourselves - it's horrible to just wait. It feels like an eternity\". Unfortunately this is not a unique scenario. Traumatic incidents affect everyone involved both the injured and bystanders. However, research has shown that 'eliminating' the feeling of uselessness by proceeding with determined actions minimises the risk of being severely traumatised. The last four decades the focus of casualty evacuation (CASEVAC) and medical evacuation (MEDEVAC) has increased as a result of nations being engaged in conflicts far away from their own countries, an increasingnumber of terrorist actions and large nature catastrophes. With an almost ever-present media transmitting images of people in distress or of seriously wounded or even deceased into our living rooms, it is vital for nations to have satisfactory routines, procedures and equipment. Authorities need to assure soldiers and citizens that they are able to take care of their own people when wounded abroad, and bring them home for treatment and recovery. After more than 60 years developing the routines and procedures, both within each nation and within coali- tions, one would assume that termsand abbreviations as well as equip- ment interfaces would be harmonised between nations to ensure interoper- ability, flexibility and cross training. A lot has been done in the past 20 years to achieve this. NATO has devel- oped standards for equipment as well as terminology; several yearly conferences - both military and civilian organised - contribute to the transfer of knowledge and experience between services and nations. Nevertheless, most nations still have huge areas of improvement before they can claim perfection. Standardisation and harmonisation between services and nations While trying to ensure interoperability of services as well as national forces,When minutes feels like hours A traumatic scenario we know that it is impossible to meet all interests. For example, the infantry soldiers want super-light and compact stretchers. For the vehicle operator it is vital that the stretcher fits into the actual stretcher support in the vehicle. The helicopter or aircraft operator needs a stretcher approved for aerial evacuation, while the wounded soldier has the best chances of survival and least pain if he is brought throughout the chain of evacuation on the samestretcher. Very often the result is different stretchers in different services, which arguably does not serve the patient. Can the industry contribute to the process of harmonising, equipment, and assist armed forces in developingand maintaining flexible solutionswith high capacity across services and nations? \" Photo: Erik Skjerven Defence Media ArchiveThere is a significant level of expertise and knowledge in the industry as well as in the medical services. NODIN Aviation suggests that this knowledge can catalyze the best solution for the customer and the industry can further improve their services to their customers by: Developing collaboration between companies to extend competence and capacity; Participating in arenas where the customers share their experience in field; Knowing, understanding and being loyal to applicable standards when designing solutions; Focusing on the patient and the medics, not the equipment, when doing innovative design solutions. What can the customers do to make the suppliers better prepared to develop solutions, products and services that meet the needs of the patients? NODIN suggests to: Improve the arenas where users share their experience in patient evacuation; Allow and encourage informal discussions between users andindustry, enabling industry to fully understand the need; Describe the issue and/or the need, not the solution. The best solutions may not yet have been invented. There is a significant effort in many nations to improve their CASEVAC and MEDEVAC capability and if these activities are fairly coordinated the international community will see a huge increase in the total capacity to bring injured people out of disaster areas. Back to the introductory traumatised scenario As a company focusing on products and concepts for CASEVAC and MEDEVAC in wars and catastrophes we are obliged to support with solutions focusing on the patient, the medics and everyone involved when developing innovative and first class solutions. Olav Kaarstein R&D Director NODIN Aviation AS kaarstein@medevac.no www.medevac.no Our new CASEVAC KIT was developed to change the role of any vehicle and mobile platforms in the battlefield or catastrophe area. The KIT consists of a four-folded Field Stretcher and a Shock and Vibration Damped Stretcher Suspension System, all packed in a handbag. Using this kit, a vehicle or any mobile platform will be converted into a CASEVAC-Unit in 1 to 2 minutes. The MEDEVAC Field Stretcher is designed and manufactured in accordance to military and civilian requirements for all platforms on land, at sea and in air. In addition to increase the evacuation capacity this solution enables the comrades of the wounded soldier to contribute in a positive way and the action itself make the soldiers handle the traumatic situation better.

We aim to understand the biology of stem cells and to analyse the genetic and epigenetic alterations generated in the context of cancer, as well as their ability to act as immunosuppressant. In addition, we try to reveal the connections between chromosome alterations and the stem cell theory of cancer, by studying the combination of genetic defects termed chromosome instability (CIN) that is found in approximately 85% of non-hereditary carcinomas. Finally, in an attempt to identify conditions in which adult stem cells can be used to replace malfunctioning organs in the body, we have shown that adult heart contains a resident non-cardiomyocyte population of Bmi1-expressing stem cells (B-CSCs). This novel population shows enriched expression for critical multipotency and stemness markers and contributes to the generation of de novo cardiomyocytes throughout life. Thus, we would like to get more precise information on the B-CSC population for a final evaluation in clinical trials.www.cnb.csic.esTHE KEY TO COMMUNICATION IN RESEARCH AND SOCIETY Innovative communication methods for people born both deaf and blind To nd out more, visit: www.rug.nl/sta/h.j.m.janssen and www.kentalis.nl/deafblind In collaboration with the Kentalis Deafblindness Center of Excellence, seven PhD students from the University of Groningen, ar e attempting to create strategies and techniques to help people with congenital deafblindness to communicate at higher levels, by sharing experiences and emotions with their daily carers.
