The human body is always seeking balance (homeostasis) in all of its processes and functions, and a homeopathic remedy is a gentle stimulus to help the body regain balance. Critics of homeopathic medicine will say that science shows this medicine to be placebo in nature due to there being very little to no molecules left in the original substance to stimulate any type of response. Critics also state that randomized controlled trials using homeopathic medicine have scientifically proven the inefficacy of this therapy. However, homeopathic medicine is not amenable to scientific randomized controlled trials because of the nature of this medicine: it is highly individualized and different remedies are used for different people for the same condition. A homeopathic remedy is selected based on the totality of the symptom presentation of the patient, including physical, emotional and mental symptoms combined. The remedy is not selected based on a specific disease or condition, the way a pharmaceutical drug is selected and scientifically proven for efficacy. We do not understand how homeopathic medicine works, but it is gentle medicine, and empirical evidence over hundreds of years have shown us that it is much more than placebo in nature. It is amazing how well animals and very young children positively and dramatically respond to this type of medicine. Perhaps infants and animals can be influenced by medicine that is placebo in nature? I think not. If you are interested, and to understand more about my views regarding homeopathy, in 2012 I wrote a post on my archived blog called, \" [Is Homeopathy Nonsensical?](/one-size-does-not-fit-all?category=homeopathy)\". I practise both constitutional homeopathy (finding the one best suited remedy for an individual at a given time) and complex homeopathy (a combination of substances in one formula). Depending on the situation and presentation, I will use the most appropriate method for a patient. "}
