Vaccinating is an effective means of addressing the pandemic threat. The government of India has implemented a massive vaccination drive to save its citizens from the deadly virus. However, the effort has faced multiple challenges, including vaccine hesitancy. This research understands respondents' perspectives on factors contributing to the lower vaccination uptake in Gujarat, India. Forty-four semi-structured interviews were conducted through convenience sampling representing different demographic backgrounds. Factors influencing vaccine adoption included religious leadership, political leadership and the government, and fear of side effects, especially among children and those with co-morbidities, resulting primarily from fake news and misinformation circulated through social media. Compared with nine countries from across the world, the study found similarities to vaccine hesitancy from misinformation and the fear of side effects among children. In contrast, the role of government and the influence of religious and political leaders was considered positive. The study recommends strategies to overcome people's apprehensions about the adoption of vaccination. These include offering incentives, providing positive peer-to-peer communication, recruiting influencers such as religious and community leaders and early adopters such as the elderly population to endorse vaccination, targeting youth through social media, and reaching rural sections by involving NGOs and social service groups.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2022-02-25", "cleaned_text": "Understanding Factors to COVID-19 Vaccine Adoption in Gujarat, India [https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19052707](https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19052707) [Social Vaccines have reduced the overall morbidity and mortality of several infectious diseases in the past [ [2](#B2-ijerph-19-02707)]. Vaccination can similarly play a substantial role in controlling the COVID-19 pandemic [ [3](#B3-ijerph-19-02707)]. Despite these benefits, a strong minority in society remains opposed to vaccines. Such opposition can derail the government's attempt to protect the citizens and achieve public health objectives. To overcome this problem, it is important to understand the reasons for this opposition. The current study explores perceptions of the COVID-19 vaccine among residents of Gujarat, India. 1.1. Vaccine Hesitancy [4](#B4-ijerph-19-02707)] (p. 4163). Vaccine hesitancy lies in a continuum between the two extremes of individual behaviour, i.e., total acceptance and opposition to vaccination [ [5](#B5-ijerph-19-02707), [6](#B6-ijerph-19-02707)]. [7](#B7-ijerph-19-02707)]. Vaccine hesitancy might be observed in a mere ten per cent of the population [ [8](#B8-ijerph-19-02707)]. However, they can complicate the vaccination drive as the rest of the population might be influenced by negative word of mouth [ [9](#B9-ijerph-19-02707)]. Hence, understanding the reasons for the lower uptake of vaccines is critical from policy formulation and social marketing intervention perspectives. 1.2. Factors Related to Vaccine Hesitancy [10](#B10-ijerph-19-02707), [11](#B11-ijerph-19-02707), [12](#B12-ijerph-19-02707)]. This uncertainty has resulted in lower-than-expected vaccination rates, especially in low- and middle-income countries [ [13](#B13-ijerph-19-02707), [14](#B14-ijerph-19-02707), [15](#B15-ijerph-19-02707)]. The issue is not limited to the developing world. Studies on fear of vaccines, low trust in government, and the role of misinformation have also been reported in developed countries [ [8](#B8-ijerph-19-02707), [16](#B16-ijerph-19-02707), [17](#B17-ijerph-19-02707), [18](#B18-ijerph-19-02707), [19](#B19-ijerph-19-02707)]. 1.3. Vaccination Campaign and Status in India [20](#B20-ijerph-19-02707), [21](#B21-ijerph-19-02707)]. The Indian government established a National Expert Group on COVID-19 Vaccine Administration (NEGVAC) to advise on all areas of COVID-19 vaccine administration in India [ [22](#B22-ijerph-19-02707)]. The government formed a group of specialists from various branches to determine the clinical criteria that should be used to prioritize persons with co-morbidities for COVID-19 immunization. According to the committee, anyone with congenital heart disease or any other kind of disease was given top priority. The COVID-19 vaccination was initially administered to healthcare personnel, frontline workers, and those over 50 (with a priority for those over 60), followed by people under 50 with co-morbidities. [23](#B23-ijerph-19-02707), [24](#B24-ijerph-19-02707), [25](#B25-ijerph-19-02707)]. Despite several challenges in India (i.e., limited healthcare infrastructure, limited vaccine availability, geographic constraints, and a large population), the country had administered both vaccination doses to 461.5 million people 18 years and above (49%) as of 31st July 2021. On the same day, Gujarat had administered two doses to 32.6 million people 18 years and above (66%) [ [26](#B26-ijerph-19-02707), [27](#B27-ijerph-19-02707), [28](#B28-ijerph-19-02707), [29](#B29-ijerph-19-02707), [30](#B30-ijerph-19-02707)]. 1.4. Setting literacy rate in 2011 was 78% [ [32](#B32-ijerph-19-02707)], which is expected to have increased in the past decade. While the people of Gujarat mostly follow Hindu practices, a sizeable population adheres to Islam, Christianity, Sikhism, Buddhism, and Jainism. This state has an average healthcare facility with over 23 district hospitals, 8347 rural dispensaries, 14 homeopathic hospitals, [35](#B35-ijerph-19-02707)]. As per social marketing research, one-time behaviour change is easier to promote, and vaccination falls into this behaviour category [ [36](#B36-ijerph-19-02707), [37](#B37-ijerph-19-02707), [38](#B38-ijerph-19-02707)]. There is a need to develop consciousness among the people and a positive intention towards receiving the vaccines so that the Gujarati population receives the required doses of COVID-19 vaccination. In this state, vaccination shots are available in different inoculation centers [ [39](#B39-ijerph-19-02707)] at a low price [ [40](#B40-ijerph-19-02707)]. 2. Method [41](#B41-ijerph-19-02707)] and Cresswell [ [42](#B42-ijerph-19-02707)] have suggested that the saturation range in semi-structured interviews is around 5 to 25. However, more interviews were undertaken to achieve saturation [ [43](#B43-ijerph-19-02707)] and provide an in-depth understanding of a relatively new phenomenon [ [44](#B44-ijerph-19-02707)]. [Appendix A](#app1-ijerph-19-02707). [45](#B45-ijerph-19-02707)]. One of the authors developed transcripts in the first stage. In the second stage, both the coders independently read the transcripts and assigned the codes to relevant quotes. In the third stage, the authors merged the relevant codes into sub-themes, and sub-themes into themes in the last stage. At each stage, the coders met and resolved discrepancies; when needed, the third coder was consulted (RMR). Intercoder reliability of 80% was noted, and discussions resolved discrepancies. [46](#B46-ijerph-19-02707)]. 3. Results [Table 1](#ijerph-19-02707-t001), who resided in different cities of Gujarat. Seven themes emerged from the interviews (See [Figure 1](#ijerph-19-02707-f001)). The obtained themes from primary data were arranged from broader to narrow scope for better organization and ease of interpretation [ [47](#B47-ijerph-19-02707)]. The themes and subthemes derived from the interviews are discussed below. The themes were later compared with nine select countries ( [Table 2](#ijerph-19-02707-t002)). A detailed explanation of the comparison with nine countries is presented in [Section 4](#sec4-ijerph-19-02707). 3.1. Low Uptake of Vaccines \"I already had corona once. Now, we are safe at least for three to four months. We have antibodies in our body, so we do not need to take the vaccination\".(participant 7) \"I have heard all this kind of news of vaccine inefficacy. I do have hesitancy and fear. You will not believe it; I have not even taken a test to check whether I have corona or not till today! So, forget about the vaccine\".(participant 27) 3.2. Themes 3.2.1. Religious Influence \"Religion will play a role. See, the thing is that Indians are quite religious. We always bring religious sentiments when eating food or wearing dresses like Western culture dresses. Also, I feel that many people would not prefer to have it (the vaccine) based on religious sentiments\".(participant 14) Influence of Religious Leaders \"If religious leaders are educated about the vaccination process, they will educate the local people or their community and explain to them the importance of vaccine\".(participant 18) Ingredients of Vaccine and Religious Sentiments \"When it comes to vaccine ingredients, it will not matter to me what is inside the dose. For example, we are given medicine like cough syrup when we have an illness. It contains alcohol (which is haram), but we overlook this aspect. We take medicines regularly, so we cannot claim that we have not taken alcohol. I will take the vaccine as vaccine and avoid thinking about this aspect\".(participant 42) \"The main reason I am apprehensive about the vaccine is that I do not know exactly what is in the vaccine. I will accept it only if the ingredients are halal (and not haram)\".(participant 6) 3.2.2. Emphasis on Family Children \"When it comes to children, one has to be very careful as they have a long life ahead. It will be a big problem if some major side effect happens. The first thing is to consult a doctor, make sure that they are mentally and physically capable of taking the vaccines, only then the vaccine should be given to them\".(participant 25) Seniors \"Yes, elders should go for vaccination because their immune system is not strong. Also, many of them have other diseases and co-morbidities. The doctor's advice is vital before taking the vaccine in such cases\".(participant 14) \"I feel like old people should go for the vaccination, but if they have some other major disease like high blood pressure, diabetes or cancer, then they need to think twice, and for the same, they should take the advice from their family doctor first\".(participant 17) Young People \"Young people should go for vaccination because they are the main sources of spreading. Since they travel to different places for professional and personal reasons, they meet many people who might be the carriers of the virus\".(participant 19) 3.2.3. Political Leadership \"Our honorable prime minister of India, as well as the chief minister of Delhi, have taken the vaccine, and hence people are influenced to follow suit. People felt assured that they took vaccinations as they were certain about their effects. Thus, personally taking the vaccine and suggesting others do the same will significantly influence creating a positive attitude towards the vaccine. Celebrities and politicians generally have a strong influence on people\".(participant 8) 3.2.4. The Role of Government \"Yes, the government (across India) has undertaken sufficient initiatives to guide people; they have created awareness about vaccines using local languages like Gujarati, Hindi, Marathi and that too in layman's terms. They have even put a caller tune of around 30 s to spread awareness about taking vaccines when the slots are available. Sometimes it was irritating, but they have used it positively to influence people by delivering necessary information\".(participant 12) \"From Rajkot municipality corporation, a team of three people including a doctor used to come to our home at a regular interval to check about our health condition. They used to bring the COVID test kit, and if found positive, they would provide free basic medicine\".(participant 40) \"As my daughter was found COVID positive, she returned for a few days from her in-law's family. She told me, every Tuesday and Friday, she used to get a call from the local municipality to check about her health\".(participant 37) - (a) - to control the spread of misinformation both online and offline - (b) - to provide vital information to the masses, especially to those located in rural areas and the weaker sections - (c) - to increase the supply of vaccines to private hospitals for easy access - (d) - to provide data of state-wise measures taken in the country - (e) - to ensure transparency concerning the vaccination process - (f) - to provide vaccines to private corporate employees as a priority - (g) - to collaborate with NGOs and other service provider organizations, and - (h) - to bring transparency by sharing vaccination data 3.2.5. Willingness to Pay \"I paid for my parents' vaccination. My reason was not safety or hygiene or anything like that. My reason was that I did not want to burden the government with additional 500 rupees\".(participant 28) \"If I am supposed to take the vaccine, I will pay for it because I can afford it. US $7 for two shots is fine. The genuine reason for not going to the government health center is that if I give up my vaccine shot, a needy person can get that shot, and they will not have to pay for it. As I can afford it, so I can get it from a private hospital\".(participant 43) 3.2.6. The Role of Misinformation \"There are stories related to vaccine floating around saying that if we take the vaccine, then our genetic makeup changes. We are surrounded by a lot of misinformation about the vaccine because we do not have 100% information related to the vaccine\".(participant 30) 3.2.7. The Role of Fear \"My grandmother and my mother both have blood pressure and diabetics. I insisted they go for vaccination, but they were concerned about what would happen after taking the vaccine. That is why they were hesitant\".(participant 15) \"I am afraid because as we are young. I do not think corona will easily enter our body if we take care. Because of the lockdown, we have already improved our health. So, I do not feel the need for the vaccine because it may instead cause damage\".(participant 4) \"When I have a health problem, I choose Ayurveda medicine since my brother's wife, brother-in-law, and father-in-law are all ayurvedic physicians. Only ayurvedic medicines are used to treat illnesses in our family, and I am fearful of other drugs\".(participant 7) 4. How Do Our Findings Compare with the Rest of the World? [48](#B48-ijerph-19-02707)]; and (c) collectively represent most major religions (Christianity practiced in USA, Germany, Canada, UK, Australia, and Brazil, Islam in Saudi Arabia, Shintism in Japan, Hinduism in India, and Buddhism in Thailand) [ [111](#B111-ijerph-19-02707)], This diversity helped us examine the cross-cultural effect and its influence at the global level [ [112](#B112-ijerph-19-02707), [113](#B113-ijerph-19-02707), [114](#B114-ijerph-19-02707)]. A comparison is represented in [Table 2](#ijerph-19-02707-t002). [8](#B8-ijerph-19-02707)] reported that very religious people tend to be more resistant to vaccine uptake. Consistently, Smith, Attwell and Evers [ [51](#B51-ijerph-19-02707)] found that less religious people were more supportive towards uptake. In Japan, Lahav, Shahrabani, Rosenboim and Tsutsui [ [56](#B56-ijerph-19-02707)] also revealed that more religious people were less likely to take vaccines than less religious ones. In the other developed countries like the USA and the UK, change in religious belief was reported to significantly correlate with the impact of the coronavirus crisis [ [49](#B49-ijerph-19-02707)]. [52](#B52-ijerph-19-02707)] concluded that hesitancy in Muslim-dominated Asian countries exists due to the content of vaccines being haram. This reason could be extended to the COVID-19 vaccine as well. People have stated the same reason in other Muslim countries to refuse the vaccine [ [53](#B53-ijerph-19-02707), [54](#B54-ijerph-19-02707)]. Our study partially supports this argument. [50](#B50-ijerph-19-02707)]. The British Islamic Medical Association and other Islamic scholars approved the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine [ [62](#B62-ijerph-19-02707)]. While in Thailand, the Sheikul Islam Office has allowed the commencement of mosque prayers in localities where at least 70% of persons aged 18 and above were vaccinated [ [55](#B55-ijerph-19-02707)]. [57](#B57-ijerph-19-02707)], the family was an influencing factor. Lazarus, Wyka, Rauh, Rabin, Ratzan, Gostin, Larson and El-Mohandes [ [59](#B59-ijerph-19-02707)] observed that women were more likely than males to follow an employer's vaccine suggestion in Brazil and the USA. In Canada [ [58](#B58-ijerph-19-02707)], 70% of university students preferred to take the vaccine only if a doctor or pharmacist recommended it. At the same time, a few instead waited to see the effect of the vaccine on others. [19](#B19-ijerph-19-02707)]. Research conducted among the residents and expatriates in Thailand established that 58% of residents and 82.9% of expatriates would depend on their family member's advice on the uptake of vaccines [ [88](#B88-ijerph-19-02707)]. This emphasis on family and doctors resembles the current study with a sample of the Gujarati population. [63](#B63-ijerph-19-02707)]. In Saudi Arabia, the crown prince took the coronavirus vaccine. These government and political leader initiatives were highly appreciated [ [68](#B68-ijerph-19-02707)]. In contrast, the Brazilian president was criticized for his inability to handle the pandemic [ [64](#B64-ijerph-19-02707), [65](#B65-ijerph-19-02707), [66](#B66-ijerph-19-02707), [67](#B67-ijerph-19-02707)]. [71](#B71-ijerph-19-02707)]. Enhancing the public's trust in the COVID-19 vaccine has been the motto of all governments across the globe. The fourth theme highlighted the government's active role in promoting the uptake of vaccines. Few efforts were highly appreciated. For instance, the Australian government developed a systematic four-stage process [ [73](#B73-ijerph-19-02707)] and allocated $257 million to vaccinate 80% of adults by December 2021 [ [74](#B74-ijerph-19-02707)]. Additionally, the government proactively curbed various companies' false COVID-19 cure claims by issuing an advisory [ [75](#B75-ijerph-19-02707), [76](#B76-ijerph-19-02707)]. [115](#B115-ijerph-19-02707)]. The government started four new programmes in Canada to promote vaccine uptake through the Immunization Partnership fund [ [72](#B72-ijerph-19-02707)]. In Japan, the government imported 28 million doses by April 2021 [ [69](#B69-ijerph-19-02707)], significantly improving vaccination rates [ [82](#B82-ijerph-19-02707)]. [80](#B80-ijerph-19-02707)]. In addition, the Thai government developed an \"Anti-fake news centre\" to arrest all those who spread false information about the COVID-19 and impose fines [ [81](#B81-ijerph-19-02707)]. In Saudi Arabia, devotees could only visit two holy mosques for prayers if they had received both vaccine shots [ [79](#B79-ijerph-19-02707)]. Such initiatives resulted in positive government perceptions [ [78](#B78-ijerph-19-02707)]. In contrast, the Brazilian government was criticized for their suboptimal performance [ [48](#B48-ijerph-19-02707), [77](#B77-ijerph-19-02707)]. [57](#B57-ijerph-19-02707)]. Some governors have announced mandatory vaccination for state employees [ [70](#B70-ijerph-19-02707)]. In Canada, 32.4% of respondents argued that vaccines were not evaluated thoroughly and had a political objective [ [60](#B60-ijerph-19-02707)]. To counter, it was announced that those who refused to divulge their vaccination status or be fully vaccinated would be placed on administrative leave without pay commencing 15 November 2021 [ [15](#B15-ijerph-19-02707)]. In the UK, England's chief medical officer urged every woman planning for pregnancy to get her jab in advance as a precautionary measure [ [61](#B61-ijerph-19-02707)]. [116](#B116-ijerph-19-02707)]. In Australia, a study revealed that willingness to pay is $34.44 for reducing the waiting time for the uptake of vaccines [ [87](#B87-ijerph-19-02707)]. According to a study conducted in the USA and Canada, willingness to pay was $23 and $11.5, respectively [ [83](#B83-ijerph-19-02707)]. In a more recent study, it was found that in the USA, willingness to pay was $228-$291 for a vaccine for themselves and US$243-US$321 for their children [ [84](#B84-ijerph-19-02707)]. [86](#B86-ijerph-19-02707)]. In Brazil, the willingness to pay for vaccine uptake was US$ 22.18 [ [85](#B85-ijerph-19-02707)], although 75% of people were urged to take the vaccines if they were freely available to them [ [88](#B88-ijerph-19-02707)]. Our research also found that Gujaratis were willing to pay for their vaccinations, although the value was not ascertained. [117](#B117-ijerph-19-02707)]. Failure to prevent the dissemination of misinformation about COVID-19 and vaccines has caused panic, terror, and disorder in society [ [118](#B118-ijerph-19-02707)]. In Australia, Rozbroj, Lyons and Lucke [ [94](#B94-ijerph-19-02707)] concluded that people were highly concerned about the anti-vaccination movement, spreading much misinformation. Between October 2020 and March 2021, TikTok banned 873 videos that mentioned the coronavirus or other medical conditions to stem misinformation [ [95](#B95-ijerph-19-02707)]. [96](#B96-ijerph-19-02707)] revealed that misinformation was linked with digital health literacy. Evanega, Lynas, Adams, Smolenyak and Insights [ [89](#B89-ijerph-19-02707)] found that only 16.4% of people did \"fact-checking\" before passing information to others in the USA. In the UK and USA, through a randomized controlled trial, it was contended that there was a decline in the misinformation by 6.2% in the UK and 6.4% in the USA among those who were open to taking the vaccines [ [90](#B90-ijerph-19-02707)]. Desveaux, Savage, Tadrous, Kithulegoda, Thai, Stall and Ivers [ [91](#B91-ijerph-19-02707)] reported that Canadians rely more on public health websites and health care workers' advice to uptake vaccines. [76](#B76-ijerph-19-02707)]. A study conducted by Nomura, Eguchi, and Miyata [ [100](#B100-ijerph-19-02707)] found that people trust physicians and nurses for checking information related to vaccine uptake. A very different approach was adopted in the UK to combat misinformation. The government collaborated with the University of Cambridge to create \"Go Viral!\". It was a game developed to teach and enlighten people about how misinformation was being spread on social media to safeguard themselves [ [92](#B92-ijerph-19-02707), [93](#B93-ijerph-19-02707)]. [97](#B97-ijerph-19-02707)] found that more than 70% reported the primary source of misinformation to be the WhatsApp application. Similar results were observed in Saudi Arabia, where most misinformation is spread through WhatsApp. Of that, 46% was related to the pandemic [ [98](#B98-ijerph-19-02707)]. Because of the widespread misinformation in Thailand, Mongkhon, Thavorn, Hutton, Wongpakaran, Wongpakaran and Nochaiwong [ [99](#B99-ijerph-19-02707)] revealed that those exposed for three or more hours in a day to misinformation were facing problems related to depression, anxiety, and insomnia. [105](#B105-ijerph-19-02707)] found 82.8% of people feared vaccine efficacy and safety. Furthermore, a study indicated that one-third of people prefer not to go for the vaccine because they fear the side effects of vaccines [ [106](#B106-ijerph-19-02707)]. The stress level of people had increased from 10.6% in 2020 to 12.5% in 2021 because of the fear related to vaccination [ [107](#B107-ijerph-19-02707)]. In Germany, the survey conducted by Bauernfeind, has revealed that 79% of people have fear related to the uptake of the vaccines. [19](#B19-ijerph-19-02707)]. Another Japanese study [ [100](#B100-ijerph-19-02707)] reported similar findings. Furthermore, a recent study by Okubo, Yoshioka, Ohfuji, Matsuo and Tabuchi [ [110](#B110-ijerph-19-02707)] found that among the hesitant group, more than 70% of people are afraid of the efficacy of the vaccine. In addition to that, Yoda and Katsuyama [ [19](#B19-ijerph-19-02707)] found that fear resulted from a lack of trust and potential side effects of vaccines. Similar findings were found in the UK [ [104](#B104-ijerph-19-02707)]. [101](#B101-ijerph-19-02707)]. Kirzinger, Kearney, Hamel and Brodie [ [102](#B102-ijerph-19-02707)] reported that 48% of Americans had not taken vaccines due to fear, even when health care workers were in direct contact with patients. In Canada, people have shown similar concern for vaccine safety, and because of fear, they were avoiding vaccines [ [58](#B58-ijerph-19-02707), [60](#B60-ijerph-19-02707)] 5. Discussion, a Review of Government Efforts, and Recommendations [119](#B119-ijerph-19-02707), [120](#B120-ijerph-19-02707)]. Effective social marketing strategies can help promote 'one-time behavioral change' such as vaccine jabs [ [36](#B36-ijerph-19-02707), [121](#B121-ijerph-19-02707)]. In this section, we consider the social marketing perspective to review the efforts of the governments of Gujarat and India, connect them with the study findings, and recommend strategies to improve vaccine uptake. [122](#B122-ijerph-19-02707)]. Most participants agreed that low vaccination rates threatened the achievement of the long-term goal. Practical Implications [123](#B123-ijerph-19-02707)] [124](#B124-ijerph-19-02707)]. [121](#B121-ijerph-19-02707)]. The \"My why\" social campaign motivated people to post their stories related to vaccination in Canada on social media. This campaign helped in increasing the confidence of others towards the vaccination. The campaign aimed to increase the overall uptake among Canadians [ [125](#B125-ijerph-19-02707)]. The Indian government has introduced the \"Jan Andolan\" campaign. One takes a pledge on a website that he or she will follow six significant behaviors to help safeguard from the deadly virus and receive a certificate [ [126](#B126-ijerph-19-02707)]. [127](#B127-ijerph-19-02707)]. According to the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI), Gujarat is currently one of the eight Indian states with a teledensity of more than 100%. Further, mobile phone users have risen in recent months [ [128](#B128-ijerph-19-02707)]. [129](#B129-ijerph-19-02707)]. 6. Limitations and Future Research 7.
