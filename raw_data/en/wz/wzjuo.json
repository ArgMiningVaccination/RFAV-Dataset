and Descriptions 2022 -2023 3 General Introductions and Resources The 2022- 2023 edition of the Indiana Department of Education's (IDOE) Course Titles and Descriptions list are course titles and descriptions that have been approved for schools to use during the 2022- 2023 school year. Course descriptions provide brief statements of the content of high school courses. These descriptions are intended to assist schools in communicating, in a broad context, the content and Indiana Academic Standards (IAS) of state approved course titles. Code numbe rs and titles listed for each course description must be used when reporting courses on IDOE documents and should be used on student transcripts as well. Instructional decisions related to curriculum selection and development, implementation, and assessment are left to local school corporations. In fact, Indiana schools may explore, develop, and implement activities and programs that go beyond these descriptions as they strive to prepare their students for life in an ever-changi ng society. Indiana State Board of Education rules and the School Improvement Plan required by Public Law 221 provide avenues for gaining approval of well- planned, non -standard programs and courses. School corporations may apply for a non-standard course waiver if the course or program is not listed in this document. Look for the links under \"Non -Standard Course waiver\" on this page. Additionally, information about teacher licensing for each course may be found here. Changes and Revisions For information on course revisions and changes, please see this document. Academic Impact The COVID -19 pandemic has significantly impacted student learning. Students experienced modera te to significant impacts that require more than one year s of supplemental academic support to recover the impact. Most students were impacted academically. Review additional information on the Executive Summary of the Indiana Academic Impact Analysis here. Please note these other important details: Per 511 IAC 6.1- 5-4.5, the cours e titles listed in this document, along with approved non - standard course waivers, are the only course titles that may be offered for high school credit in order to meet the graduation requirements established by the Indiana State Board of Education (SBOE), the expectations of Core 40, and the requirements of the honors diplomas. Course descriptions are consistent with the Indiana Academic Standards. The maximum number of credits that may be granted for each course is listed in the High School Course Titles and Descriptions 2022 -2023 4 course description bullets. Generally, one credit is awarded per semester except as noted. Course description bullets identify those courses in which students may receive credit for successive semesters of instruction. Multiple credits may not be awarded for the same course unless the course description permits multiple credits to be awarded. The Indiana State Board of Education does not restrict high school credit to course work completed in grades 9 through 12. Schools may elect to award high school credit to students who complete high school courses before entering grade 9 if the course is fully equivalent to its high school counterpart. Local policies and procedures should be developed to govern credit for high school courses taught prior to grade 9. Additional information can be found here. Required and recommended prerequisites are listed for some courses. Local schools and districts may require additional prerequisites. The Certificate of Completion course of study must be followed (effective for the student cohort that started in the school year 2018/2019) if a student with an Individualized Education Plan (IEP) has been removed from a diploma path. The Certificate of Completion provides increased access to the general education curriculum by providing flexibility in earning either credits or applied units in general education or special education classes. The Certifi cate of Completion can be earned through any combination of applied units and credits. For more information, please see the Graduation Pathways site here . The Applied Courses are aligned to Indiana's academic standards using content connectors, and highlight necessary knowledge and skills within the academic standards for students to reach learning targets at each grade level. Applied courses do not have a separate section within the Course Titles and Descriptions. Applied courses are embedded within the appropriate content area section. Applied courses describe an approach to instruction and learning that focuses on making connections between academic subjects and the real world. The purpose is to make academic content relevant and hands -on for learners. Applied courses are available to students with a broad spectrum of ability levels. The method of instruction, accommodations, and modifications will vary per each student's IEP. Students enrolled in applied courses are expected to learn the content as described in the applied course description. Applied courses provide general education teachers with the ability to use a variety of instructional methods to assist students with learning the content of the course. Using authentic assessment, collaboration, and different forms of media, student engagement is enhanced. A laboratory course, identified by (L) in these course descriptions, is one in which a \"minimum of twenty -five percent (25%) of the total instructional time is devoted to laboratory activities. Laboratory activities are those activities in which the pupil personally uses appropriate procedures and equipment in accomplishing that learning task.\" Schools may designate a course Honors when the course content is significantly more rigorous than the state -approved course. Honors level courses must be based on the IAS, have defined criteria for student admission to the course as well as High School Course Titles and Descriptions 2022 -2023 5 clear expectations of student outcomes. Honors level courses must include a culminating Honors project that reflects understanding of the Honors course content. The course description should reflect the Honors nature of the course, and course titles should include an \"H\" or the word \"Honors\" in the title. Advanced Placement (AP), International Baccalaureate (IB), Cambridge International (CI), and Advanced College Credit (Dual Credit) courses appear only in their respective sections and are not repeated in content area sections. We welcome your suggestions and comments. Please contact Adam McMickle, Academics Specialist (amcmickle@doe.in.gov ) or Karrianne Polk-Meek, Director of Teaching and Learning (kpolkmeek@doe.in.gov ), should you have any questions, concerns, or recommendations. High School Course Titles and Descriptions 2022 -2023 6 Advanced Courses -Non CTE for College Credit Indiana State - Approved Course Titles and Descriptions 2022-2023 School Year Indiana Department of Education High School Course Titles and Descriptions 2022 -2023 7 Advanced and Dual Credit Courses for College Credit Introduction Advanced Courses for College Credit covers (1) any college- level course offered for credit by an accredited post -secondary institution through an approved agreement with a secondary school, or (2) any other post-secondary course offered for dual credit under the provisions of 511 IAC 6- 10. The intent of this course is to allow schools to award high school credit to students for taking college courses with content that is more advanced than state- approved high school courses. Dual credit is the term given to courses in which high school students have the opportunity to earn both high school and college credits. Dual credit courses are taught by high school faculty, adjunct college faculty, or college faculty either at the high school or the college/university. This may also include online courses or distance education taught by college faculty. Dual credit is offered by both state and independent (private, regionally accredited) colleges and universities. Indiana law requires each Indiana high school to offer a minimum of two dual credit courses. According to the Indiana Commission for Higher Education's Policy on Dual Credit Courses Taught in High Schools by High School Faculty, all post- secondary institutions shall generate transcripts for all students who complete advanced courses for dual credit. In order to apply these dual credits toward an Honors Diploma Award, both the secondary and the post - secondary institutions must transcript the credit. In cooperation with the Indiana Commission for Higher Education (CHE), IDOE offers a Dual Credit FAQ by accessing this link. Dual credit courses provide opportunities for qualified students to earn college credit from regionally accredited institutions while attending high school. 1124Advanced English/Language Arts, College Credit (ADV ENG CC) Advanced English/Language Arts, College Credit, is an advanced course based on the Indiana Academic Standards for English/Language Arts in grades 11 and 12.

The course is an interdisciplinary synthesis of language A and theatre. It incorporates essential elements of literature and performance and aims to explore the dynamic relationship between the two. At the heart of the course is the interaction between (1) a conventional literary emphasis on close readi ng, critical writing and discussion and (2) the practical, aesthetic and symbolic elements of performance. A distinctive outcome of this synthesis is the performance of a piece transformed from poetry or prose. In this creative process, text is viewed from different angles in a way that goes beyond what is characteristic of either literary or theatre studies as single disciplines. Through examination of both literary and dramatic texts, the course develops intellect, imagination, and creativity. It encourages intercultural awareness through a study of texts from more than one culture. (Available at standard level only).
