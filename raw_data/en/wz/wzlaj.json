The COVID-19 vaccines are here. You must know at least one person who has received it by now and are awaiting your turn. But they're also stirring up some controversy, especially amongst those with chronic diseases. If you have psoriasis skin disease then you know that you have an overactive immune system. And you might wonder if it cancels out the impact of the COVID-19 vaccine. Or you might think taking the COVID-19 vaccine can make your psoriasis worse. Or else you might assume that the side-effects of the COVID-19 vaccine may impact your psoriasis skin. Keep reading to find out. Could the COVID-19 vaccine interact with psoriasis medications? People taking immunosuppressive medications for their autoimmune diseases need those medications to stay in remission. Nevertheless, those medications might blunt the immune response to the COVID-19 vaccines. These medications can make the COVID-19 vaccines less effective. It is not recommended to stop the immunosuppressive medications before getting vaccinated. Nevertheless, this should be discussed on a case-by-case basis with the doctor treating you. Will COVID-19 vaccine side-effects be more severe due to psoriasis? It is not known if the vaccine side-effects will differ in those with autoimmune conditions. Immunocompromised individuals or those requiring immunosuppressive therapy were excluded from phase III SARS Cov-2 vaccine trials. Therefore, safety and efficacy in this population are unknown. Conventional treatment of psoriasis The conventional treatment of psoriasis includes immune modulators, phototherapy, and topical immune modulators. But there can be possible side effects such as drug toxicity and skin atrophy. How does homeopathy help in psoriasis treatment?
