Sounds great right? Maybe it's on your to-do list? Sure, in a perfect world. But who has time to DIY a mountain of natural cleaners and who has the money to purchase an organic bed? Not me. Probably not you either. But here's the secret: you don't have to do it all at once. That's right, you don't have to get stressed about switching out all of your cleaning products and toiletry products RIGHT NOW. You don't have to go out and spend a bundle on a new mattress and sofa. Do it slowly over time and focus on just one thing as you need to replace it. If you've been living with the chemicals for years, another few months won't make a difference. I took about a year to switch out my cleaning products first, then air fresheners, then laundry detergent, then hand sanitizers and soaps, then toiletries, then beauty products. Finally, if I needed new furnishings or linens or decorations, I made sure to look for sustainable, healthy options. But that's only if I needed to bring new things into my home at all. Until then, my current pillows stay (with hemp pillow covers over them!). Below I'll spell out for you a simple strategy for switching to a natural, non-toxic, healthy home. But first, in case you need more proof that a healthy home environment is necessary...take a gander at the typical ingredients that commonly come into our homes through cleaners, air fresheners, beauty and body-care products and even on furniture. Parabens - disrupt the endocrine system and may increase breast cancer risk Phthalates - disrupt the endocrine system and affect reproduction Triclosan - linked to skin sensitivity, liver damage and hormone disruption Chlorine - aggravates asthma, destroys gut bacteria, can disrupt thyroid function, linked to colon/bladder cancer Perchloroethylene (PERC) - commonly found in dry-cleaning solutions, spot removers, and carpet and upholstery cleaners, it is a neurotoxin and possible carcinogen Chloroform - found in dryer sheets, it's a neurotoxin and carcinogen 2-butoxyethanol - irritates skin and eyes Benzyl acetate: linked to pancreatic cancer Fragrance - triggers allergies and asthma, linked to hormone disruption Sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS) and sodium laureth sulfate (SLES) - can cause severe skin irritation Butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) - may damage liver and kidneys, disrupt hormones and promote tumour growth Ammonia- commonly found in glass cleaner, causes eye, skin and lung irritation and worsens asthma. Formaldehyde - aggravates allergies, irritates the skin and burns eyes, nose and throat, a carcinogen DEA (diethanolamine), TEA (triethanolamine) and MEA (monoethanolamine) - can cause allergic reactions, linked to liver and kidney cancer Yeah, pretty bad right? Ready to begin making the switch? Here's a simple strategy for switching to a more natural home without a huge investment of time or money: Choose one area. For example, cleaning products are a good place to begin. Or maybe skin products like lotions and soaps. Replace something only when you've used up your current product. No need to waste your already-purchased luxury skin cream and you certainly don't need to ditch your furniture for organic pieces until they're worn out. Look for DIY alternatives, check out your local natural foods store or go online and search for natural, organic products.
