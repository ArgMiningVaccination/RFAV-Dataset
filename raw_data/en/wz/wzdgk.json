If you have symptoms of Covid-19 please consult your healthcare professional immediately. Vitamin C 500 mg BID and Quercetin 250 mg daily Quercetin helps zinc get into the cells to ward off the virus. Intravenous vitamin C is already being used to treat Covid-19 patients. One such protocol involves providing intensive care patients with an immediate IV dose of 1,500 milligrams of C, with the dose repeated 3 to 4 times a day. The patients that receive this C treatment fare significantly better compared to those who don't receive the C treatment. When sepsis, of the infiltration of the virus into the blood occurs, levels of C drop significantly in the bodies of patients. Zinc 30-50 mg/day Supplementing with zinc increases the ability of immune cells called polymorphonuclear cells to fight infections. With regard to the coronavirus that causes Covid-19, zinc inhibits the virus polymerase activity and viral replication in cell culture models of SARS-CoV-1. Zinc also reduces the duration of common colds, which is caused by a type of coronavirus. One recent study published in the Journal of Infectious Diseases described how four patients with confirmed cases of Covid-19 were treated with zinc lozenges. All four of these patients reported significant improvement in objective and symptomatic disease measures after just one day of high dose zinc lozenge therapy. Melatonin (slow release): Begin with 0.3mg and increase as tolerated to 2 mg at night The full therapeutic potential of melatonin and its ability to modulate the immune system, especially the critical function of suppressing cytokine storms to prevent progression of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and respiratory failure in infected patients was clearly demonstrated in a study by Huang et al. (2019). Huang et al. infected rodents with the highly lethal and infectious H1N1 influenza A virus. Co-treatment of these infected rodents with melatonin and an antiviral drug significantly increased their survival rates compared to mice treated only with antivirals alone. Vitamin D3 1000-3000 u/day and B complex vitamins One recent study that has not yet been published involved doctors in Singapore who were treating 43 patients all over age 50 with Covid-19. The doctors provided 17 of these patients with a nutrient combination of nutrients that consisted of 1,000 units of vitamin D; 150 milligrams of magnesium; and 500 micrograms of vitamin B12, all ingested once a day. While 17 patients ingested this nutrient combo, another 26 patients did not. The rationale for this particular group of nutrients was that vitamin D has a proven track record in producing protective effects against upper respiratory tract infections, including those caused by flu viruses. Magnesium is added because it enhances vitamin D function and also is a vasodilator (increases blood flow) and bronchodilator (opens up bronchial tubes in the lungs, which aids breathing). The B12 is added because it modulates gut bacteria or the intestinal microbiome. The intestinal microbiome is vital for immune function and over 90% of immune function is based on a communication between the intestinal bacteria and the immune system.
