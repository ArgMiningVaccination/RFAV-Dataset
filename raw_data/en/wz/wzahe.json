While presenting to a group of clinicians including integrative doctors, naturopaths and a compounding pharmacist I made a passing comment \"Naturopathy seems to have lost its way\". I was surprised when one of my colleagues in the group pulled me up and ask what I meant by this. I later discovered that he had been strategic in one of Australia's most prestigious naturopathic educational institutions. A little taken back and not wanting to offend anyone, I began to explain that the principles of Naturopathy that I had learned some thirty plus years ago were to treat the individual - not the disease, to work toward enhancing the body's natural defences and to utilise mainly diet, lifestyle and traditional detox programs like fasting and saunas. I continued to say that contrary to this, the approach today seems to have moved toward using specified protocols to treat specific disease states, to load the body with multiple and often synthetic supplements and to avoid the traditional cleansing programs in favour of highly processed, concentrated and expensive powders. I did clarify that the graduates of today were far better qualified in many areas than we were as graduates especially in the science disciplines. Not sure where the discussion was about to go and expecting a challenge and debate to develop I was surprised by the unanimous agreement within the group. Comments followed that Naturopathy was moving toward the more reductionist, orthodox, medical viewpoint of health and departing from the traditional holistic understanding. It makes me wonder how many other practitioners of natural, holistic medicine share in this frustration and disappointment as we have been swept along by a commercially-driven tide over the past decades that continues to erode the very foundation laid by our forefathers. It seems as Naturopathy has become more acceptable and even fashionable that a manufacturing industry has boomed not only synthesising the \"natural medicines\" of today but shaping the way in which we as practitioners view health. As more doctors embrace the possibility of \"Natural Medicines\" and Naturopaths grasp for the latest \"natural wonder drug\" the neo-naturopathic age has begun. In short Neo-naturopathy is the synthesis of the contemporary reductionist medical model with traditional, natural medicine. Sadly it seems to have lead to a compromise of our unique, holistic view.
