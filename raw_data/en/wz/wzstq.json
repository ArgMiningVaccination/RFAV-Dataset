Cancer is mainly characterized as the uncontrolled growth and spread of abnormal cells and if the growth is not controlled, ultimately it can interfere with essential life-sustaining systems and result in death. The standard allopathic treatment is via chemotherapy and radiation. These very harsh chemical substances are introduced into the body with the intent to destroy cancer cells. Unfortunately, chemotherapy not only destroys the bad cells, it also kills life sustaining cells as well. Because chemotherapy destroys your entire immune system, this also results in causing uncomfortable side effects such as: fatigue, hair loss, nerve damage, sores and ulcers in mucus linings, bruising and bleeding, infection, anemia, nausea and vomiting, loss of appetite and constipation. Many people immediately subscribe to chemotherapy out of fear, but cancer in most cases, offers you more 'time' for decision making than most allopathic doctors will readily admit to. In the last decade thousands of individuals have begun to turn down chemotherapy and have instead, sought out alternative ways to manage or reverse cancer. Dr. Rodger has first hand experience with cancer and chemotherapy as his own sister, utilizing chemotherapy as a means of treatment, passed away regardless. This great loss is what turned Dr. Rodger to study Naturopathy, as a means to find alternative and less volatile ways to battle cancer. Under Dr. Rodger's guidance, a sound human clinical medical nutritional plan practiced in alignment with a series of consultations helps to keep you on a health-driven plan of action. Muscle testing in combination with nutritional education, an organic diet plan, and supplements based on your body's individual needs, reduces inflammation and rebuilds your body's best resource: your immune system.
