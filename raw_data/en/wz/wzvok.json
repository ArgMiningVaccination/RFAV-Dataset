WIC (Women, Infants, and Children) is a Federally-funded health and nutrition program that serves low and moderate income pregnant, breastfeeding, and postpartum women, infants, and children up to age five who have nutrition-related health problems. WIC has demonstrated a positive effect on pregnancy outcomes, and child growth and development. What's more, for every dollar spent by the program, more than three dollars in subsequent health care costs are saved. How does WIC work? Participants exchange WIC food benefits at approved retail grocery stores and pharmacies. WIC foods are selected to meet nutrient needs, such as calcium, iron, folic acid, and Vitamins A & C. What does WIC provide? Food for infants (birth - 12 months) Food for women and children (under five years of age) Nutritional education High-risk nutrition counseling Health care referrals Breastfeeding promotion and support Project FRESH coupons (to purchase fresh fruits and vegetables) WIC makes a difference Vaccinations save lives! Thanks to advances in medical science, children are protected against more diseases than ever before. Some diseases that once injured or killed thousands have been completely eliminated, while others are close to extinction- primar - ily due to safe and effective vaccines. For example, children no longer need to get smallpox shots because the vac - cine eradicated the disease worldwide. By vaccinating children against rubella (German measles), the risk of pregnant women passing the virus to their fetus has dramatically decreased, and associated birth defects are no longer seen in the U.S. Yet another example is the elimination of what was once America's most-feared disease, polio. But with that said, it's important to note that children in the U.S. still get vaccine-preventable diseases. In fact, we have seen a resurgence of measles and whooping cough (pertussis) over the past few years. In 2010, the U.S. had over 21,000 reported cases of whooping cough and 26 deaths, mostly in children younger than six months. Unfortunately, some babies are too young to be completely vaccinated and some people may not be able to receive certain vacci - nations due to allergies or weakened immune systems. To help keep these vulnerable groups safe, it is important for those who are able to get vaccinated to do so. One group we may not think to vaccinate is adolescents. Adolescents between the ages of 11 and 18 years of age need vaccinations to prevent diseases such as whooping cough, hepatitis B, hepatitis A, chicken pox, measles, mumps, meningitis, and human papillomavirus. If parents need assistance paying for vaccines, the Vaccines for Children (VFC) program may be able to help. The VFC program provides vaccines at no cost to children under 19 years of age who are Medicaid eligible, have no health insurance, are underinsured, or an American Indian or Alaskan Native. To find out more about the VFC program, visit www.cdc.gov/vaccines/programs/vfc/, speak with your doctor, or contact MMDHD. Immunizations protect future generations. If we continue vaccinating, and vaccinating completely, parents in the future may be able to trust that some diseases of today will no longer be around to harm their children. Parents should consult with their health care provider if they are unsure if their "}
