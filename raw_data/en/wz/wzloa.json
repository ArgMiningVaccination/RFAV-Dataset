Role was called. Approval of Minutes MOTION: To approve the minutes of the August 9 , 2012 meeting as presented. CARRIES11 -0. Director's Report Staff addition and recognition Ariel Smits was recognized as having achieved 5- years of state service. Jason Gingerich was welcomed back to the staff , this time as a policy analyst. Darren Coffman clarified his new role. Meeting time amended A few months ago, the meeting time was pushed forward an hour, causing some issue for members who travel longer distances. Coffman suggest ed changing it to 1:30- 4:30 pm to see if that would provide relief. Others indicated a potential problem with the time change. The members agreed to try the new start time for the next meetin g. HERC Minutes October 11, 2012 Page 2 Subcommittee membership Dr. Susan Williams, an orthopedic surgeon from Roseburg , was nominated and accepted as a subcommittee member for VbBS. Coffman noted Dr. Ed Toggart has resigned from HTAS and Dr. Timothy Keenen (previously appointed) now has a schedule that allows him to participate. Rules Advisory Committee Coffman gave an update on the development of administrative rules. There is a requirement to convene a Rules Advisory Committee consisting of r epresentati ves who are impacted by our process including members from s ubcommittees, industry, advocacy associations , key stakeholders , etc. This process will h elp ensure policy consistenc ies on reviewed topics , revision schedules, and public comment issues. This process will also define when and how additional expertise outside of seated subcommittee members is incorporated . HERC leadership will coordinate with staff to manage membership and hope to convene a meeting in mid -November of approximately 3 hours. Dr. Chan expressed interest in participating. Policies Coverage Recommendations Algorithm & Guidance Development Framework Principles Handout Livingston explained how the algorithm was developed and the intended use when vetting evidence for guidelines and coverage guidance topics. It helps answer the question of what to do when there are different levels of evidence among the trusted sources . There has been feedback from OHP Medical Directors who expres sed they are looking to this body to make the hard decisions on coverage guidance issues. Accordingly , EbGS nuanced the algorithm to minimize areas of indecisiveness. This is seen to be a working document. Livingston mentioned an area in need of clarification is to d efine what is meant by the statement \"Treatment is prevalent.\" Members agreed this is a useful working document; they would like additional discussion and time to digest the information. OHP Medical Directors have expressed an inter est in thi s Commission making coverage recommendations on topics where there more controversy. Dr. Chan stated his opinion that doing so would take a full guideline development team to manage. Coffman mentioned HERC budget currently has funding for two evi dence- based guideline reviews and two health technology reviews per year . Considering the new framework, Livingston shared the EbGS members felt a different decision might have been made for coverage guidance of Femoroacetabular Impingement Syndrome Surgery ( page 17 ), which was previously tabled. The new algorithm does not allow for tabling a subject. OHP Medical Directors have asked for direct ion. Should this topic move back to subcommittee for further review? HERC Minutes October 11, 2012 Page 3 MOTION: Return FIA to EbGS for further review. CARRIES: 11 -0. Public Testimony and Materials Submission Criteria for Topic Review on the Placement of Services on the Prioritized List for the Health Evidence Review Commission ( page 24 ): Additional language recommended (in blue) amending the criteria for rare clinical conditions. MOTION: To adopt the proposed topic review policy as written. Carries 11- 0. Health Evidence Review Commission Policy on Acceptance of Testimony and Guidelines for Speakers & Presenters (page 26 ): Additional language recommended (in red) to guide public comment received 7- days prior to a meeting . This is related to the HERC Coverage Guidance Process policy (page 27- 28): Additional language recommended (in red) in response to coverage guidance public comments submitted outside the 30 -day public comment window. Gibson expressed concern about public comment forwarded to members the week before the meeting and wonders if some might see that as an advantage, where staff cannot review and analyze those comments. He would like to see individuals attend meetings to give oral testimony . Members discussed only accepting written comments during the 30- day public comment period. Staff will work with leadership to wordsmith and bring back for review in January. MOTION: To return the proposed polic ies for additional staff work. Carries 11- 0. Subcommittee Reports Value- based Benefits Subcommittee (VbBS) Report (HERC meeting materials pages 31-98) Ariel Smits, Cat Livingston and Lisa Dodson reported the VbBS had met earlier in the day , October 11th. Each helped to summarize a number of topics discussed. Recommendations for interim changes were reviewed, adjusting the Prioritized List into compliance with the previously HERC -approved coverage guidances on the following topics ( pages 72 -90) (Full text can be found in the 10/11/12 VbBS minutes, Attachment B ): Artificial Disc Replacement to be included as an alternative to fusion when certain criteria are met Non-Pharmacologic I nterventions For Treatment -Resistant Depression o Discussion to disambiguate l anguage , ensuring \"anti -depressant\" is used rather than \"pharmacologic \" treatments o Add repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation and electroconvulsive therapy options only after failure of at least two antidepressants Neuroimaging In Dementia: new guideline added to include neuroimaging only for ruling out reversible causes of dementia Adva nced Imaging For Low Back Pain (incorporated into existing Diagnostic Guideline D4): limits advanced imaging to only patients with certain red -flag conditions HERC Minutes October 11, 2012 Page 4 Elective Induction of Labor (incorporated into existing Guideline Note 85) : clarified noncoverage of elective induction of labor prior to 41 weeks except in certain cases such as maternal diabetes, prelabor rupture of membranes, etc MOTION: To accept the VbBS recommendations as stated to adjust the Prioritized list to incorporate the five coverage guidances presented to be effective 4/1/13 . Carries: 11-0. Additional Neuroimaging is currently HERC -approved; some red- flag features might lead to inappropriate imaging. Staff recommends returning this coverage guidanc e to subcommittee for additional review. MOTION: To return Neuroimaging for Headache coverage guidance to EbGS for additional review. CARRIES: 11 -0. VbBS r ecommendations for other interim changes, effective 4/1/13 include: Coding recommendations: o Add codes for peripheral neuropathies to covered nerve disorder lines o Add spinal arthrodesis codes to lines that had some, but not all, of the spinal arthrodesis codes o Add acupuncture and cognitive behavioral therapy to the low back pain lines and delete spinal traction coverage o Add artificial disc replacement codes to the covered and the uncovered spinal conditions lines o Recommend DMAP add electromyelography to the Diagnostic List o Add t ranscranial magnetic stimulation coverage to the major depression line o Add procedures for the treatment of congenital dislocation of the hip Guideline notes recommendations: o Guideline Note 7, Erythropoiesis -Stimulating Agent (ESA) - Amend to require reassessment of ESA use at 12 rather than 8 weeks of therapy for patients with r enal insufficiency. o Guideline Note 37 , Disorders o f Spine With Neurologic Impairment - Clarify the definition of radiculopathy, edit lines/diagnoses . o Guideline Note 47, Urinary Incontinenc e - Modify to remove electrical stimulation as a possible modality as a requirement to be tried prior to surgery. o Guideline Note 92, Acupuncture - Revise to allow coverage for low back pain for 12 visits and for tension headache. o New Guideline Note 100, Smoking a nd Spinal Fusion - This guideline allows coverage of non -emergent spinal fusion only for non- smoking patients. Brief discussion of discrimination to smokers ; though smoking cessation is covered; this guideline is for non -emergent conditions only. Smits notes this language has been reviewed by several area spine surgeons. Public comment from Dr. Vinod Dasa, a Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center orthopedic surgeon (total joint) with no declared conflicts : He expressed concern that this proposed guideline moves the decision making away from the surgeon. Another point to consider is the development of technology to augment fusion which may make exclusion HERC Minutes October 11, 2012 Page 5 for smoking obsolete. He urged caution about making blanket statements which limit a physician's ability to care appropriately for their patient. Recomm endations for the biennial list (10/ 1/14) include ( pages 90- 96): ICD-10-CM conversion recommendations: o Add codes for foreign body in GI tract to a covered line with a guideline specifying when these codes are on the covered line and when on the uncovered lines o Add albinism codes to the precancerous skin condition line; add oculocutaneous albinism codes to an ophthalmology line MOTION: To accept the other coding an d guideline VbBS recommendations as stated. See the VbBS minutes of 10/11/12 for a full description. Carries: 11- 0. Health Technology Assessment Subcommittee (HTAS) Report Wally Shaffer explained there is one coverage guidance from this subcommittee being proposed today (overview in the meeting materials on pages 104- 107). HTAS Coverage Guidance Recommendation: Viscosupplementation for Osteoarthritis of the Knee (page 108 ) The 30- day public comment period on the draft guideline closed May 30, 2012. Public comments were received and considered. This technology is an injection therapy for knee arthritis . The intent of this technology is to find a t reatment that is between conservative care (with anti -inflammatory medications) and knee replacement surgery. There is an extensive body of evidence that shows effectiveness is marginal. Several individuals representing patients, providers and product manufacturers gave public comment, all in supported of coverage for this procedure. Commission members discussed these comments but also mentioned most patients see no benefit or experience harm from these procedures, and that the evidence considered shows a benefit which may not be clinically significant . Public comments (see * above for individuals who provided comments ) focused on several areas: Personal testimonies from physicians and patients with report s of successful viscosupplementation treatment urge coverage of the procedure. Testimony raising concerns about the quality of the evidence used in the noncoverage determination. Concerns included inclusion of inappropriately selected patients in the studies, known as selection bias. Testimony that analgesics are insufficient or contraindicated for some patients. Steroids have adverse effects. The only other alternative is knee replacement, which is more expensive and more invasive. Testimonies observing other similar bodies and other payers have decided to cover the procedure. MOTION: To approve the report of the Health Technology Assessment Subcommittee including the coverage guidance on viscosupplementation. Carries 11 -0. HERC Minutes October 11, 2012 Page 6 Approved Coverage Guidance: Evidence- based Guidelines Subcommittee (EbGS) Report Wiley Chan, EbGS Chair, and Livingston explained there are two coverage guidances being proposed today (overview of the two available in the meeting materials on pages 131 -139). Percutaneous Interventions for Low Back Pain ( page 140 ) The 30-day public comment period on the draft guideline closed September 7, 2012 . Epidural steroid injection is a minimally invasive procedure employed to relieve neck, arm, back, and leg pain caused by inflamed spinal nerves and herniated discs. For radiculopathy due to herniated lumbar disc, evidence on benefits of epidural steroid injection is mixed, with some trials finding moderate short -term benefits and others finding no differences. There is no convincing evidence that epidural steroids are associated with long- term benefits and most trials found no reduction in rates of subsequent surgery. For nonradicular low back pain, there is no convincing evidence that show steroid injections or other interventional therapies to be effective. There is consistent evidence that facet joint steroid injection, prolotherapy and intradiscal steroid injections are no more effective than sham therapies. Management of Chronic Otitis Media with Effusion in Children (page 155 ) The 30- day public comment period on the draft guideline closed September 7 , 2012. This coverage guidance recommendation is for a procedure where a small plastic or metal tube is placed within the tympanic mem brane to equalize the pressure behind the eardrum and to allow for adequate drainage of any fluid within the middle ear space (effusion) . The evidence shows a likely decrease in duration of middle ear effusion that provides a short -term improvement in hearing that dissipates by 12 months. There are no clear risk factors that identify children who should have PE (pressure -equalization) tubes placed. Watchful waiting for 3 to 6 months is an appropriate initial step in the management of OME . There is no evidence that antihistamines, decongestants or nasal steroids are effective treatments. Also considered was adenoidectomy , which may improve middle ear effusions at six months but does not lead to significant improvements in hearing or in recurrent acute otitis media . Autoinflation may have some benefits in terms of resolution of effusion, HERC COVERAGE GUIDANCE Viscosupplementation should not be covered for the treatment of pain associated with Osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee. HERC Minutes October 11, 2012 Page 7 while oral steroids and antibiotics show short -term benefit but longer term improvement is eithe r not sustained or is uncertain. Livingston shared some discussion the EbGS members had over the wording change from \"should\" to \"may\" be covered; they questioned if that ambiguity could lead to increased confusion and testing. Given the OHP Medical Direc tor's recent request for more solid guidance, Dodson wondered if the perceived ambiguity in this guidance might present an issue. Coffman responded medial directors have reviewed the language proposed and found it acceptable. Members agree the wording chan ge is intended to help guide health plans when making a decision for individual coverage. MOTION: To accept the report of the Evidence -based Guidelines Subcommittee , including the recommended coverage guidances on percutaneous interventions for low back pain and the management of chronic otitis media in children. Carries 11- 0. Approved Coverage Guidances HERC COVERAGE GUIDANCE For radicular low back pain , Epidural steroid injections should be covered for patients with persistent radiculopathy due to herniated lumbar disc; it is recommended that shared decision -making regarding epidural steroid injection include a specific discussion about inconsistent evidence showing moderate short -term benefits, and lack of long- term benefits. If an epidural steroid injection does not offer benefit, repeated injections should not be covered. Epidural steroid injections should NOT be covered for central spinal canal stenosis. For radicular low back pain , the following treatments NOT be covered: coblation nuceleoplasty radiofrequency denervation For nonradicular low back pain, the following treatments should NOT be covered: facet joint corticosteroid injection prolotherapy intradiscal corticosteroid injection local injections (including trigger point injections) botulinum toxin injection epidural steroid injection intradiscal electrothermal therapy (IDET) thermocoagulation HERC Minutes October 11, 2012 Page 8 Coverage Guidance Discussion Additional discussion centered on what type of coverage guidance recommendations HERC expects from EbGS and HTAS. Some options: Strictly about the evidence Reflect coverage for a baseline benefits package Something else Chan said he has observed there usually are graded recommendations; a weak recommendation would state \"may\" while a strong recommendation, one that most individuals would want/need and provide good outcome and performance metrics , would employ phrases like \"should\" or \"must.\" Perhaps weak recommendations should be excluded under basic benefit packages. Craft and others expressed concern about how a guidance of \"may\" would be implemented. Shaffer shared, in OHP there are three factors for decision making, in order of importance: Where does the condition fall on the Prioritized L ist, above or below the f unding line? Does the condition pair with the treatment ? Are there guideline notes? Coffman noted the phrasing \"may\" could be seen as useful for V bBS, as the Legislature determines cover age while HERC (through VbBS) determines priority. Stronger language could be seen as a mandate for coverage. HERC COVERAGE GUIDANCE Antibiotic and other medication therapy (including antihistamines, decongestants, and nasal steroids) should not be covered for children with children with otitis media with effusion (OME) (without another appropriate diagnosis). There should be a 3 to 6 month watchful waiting period after diagnosis of otitis media with effusion, and if documented persistent hearing loss is greater than or equal to 25dB in the better hearing ear, referral for tympanstomy surgery may be covered, given short, but not long- term, improvement in hearing. Formal audiometry should be covered for children with chronic OME present for 3 months or longer. Children with language delay, learning problems, or significant hearing loss should have hearing testing covered initially upon diagnosis. Children with chronic OME who are not at risk for language or developmental delay should be reexamined at 3- to 6-month intervals until the effusion is no longer present, significant hearing loss is identified, or structural abnormalities of the eardrum or middle ear are suspected. Adenoidectomy should not be covered at the time of the first pressure equalization tube insertion. Patients with craniofacial anomalies, Down's syndrom e, cleft palate, and patients with speech and language delay along with hearing loss should have coverage based on an individualized treatment plan. HERC Minutes October 11, 2012 Page 9 Kirk commented it could be employed to determine levels of cost -sharing in a commercial plan/ value based benefit design. Westbrook contended the phrasing could lead to appropriate physician- patient decision- making. Livingston suggested creat ing a value judgment of marginal benefit which could also drive cost -sharing. Dodson felt we should determine whether the treatment/technology is effective enough in the aggregate that we should devote resources to it. Members agree it makes sense to have subcom mittees answer key questions that are up for interpretation. Coffman suggested a \"consumer reports\" type of visual layout of the criteria. MOTION: To have staff and HERC leadership review the methodology by which EbGS and HTAS submit reports to HERC for consideration and attempt to place them into a more formulaic methodology. CARRIES: 11 -0. Trusted Sources List (pages 165- 190) Livingston reviewed two potential additions to the Commission's list of trusted sources : Institute for Clinical and Economic Review (ICER) ( pages 169 -182) o Reviews look predominantly at cost effectiveness o Potential for unique information o Trusted vendor for the Washington HTA program (current trusted source) o Receive funding from and have an advisory board that includes industry Have well developed policies on the role of the advisory board Choosing Wisely\u00ae ( pages 183- 188) o National campaign started by the American Board of Internal Medicine o Charged specialty societies to self -identify 5 tests or procedures commonly used in their field, whose necessity should be questioned and discussed o Part of a multi -year effort to help physicians be be tter stewards of finite health care resources Chan expressed unease at naming Choosing Wisely \u00ae a \"trusted\" source, because of the selection methodology. Livingston stated it may be used when no other source is available- noting the quality (or lack ) of evidence. The informati on is useful but it would not be regarded as good evidence in all cases. Coffman suggested we might include in under the section currently dedicated to guidelines where sources employ variable methods , though the language would need to be nuanced. MOTION: To accept Institute for Clinical and Economic Review (ICER) as a trusted source. CARRIES: 11- 0. MOTION: To accept Choosing Wisely\u00ae as a source with variable methods which is searched in the process of developing guidelines/coverage guidances/health technology assessments and topics for consideration. CARRIES: 11- 0. HERC Minutes October 11, 2012 Page 10 Prioritization Review a nd Next Topics Given the discussion on cover age guidance today (and the formation of an ad hoc group to discuss the direction) , EbGS and HTAS should continue to meet but refrain from developing any final guidance recommendations. Public Comment There was no further public comment at this time. Adjournment Meeting was adjourned at 5:07 pm. Next meeting will be from 1 :30-4:30 pm on Thursday, January 10, 2013 at the Meridian Park Hospital Health Education Center in Conf . Room 117 B&C. Value -based Benefit Subcommittee Report Value-based Benefits Subcommittee Summary Recommendations, 10/11//12 Value- based Benefits Subcommittee Recommendations Summary For Presentation to: Health Evidence Review Commission on October 11, 2012 For specific coding recommendations and guideline wording, please see the text of the (10/11 /12) VbBS minutes. CODE MOVEM ENT Spinal arthrodesis codes were added to lines that had some, but not all, of the spinal arthrodesis codes Acupuncture and cognitive behavioral therapy were added to the low back pain lines Spinal traction was removed from the low back pain lines Artific ial disc replacement was added to the covered and the uncovered spinal conditions lines Electromyelography was recommended to be moved from the Ancillary to the Diagnostic List Transcranial magnetic stimulation was added to the major depression line A seri es of straightforward code changes were accepted Injections into the labyrinth were added for treatment of Meniere's disease Several procedures were added for the treatment of congenital dislocation of the hip ITEMS CONSIDERED BUT NO CHANGES MADE An unspecific ICD-9 code for toe walking was considered for movement from an uncovered line to a covered dysfunction line; however, a more specific code for tendon contractures was found to pair with the desired treatment and was felt to represent more appropriat e coding A guideline for neuroimaging in headache was considered, but will be revisited in December GUIDELINE CHANGES A series of guidelines were revised to ensure consistency between the Prioritized List and HERC- approved coverage guidances DIAGNOSTIC GUIDELINE D4, ADVANCED IMAGING FOR LOW BACK PAIN was changed to include the imaging recommendation table included in the HERC low back pain evidence- based guideline GUIDELINE NOTE 85, ELECTIVE INDUCTION OF LABOR. The Guideline Note was clarified to indicat e that elective induction of labor is not covered for elective induction of labor prior to 41 weeks except in the cases of maternal diabetes, prelabor rupture of membranes, or other medical or obstetrical indications. Other guideline notes were revised: GUIDELINE NOTE 7, ERYTHROPOIESIS -STIMULATING AGENT (ESA) GUIDELINE. The Guideline Note was changed to require reassessment of ESA use at 12 rather than 8 weeks of therapy for patients with renal insuffi ciency. GUIDELINE NOTE 37 DISORDERS OF SPINE WITH NE UROLOGIC IMPAIRMENT was modified to clarify the definition of radiculopathy and which lines contained which diagnoses GUIDELINE NOTE 47, URINARY INCONTINENCE. The Guideline Note was modified to not include electrical stimulation as a possible modality that could be required to be tried prior to surgery. GUIDELINE NOTE 92, ACUPUNCTURE was revised to allow coverage for low back pain for 12 visits and for tension headache New guidelines were adopted: GUIDELINE NOTE XXX, SMOKING AND SPINAL F USION . This guideline allows coverage of spinal fusion only for non -smoking patients. GUIDELINE NOTE XXX, FOREIGN BODIES IN TH E GI TRACT was adopted to specify that hazardous foreign bodies would be c overed on a higher line, nonhaz ardous bodies on a lower line A series of new guidelines were adopted to ensure consistency between the Prioritized List and HERC- approved coverage guidances GUIDELINE NOTE XXX , ARTIFICIAL DISC REPL ACEMENT was adopted which details when artificial disc replacement would potentially be covered. GUIDELINE NOTE XXX , NON- PHARMACOLOGIC INTERVENTIONS FOR TREATMENT -RESISTANT DEPRESSION was adopted to require trials of two antidepressant medications prior to ECT or repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation DIAGNOSTIC GUILDELINE XXX, NEUROIMAGING IN DEMENTIA was adopted specifying when neuroimaging is covered for the work up of dementia CHANGES FOR THE OCTO BER 1, 2014 (TENTATI VE) PRIORITIZED LIST AS PART OF THE ICD- 10 CONVERSION PROCES S Various ICD -10 codes for peripheral neuropathies were moved f rom an uncovered sprain/strain line to covered nerve disorder lines Foreign body codes were added to a covered line with a guideline specifying when these codes are on the upper covered and when on the lowered uncovered lines Albinism codes were added to t he precancerous skin condition line; certain albinism codes involving conditions of the eyes were also added to an ophthalmology line Value-based Benefits Subcommittee Minutes, 10/11/12 Page 3 VALUE -BASED BENEFITS SUBCOMMITTEE Meridian Park Health Education Center October 11 , 2012 8:30 AM - 1:30 PM Members Present: Lisa Dodson, MD, Chair; Kevin Olson, MD, Vice -chair; Coffman; Ariel Smits, MD, MPH; Cat Liv ingston, MD, MPH Jason Gingerich; Dorothy Allen Also Attending: Denise Taray (DMAP ); Kathy Kirk, Oregon Pain Management Commission Roll Call/Minutes Approval/Staff Report The meeting was called to order at 8:30 am and roll was called. Minutes from t he August 9, 2012 VbBS meeting were reviewed and approved as submitted. ACTION: HERC staff will post the approved minutes on the website as soon as possible. An orthopedic surgeon from Roseburg has expressed interest in joining the VbBS/HERC. The HERC has been looking for surgical expertise in a member. The subcommittee had no objections to having the HERC consider her for VbBS membership. She will likely be joining the VbBS for the December meeting. Coffman discussed having a possible new timeline for dealing with new CPT codes. These codes are expected to be published in September rather than late October. The VbBS may take these codes up in November (starting in 2013) and publish a new List on January 1 st to allow the new codes to be incorporat ed into the List in a timely fashion. The downside of this proposal would be to have a longer time between Lists (January 1 and October 1 rather than April 1 and October 1). Kirk reported that the plans did not have an issue with the delayed code publication to date. HERC staff will continue to examine this possible change and update the subcommittee. Smits presented a HERC staff request for input from the subcommittee for dealing with treatments with low effectiveness and high cost. Two options woul d be a specific guideline for each new class of treatment or a general guideline outlining general coverage guidance. Gibson thought that a set of principles for coverage would be useful . Ocker suggested that some of these treatments should still be brou ght to the committee to review. Coffman mentioned that previous discussions with the HSC had brought up issues about having an absolute number ( QALY threshold) in a guideline. Kirk urged staff to consider the guideline note method as these notes have been very useful for the plans and in the legal process. Value-based Benefits Subcommittee Minutes, 10/11/12 Page 4 Topic: Mononeuritis and other peripheral neuropathies Discussion: Livingston introduced a summary document with suggested placement changes for ICD- 10 codes for peripheral neuropathies on the 2014 list. It was clarified the new acute peripheral nerve injury line included surgical treatment only. There was minimal discussion and changes were approved as proposed. Actions: 1) G57.10 -G57.13 moved from line 638 to lines 535 and 557 2) G57.20 -G57.22 moved from line 638 to lines 450 (new line on October 1, 2014 List), 535 and 557. 3) G57.40 -G57.42 moved from line 557 to line 441 4) G58.8 -G58.9 moved from line 638 to lines 535 and 557 5) DMAP advised to move G59 from line 638 to the Excluded File Topic: Toe walking Discussion: Smits introduced a summary regarding coverage of toe walking. Kirk brought up that most toe -walking self resolves and therefore does not need to be covered. Pollack was concerned about the cases in which kids have an underlying medical condi tion which results in the toe walking, such as cerebal palsy. In CP and other cases, there are true ligament contractures. The group felt that ligament contractures should be covered, but not toe walking per se. Smits noted that 727.18 (ligament contrac ture) was on line 318 and paired with the tendon lengthening CPT code requested for treatment of toe walking. The decision was that 727.18 could be used to code for this condition when surgery is required. Providers may need to be educated that this pair ing exists on line 318. Toe walking (ICD -9 739.79) was not added to line 318. Actions: No changes made to the Prioritized List Topic: Erythropoeisis stimulating guideline revision Discussion: Livingston introduced a summary document regarding sugges ted changes to the erythropoeisis stimulating agents (ESAs) guideline. There was some discussion about use of ESAs for conditions not currently included in the guideline, such as anemia resulting from treatment including multiple medications for hepatitis C. The decision was not to consider adding any indications until specifically requested to review ESAs for a new particular indication. The requested change increasing the reassessment period in renal failure to 12 weeks was accepted. Actions: A revis ed guideline note was adopted as shown in Attachment A. Topic: Radiculopathy and guideline note 37 Discussion: Livingston introduced a summary document with suggested changes to guideline note 37. There was a discussion about adding radiculopathy and members Value-based Benefits Subcommittee Minutes, 10/11/12 Page 5 suggested a language modification could be made for greater clarity. There were clarifying suggestions about which portion of the guideline applied to which line on the Prioritized List. Actions: A revised diagnostic guideline was approved as shown in Attachment A. Topic: Guideline for spinal fusion and smoking Discussion: Smits introduced a summary with a suggested new guideline regarding smoking and spinal fusion. There was some discussion about whether it would be problematic to require testing on the day of surgery. Kirk felt that the guideline as written was implementable and the requirement for testing was not significantly different from the bariatric surgery guideline. There was concern that there w as no restriction to not smoke af ter surgery; however, it was felt that such restrictions would not be feasible. Gibson suggested that, because there are multiple types of surgery which have better outcomes with non- smoking, a more general guideline limiting most types of surgery to non-smokers should be considered. However, it was felt that the evidence reviewed showed decrease efficacy with smoking and spinal fusion; evidence was not reviewed for other types of surgery. Ocker expressed concern for discrimination with this guideline. She was concerned that smokers may tend to have other characteristics such as poor diet, sedentary lifestyle, etc. She suggested that patient education may be more valuable than a restrictive guideline. Other members agreed that there was a concern about discrimination. However, the general consensus was that the evidence supported this guideline. Additionally, restricting smoking had precedence in other rules such as restricting alcohol use prior to liver transplant. Spinal fusion is generally an el ective surgery, which gives patients time to quit smoking. Dodson reminded the subcommittee that OHP covers tobacco cessation treatments, so patients would all have access to these types of services. The group felt that Ocker's concerns about patient edu cation and optimizing lifestyle issues should be brought up again when this guideline was discussed at HERC. The group also added a clause to the guideline specifying that patients have access to tobacco cessation services. There was discussion that spi nal fusion surgery has marginal effectiveness, so any restrictions which improve outcomes are useful. There was also support for having patients have accountability for optimizing their own health outcomes. DMAP raised concerns about the suggested guideline specifying \"non -elective\" spinal surgery. There was a question about what the definition of elective was. The subcommittee felt that only emergent indications would require a waiving of the non - smoking guideline and changed that wording in the guideline. Emergent indications were thought to be neurologic conditions which were unstable, such as rapidly progressing neurological deterioration. An emergent indication would be one for which delay in treatment would reasonably be expected to result in permanent serious dysfunction. The decision was to change the language to \"emergent\" without a specific definition in the guideline. If there is a problem in defining emergent in practice, then DMAP or the health plans can bring this guideline back for fur ther modifications. Value-based Benefits Subcommittee Minutes, 10/11/12 Page 6 Actions: 1) A new guideline was adopted as shown in Attachment B. 2) Add 22532- 22548, 22590- 22632 to line 84 DEEP ABSCESSES, PERIORBITAL ABSCESS; INTESTINAL PERFORATION 3) Add 22532- Urinary Incontinence Guideline Discussion: Smits introduced a summary document with suggested changes to the urinary incontinence guideline. There were some questions about whether electrical stimulation was part of physical therapy. Ocker noted that some of the literature showed acupuncture treatments, others showed electrical pads as the therapy. Kirk noted that electrical stimulation was billed in addition to PT. Dodson expressed concern about limiting the modalities used by a PT. Smits pointed out that electrical stimulation (CPT 97014) was currently on the Excluded List, so we are not covering it currently. The subcommittee agreed to not add coverage for this service and to remove reference to this s ervice from the current urinary incontinence guideline. Actions: A revised guideline note was adopted as shown in Attachment A Topic: Coverage Guidance for Low Back Pain/Acupuncture Guideline Discussion: Livingston introduced a summary of changes to t he Prioritized List to make it consistent with the HERC coverage guidance for low back pain. There was discussion about adding coverage for low back pain, which has traditionally been below the funding line. However, OHP is currently paying for primary care visits for this diagnosis. Members discussed that as OHP moves toward CCOs, there may be additional incentive to cover services such as yoga. There was some concern about CCOs not being willing to accept the global budget amounts , which would make suc h coverage less likely. Currently, many patients with back pain are treated by pain clinics, but there is an access issue for both pain clinics and primary care for patients with back pain and narcotic prescriptions. There is an emerging issue of PCPs unwilling to see patients who are taking narcotics at all. There was some discussion about requiring referrals for acupuncture. Ocker was concerned that this might limit access. Others expressed concern that acupuncturists may not be able to make a dia gnosis, which would be required for coverage. Seeing a PCP and getting identified as having a covered diagnosis would be facilitated by requiring referral for acupuncture. There was concern that some PCPs would refuse to refer to acupuncture as they do not feel that it is effective. The subcommittee expressed their intent to not limit acupuncture access, but rather to have a referral to maintain continuity between the PCP and acupuncturist. Further discussion of the acupuncture guideline centered around the number of visits allowed for low back pain. The decision was 12 visits was a reasonable place to start. Ocker felt that 12 visits was a reasonable number for any chronic pain condition. Value-based Benefits Subcommittee Minutes, 10/11/12 Page 7 The decision was to add coverage for acupuncture and CBT t o lines 400 and 562 (the back lines). Spinal traction will no longer be covered per the coverage guidance. A coding specification will be added to these lines to specify that CBT is only covered for certain back pain diagnoses. The acupuncture guideline was modified to reflect coverage for low back pain. An additional modification was made to the acupuncture guideline to allow coverage for tension headaches. HERC staff will work with Ocker to consider other conditions to be added to the acupuncture gui deline. Actions: 1) Add acupuncture (97810 -4) to lines 400 and 562. 2) Add cognitive behavioral therapy (90804- 15) to lines 400 and 562 3) Delete spinal traction (CPT code 97012) from lines 400 and 562 4) Add a coding specification to Line 400 i. Cognitive behavioral therapy (90804- 15) only pair s on Line 400 with the low back a coding specification to Line 562 i. Cognitive behavioral therapy (90804- 15) only pair s on Line 562 wit h the low back shown in Attachment A . Topi c: Coverage Guidance for Artificial Disc R eplacement Discussion: Smits introduced a summary of changes suggested for the Prioritized List to allow agreement with the approved coverage guidance on artificial disc replacement. Livingston reminded the subcommittee that the data showed that artificial disks were non-inferior to spinal fusion. Olson pointed out that the HSC had not adopted coverage of artificial discs due to concer n about safety; however, the newer data reviewed to create the coverage guidanc e appeared to be more r eassuring about the safety of this procedure. It was also discussed that this procedure is safer than the alt ernative of spinal fusion. Dodson wanted the List to match the coverage guidance and the HTAS decision. It was pointed out that the diagnoses suggested to pair with artificial disc replacement were on lines 400 and 562 and the artificial disk CPT codes should be added to both lines. The decision was to adopt the guideline as suggested, with an additional reference to line 562. Actions: 1) Adopt a new guideline as shown in Attachment B 2) Add artificial disc replacement (CPT 22856 -22865) to line 400 and 562 Topic: Coverage Guidance for Neuroimaging for Low Back Pain Discussion: Livingston introduced a summary of changes suggested for the Prioritized List to allow agreement with the approved coverag e guidance on neuroimaging for low back pain. There was minimal discussion about the guideline. It was pointed out that Value-based Benefits Subcommittee Minutes, 10/11/12 Page 8 electromyelography (CPT 96002- 4) is used for diagnosis of a variety of conditions. The proposal was to not cover this service for the diagnosis of low back pain ; however, the group agreed that it should be covered for diagnosis for other conditions and moved from the Ancillary to the Diagnostic List. The intention is to not cover EMG for diagnosis of low back pain. Actions: 1) Advise DMAP to move electromyelography (CPT 96002- 4) from the Ancillary List to the Diagnostic List 2) Diagnostic guideline 4 modified as shown in Attachment A. Topic: Coverage G uidance for N onpharmacologic Interventions for T reatment Resistant Depression Discussion: Livingston introduced a summary of changes suggested for the Prioritized List to allow agreement with the approved coverage guidance on treatment resistant depression. Pollack expressed concern dismay that there was no evidence for treatments such as meditation, psychotherapy, etc. There was some discussion about clarifying what qualifies as two medications for depression. For example, sleep aids should not be considered medic ations. The medications should be SSRIs, SNRIs, tricyclic antidepressants or similar medications. There was som e concern that psychotherapy may not be reasonable to try in certain cases , such as catatonic patients . The group felt that the proposed guideline was reasonable, but changed the title to more closely reflect what was included in the guideline. Actions: 1) Transcranial magnetic stimulation codes 90867 - 90868 were added to Line 9 MAJOR DEPRESSION, RECURRENT; MAJOR DEPRESSION, SINGLE EPISODE, SEVERE 2) No change was made to 90869 placement 3) A new treatment guideline for nonpharmacologic interventions for treatment resistant depression was adopted for line 9 as shown in Attachment B Topic: Coverage Guidance for Neuroimaging for Dementia Discussion: Livingston introduced a summary of changes suggested for the Prioritized List to allow agreement with the approved coverage guidance on neuroimaging for dementia. The only modification requested to the proposed guideline was to add the reversible causes of dementia that were listed in the coverage guidance to the guideline. Actions: 1) A new diagnostic guideline for neuroimaging in dementia was adopted as shown in Attachment B Topic: Coverage Guidance for Neuroimaging for Headache Value-based Benefits Subcommittee Minutes, 10/11/12 Page 9 Discussion: Livingsto n introduced a summary of changes suggested for the Prioritized List to allow agreement with the approved coverage guidance on neuroimaging for headache. DMAP has made HERC staff aware that this guideline is unenforceable. This guideline needs to be reworked and brought back for consideration at the December meeting. Actions: 1) HERC staff to rework guideline and bring back to the December meeting Topic: Coverage Guidance for Elective Induction of Labor Discussion: Smits introduced a summary of chang es suggested for the Prioritized List to allow agreement with the approved coverage guidance on elective induction of labor. The guideline affected by this coverage guidance was previously reviewed in August. However, HERC staff on review found that the elective induction of labor guideline substantially did not match the coverage guidance. There was some discussion about whether elective induction should be limited prior to 39 weeks or prior to 41 weeks. Elective induction after 39 weeks is standard of care in many Oregon communities. However, there is no evidence that this improves outcomes, and it may cause harm. The group felt that the HERC should challenge community standard, when the evidence supports other practice. The group also felt that the Prioritized List should match HERC guidances. Actions: 1) A revised guideline note was adopted as shown in Attachment A Topic: ICD-10 Follow Up Foreign Body in the GI Tract Discussion: Livingston introduced a summary document regarding suggested chan ges to coverage of treatment of foreign bodies in the GI tract. There was minimal discussion. Actions: 1) Duplicate foreign body in GI tract codes currently on the 2014 biennial Prioritized List line 527 (T18.2xxA, T18.3xxA, T18.4xxA, INTUSSCEPTION, VOLVULUS, INTESTINAL OBSTRUCTION, HAZARDOUS FOREIGN BODY IN GI TRACT WITH RISK OF PERFORATION OR OBSTRUCTION 2) Rename Line 527 FOREIGN BODY IN GI TRACT WITHOUT RISK OF PERFORATION OR OBSTRUCTION . 3) Adopt a new guidel ine for lines 48 and 527 as shown in Attachment B for the 2014 biennial list Value-based Benefits Subcommittee Minutes, 10/11/12 Page 10 Topic: ICD -10 Follow Up Placement of Albinism Codes Discussion: Livingston introduced a summary document for changes involving albinism codes for the 2014 biennial list . The discussion centered around whether routine skin exams should be covered for persons with this condition. The suggested placement was on the prevention line (line 3); however, the line containing high risk skin conditions (line 257) was considered to be a better place to pair albinism with skin exam CPT codes. Ocular and cutaneous diagnoses would be on both the ophthamalogical and the skin lines. Cutaneous only diagnosis codes should only be on line 257. Actions: 1. Place E70.338 and E70.339 (with hematolog ic abnormality) on Line 329 DISORDERS OF AMINO -ACID TRANSPORT AND METABOLISM (NON PKU) Place oculocutaneous albinism codes (E70.31x and E70.32x) on Line STRABISMUS; OF 2. Place cutaneous AND E70.39 on line AL PREMALIGNANT AND CARCINOMA IN SITU Topic: Straightforward Issues Discussion: Smits presented a summary of straightforward changes to the Prioritized List. There was a brief discussion about adding cerumen impaction l avage (69210) to several lines or taking off all lines but 526. The group felt that the lavage was needed to treat the hearing loss or to diagnose otitis media and therefore should be on these lines. Uncomplicated cerumen impaction will stay on line 526. There was also discussion about adding PT/OT for treatment of brachial plexus. The group decided to add PT/OT to both lines with brachial plexus codes (lines 493 and 535). Actions: 1) Remove 59830 from line 1 2) Add 59830 to line 41 3) Add 75557- 75561, 75565 to line 50 4) Add 26665 to line 382 5) Add 26785 to line 297 6) Add 43262, 43264, 43265, 43268, and 43271 to line 308 7) Add 28190 to line 415 8) Remove 96920- 2 from lines 223, 386, 432, 517, 545, 553, 554 and 568 9) Add 61582 to line 320 10) Remove 839.40 from line 497 11) Add 839.40 to line 551 12) Add 77371 to line 466 13) Add 19120 to lines 197, 509 and 665 14) Advise DMAP to remove 19120 from the Ancillary List 15) Remove 11401 and 11402 from line 197 16) Remove 11623 from line 197 17) Remove 13122, 13132, and 13133 from line 197 18) Add 23470 and 23472 to line 208 19) Add 27130 to lines 89, 207, 308 and 382 Value-based Benefits Subcommittee Minutes, 10/11/12 Page 11 20) Add 27495 to line 208 21) Add 11043- 11047 to line 142 22) Add 76801, 76805, and 76815- 7 to line 59 23) Add 27495 to line 208 24) Add 61571 to line 101 25) Add 14000 to line 208 26) Add 14001 to lines 197, 216, 308, 448 27) Add 69210 to lines 383 and 470 28) Add 44120, 44121, and 44125 to line 88 29) Add 15100 and 15101 to lines 146, 167, 250, and 448 30) Add 44130 to line 341 31) Add 33530 to line 77 32) Add 12021 to line 216 33) Add 77418 and 77421 to line 165 34) Add 97001- 97004, 97110- 97124 to line 493 and 535 35) Add reference to line 493 and 535 to GUIDELINE NOTE 6, REHABILITATIVE THERAPIES 36) Add 92002- 92014 to lines 183, 292, 308, 320, and 448 37) Add 65430 to line 164 38) Add 44125 to lines 35 and 165 39) Add 99211- 99255 to line 173 40) Change the treatment description of line 173 to \"Medical and surgical treatment\" 41) Add 357.2 to line 535 42) Add 51705 and 51710 to line 351 43) Add 29828 to line 406 44) Remove 45378 from line 48 45) Advise DMAP to place 45378 on the Diagnostic List Topic: Intratympanic Gentamycin for Meniere's Disease Discussion: Smits presented a summary document. There was no discussion. Actions: 1) Add 69801 ( Discussion: Smits ented a summary document. There was no discussion. Actions: 1) Add 27001- 27006 (Open tenotomy, hip) to line 336 2) Add 27140- 27165 (osteotomy, hip or pelvis) to line 336 3) Add 77036 (capsulectomy or capsulotomy, hip) to line 336 4) Do not add hip arthroplasty (27130) to line 336 Value-based Benefits Subcommittee Minutes, 10/11/12 Page 12 Topic: Coverage Algorithm Discussion: Livingston presented a proposed coverage algorithm for discussion. A comment was raised that the burden of proof should be on those advocating the treatment. A discussion of coverage with evidence development ensued, and there were considerations such as less risk or harm, but unknown effectiveness. There was a discussion of standard of care and how to invest public resources and public dollars. The entire side of the algorithm in which there is i nsufficient or mixed evidence was felt to be risky for recommended coverage. If there is insufficient evidence, how can one know if it is safer and cheaper . The middle avenue on the algorithm should not have coverage. Actions: 1) Further discussion of the algorithm is planned for today's HERC meeting Public Comment: There was no additional public comment received.

CODE MOVEMENT The 20 13 CPT, HCPCS, and CDT codes were placed as shown in Attachment A These proposed placements will be placed on the HERC website to be available for viewing by the various health plans. Final approval of these placements will be done at the HERC meeting on January 10, 2013. These codes will appear on the April 1, 2013 Prioritized List as approved by the HERC in January. A missing tympanostomy tube removal procedure code was added to the acute mastoiditis line Tympanostomy procedure codes that were mistakenly not removed from the hearing loss line were removed A pharyngoplasty procedure code was added to the line with congenital neck problems ITEMS CONSIDERED BUT NO CHANGES MADE The use of silver compounds for treatment of dental caries was discussed but no decision regarding coverage was reached The prioritization of pseudobulbar affect was discussed but no deci sion was reached A prenatal genetic testing guideline was discussed, and a work group will be convened to write it Changes to the guideline for hysterectomy for menstrual bleeding disorder were discussed, and will be readdressed at a future meeting GUIDELINE CHANGES The coding specifications regarding cognitive behavioral therapy for low back pain were changed to indicate the correct CPT code Mistakes in the coding specification for bariatric surgery on the type 2 diabetes line were corrected The non-prenatal genetic testing guideline was modified to reflect changes needed for the new 2013 CPT genetic testing codes, as shown in Appendix C Two dental guidelines were modified and one deleted as shown in Appendix C The chronic otitis media with eff usion treatment guideline was modified as shown in Appendix C A new guideline allowing coverage of puberty suppression in adolescents under new gender dysphoria line was adopted for the ICD -10 (October 2014) Prioritized List as shown in Appendix B Value-based Benefits Subcommittee Minutes, 12/13/12 Page 2 VALU E-BASED BENEFITS SUBCOMMITTEE Meridian Park Health Education Center December 13, 2012 8:300 AM - 2:30 PM Members Present: Lisa Dodson, MD, Chair; Kevin Olson, MD, V ice-chair; none Present: Coffman; MPH; Cat Livingston, MD, AMH; Bruce Boston, OHSU P ediatric Endocrinology; Dr. Karin Selva, Legacy Pediatric ton, Transactive; Dr. Ericka King, OHSU Otolaryngology; Allergan; Gary Allen, DMD, Advantage Dental; Christina Schad, MD, and Julie Brown, Avenir Pharmaceuticals; Steven Duf fin, Oral Health Outreach; Beryl Fletcher, ODA; Deborah Loy, Capital Dental; Aubrey Harrison, Basic Rights Oregon . Roll Call/Minutes Approval/Staff Report The meeting was called t o order at 8:35 am and roll was called. Dr. Williams, an orthopedic surgeon practicing in Roseburg , was introduced as a new member of the subcommittee. Minutes from the 10/11/12 VbBS meeting were reviewed and approved with one change requested by Pollack regarding his remarks on the treatment resistant depression section . Action : HERC staff will post the approved minutes on the website as soon as possible. Coffman shared the work of a group that is trying to make the coverage guidance process more eff icient and more reflective of the actual authority of these guidances. There was a general discussion about what authority the guidances and Prioritized List guidelines have. The HERC has the authority to prioritize conditions, and the Legislature determ ines the coverage level. Other insurers or other bodies may or may not choose to follow these guidances. Value-based Benefits Subcommittee Minutes, 12/13/12 Page 3 Straightforward Discussion Topic: Straightforward Issues Table Discussion: Smits introduced a document with straightforward coding changes. There was no discussion. Actions: 1) Add 69424 to line 178. 2) Remove 69424 and 69433 from line 383 3) Add 42950 to line 71 Topic: Low Back Pain Coding Specifications Discussion: Smits introduced a document with changes needed for the low back pain line coding s pecifications . There was no discussion. Actions: 1) Add the following coding recommendation to Line 400 for the April 1, 2013 Prioritized List a. Cognitive behavioral therapy (90785 -90840) only pairs on Line 400 with the low back diagnoses (344.60, 722.1, 722. 2, 722.7, 724.4) 2) Add the following coding recommendation to Line 562 for the April 1, 2013 Prioritized List a. Cognitive behavioral therapy (90785 -90840) only pairs on Line 562 with the the following coding recommendation for Line 400 for the April 1, 2013 Prioritized List a. Cognitive behavioral therapy ( 90785 -90840 ) only pairs on Line 400 low back diagnoses (344.60, 722.1, 722.2, 722.7, 724.4) 4) Change the following coding recommendation for Line 562 for the April 1, 2013 Prioritized List a. Cognitive behavioral therapy (90785 -90840 ) only pairs on Line 562 with Bariatric Surgery Coding Specification Discussion: Smits introduced a document with changes neede d for the bariatric surgery line coding specifications on the April 1, 2013 list . There was no discussion. Actions: 1) The coding specification for line 33 was changed to read: CPT codes 43644 45 (laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding) are only included on this line as treatment according to the requirements in Guideline Note 8 when paired with: 1) a primary diagnosis of 250.x0 or 250.x2 (Type II Diabetes with or without complication); 2) a se condary diagnosis of 278.00 (Obesity, Unspecified) or 278.01 (Morbid Obesity); AND, 3) diagnosis code of -V85.4 05 (BMI >= CPT codes Discussion: Smits introduced several documents with recommendations for the placement of the 2013 CPT , CDT and HPCPS codes. These recommendations were accepted as shown in the meeting materials (see Appendix A) , with the exceptions below . Other code changes recommended in the various issue documents were also accepted as sh own in the meeting materials unless noted below. This discussion section includes the genetic testing and psychiatric CPT codes. 1) 52287 (chemodenervation of the bladder). The subcommittee altered the suggested guideline for this procedure to clarify that it was to be used for overactive bladder caused by several types of spinal diseases and that a patient must have failed appropriate pharmacologic management first rather than antimuscarinic medications, as there may be other types of appropriate medicatio n. 2) 64615 (Chemodenervation for migraine). This code is recommended to be added to the Excluded File as suggested by staff . There was considerable discussion about the differing recommendations of trusted sources (MED vs NICE). There was some discussion about these sources possibly using different studies or having differing amounts of industry and patient/provider input. Livingston said the MED report found studies with statistically significant differences with botulinum therapy, but that these differe nces were Value-based Benefits Subcommittee Minutes, 12/13/12 Page 5 not clinically significant. Dodson noted that this treatment might be cost effective if it lowered ER costs/utilization. Croswell as noted that chronic migraine patients are not very functional, and any therapy that would allow them to be more productive should be considered. Gibson recommended not covering due to lack of clinically significant outcomes. Kirk felt that this therapy was not medically appropriate based on the evidence. Payers could make exceptions for high ER utilizing patients if the payer felt that this might decrease their overall costs. Shaffer noted that this exception could not be made for FFS patients if the treatment was placed on the Excluded File. Livingston reviewed GRADE criteria and noted that this therapy would li kely not be recommended for coverage using this criteria. The decision was made to not cover. 3) 81235 (EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor) testing). The subcommittee recommended placing on the line which included the diagnosis of non -small cell lung ca ncer (line 278) , as this is the diagnosis for which this code is utilized (not the Diagnostic File). Olson noted that this procedure is a test on tumor tissue, not germ line tissue and therefore is not a genetic test. It therefore should not be included in the non -prenatal genetic testing guideline and that portion of the suggested guideline changes was not accepted. 4) 86152/86153 (Cell enumeration using immunologic selection) were recommended for placement on the Excluded File rather than the Diagnostic File. Olson stated that these tests are expensive and their place in cancer care is dubious. He recommended against coverage 5) 86711 (JC virus antibody) was placed on the multiple sclerosis and Crohn's disease lines (35 and 268) rather than the Diagnostic File. Livingston reported that this test is only FDA approved for use in these 2 indications. The subcommittee was concerned about over use for other indications without evidence of benefit. 6) 90839/90840 (psychotherapy for crisis) were not added to the low back pain lines (400 and 562) 7) 90863 (pharmacologic management) was recommended for addition to the Excluded File as this applies only to prescribed psychologists in 2 states (not Oregon). AMH suggested leaving this code open to allow for non -MD and non-NP mental health providers to bill for medication management. Pollack felt that this code was inappropriate for Oregon, as psychologists do not have prescribing privileges here. 8) 95782/95783 (pediatric polysomnography) are recommended to be placed on the Dia gnostic File rather than the Ancillary File, because the subcommittee felt that these tests are used in the diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea and other sleep issues. Pollack asked HERC staff to consider moving all polysomnography CPT codes from the Anc illary File to the Diagnostic File 9) The \"C\" HCPCS codes did not have placement determined. These codes are used solely during hospitalization and have never been included on the Prioritized List. There was discussion about the C codes for drug eluting cardiac stents. HERC staff was asked to consider having HTAS review drug eluting vs bare metal cardiac stent technology. Value-based Benefits Subcommittee Minutes, 12/13/12 Page 6 10) S8930 (electrical stimulation of auricular acupuncture points) had no final placement decision made. Ocker provided the Regence BCBS cov erage position on this technology, which is that it is investigational. Ocker and HERC staff will work with acupuncture experts to determine 1) if this HCPCS code is used solely for a device or if it is intended for use for standard electrical stimulation of ear points; 2) if an acupuncturist who does traditional electrical stimulation of ear points can use the usual acupuncture CPT codes for billing; 3) determine if this procedure should be added to any or all of the current lines which contain acupunctur e CPT codes. This topic will be readdressed at the January, 2013 VBBS meeting. 11) D7952 was added to line 648 (there was a mistake in line number listed in the meeting materials) Actions: 1) See Appendix A for new CPT, CDT and HCPCS code placements a. These pro posed placements will be placed on the HERC website to be available for viewing by the various health plans. Final approval of these placements will be done at the HERC meeting on January 10, 2013. These codes will appear on the April 1, 2013 Prioritized List as approved by the HERC in January. 2) 77435 was removed from all current lines and are recommended to be added to the Excluded File 3) A new guideline was added to line 351 as shown in Appendix B 4) 92973, 92975, 92977 were removed from all lines other than lines 51, 76, 108, and 195 5) The non -prenatal genetic testing guideline was modified as shown in Appendix C 6) Dental guidelines 17 and 53 were modified as shown in Appendix C 7) Dental guideline note 91 was deleted New Discussion Items Topic: Silver Nitrate Tr eatments For Dental Carie s Discussion: Livingston introduced a summary document regarding use of silver nitrate for treatment of dental caries. Deborah Loy, Capital Dental, submitted written testimony and gave oral testimony against allowing silver nitra te use. She felt that this treatment was not the right treatment for the vulnerable low income population it was targeted for. She testified that its use had no support from professional organization s and had no U.S. evidence to support its use. She feels that its use results in a very poor cosmetic outcome. She also argued that the various types of silver treatment are not interchangeable, and the usual agent used globally is not FDA approved in the US. Loy also acknowledged that if there were good ev idence available to support its use, she and others would reconsider, but at this point there is too little know n about harms and about comparative efficacy to current treatments. Value-based Benefits Subcommittee Minutes, 12/13/12 Page 7 Dr. Gary Allen a dentist with Advantage Dental , gave written and oral testim ony in favor of the use of silver compounds for treatment of dental caries. He testified that the MED review recommendations did not reflect the findings of the review itself. He feels that silver diamine fluoride has evidence of effectiveness, but that this technology is very old and much of the literature would not be found by a standard search of recent studies . He argued that the cosmetic outcome was not that poor, as it turns a n otherwise brown stain into a black stain . Silver compounds are used wi dely internationally to treat dental caries. However, these compounds are not approved in US for this use, but are under review for approval. Silver nitrate + fluoride varnish is being used by some dental providers in Oregon. Silver d iamine fluoride wou ld be preferred when available in the US. Dr. Allen argued that silver treatments would be another tool in the toolbox. The typical course of treatment would be 5 applications over a 3 -4 month period with restoration at the end of that course. He argued that halting the bacterial infection is important. He also felt that this therapy may be cost savings if avoiding hospitalization of children for extensive dental work . Tyack asked clarifying questions about the need for further restorative treatment after treatment with silver nitrate. Livingston noted that no stu dies looked at the comparative outcomes of repeated applications of silver diamide fluoride with delayed restor ation vs immediate restoration (what would be standard of care in the United State s). Tyack also expressed concern about the potential for discrimination against poor children with black teeth. Glass ionomer cement was offered as another alternative with superior cosmetic outcomes. Kirk noted that OHP dental director Mike Shirtcliff has reported significant decrease in ER visits with this treatment in his organization. Livingston also shared public testimony that had been received by Dr. Steven Duffin. Questions were asked about how silver treatments are billed. The reply was that these treatments are billed with the CDT code for \"desensitizing agent\" which is not-specific. If the proposed guideline specifying that it is not a covered treatment is not adopted , then dental plans may cover it. Jacobo noted that the desensitiv izing c ode is not currently reimbursed by DMAP and would not be reimbursed under FFS, but that the capitated dental plans could choose to reimburse for it . Tyack expressed concern s for high costs associated with this approach due to mid-level dental providers in FQHC model using this treatment and then billing at the very expensive FQHC wrap -around rate. Allen responded that this would not likely happen under a DCO global budgeting model. Lo y replied that even with DCO's, the FQHC wrap -around payment would stil l apply. Loy noted that the board of dentistry is currently looking into the type of provider that should be allowed to apply silver compounds. Value-based Benefits Subcommittee Minutes, 12/13/12 Page 8 Actions: The decision was to defer further discussion until the January VBBS meeting. The members will read over the materials in more detail. HERC staff will make a summary of the testimony (written and oral) and other evidence provided for this meeting. HERC staff will also consult the board of dentistry for input on this topic. Topic: Pseudobulbar A ffect Discussion: Smits introduced a summary document recommendations regarding the prioritization of pseudobulbar affect (PBA) . Testimony was heard from Christina Schad, MD , on behalf of Avanir Pharmaceuticals. She testified that PBA should be a covered condition, as this condition is under -recognized and undertreated . The prevalence of this condition is10 -20% of patients with underlying neurologic condition s and 40% of ALS patients. About 2 million Americans suffer from PBA. PBA causes distress, affe cts quality of life, and affects occupational functioning. It affects a patient's ability to interact with health care, participate in rehab, and can cause relationshi p issues. Dr. Schad testified that this condition is a significant burden on patients, family, and caregivers. Coffman noted that PBA would be covered as a co -morbid condition on the Prioritized List and that the ICD -9 code should be billed as a secondary code when an underlying condition is present . Pollack noted that he had a patient that he attempted to try this medication for, and had considerable difficulty obtaining coverage for it. He noted that the patient did not respond well to this treatment. He feels that PBA is a significant condition and should be covered. Smits noted th at a new line could be created for PBA with the next biennial review, and scored with the usual methodology. If more timely movement of this condition is needed, the VBBS could consider where such a line would be located and find a similar line in that ar ea of the List that the diagnosis could be added to. Actions: No decision was made. Staff will create a mock line with PBA and score it with the usual methodology and bring a proposed new code placement based on this theoretical line to the January VBB S meeting. HERC staff will also contact neurology experts for independent input. Coverage Guidances for R eview Topic: Viscosupplementation for O steoarthritis of the Knee Value-based Benefits Subcommittee Minutes, 12/13/12 Page 9 Discussion: This topic was tabled until the January VBBS meeting. Actions: Will be discussed at the January VBBS meeting. Topic: Percutaneous Interventions for Low Back Pain Discussion: This topic was tabled until the January VBBS meeting. Actions: Will be discussed at the January VBBS meeting. Topic: Management of Chronic O titis Media in C hildren Discussion: Livingston introduced a summary document with recommended changes to the otitis media treatment guideline. Dr. Ericka King from OHSU Pediatric ENT testified about concerns she and her colleagues have about the proposed changes to the guideline and about the literature used for the creation of the HERC coverage guidance on this topic. She recommended re -inserting the stricken language \" For the child who has had chronic OME and who has a hearing deficiency in the better -hearing ear of 25 dB or greater, myringotomy with tube insertion recommended after a total of 4 to 6 months of effusion with a documented hearing deficit.\" She said that children with a 25dB hearing loss are at risk for language delay. There was discussio n that the current location of chronic OME below the funding line was preventing children from getting needed care. The committee directed Dr. King to bring this concern to the legislature as it is a funding issue. Livingston brought up that the last s entence regarding individualized treatment plans was problematic for DMAP. She recommended putting in wording that ear tubes should be covered for these diagnoses. There was discussion about adding the CPT code for ear tube to these diagnosis lines (Down 's syndrome, craniofacial anomalies, etc.). Williams suggested adding PE tubes back to the hearing loss lines. Livingston noted that PE tubes were not indicated for hearing loss unless effusion is present, in which case the diagnosis would be on the ch ronic OME line. Actions: 1) The chronic otitis media treatment guideline was modified as shown in Appendix C. it will be brought back to the January VBBS meeting as a straightforward item. Value-based Benefits Subcommittee Minutes, 12/13/12 Page 10 Previous Discussion Items Topic: Puberty Suppression f or Transge ndered Youth Discussion: Smits introduced a summary document with information regarding puberty suppression in transgendered youth. Jenn Burle ton from TransActive , Dr. Karin Selva from Legacy Pediatric Endocrinology and Dr. Bruce Boston from OHSU Pediatr icc Endocrinology gave testimony in favor of coverage of this treatment. The main discussion was about the type of mental health evaluation that would be required prior to this therapy. There are several non -MD mental health providers who are very compet ent in this area. The proposed guideline wording was changed from \"psychiatric evaluation\" to \"mental health\" evaluation. Tyack and Olson made comments in support of coverage. Tyack felt that there was no alternative treatment and Olson felt that, desp ite weak evidence, the committee heard strong testimony about the utility of use in this vulnerable population. He also felt that this treatment was unlikely to be abused. Selva asked that HERC staff ensure that medical visit E&M codes are on the new Gender Dysphoria line for the ICD -10 Prioritized List to allow providers to see these patients for monitoring of this type of treatment. Note: staff reviewed the new line and it includes E&M codes appropriate for this type of care. Actions: 1) A new guidelin e for the gender dysphoria line on the ICD -10 list was adopted as shown in Appendix B Guidelines Topic: Guideline note 44, Menstrual Bleeding Disorders Discussion: Smits introduced a summary document regarding proposed changes to remove a defined hemogl obin level from guideline note 44. Williams expressed concern that without a specific number, there would be no method to objectively determine if anemia was present. Livingston noted that this guideline change would result in increased numbers of hyster ectomies for menstrual bleeding disorders. Taray noted that DMAP is already covering many of these cases without the documentation of this hemoglobin level, so the number of new cases with this change would likely be smaller than expected. She noted that there are about 2 cases per month approved by DMAP in the FFS population without a documented hemoglobin of 10. Kirk noted that his plan is using and enforcing this clause. In general, there was a sense that hysterectomy for this indication has significa nt potential for overuse. Value-based Benefits Subcommittee Minutes, 12/13/12 Page 11 Several alternate wording proposals were put forth. Livingston suggested adding language to require \"documented precipitous loss or requiring iron treatment.\" Dodson felt that there were already considerable \"hoops\" to get thro ugh in this guideline. She did not feel that the hemoglobin of 10 clause added much to the guideline. She felt that there was no good medical evidence that the value of 10 makes a difference as compared to any other value defining anemia. This number wa s picked arbitrarily. Taray suggested putting an OR between clauses 1a and 1b ; however, the group did not accept this suggestion as it would allow a patient with normal periods but anemia for an unrelated reason to qualify for a hysterectomy. Actions: 1) HERC staff will seek input from the OHP medical directors regarding the utility of having a hemoglobin level of 10 required in this guideline. HERC staff will also research other guidelines, such as Blue Cross, to see what type of definition is used for an emia, if any. This topic will be brought back to the March 2013 VBBS meeting (the next OHP medical directors meeting is after the January VBBS meeting) Topic: Prenatal genetic testing guideline Discussion: Livingston introduced a summary document regard ing plans to create a prenatal genetic testing guideline. The group decided that it should go through the coverage guidance process and engaging experts to assist. Actions: 1) HERC staff to identify experts and bring to a subsequent Evidence -based Guidelin es Subcommittee meeting Public Comment: No additional public comment was received Issues for next meeting: Coronary brachytherapy External elements exposure issues Stereotactic radiation therapy for intracranial AVMs ( Personal history of cancer V codes Auricular acupuncture Enzyme replacement therapy for Guacher's disease and PKU Silver compoun ds for caries treatment Pseudobulbar affect prioritization Changes need ed to the Prioritized List to bring into alignment with coverage guidances on viscosupplementation for osteoarthritis of the knee, percutaneous Value-based Benefits Subcommittee Minutes, 12/13/12 Page 12 interventions for low back pain, and management of chronic otitis media in children Guideline on immunizations/prevention tables Expensive/marginally effective drug guideline Guideline Note 37 on abnormal reflexes radiculopathy Next meeting: Thursday, January 10, 2013, Meridian Park Hospital, Conference Room 117 Time: TBD The meeting adjourned at 2:45 PM.

Prior to initiation of puberty suppression therapy, adolescents must fulfill eligibility and readiness criteria and must have a comprehensive mental health evaluation . Ongoing ps ychological care is strongly encouraged for continue d puberty suppression therapy. Appendix C Value -based Benefits Subcom mittee Minutes, 12/13/12 Appendix C Revised Guidelines DIAGNOSTIC GUIDELINE D1, NON -PRENATAL GENETIC TESTING GUIDELINE Coverage of genetic testing in a non -prenatal setting shall be determined by the algorithm shown in Figure C.1 unless otherwise specifie d below. A) Related to genetic testing for patients with breast/ovarian and colon/endometrial cancer suspected to be hereditary, or patients at increased risk to due to family history. 1) Services are provided according to the Comprehensive Cancer Networ k Guidelines. a) Lynch syndrome (hereditary colorectal and as defined by the NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelin es in 81211 -81217) for women without a personal history of breast and/or ovarian cancer should be provided to high risk women as defined in GUIDELINE NOTE 3, PROPHYLACTIC TREATMENT FOR PREVENTION OF BREAST CANCER IN HIGH RISK WOMEN or as otherwise defined by the US Preventive Services Task Force c) BRCA1/BRCA2 testing services (CPT 81211 -81217) for women with a personal history of breast and/or ovarian cancer and for men with breast cancer should be provided according to the NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology. Genetic/Familial High - Risk should be provided as defined by the NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology. Colorectal Cancer Screening. V.1.2012 (5/2/12). www.nccn.org 2) Genetic counseling should precede genetic testi ng for hereditary cancer. Very rarely, it may be appropriate for a genetic test to be performed prior to genetic counseling for a patient with cancer. If this is done, genetic counseling should be provided as soon as practical. a) Pre and post -test genetic counseling by the following providers should be covered. i) Medical Geneticist (M.D.) - Board Certified or Active Candidate Status from the American Board of Medical Genetics ii) Clinical Geneticist (Ph.D.) - Board Certified or Active Candidate Status fr om the American Board of Medical Genetics. Appendix C Value -based Benefits Subcom mittee Minutes, 12/13/12 Appendix C iii) Genetic Counselor - Board Certified or Active Candidate Status from the American Board of Genetic Counseling, or Board Certified by the American Board of Medical Genetics. iv) Advance Practice Nurse in Gene tics - Credential from the Genetic Nursing Credentialing Commission. 3) If the mutation in the family is known, only the test for that mutation is covered. For example, if a mutation for BRCA 1 has been identified in a family, a single site mutation analy sis for that mutation is covered (CPT 81215), while a full sequence BRCA 1 and 2 (CPT 81211) analyses is not. There is one exception, for individuals of Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry with a known mutation in the family, the panel for Ashkenazi Jewish BRCA muta tions is covered (CPT 81212). 4) Costs for rush genetic testing for hereditary breast/ovarian and colon/endometrial cancer is not covered. B) Related to diagnostic evaluation of individuals with intellectual disability (defined as a full scale or verbal IQ < 70 in an individual > age 5), developmental delay (defined as a cognitive index <70 on a standardized test appropriate for children < 5 years of age), Autism Spectrum Disorder, or multiple congenital intellectual disability/developmental delay; multiple congenital anomalies; or, Autism Spectrum Disorder accompanied by at least one of the following: dysmorphic features including macro or microcephaly, congenital anomalies, or intellectual dis ability/developmental delay in addition to those required to diagnose Autism Spectrum Disorder. 2) CPT 81229, Cytogenomic constitutional (genome polymorphism (SNP) variants for chromosomal abnormalities: for individuals with intellectual disability/developmental delay; multiple congenital anomalies; or, Autism Spectrum Disorder accompanied by at least one of the following: dysmor phic features including macro or microcephaly, congenital anomalies, or intellectual disability/developmental delay in addition to those required to diagnose Autism Spectrum Disorder; ONLY IF consanguinity AND recessive disease is suspected, OR UPD (unipar ental disomy) is suspected, OR other suspected mechanism that is not detected by the oligo microarrays (CPT 81228). 3) Array -based evaluation of multiple molecular probes (CPT 88384 -88386) will be covered for diagnostic evaluation with inte llectual disability/developmental delay; multiple congenital anomalies; for 2012. 4) CPT 81243, 81244, Fragile X genetic testing is covered for individuals with intellectual disability/developmental delay. Although the yield of Fragile X is 3.5 - 10%, this is included because of additional reproductive implications. Appendix C Value -based Benefits Subcom mittee Minutes, 12/13/12 Appendix C 5) A visit with the appropriate specialist (often genetics, developmental pediatrics, or child neurology), including physical exam, medical history, and family histor y is covered. Physical exam, medical history, and family history by the appropriate specialist, prior to any genetic testing is often the most cost - effective strategy and is encouraged. C) Related to other tests with specific CPT codes: 1). The following tests are not gene analysis, gene analysis, common variants (eg, - 1639/3673) 2) The following tests are covered only if they meet the criteria for the Non -Prenatal Genetic Testing Algorithm AND the common variants (eg, R183P, G278S, E422X): Cover only when the newborn screening test is abnormal and serum amino acids are normal b. full gene sequence: covered for patients who are symptomatic or who have positive newborn screening for CF AND genetic testing for common mutations is negative AND if the patients ethnicity has <90% coverage by common mutation panels. Covered genetic counse d. 81240, F2 (prothrombin, hereditary hypercoagulability) gene analysis, 20210G>A variant: Not covered for routine testing in the following circumstances: (1) adults with idiopathic venous thromboembolism. (2) Asymptomati c adult family members of C Value -based Benefits Subcom mittee Minutes, patients with idiopathic venous thromboembolism and F5 mutation, for the purpose of considering primary prophylactic anticoagulation. Test may have clinical utility in other circumstances, e.g. family history of coagulopathy, deci ding short range anticoagulation therapy, problems with anticoagulation management, muliptle pregnancy losses. CPT 81241, hereditary hypercoagulability) gene analysis, Leiden variant: Not covered for routine testing i n the following circumstances: (1) adults with idiopathic venous thromboembolism. (2) Asymptomatic adult members of patients with idiopathic venous thromboembolism and F5 mutation, for the purpose of considering primary prophylactic anticoagulation. Test may have clinical utility in other circumstances, e.g. family history of coagulopathy, deciding short range anticoagulation therapy, problems with anticoagulation therapy muliptle C282Y, H63D): Covered for diagnostic testing of patients with elevated transferrin saturation or ferritin levels. Covered for predictive testing ONLY when a first degree family member has treat able iron overload from HFE. g. variants (eg, *S and *Z): The alpha -1-antitrypsin protein level sho uld be the first line test ofr a suspected diagnosis of AAT deficiency in symptomatic individuals with unexplained liver disease or obstructive lung disease that is not asthma or in a middle age individual with unexplained dyspnea. Generic testing or the anpha -1 phenotype test is appropriate is the protein test is abnormal or borderline. The genetic test is appropriate for siblings of people with AAT deficiency regardless of the AAT protein test results. 3) Do not cover a more expensive genetic test (gene rally one with a wider scope or more detailed testing) if a cheaper (smaller scope) test is available and has, in this clinical context, a substantially similar sensitivity. For example, do not cover CFTR gene sequencing as the first test in a person of No rthern European Caucasian ancestry because the gene panels are less expensive and provide substantially similar sensitivity in that context. GUIDELINE NOTE 17, PREVENTIVE DENTAL CARE Line 58 Dental cleaning and fluoride treatments are limited to once p er 12 months for adults and twice per 12 months for children up to age 19 (D1110, D1120, D1203, D1204, D1206). More frequent dental cleanings and/or fluoride treatments may be required for certain higher risk populations. Additionally, assessment (D0191) may be performed once per 12 months for adults and twice per 12 months for children up to age 19. Appendix C Value -based Benefits Subcom mittee Minutes, 12/13/12 Appendix C GUIDELINE NOTE 53, BASIC PERIODONTICS Line 232 Only for the treatment of severe drug -induced hyperplasia (D4210, D4211, D4212 ). Payable only when there are pockets of 5 mm or greater (D4341). GUIDELINE NOTE 91, ONE SURFACE POSTERIOR COMPOSITE RESTORATIONS Line 372 HCPCS code D2391 is only included on this line for one surface posterior composite restorations on occlusal s urfaces and class V surfaces in the esthetic zone (buccal surfaces of teeth 3,4,5,12,13,14,19,20,21,28,29,30,A,B,I,J,K,L,S,T). GUIDELINE NOTE 51, CHRONIC OTITIS MEDIA WITH EFFUSION Line 502 Antibiotic and other medication therapy (including antihistamine s, decongestants, and nasal steroids) are not indicated for children with chronic otitis media with effusion (OME) (without another appropriate diagnosis). There should be a 3 to 6 month watchful waiting period after diagnosis of otitis media with effusi on, and if documented hearing loss is greater than or equal to 25dB in the better hearing ear, tympanostomy surgery may be indicated given short but not long term improvement in hearing. Formal audiometry is indicated for cChildren with chronic OME presen t for 3 months or longer. or Children with language delay, learning problems, or significant hearing loss at any time should have hearing testing upon diagnosis . Children with chronic OME who are not at risk for language or developmental delay should be re examined at 3 - to 6-month intervals until the effusion is no longer present, significant hearing loss is identified, or structural abnormalities of the eardrum or middle ear are suspected. For the child who has had chronic OME and who has a hearing defic iency in the better - hearing ear of 25 dB or greater, myringotomy with tube insertion is recommended after a total of 4 to 6 months of effusion with a documented hearing deficit. Adenoidectomy is not indicated at the time of first pressure equalization tub e insertion. It may be indicated in is an appropriate surgical treatment for chronic OME in children over 3 years with who are having their second set of tubes. First time tubes are not an indication for an adenoidectomy. Tube insertion should be cover ed for p atients with craniofacial anomalies, Down's syndrome, cleft palate, and patients with speech and language delay along with co- morbid hearing loss . Coronary Brachytherapy Issue: During the 2013 CPT code review of cardiac stenting, HERC staff identified that the CPT code for coronary brachytherapy is on multiple inappropriate lines. Description: Intracoronary brachytherapy with gamma or beta radioactive ribbons for the management of in -stent restenosis of native coronary vessels following successful PTCA. Multiple contraindications exist, including acute MI, left ventricular ejection fraction <40%, and type of lesion. Current list placement: CPT code 92974 ( Transcatheter placement radiation delivery device for subsequent coronary intravascular brachytherapy ) is currently on multiple lines (approximately 40). It is only used for coronary artery stent issues. At the 2013 CPT code review, cardiac stenting was limited to 4 lines with coronary artery disease diagnoses. The coronary brachytherapy code is therefore on multiple lines that are inappropriate. Recommendation : 1) Remove 92974 from all current lines except i. 51 CORONARY ARTERY ANOMALY ii. 76 ACUTE AND SUBACUTE ISCHEMIC HEART DISEASE, MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION iii. 108 HEART FAILURE iv. 195 CHRONIC ISCHEMIC HEART DISEASE External Elements Exposure Issue Summary 1 Question: Should changes in coverage be made for a variety of \"exposure\" to element conditions? Question Source: Jim Beggs, Medical Director, CCC Issue: Dr. Beggs raised concerns that motion sickness is covered for OHP, and simultaneously realized that the 994 series probably needed a re- look. He raised concerns as to whether OHP should cover G -force and weightlessness complications or exhaustion. He also raised the concern that many of these codes appear to be \" secondary descriptors rather than primary i llnesses and coverage should perhaps derive from their specific effect rather than how it happens. \" 994 Effects of other external causes Excludes: certain adverse effects not elsewhere classified (995.0- 995.8) 994.0 Effects of lightning COVERED Shock from lightning Struck by lightning NOS Excludes: burns (940.0- 949.5) 994.1 Drowning and nonfatal submersion COVERED Bathing cramp Immersion 994.2 Effects of hunger NOT Covered Deprivation of food Starvation 994.3 Effects of thirst NOT Covered Deprivation of water 994.4 Exhaustion due to exposure COVERED 994.5 Exhaustion due to excessive exertion COVERED Exhaustion due to overexertion 994.6 Motion sickness COVERED Air sickness Seasickness Travel bedclothes cave -in constriction mechanical plastic bag pressure External Elements Exposure Issue Summary 2 strangulation Excludes: asphyxia from: carbon monoxide (986) inhalation of food or for eign body (932- 934.9) other fumes, and vapors (987.0- 987.9) 994.8 Electrocution and nonfatal effects of electric current COVERED Shock from electric current Shock from electr oshock gun (taser) Excludes: electric burns (940.0- 949.5) 994.9 Other effects of external causes COVERED Effects of: abnormal gravitational [G] forces or states weightlessness HERC Staff additional background: 994.2 and 994.3 are in the funded region of the List, on Line 132.

Question source : Issue : cerebral AVMs (ICD -9 747.81) on Line 201 SUBARACHNOID AND INTRACEREBRAL HEMORRHAGE/HEMATOMA; CEREBRAL ANEURYSM; COMPRESSION OF BRAIN. There are various treatments on this line, including embolizat ion and various lines for treatment of benign and malignant tumors of the CNS. However, it is currently not covered for treatment of AVMs . From Dr. Chris Kirk: We have a member with \"anomaly of cerebrovascular system\" - ICD-9 code 747.81. It is a deep pari etal AVM. He cannot have sur gery due to it's deep location. It is not amenable to embolization because of its lack of a specific arterial vessel that can be embolized. The team at OHSU would like to claim that this is \"...a commonly accepted treatment method for this patient's situation...\" and that it is supported in the literature (they offered no citations). Evidence 1) Friedlander 2007 , review of AVMs a. Radiosurgery is often recommended if an arteriovenous malformation is less than 3 cm in diameter and is located in an eloquent area where surgeryis likely to cause a neurologic deficit. b. Although data from randomi zed trials to guide the choice of intervention are lacking, treatment (surgical resection, radiosurgery, embolization, or a combination of these) is generally considered appropriate for arteriovenous malformations that are grade I to III.24,33 The choice of therapy will depend on the specific features of the lesion, with consideration of the age of the patient, presence or absence of bleeding and associated aneurysms, diameter and location of associated aneurysms, and pattern of venous drainage. 2) Fleetwood 2002, review of AVMs a.

Cigna 2012 i. Covers steretotactic radiosurgery for arteriovenous malformation of the brain or spine Summary : intracranial stereotactic radiosurgery appears to be a standard, accepted treatment for certain patients with AVMs Recommendation : 1) Add intracranial stereotactic radiosurgery to line 201 SUBARACHNOID AND of Cancer V Codes 1 Question : should additional personal history of cancer diagnosis codes be on funded lines? Question source : DMAP and HERC staff Issue : Most V10 series codes (personal history of cancer) are lo cated on funded lines. For many cancers, there is an altered screening schedule (more frequent colonoscopy in colon cancer, for example) or screening modality ( e.g. breast MRI instead of mammogram in breast cancer ) if a patient has a history of that cancer. Other cancer survivors may need periodic PET scans, X - rays, blood work, specialist visit s, or other t ypes of surveillance and follow up. Most V10 codes are located on funded lines. However, 2 are located on unfunded lines and several are located on the Excluded List. These should be considered for movement t o funded lines. There are several \"unspecified\" codes that are Excluded and should remain so.

At that time, HERC staff indicated th at there was not enough information available to make a placement determination for this code. Staff has consulted experts and reviewed additional materials. Definition : Auricular electrostimulation involves the stimulation of acupunc ture points on the ear. Devices, including the P-Stim and E-pulse , have been developed to provide ambulatory electrical stimulation over a period of severa l days. Auricular electr ostimulation is being evaluated for a variety of conditions, including pain, depression, and anxiety. The P-Stim device is a single-use miniature electri cal stimulator for auricular acupuncture points that is worn behind the ear with a self-adhesive electrode patch. A selec tion stylus that measures electrical resistance is used to identify 3 auri cular acupuncture points. Current List status : New code: S8930 Electrical stimulation of auri cular acupuncture points; each 15 minutes of personal one-on-one contact with the patient Current lines with acupuncture CP T codes for traditional acupuncture: 1 PREGNANCY 5 ABUSE OR DEPENDENCE OF PSYCHOACTIVE SUBSTANCE 6 TOBACCO DEPENDENCE 15 HIV DISEASE (INCLUDING ACQUIRE D IMMUNODEFICIENCY SYNDROME) AND RELATED OPPORTUNISTIC INFECTIONS 68 SUBSTANCE-INDUCED DELUSI ONAL AND MOOD DISORDERS; INTOXICATION 70 SUBSTANCE-INDUCED DELIRIUM 212 DEPRESSION AND OTHER MOOD DISORD ERS, MILD OR MODERATE 400 DISORDERS OF SPINE WITH NEUROLOGIC IMPAIRMENT 435 MIGRAINE HEADACHES 562 ACUTE AND CHRONIC DI SORDERS OF SPINE WITHOUT NEUROLOGIC IMPAIRMENT 563 TENSION HEADACHES Expert input : Peter Martin , LAc, Associate Medical Director with CHP Group Mr. Martin reported that the HCPCS code is lik ely used for payment for the device used for this type of acupuncture . Auricular Electro-Acupuncture for full-body and ear acupuncture are typically the same, and usually simple. These devices are essential for acupunc ture. It is comforta ble for patients and efficient for practitioners. Res earch on conventional devices is extensive, such as the work of Becker and most notably Dr. Han, Ji-Sheng. Han led government research on acupuncture in China for 30 years, and found that electro acupressure or acupuncture (specifically alternating be tween 2 and 100 Hz) boosted all 5 known neurotransmitters in the cerebrospinal fluid. He published a wealth of research articles in English, searchable on PubMed, and presented at top-le vel scientific conferences internationally. For this, he was awarded China's top science prize a few years ago. Most LAcs are unaware of Dr. Han's work, but it provides rich scientific ba sis for ElectroAcupun cture (EA). Many acupuncturists use a simple 10 Hz if an alte rnating current is not available on their machines --many of my MD ac upuncture colleagues use this as a convention. It was the waveform successfully applied on two acupoints on a patient's head during a 3 hour surgery at OHSU in 2004 that precluded the use of any chemical anesthesia. One EA device, called 'micro current,' markets something that clai ms great effects --alt hough the patient does not feel anything. Some of my colleagues swear by these devices, attending special workshops by the manufacturer. As is the case with mo st medical devices, however, there is no independent research on them. In the past, this was billed as Elec tro acupuncture, for s lightly more than conventional. These devices do not require addi tional training nor capit al investment, since the devices cost less than $500, and great on es run for about $300 or less. I've never understood why a separate code or cost was ju stified with these devices. This billing practice probably encouraged the use of EA by practitioners, which is harmless, but is not a good model for influencing practice for the sake of a few dollars . The list makes sense. It is an essential practice for acute situations where hours of stimulation are needed, such as surgical or de ntal anesthesia/analges ia, or obstetric labor and delivery. It is interesting that every rese arch article I surveyed that compared EA to conventional acupuncture for treating depression had superior results for EA: that was about a dozen articles in 2005. It makes a str ong case for EA with this condition. EA is well known for pain of all types. I would not lim it it to the pain conditions below. It would not be my first choice for pregnancy, but is essential for labor a nd delivery. Working at Hooper Detox, we found EA to help diffi cult detoxification, such as opiates.

Enzyme Replacement Therapy - Gaucher's Disease Question: What should the HERC determine about placement on the Prioritized List for enzyme replacement therapy for Gaucher's Disease? Question Source : ICD-10 pediatric metabolic consultants and Dr. Dave Koeller , OHSU Genzyme pharmaceuticals Issue: At the August 2012 VBBS/HERC meetings enzyme replacement therapies (with the exception of infantile Pompe's disease) were included on Line 684, including treatment of Gaucher's disease. At that time, there was no high quality data (Cochrane reviews or randomized controlled trials) identified to support coverage. Those studies that were identified appear to focus on primary endpoints of hemoglobin concentrations and not on patient -oriented outcomes. Since that time, the ICD -10 pediatric metabolic consultants Drs. Buist and Koeller have approached staff with additional evidence and the makers of Cerezy me have also submitted evidence with the request that since this is so rare RCT evidence i s not available and case series and registries should be considered. Clinical Background: Gaucher disease is characterized by a deficiency of \u00df -glucocerebrosidase activity, resulting in accumulation of glucocerebroside in tissue macrophages which become engorged and are typically found in the liver, spleen, and bone marrow and occasionally in lung, kidney, and intestine. Secondary hematologic sequelae include severe anemia and thrombocytopenia in addition to the characteristic progressive hepatosplenomegaly , skeletal complications, including osteonecrosis and osteopenia with secondary pathological fractures.

Aetna considers alglucerase, imiglucerase, miglustat, taliglucerase alfa, and velaglucerase alfa experimental and investigational for all other indications because of insufficient evidence in the peer -reviewed literature. This policy is based, in part, on the recommendations of the International Collaborative Gaucher Group U.S. Regional Coordinators and the National Institutes of Health Technology Assessment Conference on Gaucher Disease. Cigna, 2012 Cigna covers the follo wing long -term enzyme replacement therapies as medically necessary for Type 1 imiglucerase (Zavesca\u00ae) as medically necessary for the treatm ent of mild to moderate Type 1 Gaucher disease in adults for whom enzyme replacement therapy is not a therapeutic option. When coverage is available and medically necessary, the dosage, frequency, site of administration, and duration of enzyme replacement therapy should be reasonable, clinically appropriate, and supported by evidence -based literature and adjusted based upon severity, alternative available treatments, and previous response to enzyme replacement therapy. Health Partners, 2011 Enzyme replace ment therapy for Gaucher's disease is considered medically necessary for pediatric and adult patients with a confirmed diagnosis of Type I Gaucher disease resulting in one or more of the following conditions: moderate to severe anemia, thrombocytopenia wit h bleeding tendency, bone disease, significant hepatomegaly or splenomegaly. The labeled dosage is 60 units/kg administered every other week as a 60 -minute intravenous infusion. However, after therapeutic goals are achieved, the lowest effective dose shoul d be used. Annual reauthorizations will require (1) a statement of progress against therapy goals which should include assessments of hemoglobin, platelet count, and liver and/or spleen volumes by MRI (when MRI is clinically indicated); and (2) for all regimens using more than 30 units/kg every other week, a statement of medical necessity indicating that the lowest effective dose to maintain therapeutic goals is being used. Cost information Based on a recommended dosing of 60U/kg every 2 weeks, the monthly cost for a 100kg person would be $50,088. This translates to an annual cost of $601,056. Summary There are no high quality studies to support the use of enzyme replacement therapy for Gaucher Type 1. There are case series and cohort studies without cont rols that demonstrate improvements in hemoglobin, platelet s, spleen size, liver size, bone density , bone crises, and bone pain. There is a single comparative study that found improvement in bone mineral density at 8 years. There is no data available about patients who discontinue therapy or who choose not to be on therapy compared to those remaining on therapy. This comparative data would be possible to obtain from the registry. There no evidence to show that ongoing treatment with ERT prevents long-term clinical complications (e.g. infection, hospitalization, and mortality). HERC Staff Recommendation 1. Option 1: Make no change . Await comparative data to demonstrate efficacy on patient -oriented outcomes. 2. Option 2: If the decision is made to prioritize th is therapy higher, Guideline Note 67 would need to be modified as follows : GUIDELINE NOTE 67, ENZYME REPLACEMENT THERAPY Lines 67, 264,684 Enzyme replacement therapy for Type 1 Gaucher disease is included on Line 67 and for infantile Pompe's disease is i ncluded on Line 264. All other enzyme replacement therapies are included on Line 684. Consider adding this additional wording to the guideline: Enzyme replacement therapy is only included on Line 67 for Type 1 Gaucher's disease in adults when at least two or three of the following criteria are met: Moderate to severe anemia (hemoglobin less than or equal to 11.5 g/dL (adult women) or 12.5 g/dL (adult men) or less than or equal to 1.0 g/dL or more below the lower limit of normal for age and sex); or Signi ficant hepatomegaly (liver size 1.25 or more times normal (1,750 cc in adults)) or splenomegaly (spleen size 5 or more times normal (875 cc in adults)); or Skeletal disease beyond mild osteopenia and Erlenmeyer flask deformity; or Symptomatic disease, incl uding abdominal or bone pain, fatigue, exertional limitation, weakness, or cachexia; or Thrombocytopenia (platelet count less than or equal to 120,000/mm3) with bleeding history For children and adolescents with Type 1 Gaucher's disease , the above criteri a do not need to be met , they simply must be symptomatic. For all recipients of enzyme replacement therapy there needs to docume ntation of responsiveness to the enzyme replacement therapy and the lowest effective dose should be used in order for continued coverage. Silver Compounds For Dental Caries Silver fluoride for dental caries Jan VBBS Page 1 Question : Should coverage for silver compounds (silver nitrate plus topical fluoride or silver diamine fluoride) to prevent and treat dental caries be added to the Prioritized List? Question source : Senator Bates Issue : At the December 13, 2012 VBBS meeting, the evidence on the use of silver compounds (specifically silver diamine fluoride) was reviewed, and public testimony was heard about the pros and cons of use of silver nitrate plus fluoride varnish for the arresting of dental caries. Summary of the evidence Silver diamine fluoride appears to be effective at preventing and arresting caries based on evidence only performed resource- poor settings (and none in the United States) . There are no studies on silver nitrate + fluoride which is what would be used in the U .S. There are no studies evaluating the utility of arresting of caries compared to standard of care which is immediate restoration compared to delayed restoration. Summary of the argument in favor of silver compounds It stops the infection in the tooth Silver is c oming back into favor Allows for those who do not want restoration (or immediate restoration) to have a means to arrest caries progression Inexpensive chemical Anecdotal evidence from Advantage that it is decreasing their ED visits Summary of the argument against silver compounds There is no data in the US supporting this as a treatment There are no k nown studies in process actually evaluating the efficacy of arresting caries compared to immediate restorative treatment There is permanent tooth discoloration that occurs Restoration is still required There is a potential large cost associated with the recommended 5 visits over 3- 4 months, and then there would still be the cost of restoration No professional associations recommend it Oregon Board of Dentistry input From Patrick Braatz, Executive Director, Oregon Board of Dentistry \"No official position it is something that Dentists may use. The Board has recently developed an administrative rule to allow Dental Hygienists and dental assistants to also apply if a dentist has authorized, but that rule has not yet passed.\" Silver Compounds For Dental Caries Silver fluoride for dental caries Jan VBBS Page 2 AAPD Clinical Guideline, updated 2011. Guideline on Caries -risk Assessment and Management for Infants, Children, and Adolescents. -- one of the advocates stated that AAPD recommended it. The clinical guideline had the following language: \" Other approaches to the assessment and treatment of dental caries will emerge with time and, with evidence of effec tiveness, may be included in future guidelines on caries risk assessment and management protocols. For example, there are emerging trends to use calcium and phosphate remineralizing solution to reverse dental caries. 53 Other fluoride compounds, such as silver diamine fluoride 54 and stannous fluoride 55, may be more effective than sodium fluoride for topical applications.\" Conclusion:S silver diamine fluoride may be included in future guidelines as evidence of effectiveness emerges American Dental Association: Center for Evidence- based Dentistry No of ficial position 1. Critical summary January 2011 of the following review: Rosenblatt A, Stamford TC, Niederman bullet\". Journal of Dental Research. 2009;88(2):116- 25 2. Strengths and Weaknesses of the Systematic Review: The reviewers used accepted methods to identify and select studies on SDF based on a priori inclusion criteria and the two studies reached similar conclusions. The reported preventive fractions and numbers needed to treat in the systemat ic review did not compare the SDF to fluoride varnish, and instead compared outcomes for SDF and fluoride varnish to the control groups. 3. Strengths and Weaknesses of the Evidence: Both studies in the review were prospective studies with relatively large numbers of subjects in each study group, which was the main strength. While one of the studies compared SDF to no treatment, the other compared SDF to fluoride varnish. In addition, Chu and colleagues (2002) did not estimate trial sample sizes using a priori power calculations. Safety outcome measures associated with SDF were not clearly defined. There are potential problems with concluding that SDF is safe based on results from a study that may not be adequately powered to detect differences in adverse outcom es that are rare. Lastly, one study assessed the effectiveness of SDF on primary maxillary anterior teeth while the other focused on primary canines, primary molars, and permanent first molars. 4. Implications for Dental Practice: Silver Compounds For Dental Caries Silver fluoride for dental caries Jan VBBS Page 3 Results from two studies sug gest that SDF is a promising chemotherapeutic agent that arrests and prevents caries in children. However, SDF has not been approved by the FDA for clinical use in the United States. Additional studies are needed to assess safety. There are also concerns associated with staining caused by SDF, which can be addressed by restoring the SDF -treated teeth with glass ionomer. SDF may have the potential to be used in clinical settings as a chemotherapeutic agent to effectively control and reduce dental caries in high -risk populations. Summary There is evidence in resource- poor countries that silver diami ne fluoride is effective at preventing and arresting caries. However, t here is no evidence of the effectiveness of silver nitrate + fluoride varnish which is what would be used in the US (because the FDA has not approved silver diamine fluoride) and there are no US studies of either type of treatment. There are concerns about costs of repeated visits when restoration is still required and t here is no data supporting that delayed restoration compared to immediate restoration is beneficial. Cosmetic concerns about permanent black staining in the teeth exist. Although the international studies are promising, no US major dental organizations currently recommend the use of silver compounds . This appears to be an experimental treatment at this time , and more research demonstrating efficacy and safety is required prior to allowing OHP patients to have this procedure done. Recommendations : 1) Do not add silver treatment s to the Prioritized List 2) Add a guideline to indicate that neither this treatment (Silver diamine fluoride) nor a proxy (silver nitrate plus fluoride) are included on the Prioritized List Guideline Note XX Silver compounds for dental caries Lines 58, 372, 373, 494, 621 Silver compounds for dental caries prevention and treatment are not included on these or any lines on the Prioritized List for coverage consideration.

Question source : Health Evidence Review Commission Issue : HERC approved the Coverage Guidance : Management of chronic otitis media with effusion in children in October , 2012. This coverage guidance needs to be evaluated for application within the Prioritized List. At the December 2012 VBBS meeting testimony was heard and a discussion to make modifications to the proposed guideline followed. The proposal had recommended striking language including the definition of 25dB hearing loss, and the decision was made to leave this language as part of the guideline. Additionally, the \"individualiz ed\" treatment language was not operationalizeable by DMAP and so the proposal was to add tympanostomy tubes to those specified underlying condition lines (e.g. Down syndrome, cleft palate, and craniofacial anomalies). It was decided not to add these codes to the speech and language delay lines because these are dysfunction lines. HERC Coverage Guidance Antibiotic and other medication therapy (including antihistamines, decongestants, and nasal steroids) should not be covered for children with children with otitis media with effusion (OME) (without another appropriate diagnosis). There should be a 3 to 6 month watchful waiting period after diagnosis of otitis media with effusion, and if documented persistent hearing loss is greater than or equal to 25dB in the better hearing ear, referral for tympanstomy surgery may be covered, given short, but not long- term, improvement in hearing. Formal audiometry should be covered for children with chronic OME present for 3 months or longer. Children with language delay, learning problems, or significant hearing loss should have hearing testing covered initially upon diagnosis. Children with chronic OME who are not at risk for language or developmental delay should be reexamined at 3 - to 6-month intervals until the effusion is no longer present, significant hearing loss is identified, or structural abnormalities of the eardrum or middle ear are suspected. Adenoidectomy should not be covered at the time of the first pressure equalization tube insertion. Patients with craniofacial anomalies, Down's syndrome, cleft palate, and patients with speech and language delay along with hearing loss should have coverage based on an individualized treatment plan. CG - Management of Chronic Otitis Media with Effusion in Children 2 Current Prioritized List status: chronic otitis media is included on line 502 CHRONIC OTITIS MEDIA Treatment: PE TUBES/ADENOIDECTOMY/TYMPANOPLASTY, MEDICAL THERAPY. Currently, guideline note 51 applies to this line. GUIDELINE NOTE 51, CHRONIC OTITIS MEDIA WITH EFFUSION Line 502 Antibiotic and other medication therapy are not indicated for children with chronic otitis media with effusion (OME). Children with chronic OME present for 3 months or longer or with language delay, learning problems, or significant hearing loss at any t ime should have hearing testing. Children with chronic OME who are not at risk should be reexamined at 3- to 6-month intervals until the effusion is no longer present, significant hearing loss is identified, or structural abnormalities of the eardrum or mi ddle ear are suspected. For the child who has had chronic OME and who has a hearing deficiency in the better -hearing ear of 25 dB or greater, myringotomy with tube insertion recommended after a total of 4 to 6 months of effusion with a documented hearing deficit. Adenoidectomy is an appropriate surgical treatment for chronic OME in children over 3 years with their second set of tubes. First time tubes are not an indication for an adenoidectomy.

Immunization Guideline 1 Question : Should the current Prevention Tables have immunization recommendations removed and placed into a separate table to be maintained by the Oregon Immunization Program ? Question source : HERC staff , Oregon Immunization Program staff Issue : The curr ent Prevention Tables are out of date, and are not scheduled to be replaced until the ICD -10 List in 2014. The immunization recommendations in these tables are out of date, and not regularly updated. The Oregon Immunization Program has proposed having an updated table to be hosted by OIP and regularly updated by their staff. This table will be available through a link in a new Prioritized List guideline. Traditionally, HSC/HERC has followed ACIP immunization recommendations, which are created by publi c health experts and the CDC. The OIP program follows ACIP guidelines. If the following guideline referring to the OIP table is adopted, then changes will need to be made to the Prevention Tables as shown below.

Question Source : HERC Staff, P&T Committee Issue Summary: A number of recent issues have come up in which there are decisions around therapies that have marginal benefit and very high cost. HERC staff has been working with the P harmacy and Therapeutics (P&T) C ommittee on how the Prioritized List interfaces with the work of the P&T committee. Historically, when there is a condition with treatments that h ave significantly different cost-effectiveness or marginal benefit, HERC has chosen to prioritized treatments both above and below the funded region of the List or not put the treatment of questionable benefit on the List at all . P&T is performing assessm ents on benefit as well as cos t for a number of medications and interventions. HERC could potentially refer to assessments completed by the P&T as it relates to the Prioritized List. In this way, the principles for prioritization can take into account ev idence and cost -effectiveness research that the P&T committee performs . The Prioritized List currently has a guideline that provides broad -based principles for cancer treatment at the end of life with marginal benefit and may serve as a model for developi ng a guideline of other treatment s of little or no benefit and/or high cost . GUIDELINE NOTE 12, TREATMENT OF CANCER WITH LITTLE OR NO BENEFIT PROVIDED NEAR THE END OF LIFE Lines 102,103,123 -125,144,159,165,166,170,181,197,198,207,208,218,220,221,228,229, 231,243,249,252,275 - 278,280,287,292,310 -312,320,339 -341,356,459,586,622 This guideline only applies to patients with advanced cancer who have less than 24 months median survival with treatment. All patients receiving end of life care, either with the int ent to prolong survival or with the intent to palliate symptoms, should have/be engaged with palliative care providers (for example, have a palliative care consult or be enrolled in a palliative care program). Treatment with intent to prolong survival is not a covered service for patients with any of the following: Median survival of less than 6 months with or without treatment, as supported by the best available published evidence Median survival with treatment of 6 -12 months when the treatment is expecte d to improve median survival by less than 50%, as supported by the best available published evidence Median survival with treatment of more than 12 months when the treatment is expected to improve median survival by less than 30%, as supported by the best available published evidence Poor prognosis with treatment, due to limited physical reserve or the ability to withstand treatment regimen, as indicated by low performance status. Unpublished evidence may be taken into consideration in the case of rare can cers which are universally fatal within six months without treatment. The Health Evidence Review Commission is reluctant to place a strict $/QALY (quality adjusted life -year) or $/LYS (life - year saved) requirement on end -of-life treatments, as such measur ements are only approximations and cannot take into account all of the merits of an individual case. However, cost must be taken into consideration when considering treatment options near the end of life. For example, in no instance can it be justified to spend $100,000 in public resources to increase an individual's expected survival by three months when hundreds of thousands of Oregonians are without any form of health insurance. Therapies With Marginal Benefit and/or High Cost Issue Summary 2 Treatment with the goal to palliate is addressed in Statement of Intent 1, Palliative Care. HERC Staff Recommendation: 1) Discuss adopting a new ancillary guideline note for the Prioritized List ANCILLARY GUIDELINE XXX, THERAPIES WITH MARGINAL BENEFIT AND/OR HIGH COST It is the intent of the Commission that t herapies that exhibit the following characteristics generally not be included in the funded region of the Prioritized List: i. Marginal or clinically unimportant benefit , ii. Very high cost in which the cost does not justify the benefit, and iii. Significantly greater cost compared to alt ernate therapies when both have similar efficacy Where possible, the Commission prioritizes pairings of condition and treatment codes to reflect this lower priority, or simply does not pair a procedure code with one or more conditions if it exhibits one of these characteristics. As codes for prescription drugs and certain other ancillary services are not included on the Prioritized List, it is more difficult to indicate the importance of these services through the prioritization process. The Commission recognizes the evidence -based reviews being conducted by the Pharmacy and Therapeutics Committee and hereby prioritizes those services found in Table XX located at www... (e.g. as of October 1, 2013 ) to be prioritized on the line listed below that correspond s with the condition being treated : ICD-9-CM Codes Condition classification Line , V18.2 , V58.2 681 320-359, 740-742, Diseases of the nervous system 687 Therapies With Marginal Benefit and/or High Cost Issue Summary 3 778, V13.3 767-768, 772, 800- Injury and poisoning 663 Therapies With Marginal Benefit and/or High Cost Issue Summary 4 999 * Rename Line 692, \"Gastrointestinal Conditions and Other Miscellaneous Conditions with N o or Minimally Effective Treatments or No Treatment Necessary.\" Consider adding a new line to January 2016 list that separates out miscellaneous conditions from Line 692. Reflexes Issue Summary 1 Question: Should Guideline Note 37 be further clarified with intent about the definition of \"abnormal reflexes?\" Question Source: John Sattenspiel, LIPA, OHP Managed Care Medical Directors Issue: Guideline Note 37 defines neurologic impairment, and abnormal reflexes can be one of the criteria. Dr. Sattenspiel raises the concern that abnormal reflexes are quite subjective and possibly over -interpreted. From Dr. Sattenspiel This statement is from Disorders of the Nervous System - Reeves & Swenson and in my mind it is a reasonable description of reflex examination and grading: Examination of myotatic (\"deep tendon\") reflexes The muscle stretch (myotatic) reflex is a simple reflex, with the receptor neuron having direct connections to the muscle spindle apparatus in the muscle and with the alpha motor neurons in the central nervous system that send axons back to that muscle ( Fig. 8 -1). Normal muscle stretch reflexes res ult in contraction only of the muscle whose tendon is stretched and the agonist muscles (i.e., muscles that have the same action). There is also inhibition of antagonist muscles. Reflexes are graded at the bedside in a semi -quantitative manner. The response levels of deep tendon reflexes are grade 0 -4+, with 2+ being normal. The designation \"0\" signifies no response at all, even after reinforcement. Reinforcement requires a maximal isometric contraction of muscles of a remote part of the body, such as clenching the jaw, pushing the hands or feet together (depending on whether an upper or lower limb reflex is being tested), or locking the fingers of the two hands and pulling (termed the Jendrassik maneuver). This kind of maneuver probably amplifies reflexes by two mechanisms: by distracting the patient from voluntarily suppressing the reflex and by decreasing the amount of descending inhibition. The designation 1+ means a sluggish, depressed or suppressed reflex, while the term trace means that a barely dete ctible response is elicited. Reflexes that are noticeably more brisk than usual are designated 3+, while 4+ means that the reflex is hyperactive and that there is clonus present. Clonus is a repetitive, usually rhythmic, and variably sustained reflex respo nse elicited by manually stretching the tendon. This clonus may be sustained as long as the tendon is manually stretched or may stop after up to a few beats despite continued stretch of the tendon. In this case it is useful to note how many beats are prese nt. Reflexes Issue Summary 2 One sign of reflex hyperactivity is contraction of muscles that have different actions while eliciting a muscle stretch reflex (for example, contraction of thigh adductors when testing the patellar reflex or contraction of finger flexor muscles when t esting the brachioradialis reflex). This has been termed \"pathological spread of reflexes.\" Practice observing normal reflexes in patients and initially among students is an excellent way to determine the range of normalcy. Almost any grade of reflex (outs ide of sustained clonus) can be normal. Asymmetry of reflexes is a key for determining normalcy when extremes of response do not make the designation obvious. The patient's symptoms may facilitate the determination of which side is normal, i.e., the more active or the less active side. If this is a problem, the remainder of the neurologic examination and findings usually clarify the issue. Decreased reflexes should lead to suspicion that the reflex arc has been affected. This could be the sensory nerve fibe r but may also be the spinal cord gray matter or the motor fiber. This motor fiber (the anterior horn cell and its motor axon coursing through the ventral root and peripheral nerve) is termed the \"lower motor neuron\" (LMN). LMN lesions result in decreased reflexes. The descending motor tracts from the cerebral cortex and brain stem are termed the \"upper motor neurons\" (UMN). Lesions of the UMNs result in increased reflexes at the spinal cord by decreasing tonic inhibition of the spinal segment. Lesions of t he cerebellum and basal ganglia in humans are not associated with consistent changes in the muscle stretch reflex. Classically, destruction of the major portion of the cerebellar hemispheres in humans is associated with pendular deep- tendon reflexes. The r eflexes are poorly checked so that when testing the patellar reflex, for example, the leg may swing to - and- fro (like a pendulum). In normal individuals, the antagonist muscles (in this example, the hamstrings) would be expected to dampen the reflex respons e almost immediately. However, this is not a common sign of cerebellar disease and many other signs of cerebellar involvement are more reliable and diagnostic (see Chapt. 10 ). Basal ganglia disease (e.g., parkinsonism) usually is not associated with any predictable reflex change; most often the reflexes are normal. Note particularly the second highlighted section. I would advocate for a statement that reflex status could be r emoved; or at least clarified to require absence of reflexes or markedly diminished reflexes to be considered as objective evidence that meets the guideline for coverage. What we often see is reflexes graded on an 5 point scale, reported as 4/5, and prese nted as sufficient to meet criteria as objective findings of impairment.

Implemented: 414.695 & 414.698 Coverage Guidance Process Potential changes to the coverage guidance process Question : How should the coverage guidance process and reports be modified? Question source : HERC, subcommittees, and HERC staff Issue : The subcommittees and HERC have all identified challenges with the current coverage guidance process and areas which there have been discussions about modification . HERC Staff, the Center, and the Committee Chairs have met and attempted to revise the cov erage guidance process to capture these concerns. 1) What should be the theoretical framework underlying the decisions made in coverage guidances? 2) When there is insufficient evidence, what decision should be made? 3) Should the use of coverage language be modifi ed and what should the coverage guidances say with regard to different types of plans (e.g., OHP vs commercial)? 4) How should the process be better streamlined so that HERC is not revisiting coverage guidances multiple times? 5) Should the coverage guidances b e modified to address some implementation concerns, especially regarding national or Oregon standards? 6) How should the use of outside expert input into the process be modified? 7) Providers are often unaware of what is going on, resulting in feedback that occurs after the coverage guidances have been approved. Should there be a different outreach plan? 8) What should be the initial approach to developing a recommendation for a topic? 9) Should there be additional explanation of the committee deliberations for the final coverage recommendations including in the Coverage Guidance document? Concerns and HERC Staff Recommendation s 1) Concern: What should be the theoretical framework underlying the decisions made in coverage guidances? HERC Staff Recommendations : A. Use a GRADE -based format B. Add GRADE -lite summary table to the Coverage Guidances C. Use strong and weak recommendations D. Add description of GRADE framework to Coverage Guidances 2) Concern : When there is insufficient evidence, what decision should be made? HERC Staff Recommendation: A. Use algorithm as guide B. Use GRADE -lite methodology to allow other considerations than quality of evidence including: values and preferences, cost s, and balance between desirable and undesir able effects C. Consider if \" no recommendation \" is ever an option, or if a weak recommendation (for or against) would always be indicated. Similarly, should language such as \"it is recommended coverage not be restricted\" be used when there is the reasonable possibility of real and permanent harm 3) Conce rn: Should the use of coverage language be modified and what should the coverage guidances say with regard to different types of plans? HERC Staff Recommendation: A. VBBS makes coverage recommendations for OHP , but language will to be helpful for other plans . There is some concern about strong language for coverage for non -OHP plans. a. Option 1 - Keep wording the same should/should not cover , weak or strong b. Option 2 - Change wording to say is/is not recommended for coverage , weak or strong i. Benefits - still has coverage language but away from \"should cover\" language c. Option 3 - change wording to say is/is not recommended , weak or strong i. Benefit - more adherent to GRADE language ii. Drawbacks - likely would increase confusion about whether this is a guideline or a cove rage guidance d. Option 4 - change wording to say there is strong/weak rationale for/against coverage . e. Consider if there is a role for the term moderate , in addition to strong and weak, to allow for greater granularity B. Adapt GRADE -lite framework C. Other plans can use strong/weak language to make their own coverage decisions 4) Concern: How should the process be better streamlined so that HERC is not revisiting coverage guidances multiple times? HERC Staff Recommendation: a. CG go directly from subcommittee t o VBBS for coverage decision for OHP and then to HERC for final approval. If implementation concerns are raised at VBBS then could be sent back to originating subcommittee for consideration prior to going to HERC. 5) Concern : Should the coverage guidances be modified to address some implementation concerns, especially regarding national or Oregon standards? HERC Staff Recommendation: A. Add policy landscape section i. Search National Quality Measures Clearinghouse for pertinent metrics ii. Add Oregon's Quality Strategy for CCOs (includes 100 performance strategies) if applicab le iii. Consider i. Staff to look at national professional society activit ies (not exhaustive, just if readily available) ii. Ask experts and/or specialty society about statewide or national efforts 6) Concern: How should the use of outside expert input into the process be modified? HERC Staff Recommendation: The Rules Advisory Committee met and the following draft language on the use of experts is present in the draft rules: 7) Concern: Providers are often unaware of what is going on, resulting in feedback that occur s after the coverage guidances have been approved. Should there be a different outreach plan? HERC Staff Recommendations: a. Discuss if some level of early outreach strategy is indicated to pro fessional associations, either as an in itial introduction to the process (how to sign up for public meeting notices) or an updated specific outreach with each topic. This latter approach would potentially play into expert selection as well. 8) Concern: What should be the initial approach to developing a recommendation for a topic? HERC Staff Recommendations: a. Rely on the algorithm as a structured guide b. Consider if the algorithm needs to have values/preferences added in or if it is fine as it stands with out exactly adhering to GRADE domains 9) Concern: Should there be additional explanation of the committee deliberations for the final coverage recommendations including in the Coverage Guidance document? HERC Staff Recommendations: a. Consider adding a section towards the end of the Coverage Guidance document that summarizes the major issues considered (evidence and GRADE domains and other issues such as implementation) leading to the final recommendations. Feedback on coverage guidance process from perinatal collaborative group Question: As HERC is modifying its coverage guidance process, what types of responses or changes are indicated based on public comments received, including the feedback received f rom the Perinatal Collaborative meeting Question Source: Perinatal Collaborative Group ( feedback predominantly from participating OB /GYN s) Issue: On December 3, 2012, HERC staff was invited to attend a Perinatal Collaborative meeting in order to provide information about the coverage guidance process and also receive feedback about major concerns by the present OB/GYN community. This is presented as parts of the coverage guidance process are currently under flux, and the feedback is opportune. This is a HERC staff summary of the key concerns raised. 1) General concern that the language about individualized decision making and key indications for IOL (such as fetal demise, preeclampsia) are located in a footnote. This feels nonsupportive of clinicians and ma kes them wonder if plans will try to not offer coverage for what are clearly appropriate indications for induction 2) Concerns that this is not what ACOG recommends and unlike other specialties, they practice exactly in line with this one professional organiz ation which is the single most important factor in determining standard of care/malpractice. To have something different than what ACOG/standard of care would subject them to liability. 3) There is potential harm in not permitting elective induction of labor during the 39-41 weeks time period, with increased rates of stillbirth. This should be an option for patients. 4) They have been working hard across many hospital systems to create this hard stop at 39 weeks and have made tremendous progress in decreasing e arly elective inductions. They would really like to see greater alignment and have 39 weeks be the cutoff to ensure efforts are all simultaneous 5) The level of disgruntlement varied across provider s. One stressed that the HERC has no right to go against AC OG in determining that elective cesarean sections should not be covered, while others disagreed. 6) There were concerns about having a nonstandard form of implementation. 7) There were concerns about a two -tiered system, where those with OHP would get differ ent care than those without OHP. 8) Need to acknowledge that \"insufficient evidence\" doesn't really describe what may be the best available or possible evidence for a specific group (e.g. placenta previa and CS). Should have some qualifications about the bes t level of evidence supporting a recommendation, but can also make a recommendation to support when evidence is not of RCT quality if it is the best to be expected or would be unethical to do an RCT. 9) They strongly believe expert input was indicated HERC Staff responses OG/GYN concerns HERC response Concern about discrepancies between professional guidelines and coverage guidances Sometimes varying professional guidelines exist with opposing recommendations. The HERC coverage guidances are based on the best evidence, which may or may not be what a specific guideline is based on. An individual provider has the right to choose how that they are going to approach an individual patient, regardless of the population -based plan coverage . With the adoption of the GRADE based methodology, additional concerns beyond the quality of the evidence will also be taken into account. Individualized decision making language being nonsupportive This language is currently being reviewed and alternate language, such as \" coverage should not be limited ,\" may be adopted. Footnotes are also being recommended to largely be moved to within the box. Two -tiered system concerns Right now OHP patients do get a different benefit package than , for example, commercially insured patients . The intent of the coverage guidances is to be more consistent with what will improve health outcomes and decrease unnecessary care. Improving health outcomes, decreasing harms, and containing costs would be a desirable outcome for all health plans. Concern that the quality of evidence assessment does not take into account the real level of evidence that may be obtainable for a specific condition -treatment (e.g. no RCT for placenta previa and CS) HERC is actively reviewing this issue and the adoption of a modified GRADE - framework would allow for a more comprehensive and transparent process for addressing quality of evidence as well as other factors. Implementation concerns HERC has felt that implementation should be up to individual plans. However, HERC is discussing adding a \"policy landscape\" section that would incorporate relevant national quality metrics and potentially national/state - wide efforts related to the specific issue that would be considered during the coverage guidance development pro cess. Involvement of experts This is an active area of discussion. HERC 's proposed administrative rule (public comments to be accepted through January 18th ) states that if outside expertise is not present on the subcommittee or is requested by an interest ed party , it shall be solicited . HERC will discuss whether the outreach strategy shall be changed. Specific concerns about IOL coverage guidance This particular coverage guidance is being used as an example of the new \"GRADE -lite\" process and will like ly see modifications. Specific concerns about the language can be dealt with by the EbGS subcommittee. doi:10.1136/bmj.39489.470347.AD for the GRADE D Oxman, Gunn E Vist, Regina Kunz, Yngve recommendationsquality of evidence and strength of GRADE: an emerging consensus on rating http://bmj.com/cgi/content/full/336/7650/924Updated information and services can be found at: These include: References http://bmj.com/cgi/content/full/336/7650/924#BIBLThis article cites 8 articles, 6 of which can be accessed free at: Rapid responses http://bmj.com/cgi/eletter-submit/336/7650/924You can respond to this article at: serviceEmail alerting box at the top left of the article Receive free email alerts when new articles cite this article - sign up in the Topic collections (497 articles) Other evidence based practice \u0095 Articles on similar topics can be found in the following collections Notes To order reprints follow the \"Request Permissions\" link in the navigation box http://resources.bmj.com/bmj/subscribers go to: BMJ To subscribe to on 25 April 2008 bmj.com Downloaded from 924 BMJ | 26 April 2008 | Volu M e 336ANALYSIS advantages and disadvantages but also by their confi - dence in these estimates. The cartoon depicting the weather forecaster's uncertainty captures the difference between an assessment of the likelihood of an outcome and the confidence in that assessment (figure). The use - fulness of an estimate of the magnitude of intervention effects depends on our confidence in that estimate. Expert clinicians and organisations offering recom - mendations to the clinical community have often erred as a result of not taking sufficient account of the quality of evidence.2 For a decade, organisations recommended that clinicians encourage postmenopausal women to use hormone replacement therapy.3 Many primary care phy - sicians dutifully applied this advice in their practices. A belief that such therapy substantially decreased women's cardiovascular risk drove this recommenda - tion. Had a rigorous system of rating the quality of evi - dence been applied at the time, it would have shown that because the data came from observational studies with inconsistent results, the evidence for a reduction in cardiovascular risk was of very low quality.4 Recognition of the limitations of the evidence would have tempered the recommendations. Ultimately, randomised controlled trials have shown that hormone replacement therapy fails to reduce cardiovascular risk and may even increase it.5 6 The US Food and Drug Administration licensed the antiarrhythmic agents encainide and flecainide for use in patients on the basis of the drugs' ability to reduce asymptomatic ventricular arrhythmias associated with sudden death. This decision failed to acknowledge that because arrhythmia reduction reflected only indirectly on the outcome of sudden death the quality of the evidence for the drugs' benefit was of low quality. Subsequently, a randomised controlled trial showed that the two drugs increase the risk of sudden death.7 Appropriate attention to the low quality of the evidence would have saved thousands of lives. Failure to recognise high quality evidence can cause similar problems. For instance, expert recommendations lagged a decade behind the evidence from well conducted randomised controlled trials that thrombolytic therapy achieved a reduction in mortality in myocardial infarction.8 Insufficient attention to quality of evidence risks inappropriate guidelines and recommendations that may lead clinicians to act to the detriment of their Guideline developers around the world are inconsist - ent in how they rate quality of evidence and grade strength of recommendations. As a result, guideline users face challenges in understanding the messages that grading systems try to communicate. Since 2006 the BMJ has requested in its \"Instructions to Authors\" on bmj.com that authors should preferably use the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Develop - ment and Evaluation (GRADE) system for grading evidence when submitting a clinical guidelines article. What was behind this decision? In this first in a series of five articles we will explain why many organisations use formal systems to grade evidence and recommendations and why this is important for clinicians; we will focus on the GRADE approach to recommendations. In the next two articles we will examine how the GRADE system categorises quality of evidence and strength of recommendations. The final two articles will focus on recommendations for diagnostic tests and GRADE's framework for tack - ling the impact of interventions on use of resources. GRADE has advantages over previous rating systems (box 1). Other systems share some of these advantages, but none, other than GRADE, combines them all.1 What is \"quality of evidence\" and why is it important? In making healthcare management decisions, patients and clinicians must weigh up the benefits and down - sides of alternative strategies.

A simple, transparent grading of the recommendation can effectively convey this key information. There are limitations to formal grading of recom - mendations. Like the quality of evidence, the balance between desirable and undesirable effects reflects a con - tinuum. Some arbitrariness will therefore be associated with placing particular recommendations in categories such as \"strong\" and \"weak.\" Most organisations produc - ing guidelines have decided that the merits of an explicit grade of recommendation outweigh the disadvantages. What makes a good grading system? Not all grading systems separate decisions regarding the quality of evidence from strength of recommenda - tions. Those that fail to do so create confusion. High quality evidence doesn't necessarily imply strong recommendations, and strong recommendations can arise from low quality evidence. For example, patients who experience a first deep venous thrombosis with no obvious provoking factor must, after the first months of anticoagulation, decide whether to continue taking warfarin long term. High quality randomised controlled trials show that continu - ing warfarin will decrease the risk of recurrent throm - bosis but at the cost of increased risk of bleeding and inconvenience. Because patients with varying values and preferences will make different choices, guideline panels addressing whether patients should continue or terminate warfarin should\u2014despite the high quality evidence\u2014offer a weak recommendation. Consider the decision to administer aspirin or para - cetamol (acetaminophen) to children with chicken pox. Observational studies have observed an associa - tion between aspirin administration and Reye's syn - drome.9 Because aspirin and paracetamol are similar in their analgesic and antipyretic effects, the low qual - ity evidence regarding the association between aspi - rin and Reye's syndrome does not preclude a strong recommendation for paracetamol. Systems that classify \"expert opinion\" as a category of evidence also create confusion. Judgment is neces - sary for interpretation of all evidence, whether that evidence is high or low quality. Expert reports of their clinical experience should be explicitly labelled as very low quality evidence, along with case reports and other uncontrolled clinical observations. Grading systems that are simple with respect to judgments both about the quality of the evidence and the strength of recommendations facilitate use by patients, clinicians, and policy makers.1 Detailed and explicit criteria for ratings of quality and grading of strength will make judgments more transparent to those using guidelines and recommendations. Although many grading systems to some extent meet these criteria,1 a plethora of systems makes their use difficult for frontline clinicians. Understanding a variety of systems is neither an efficient nor a realistic use of clinicians' time. The GRADE system is used patients. Recognising the quality of evidence will help to prevent these errors. How should guideline developers alert clinicians to quality of evidence? A formal system that categorises quality of evidence\u2014 for example, from high to very low\u2014represents an obvious strategy for conveying quality of evidence to clinicians. Some limitations, however, do exist. Quality of evidence is a continuum; any discrete categorisation involves some degree of arbitrariness. Nevertheless, advantages of simplicity, transparency, and vividness outweigh these limitations. What is \"strength of recommendation\" and why is it important? A recommendation to offer patients a particular treat - ment may arise from large, rigorous randomised con - trolled trials that show consistent impressive benefits with few side effects and minimal inconvenience and cost. Such is the case with using a short course of oral steroids in patients with exacerbations of asthma. Clinicians can offer such treatments to almost all their patients with little or no hesitation. Alternatively, treatment recommendations may arise from observational studies and may involve appreciable harms, burdens, or costs. Deciding whether to use antithrombotic therapy in pregnant women with prosthetic heart valves involves weigh - ing the magnitude of reduction in valve thrombosis against inconvenience, cost, and risk of teratogenesis. Clinicians offering such treatments must help patients to weigh up the desirable and undesirable effects care - fully according to their values and preferences.

This widespread adoption of GRADE reflects GRADE's success as a methodo - logically rigorous, user friendly grading system. How does the GRADE system classify quality of evidence? To achieve transparency and simplicity, the GRADE system classifies the quality of evidence in one of four levels\u2014high, moderate, low, and very low (box 2). Some of the organisations using the GRADE system have cho - sen to combine the low and very low categories. Evi - dence based on randomised controlled trials begins as high quality evidence, but our confidence in the evidence may be decreased for several reasons, including: Study limitations Inconsistency of results Indirectness of evidence Imprecision Reporting bias. Although observational studies (for example, cohort and case-control studies) start with a \"low quality\" rating, grading upwards may be warranted if the magnitude of the treatment effect is very large (such as severe hip osteoarthritis and hip replacement), if there is evidence of a dose-response relation or if all plausible biases would decrease the magnitude of an apparent treatment effect. How does the GRADE system consider strength of recommendation? The GRADE system offers two grades of recommenda - tions: \"strong\" and \"weak\" (though guidelines panels may prefer terms such as \"conditional\" or \"discretion - ary\" instead of weak). When the desirable effects of an intervention clearly outweigh the undesirable effects, or clearly do not, guideline panels offer strong recom - mendations. On the other hand, when the trade-offs are less certain\u2014either because of low quality evidence or because evidence suggests that desirable and undesir - able effects are closely balanced\u2014weak recommenda - tions become mandatory. In addition to the quality of the evidence, several other factors affect whether recommendations are strong or weak (table 1).SUmm A r Y po IN t S Failure to consider the quality of evidence can lead to misguided recommendations; hormone replacement therapy for post-menopausal women provides an instructive example High quality evidence that an intervention's desirable effects are clearly greater than its undesirable effects, or are clearly not, warrants a strong recommendation Uncertainty about the trade-offs (because of low quality evidence or because the desirable and undesirable effects are closely balanced) warrants a weak recommendation Guidelines should inform clinicians what the quality of the underlying evidence is and whether recommendations are strong or weak The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE ) approach provides a system for rating quality of evidence and strength of recommendations that is explicit, comprehensive, transparent, and pragmatic and is increasingly being adopted by organisations worldwide Box 2 | Quality of evidence and definitions High quality\u2014 Further research is very unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of effect Moderate quality\u2014 Further research is likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and may change the estimate Low quality\u2014 Further research is very likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and is likely to change the estimate Very low quality\u2014 Any estimate of effect is very uncertainFactors that affect the strength of a recommendation Factor Examples of strong recommendationsExamples of weak recommendations Quality of evidence Many high quality randomised trials have shown the benefit of inhaled steroids in asthmaOnly case series have examined the utility of pleurodesis in pneumothorax Uncertainty about the balance between desirable and undesirable effectsAspirin in myocardial infarction reduces mortality with minimal toxicity, inconvenience, and costWarfarin in low risk patients with atrial fibrillation results in small stroke reduction but increased bleeding risk and substantial inconvenience Uncertainty or variability in values and preferencesYoung patients with lymphoma will invariably place a higher value on the life prolonging effects of chemotherapy than on treatment toxicityOlder patients with lymphoma may not place a higher value on the life prolonging effects of chemotherapy than on treatment toxicity Uncertainty about whether the intervention represents a wise use of resourcesThe low cost of aspirin as prophylaxis against stroke in patients with transient ischemic attacksThe high cost of clopidogrel and of combination dipyridamole and aspirin as prophylaxis against stroke in patients with transient ischaemic attacks on 25 April 2008 bmj.com Downloaded from 1 Applying GRADE to Coverage Decisions Principal Investigator and Team Members : Philipp Dahm (PI), of Project: 07/01/2011 \u201406/30/2012 Federal Project Officer: Stephanie Chang Acknowledgement of Agency Support: Funding for this conference was made possible by grant number R13HS019894 -01A1 from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ).

Abstract Purpose : The overarching goal of the AHRQ -funded conference was to develop a rational framework for coverage decision -making based on the GRADE framework that is acceptable to all major stakeholders. Scope : Policy decision -making about coverage is a complex process with profound implications for beneficiaries' access to medical treatments and new health technologies. There is a critical need for a well -defined , transparent , and ideally unified and widely applicable system for coverage decision -making. Methods: We conducted the workshop \"Applying GRADE to Coverage Decisions\" on April 3-4, 2012 , preceded by an open GRADE workshop . A total of 42 individuals representing various national and international stakeholder organizations and the GRADE Working Group attended the meeting . Participants were requested to participate in a pre -workshop survey. The workshop used an interactive fo rmat that consisted of large and small group sessions and provided participants the opportunity to discuss the GRADE framework based on five examples that were prepared prior to the meeting . Results : The workshop very effectively engaged a group of stakeh olders with different backgrounds yet a common goal of developing a transparent, methodologically rigorous approach to coverage decision -making. Working through the examples of GRADE frameworks of moving from evidence to coverage decisions, stakeholders provided commentary on the strengths of the GRADE framework, specific guidance on how to further improve the framework as well as contextual issues and barriers that play an important role in the implementation of a coverage decision framework. Key Words: Health policy, coverage decisions, evidence -based decision -making, clinical practice guidelines 3 II. Purpose The overarching goal of the proposed conference was to develop a rational framework for coverage decision -making that would be acceptable to all major stakeholders. The specific aims of this workshop were as follows: 1. To engage key stakeholder organizations involved in coverage decision -making in the adaptation and application of GRADE 2. To define how GRADE evidence profiles should b e adapted to best suit the information needs of p eople making coverage decisions 3. To develop a framework on how to move from evidence to coverage decisions, analogous to the GRADE framework for making judgments about clinical recommendations 4. To develop and disseminate guidance documents on the use of GRA DE for decisions about coverage III. Scope III. 1. Background: Decision -making about coverage for clinical interventions is a complex process with important implications for beneficiaries' access to effective interventions, their exposure to ineffective or harmful interventions, and how limited resources for healthcare are used. Ide ally, decisions about coverage require an estimate of the 'true' effectiveness of a given healthcare intervention, which should be based on sound scientific evidence. Unfortunately, high quality and definitive evidence to help with coverage decisions is fr equently lacking. For example, a study by Neumann et al which reviewed all national coverage decisions (n=119) for new technologies made by Medicare from 1999 - 2007 found that the Center s for Medicare and Medicaid Services ( CMS ) considered the supporting evidence as only 'poor' or 'fair' for 85% of the technologies evaluated. [1] Despite the absence of h igh quality evidence , CMS made favorable decisions in about 60% of the cases, although almost always with conditions placed on the populations or settings to which coverage applied. These findings underscore the importance of an explicit and transparent system for coverage decisions to facilitate complex judgements about the relative benefits and harms underlying a given coverage decision and to ensure that these judgements are well informed. A n editorial by Neumann and Tunis has further emphasized the ne ed for stricter evidentiary standards as well as \"a more transparent, timely, and participatory process\" for health policy decision -making. [2] At present , a variety of approaches to coverage decisions are used in the U nited States (US), all of which could b e improved. III. 2. Context: GRADE had previously developed a methodologically rigorous and transparent framework that allows the developers of guidance documents to grade the quality of evidence and rate the strength of recommendations. Based on two previ ous conferences organized by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality ( AHRQ ) exploring the use of GRADE for coverage decisions, it appeared that few changes would be required in the GRADE framework for assessing the quality of evidence to apply it to health coverage decisions. However, GRADE evidence profiles appeared not ideally suited to meet the information needs of individuals making health policy decisions. Also, most importantly , the GRADE framework for grading the strength of recommendations is not directly applicable to coverage decisions. This aspect of the GRADE framework - going from the evidence t o a recommendation or decision - in the context of coverage decisions was therefore the main focus of the conference. III. 3. Setting: The focus o f the conference was coverage decision -making within the context of the US healthcare system. 4 III. 4. Participants: Invited participants were mainly US-based stakeholder representatives affiliated with CMS as well as the United States Department of Veteran s Affairs (VA). Healthcare policy experts from outside the US as well as select members of the GRADE Working Group supplemented this group. IV. Methods IV. 1. Study Design: In accordance with our funding proposal, we designed a 2 -day workshop with the title \"Applying GRADE to Coverage Decisions ,\" which was held in Clearwater Beach, Florida on April 3-4, 2012. This workshop was by invitation only but preceded by a half-day GRA DE course that was designed to not only provide an in -depth introduction to GRADE methodology to invited workshop participants , but was also open to the interested public. IV. 2. Data Sources : We invited meeting p articipants with the goal of achieving a broad and ideally representative selection of key stakeholders primarily from the United States. In addition, we invited select individuals representing corresponding international organizations and agencies as well as members of the GRADE leadership. We identified the core group of US -based stakeholder representatives initially through the participant roster of two previous AHRQ -sponsored meetings of GRADE members with health decision -makers in Baltimore (July 13, 2009) and Washington, DC (September 14, 2 009). In addition, the AHRQ program officer , Stephanie Ch ang, identified key stakeholder representatives whom she had interacted with on related health policy issues as well as by sending an announcement to the national directors for CMS th rough a list-server. We identified international participants primarily through recommendations of members of the GRADE leadership, in particular And rew Oxman, who had previously worked extensively in this arena. Lastly, GRADE membership representation included i ts leadership (Holger Sch\u00fcnemann and Gordon Guyatt) as well as members with a dedicated interest in health policy that responded to an email announcement per list -server. IV. 3. Interventions : We planned this meeting through a number of initial face -to-face meetings of members of the Local Planning Committee (Benjamin Djulbegovic, Shahnaz Sultan and Philipp Dahm) , followed by several conference calls of the entire Planning Committee, which in addition to the Local Planning Committee members included Gordo n Guyatt, Andrew Oxman and Holger Sch\u00fcnemann. We also sought input from recognized thought leaders by scheduled conference calls with Sean Tunis from the Center for Medical Technology Policy in Baltimore, Maryland , and J. Mark Gibson and Pamela Curtis , Director and Deputy Director, respectively, of the Center for Evidence -based Policy at Oregon Health & Science University. We included Stephanie Chang , as AHRQ program officer , on selected conference calls for her input and guidance. To develop suitable and practically relevant examples to evaluate the GRADE framework for moving from evidence to coverage decisions, we reached out to prospective participants and the GRADE membe rship. Ultimately, we developed five examples of coverage decisions (contributors) , which were circulated among the participants in advance of the meeting in conjunction with a set of related articles about the GRADE Working Group [3-5] and related studies about cove rage decisions [6, 7]: 1. Should low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) be offered to patients with advanced solid cancer who have no standard indication for anticoagulation? (Holger Sch\u00fcnemann and Elie Akl) 2. Should screening followed by targeted interventions for hepatitis C be covered for the US population born between 1945 and 1965? (Yngve Falck -Ytter) 5 3. Should apixaban, for patients with atrial fibrillation? (Vijay Shukla, Karen Lee and Andy Oxman) 4. Should ipilimumab be covered for patients with advanced melanoma? (Yngve Falck - Ytter) 5. Should transurethral radiofrequency for women with stress urinary incontinence? (Philipp Dahm) In preparation for the conference, we devel oped and sent out a survey to those participants that were stakeholders of organizations that make coverage decisions. Questions aske d in the survey were directed towards obtaining information on the current status of the coverage decision -making process w ithin various organizations. We therefore asked questions about the use of systematic reviews, rating of the quality of evidence, the availability of explicit criteria and what implicit factors play a role in the decision -making processes. To ensure a solid understanding of the GRADE framework for rating the quality of evidence and moving from evidence to recommendations, which served as the basis for the framework for moving from evidence to coverage decisions to be discussed at the worksho p, we planned an introductory GRADE course on the afternoon of April 2, 2012. The development of this interactive course relied heavily on the extensive experience of the GRADE membership in conducting similar educational activities and was therefore able to capitalize on existing learning materials. To promote an active exchange of ideas, we developed a meeting agenda ( Appendix 1 ) that alternated lecture -style presentations with large group discussions and small group breakout sessions. The focus of the three small group breakout sessions was placed on three key issues : 1. Understanding the confidence in estimates of effect (quality of evidence) and resource use in the context of coverage decisions 2. Moving from evidence to coverage decisions 3. Applying the GRADE framework for moving from evidence to a coverage decision IV. 4. Measures: In preparation for the workshop, we invited input into the workshop organization from multiple individuals including Sean Tunis from the Center for Medical Technology Policy in Baltimore, Maryland , and J. Mark Gibson and Pamela Curtis , Director and Deputy Director, respectively, of the Center for Evidence -based Policy at Oregon Health & Science University as well as other GRADE members who were not part of the planning committee. Prior to the workshop's adjournment, we scheduled a formal session to solicit summative feedback about the GRADE framework, recommendations for improvement and sugge sted next step s in its further development and dissemination. We have also planned a post-workshop survey of participants to assess the impact the workshop has had on their process of coverage decision -making at the different stakeholder organizations that were represented. Finally, we are planning a manuscript to be published in the peer -revie wed literature to summarize the workshop findings. IV. 5. Limitations: Potential limitations of the workshop towards meeting its objectives lay in the lack of familiarity of the participants with the GRADE framework for rating the quality of evidence and moving from evidence to recommendations in the setting of clinical practice guidelines as well as non -representative selection of participants. We sought to address the first limitation by distributing articles discussing the key features of GRADE to invit ed participants in advance. In addition, we offered a half -day GRADE course on the afternoon immediately preceding the workshop that was well -utilized (see also below). Second, although somewhat limited by both funding as well as logistic constraints that are inherent to an effective workshop, we attempted to be inclusive with regards to the individual stakeholder representatives and organizations we invited. The workshop was widely announced using the GRADE website and list -server as well 6 as through AHRQ. Ultimately, nobody who expressed a legitimate interest in attending this workshop was declined. V. Results V. 1. Principal Findings /Outcomes: The workshop took place from April 3-4, 2012. Principal findings and outcomes are summarized below. V. 1.1 Pre-workshop GRADE course: Twenty -eight individuals attended the half -day, open pre-workshop course that was offered in conjunction with the workshop on coverage decision s. Among these, 12 individuals were not invited to the subsequent workshop; 16 individ uals were invited workshop participants who took the opportunity to receive an introduction to the GRADE framework on rating the quality of evidence and moving from evidence to recommendations. Based on participant feedback, this session was perceived as v ery valuable both by subsequent workshop participants as well as the other attendees. V. 1.2. Workshop Participation: A total of 42 individuals participated in the Applying GRADE to Coverage Decisions workshop (Appendix 2 ). Among these, 19 participants represented US - based stakeholder organizations making coverage decisions, namely contractor medical directors for CMS and directors from private insurance providers. Four participants represented international organizations (Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health ( CADTH ), National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE ) and the Australian Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee). The remaining participants represented the Centers for Disease Contr ol and Prevention ( CDC ), AHRQ, the Cochrane Collaboration , the Institute for Clinical and Economic Review and the GRADE Working Group. V. 1.3. Pre -workshop Survey : The results of the pre-workshop survey were reported at the conference. It was completed by 20 (87%) of 23 eligible stakeholder representatives. Analysis focused on the responses of the 14 representatives of US -based stakeholder organizations and found the following: 13/14 organizations used systematic reviews as the basis for coverage decisions ; among these, only 2 organizations developed systematic reviews themselves whereas all other s relied on systematic review s from external sources . 9/14 organizations rated the quality of evi dence internally . The system used was different for most organizations . The single most commonly identified rating systems were past or present rating system s recommended by AHRQ (n=4). Four participants referred to an internally developed system for rating the quality of evidence within their organization ; one participant indicated the recent implementation of GRADE. A single US stakeholder representative reported the use of formal cost -effectiveness analysis prepared by an internal medical policy team. Approximately 20% (3/14) indicated some form of internal p rocess for reviewing the quality of the systematic reviews being used; one participant reported this to be the role of a sister organization . All representatives indicated playing a key role (frequently in conjunction with others) in either making recommen dations for or against coverage to the actual decision -makers or being responsible for that decision themselves . All representatives indicated using a process that considered a varying degree of stakeholder involvement from (among others) advis ory committe es, specialty societi es, community physicians etc. 7/14 organizations reported explicit criteria for moving from evidence to coverage decisions; all CMS -affiliated stakeholders pointed towards the definition of \"reasonable and necessary\" as guidance. Additional implicit criteria mentioned were considerations 7 of accepted standards of care, position papers and other policies as well as a track record of previous national and local coverage decisions. In the ensuing discussion, participants expressed s trong a greement about the value of an organized, systematic way of reviewing and summarizing the best available evidence coverage decision s should be based upon. A rigorous, ro bust and transparent system would offer great value to all users. It woul d be important that any system be sufficiently user-friendly and ultimately receive s public buy -in. It was emphasized that coverage decision -makers have limited resources at their disposal and mostly rely on access to high quality evidence in the form of systematic reviews from external sources; this also speaks to the value of a unified system for rating the quality of evidence (such as GRADE) and the t remendous value of resources such as Cochrane reviews as authoritative source s of evidence . A suitable system would have to accommodate contextual issues and withstand the influence of public politics. It must accommodate stakeholder engagement from the public and legislature , which may be extensiv e and may be more important than the quality of e vidence . With regards to the applicability to the United States, it is relevant to note that CMS is currently prohibited from formal considerations of costs in its decision -making, although this regulation does not apply to the VA or private insurers. V. 1.4. GRADE framework for rating the quality of evidence: A presentation by Gordon Guyatt was followed by a discussion about its value within the context of framework s for coverage decision -making. Several GRADE characteristics were thereby clarified as summarized below : GRADE's outcome -specific nature that accounts for the fact that the confidence in an estimate of effect will frequently differ by outcome The distinction GRADE makes between the confidence in estimate of effect and magnitude of effec t as two separate issues; can be confident or lacking confidence about big or small events GRADE's emphasis on transparency in reaching judgments about quality of evidence (preferred terminology: confidence in estimates of effect) The importance of absolu te (versus relative) measures of effect size for decision -making GRADE's approach to subpopulations/groups , which is to investigate subgroup effects if there is compelling evidence to suggest that the magnitude of effect differs in some populations ; GRADE also recognizes that patient values and preferences may diverge GRADE rates observational studies as \"low\" quality evidence and the underlying rationale; GRADE does not rate up confidence in observational studies for consistency because there is no reason to think that biases are not going to show up again in other studies V. 1.5. Consideration of resource use in decision -making about coverage: A presentation by Suzanne Hill from the perspective of the Australian Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee was followed by a discussion about the difficulties of appropriately capturing resource utilization that id eally should capture both direct and indirect costs (i.e. time out of work ). Quality adjusted life -years (QALYs) as used by NICE, was recommended as a consistent measure of comparison. It was once again emphasized that CMS is currently prevented by law from formally considering costs in its decision -making framework. Additional discussions centered around the thoughtful consideration of the \"right\" price for a healthcare intervention which needs to be aligned with that of other similar services/tests to avoid unforeseen consequences and wrong incentives; if the cost is too high, uptake of a good medical service (for example HPV vaccination in young girls) may be low . 8 V. 1.6. Summary feedback from breakout session with regards to evidence presentation : The first of three breakout sessions asked participants to focus on how the necessary evidence for coverage decision -making was presented within the GRADE framework. Participants commented on the tremendous value of having structured evidence profiles at their finger -tips that are based on systematic reviews of the current best evidence and described that actual coverage decisions were often not based on up -to-date, high quality systematic reviews , in large part due to limited resources . Specific comments about the GRADE framework centered around two issues: Surrogate endpoints: Where surrogate endpoints are reported, it should be made explicit that this lowers the confidence in the estimates of effect for the outcomes that patients actually care about . Ideally, coverage decision -makers should make an a priori determination of which outcomes they care about , which would be in analogy to the GRADE framework for moving from evidence to recommendations in the guideline setting. Subgroup analysis: Participa nts emphasized the need and requirements for subgroup analyses to d emonstrate the particular effectiveness (or lack thereof) of a given medical service and i dentify potential for harms/increased risk for adverse effects . Subgroup analyses may result in res tricted c overage (with price reduction) and thereby provide an option for escaping the most intense pressure that frequently accompanies determinations of non -coverage. GRADE members provided clarification that the confidence in the estimate of effect associated with a subgroup analys is was captured under \"indirectness\". There was consensus among the group that subgroups were so important that it would need to be brought more into the foreground, potentially by providing a separate evidence profile for each subgroup . Valuable information would also be whether the subgroup analysis was one of many and whether it w as determined a priori or post -hoc. V. 1.7. Going from evidence to recommendations: A presentation by Holger Sch\u00fcnemann on the GRADE framework (given on behalf of and prepared by Andrew Oxman) for moving from evidence to recommendations was followed by a discussion that mainly served to clarify elements of the GRADE approach: First, a lthough GRADE includes a category in its framework for guidance development of \"no decision\" , this should be rarely used since the patient and physician us ually have to reach a decision. Second, there are c onceptual difference s between saying \"outcomes are uncertain \" versus \" equally balanced \", and lastly, when considering patients ' preferences, GRADE stipulates that these patients are well -informed of their options. V. 1.8. Summary feedback from breakout session on moving from evidence to recommendations: The second of three breakout sessions asked participants to focus on the usefulness of the framework for arriving at coverage decisions. The participants ' constructive feedb ack and the outcomes of the discussion as relevant to the various criteria are summarized below: Severity: Different wording is recommended to distinguish between prevalence, mortality and morbidity of the condition Appropriate use: Would have separate considerations about inappropriate use as it relates to saf ety and indication creep; move before consideration of health equity Equity: o Change wording of inequities to disparities o Important to recognize that this question is very context -dependent (for example , will there be a co -payment by patients ) Effect size of desirable and undesirable effects : 9 o The evidence profile implies some judgments (for example, which outcomes are most important); consider comment section for coverage decision -makers to comment on whether they agree or disagree with underlying assumptions or judgments of the evidence profile o For the criteria that focus on the best estimates of desirable effects and undesirable effects, should limit judgments to \"yes\" and \"no\" and leave out \"unce rtain\"; certainty is separate issue that is addressed in the subsequent questions about certainty of anticipated effects Certainty of anticipated effects: o Certainty (confidence in estimates of effect) should come first before size of effect o Criteria shoul d address overall effect and address whether there are credible subgroup effects; decision -makers will look at this even when confidence is very low Do benefits outweigh harms (values) : o For questions of whether benefits outweigh harms: Both \"uncertain \" and \"closely balanced\" are needed and, while they are based on different considerations, they likely lead to the same consequences o Add section that would allow labeling the fact that information about important outcomes (such as quality of life ) is not av ailable; ma ybe have entirely own dedicated section in evidence profile. Putting it into the \"values\" section is not ideal/misleading o Benefits outweighing harms should be based on a combination of benefits and harms and the associated patient values and preferences; may need footnote that, at times, patient perspective may be different than societal perspective; i.e. length and type of antibiotic use o Helpful to provide additional detail s of what assumptions we are making about patients ' values and preference s, what the source of information is and how these may vary between patients o Judgments about balance of benefits to harms/downsides should not be classified under term \"values\" Cost-effectiveness: Should be considered from societal perspective ; clarify Budget: Include both resource use and cost per procedure; consider overall budget impact (i.e. put into relationship to overall budget) Overall b alance of consequences: Not clear what consequences this includes (does it include costs?) ; will likely depend on context of coverage decision Coverage decision: Suggest ion to make coverage question dichotom ous: coverage yes/no; if yes the n consider with/without restriction or make assumptions about pricing; an alternative option would be one o f three choices : No, yes, yes/with restrictions Restrictions: see above Justification: no issues Implementation: no issues Additional comments were related to the importance of b urden and inconvenience to both the patient as well as the healthcare system; the la tter is addressed under resource use. There should be three separate criteria: Benefits, Harms, Burdens/inconvenience; answers should be yes/no: any uncertainty clarified in comments . Also, when more than two interventions are being addressed (for example in \"Should apixaban, dabigatran or rivaroxaban be covered for patients with atrial fibrillation? \") these could be presented more clearly. 10 V. 1.9. Contextual factors that impact coverage decisions: Participants of the meeting made frequent ref erences to contextual factors that influenced coverage decision -making yet were not yet explicitly captured in the GRADE framework ; their discussion took up a large part of the third breakout session. It was emphasized that these could not be readily summa rized as positive or negative , although small group work suggested that some were undesired for evidence -based decision -making . The following list of contextual factors was generated: Resource availability (to decision -makers) to search/rate evidence Medical legal environment/court decisions/risk of providing/denying coverage (impact) Local factors (state regulation) Influence by: o Patient advocacy groups o Industry/lobbyists o Politicians o Professional societies o Prominent individuals o Media and press Relate d regulatory decisions from other agencies (such as FDA) Coverage decisions by other providers Past/historical decisions about drug coverage or recommendations (cultural/normative factor that drives decision -making) Societal disease priorities Special considerations of : o Life-threatening conditions o Rare diseases Time horizon being used (i.e. short -term cash flow impact versus long -term benefit of preventive health measures) Incentives and disincentives of coverage decision; making sure ultimate utilizati on is aligned with patient welfare Realities of system of care and ability to understand the process Consideration of technical aspects of coding and claim submissions (credentialing of providers, administrative burden); may require changes in system Absence or presence of alternatives Likelihood of new research becoming available and in what time period Alternate access to the same service (i.e. self -pay) or not V. 2. Discussion: As witnessed by its excellent attendance and participants ' feedback at t he meeting, the AHRQ -funded GRADE workshop on coverage decisions was highly successful in engaging a large group of US -based stakeholders ( see aim #1 ) in a constructive dialogue about the applicability of a GRADE -based framework for coverage decision -makin g. The GRADE system of rating the quality of evidence and presenting it in a structured format as evidence profiles ( see aim #2 ) was well -received , with participants acknowledging the great value in a transparent, methodologically rigorous and unified syst em of rating the quality of evidence. The workshop provided concrete feedback on how the presentation of evidence criteria that influence coverage decision -making could find better presentation. With regards to moving from evidence to coverage decisions ( see aim #3 ), several important considerations became clear. These included the constraints of all CMS -affiliated coverage decision -makers in their ability to formally consider costs in their determinations. Second, the critical role that subgroup analyses play in the context of coverage decision -making not only in determining vulnerable populations but also for identifying individuals more likely to benefit from a given intervention even when the confidence that the overall benefits of a coverage decision o utweigh the burdens and harms for 11 the overall population is low, thereby prov iding a rationale for niche indications and avoidance of a \"do not cover\" determination. Third, the meeting was very helpful in shedding light on a large number of contextual fact ors that impact coverage decision -making yet cannot necessarily be categorized as positive or negative. Once again, the application of a robust, transparent and methodologically well -grounded framework, which is able to withstand external scrutiny and ultimately garner broad public support, was viewed as beneficial. To address the aim to develop and disseminate guidance documents on the use of GRADE for decisions about coverage (aim #4), a peer -reviewed publication based on the conference results is in prep aration. V. 3. Conclusions: The GRADE workshop on coverage decision -making was successful at meeting most of its objectives. It successfully engaged a large number of US -based stakeholders in a constructive dialogue on evidence -based coverage decision -making and was able to obtain critical feedback for future development of the GRADE framework. In addition, international stakeholders were engaged and provided important information about the international context. V. 4. Significance: The AHRQ -sponsored meeting represents an important milestone in on - going efforts towards developing an explicit and transparent system for coverage decisions to facilitate complex judgements about the relative benefits and harms . It successfully engaged a large number of stakeholders who provided critical feedback about the GRADE framework for moving from evidence to coverage decisions. It also established a network of direct personal contacts that will be invaluable for future pilot projects to formally as sess the framework in practice. V. 5. Implications: The GRADE workshop on coverage decisions represented a critical step towards the development of a methodologically rigorous, transparent and robust system for coverage decision -making. It has further ed a dialogue between healthcare methodologists and decision -makers, which is expected to be the seed for projects in which the framework is pilot - tested in practice. Several stakeholders have expressed interest in such future collaboration in which the GRADE W orking Group provides methodological expertise and guidance. The results of this workshop will also help inform the forthcoming meeting at the New York Academy of Medicine with the topic Evidence -Based Guidelines Affecting Policy, Pra ctice and Stakeholders (E-GAPPS; http://www.nyam.org/events/2012/evidence -based -guidelines -conference.html ) as well as enrich on -going efforts of the work package 2 of the DECIDE Collaboration (http://www.decide -collaboration.eu/project -partners ) and its closely related aims of promoting evidence -based decision -making among health policy -makers.

To avoid adding to this confusion by having multiple variations of th e GRADE system we suggest that the criteria below should be met when saying that the GRADE system was used. Also, while users may believe there may be good reasons for modifying the GRADE system, we discourage the use of \"modified GRADE approaches\" that di ffer substantially from the approach described by the GRADE Working Group. On the other hand, we encourage and welcome constructive criticism of the GRADE approach, suggestions for improvements, and involvement in the GRADE Working Group. As most scientif ic approaches to advancing healthcare, the GRADE approach will continue to evolve in response to new evidence and to meet the needs of systematic review authors, guideline developers and other users. Suggested criteria for stating that the GRADE system was used: 1. \"Quality of evidence\" should be defined consistently with one of the two definitions (for guidelines or for systematic reviews) used by the GRADE Working Group. 2. Explicit consideration should be given to each of the GRADE criteria for assessing the q uality of evidence (risk of bias/study limitations, directness, consistency of results, precision, publication bias, magnitude of the effect, dose -response gradient, influence of residual plausible confounding and bias \"antagonistic bias\") although differe nt terminology may be used. 3. The overall quality of evidence should be assessed for each important outcome and expressed using four ( e.g. high, moderate, low, very low) or , if justified, three ( e.g. high, moderate, and very low and low combined into low ) categories based on definitions for each category that are consistent with the definitions used by the GRADE Working Group. 4. Evidence summaries (narrative or in table format) should be used as the basis for judgements about the quality of evidence and the str ength of recommendations. Ideally, full evidence profiles suggested by the GRADE Working Group should be used and these should be based on systematic reviews. At a minimum, the evidence that was assessed and the methods that were used to identify and appra ise that evidence should be clearly described. In particular, reasons for up and downgrading should be described transparently. 5. Explicit consideration should be given to each of the GRADE criteria for assessing the strength of a recommendation (the balance of desirable and undesirable consequences, quality of evidence, values and preferences, and resource use) and a general approach should be reported (e.g. if and how costs were considered, whose values and preferences were assumed, etc.) . 6. The strength of r ecommendations should be expressed using two categories (weak/conditional and strong) for or against a management option and the definitions for each category should be consistent with th ose used by the GRADE Working Group . Different 6.2c Criteria for using GRADE.doc v. 20101012 6.2c Criteria for using GRADE.doc Grade Working Group www.gradeworkinggroup.org terminology to express weak/conditional and strong recommendations may be used , although the interpretation and implications should be preserved . 7. Decisions about the strength of the recommendations should ideally be transparently reported. HERC COVERAGE GUIDANCE US ING GRADE GRADE Determinants of Strength of Recommendation Factor Description Balance between desirable and undesirable effects The larger the difference between the desirable and undesirable effects, the higher the likelihood that a strong recommendation is warranted. The narrower the gradient, the higher the likelihood that a weak recommendation is warranted Quality of evidence The higher the quality of evidence, the higher the likelihood that a strong recommendation is warranted Costs (resource allocation) The higher the costs of an intervention \u2014that is, the greater the resources consumed \u2014the lower the likelihood that a strong recommendation is warranted Values and preferences The more values and preferences vary, or the greater the uncertainty in values and preferences, the higher the likelihood that a weak recommendation is warranted Strong recommendation In Favor : The subcommittee is confident that the desirable effects of adherence to a recommendation outweigh th e undesirable effects. Against: The subcommittee is confident that the un desirable effects of adherence to a recommendation outweigh the desirable effects. Weak recommendation In Favor : the subcommittee concludes that the desirable effects of adherence to a recommendation probably outweigh the undesirable effects, but is not confident. Against: the subcommittee concludes that the un desirable effects of adherence to a recommendation probably outweigh the desirable effects, but is not confident. Quality of evidence across studies for the treatment/outcome High = Further research is very unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of effect. Moderate = Further research is likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and may change the estimate. Low = Further research is very likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and is likely to change the estimate. Very low = Any estimate of effect is very uncertain. 1 HEALTH EVIDENCE REVIEW COMMISSION (HERC) COVERAGE GUIDANCE : INDUCTION OF LABOR DATE: 06/14/2012 *There was insufficient evidence for the following indications that were evaluated in the literature: preterm, prelabor rupture of membranes ; cholestasis of pregnancy mild and severe preeclampsia; eclampsia ; suspected IUGR (preterm abruption; chorioamnionitis ; maternal medical conditions ( e.g., renal disease, chronic pulmonary disease, c hronic hypertension, cardiac disease, antiphospholipid syndrome) ; gestational hypertension; fetal compromise (e. g., severe fetal growth restriction, isoimmunization, oligohydramnios) ; fetal demise RATIONALE FOR GUIDANCE DEVELOPMENT The HERC selects topics for guideline development or technology assessment based on the following principles: Represents a significant burden of disease Represents important uncertainty with regard to efficacy or harms Represents important variation or controversy in clinical car e Represents high costs, significant economic impact Topic is of high public interest HERC COVERAGE GUIDANCE Induction of labor should be covered for the following indications: Gestational age beyond 41 0/7 weeks Prelabor rupture of membranes at term Diabetes, pre-existing and gestational Induction of labor should not be covered for: Macrosomia (in the absence of maternal diabetes) Elective purposes (without a medical or obstetrical indication) Breech For those indications for which there is insufficient evidence of clear benefit over harm *, coverage may be based on an individualized treatment plan taking into account maternal and infant health. Coverage Guidance: Induction of Labor 06/14/2012 2 Coverage guidance development follows to translate the evidence review to a policy decision. Coverage guidance may be based on an evidence- based guideline developed by the Evidence- based Guideline Subcommittee or a health technology assessment developed by the Heath Technology Assessment Subcommittee. In addition, coverage guidance may utilize an existing evidence report produced by one of HERC's trusted sources, generally within the last three years. EVIDENCE SOURCE King, V., Pilliod, R., & Little, A. (2010). Rapid review: Elective induction of labor . Portland: at: http://www.ohsu.edu/xd/research/centers -institutes/evidence- based- policy - center/med/index.cfm The summary of evidence in this document is derived directly from this evi dence source, and portions are extracted verbatim. SUMMARY OF EVIDENCE Clinical Background The use of induction of labor (IOL) in the U.S. doubled between 1990 and 2006. Rates of labor induction vary substantially from state to state, from a low of 13.2% (California) to a high of 35.2% (Utah). The rate of increase in medically indicated IOL has been slower than the overall increase, suggesting that the increase in electiv e inductions has been more rapid. The increase in the overall use of induction is likely multifactorial. There appear to have been shifts in the threshold for induction at earlier gestations with both medically indicated and elective IOL. The practices and preferences of individual physicians also have an effect on the use of IOL and the subsequent risk of cesarean delivery. Women's requests may also contribute to increased demand for elective induction of labor (EIOL). Evidence Review Systematic reviews of randomized controlled trials find either a slight increase in cesarean delivery or no effect with EIOL, but there is some evidence of increased risk of operative vaginal delivery. Observational studies using spontaneous labor control groups find increased risk of cesarean delivery for nulliparous women with number needed to harm (NNH) of 4 to 10. Multiparous women may also have an increased risk of cesarean delivery with a NNH of 62 based on one study. Cesarean delivery is increased particularly among nulliparous women who have a low Bishop score (a measure of readiness for labor) at the time of EIOL and receive preinduction cervical ripening. Infants face an increased risk of admission to a neonatal intensive care unit Coverage Guidance: Induction of Labor 06/14/2012 3 (NICU) if their mothers undergo EIOL prior to 39 weeks of gestation. The length of active labor may be shorter with EIOL, although the total time spent on a labor and delivery unit or in the hospital may be greater. Most commonly cited indications for IOL are not well s upported by evidence. Evidence- supported indications and contraindications Indications with net benefit The only indications for induction of labor supported by strong evidence of net benefit are gestational age beyond 41 weeks and prelabor rupture of me mbranes at term. Indications with net harm The only indication for which there is evidence of harm is suspected macrosomia, for which there is no evidence of improved fetal outcomes, but an increase in the risk of cesarean section. Indications with insuff icient evidence The other indications for induction of labor that were considered in the evidence report but have insufficient evidence to make strong recommendations include the following: Preterm, prelabor rupture of membranes Cholestasis preeclampsia Eclampsia Suspected IUGR (preterm and term) Gastroschisis Twin gestation Oligohydramnios Gestational diabetes treated with insulin Maternal cardiac disease Quality improvement programs targeted at eliminating inappropriate EIOL c an be effective at reducing cesarean delivery outcomes, particularly for nulliparous women with a low Bishop score. Recommendations from Others The American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology (ACOG) identifies the specific indications for induction of labor , including but not limited to the conditions listed below: Premature rupture of membranes Eclampsia , Chorioamnionitis Maternal medical conditions (eg. diabetes, renal disease, chronic pulmonary disease, chronic hypertension, cardiac disease, antiphospholipid syndrome) Fetal compromise (eg, severe fetal growth restriction, isoimmunization, oligohydramnios) Post-term pregnancy Logistical reasons (risk for rapid labor, distance from hospital) In addition, for patients with gestational diabetes, they state the following: No good evidence to support routine delivery before 40 weeks of gestation. There are no data to support a policy of cesarean delivery purely on the basis of GDM. It would appear reasonable to recommend that patients with GDM be counseled regarding possible cesarean delivery without labor when the estimated fetal weight is 4,500 g or greater. For patients with pregestational diabetes, they state: Early delivery may be indicated in some patients with vasculopathy, nephropathy, poor glucose control, or a prior stillbirth. In contrast, patients with well -controlled diabetes may be allowed to progress to their expected date of delivery as long as antenatal testing remains reassuring. Expectant management beyond the estimated due date generally is not recommended. Cesarean delivery may be considered if the estimated fetal weight is greater than 4,500 g in women w ith diabetes. Induction of labor in pregnancies with a fetus with suspected macrosomia has not been found to reduce birth trauma and may increase the cesarean delivery rate. For suspected fetal macrosomia, they state: Recent large cohort and case -control s tudies demonstrate the safety of allowing a trial of labor for estimated birth weights of more than 4,000 g. Despite the poor predictive value of an estimated fetal weight beyond 5,000 g and a lack of evidence supporting cesarean delivery at any estimated fetal weight, most, but not all, authors agree that consideration should be given to cesarean delivery in this situation. For breech presentation, they state: Mode of delivery should depend on the experience of the healthcare provider. Cesarean will be the preferred mode for most physicians. Planned vaginal delivery may be reasonable. (No comment regarding induction) The National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) has the following recommendations regarding induction of labor: Coverage Guidance: Induction of Labor 06/14/2012 5 Induction of labor shoul d be offered in the following circumstances: Post-term pregnancy Preterm, prelabor rupture of membranes after 34 weeks Prelabor rupture of membranes at term after 24 hours Maternal diabetes , any type (after 38 completed weeks gestation) Induction of labor should not be routinely offered in the following circumstances: Maternal request Breech presentation Severe IUGR History of precipitous labor Suspected macrosomia Induction of labor may be offered depending on the desires of the patient in the following circumstances: Fetal demise Indications for which there are contradictory recommendations between ACOG and NICE are the following: Severe IUGR History of precipitous labor Maternal diabetes (after 38 completed weeks gestation) Overall Summary EIOL likely increases the risk of Cesarean section in nulliparous women, and possibly in multiparous women. It also increases the risk of operative delivery. EIOL at less than 39 weeks increases the risk of NICU admission for infants. EIOL has strong evidence of net benefit for gestational age over 41 weeks and prelabor rupture of membranes, while EIOL for macrosomia is the only indication for which there is evidence of net harm. There are a number of indications for EIOL for which there is insuff icient evidence of net benefit or harm. Indications for which there is conflicting recommendations include the severe IUGR, maternal diabetes and history of precipitous labor, although the latter likely reflects differences in the health care delivery system.

However , because these conditions may lead to significant disability and/or death, and delivery of some form is inevitable, it is recommended coverage should not be restricted. Strong Recommendation o Cholestasis of pregnancy o Placental abruption o Fetal demise o Chorioamnionitis Weak Recommendation o Mild preeclampsia o Severe preeclampsia at term o Preterm, prelabor rupture of membranes; o Gastroschisis o Twin gestation o Maternal medical conditions (e.g., renal disease, chronic pulmonary disease, chronic hypertension, cardiac disease, antiphospholipid syndrome) o Gestational hypertension o Fetal compromise (e.g., severe fetal growth restriction, isoimmunization, oligohydramnios) Coverage Guidance: Induction of Labor NEW DRAFT FORMAT FOR HERC 1/3/2013 2 o Severe preeclampsia in preterm women <34 weeks Note: Definitions for str ength of recommendation are provided in the \" GRADE Framework Description\" section. RATIONALE FOR GUIDANCE DEVELOPMENT The HERC selects topics for guideline development or technology assessment based on the following principles: Represents a significant burden of disease Represents important uncertainty with regard to efficacy or harms Represents important variation or controversy in clinical care Represents high costs, significant economic impact Topic is of high public interest Coverage guidance development follows to translate the evidence review to a policy decision. Coverage guidance may be based on an evidence- based guideline developed by the Evidence- based Guideline Subcommittee or a health technology assessment developed by the Heath Technology As sessment Subcommittee. In addition, coverage guidance may utilize an existing evidence report produced by one of HERC's trusted sources, generally within the last three years. EVIDENCE SOURCE King, V., Pilliod, R., & Little, A. (2010). Rapid review: Electi ve induction of labor . at: http://www.ohsu.edu/xd/research/centers -institutes/evidence- based- policy - center/med/index.cfm The summary of evidence in this document is derived directly from this evidence source, and portions are extracted verbatim. SUMMARY OF EVIDENCE Clinical Background The use of induction of labor (IOL) in the U.S. doubled between 1990 and 2006. Rates of labor induction vary substantially from state to state, from a low of 13.2% (Califor nia) to a high of 35.2% (Utah). The rate of increase in medically indicated IOL has been slower than the overall increase, suggesting that the increase in elective inductions has been more rapid. The increase in the overall use of induc tion is likely multifactorial. There appear to have been shifts in the threshold for induction at earlier gestations with both medically indicated and elective IOL. The practices and preferences of individual Coverage Guidance: Induction of Labor NEW DRAFT FORMAT FOR HERC 1/3/2013 3 physicians also have an effect on the use of IOL and the subsequ ent risk of cesarean delivery. Women's requests may also contribute to increased demand for elective induction of labor (EIOL). Evidence Review Systematic reviews of randomized controlled trials find either a slight increase in cesarean delivery or no effect with EIOL, but there is some evidence of increased risk of operative vaginal deli very. Observational studies using spontaneous labor control groups find increased risk of cesarean delivery for nulliparous women with number needed to harm (NNH) of 4 to 10. Multiparous women may also have an increased risk of cesarean delivery with a NNH of 62 based on one study. Cesarean delivery is increased particularly among nulliparous women who have a low Bishop score (a measure of readiness for labor) at the time of EIOL and receive preinduction cervical ripening. Infants face an increased risk of admission to a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) if their mothers undergo EIOL prior to 39 weeks of gestation. The length of active labor may be shorter with EIOL, although the total time spent on a labor and delivery unit or in the hospital may be greater. Most commonly cited indications for IOL are not well supported by evidence. Evidence- supported indications and contraindications Indications with net benefit The only indications for induction of labor supported by strong evidence of net benefit are gestational age beyond 41 weeks and prelabor rupture of me mbranes at term. Indications with net harm The only indication for which there is evidence of harm is suspected macrosomia, for which there is no evidence of improved fetal outcomes, but an increas e in the risk of cesarean section. Indications with insufficient evidence The other indications for induction of labor that were considered in the evidence report but have insufficient evidence to make strong recommendations include the following: Preterm, prelabor rupture of membranes Cholestasis preeclampsia Eclampsia Suspected and term) Gastroschisis Twin gestation Oligohydramnios Coverage Guidance: Induction of Labor NEW DRAFT FORMAT FOR HERC 1/3/2013 4 Gestational diabetes treated with insulin Maternal cardiac disease Quality improvement programs targeted at eliminating inappropriate EIOL can be effective at reducing cesarean delivery outcomes, particularly for nulliparous women with a low Bishop score. Recommendations from Others The American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology (ACOG) identifies the specific indications for induction of labor , including but not limited to the conditions listed below: Premature rupture of membranes Eclampsia , abruption Chorioamnionitis Maternal medical conditions (eg. diabetes, renal disease, chronic pulmonary disease, chronic hypertension, cardiac disease, antiphospholipid syndrome) Fetal compromise (eg, severe fetal growth restriction, isoimmunization, oligohydramnios) Post-term pregnancy Logistical reasons (risk for rapid labor, distance from hospital) In addition, for patients with gestational diabetes, they state the following: No good evidence to support routine delivery before 40 weeks of gestation. There are no data to support a policy of cesarean delivery purely on the basis of GDM. It would appear reasonable to recommend that patients with GDM be counseled regarding possible cesarean delivery without labor when the estimated fetal weight is 4,500 g or greater. For patients with pregestational diabetes, they state: Early delivery may be indicated in some patients with vasculopathy, nephropathy, poor glucose control, or a prior stillbirth. In contrast, patie nts with well -controlled diabetes may be allowed to progress to their expected date of delivery as long as antenatal testing remains reassuring. Expectant management beyond the estimated due date generally is not recommended. Cesarean delivery may be consi dered if the estimated fetal weight is greater than 4,500 g in women with diabetes. Induction of labor in pregnancies with a fetus with suspected macrosomia has not been found to reduce birth trauma and may increase the cesarean delivery rate. For suspected fetal macrosomia, they state: Coverage Guidance: Induction of Labor NEW DRAFT FORMAT FOR HERC 1/3/2013 5 Recent large cohort and case -control studies demonstrate the safety of allowing a trial of labor for estimated birth weights of more than 4,000 g. Despite the poor predictive value of an estimated fetal weight beyond 5,000 g and a lack of evidence supporting cesarean delivery at any estimated fetal weight, most, but not all, authors agree that consideration should be given to cesarean delivery in this situation. For breech presentation, they state: Mode of delivery should depend on the experience of the healthcare provider. Cesarean will be the preferred mode for most physicians. Planned vaginal delivery may be reasonable. (No comment regarding induction) The National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) has the following recommendations regarding induction of labor: Induction of labor should be offered in the following circumstances: Post-term pregnancy Preterm, prelabor rupture of membranes after 34 weeks Prelabor rupture of membranes at term after 24 hours Maternal diabetes , any type (after 38 completed weeks gestation) Induction of labor should not be routinely offered in the following circumstances: Maternal request Breech presentation Severe IUGR History of precipitous labor Suspected macrosomia Induction of labor may be offered depending on the desires of the patient in the following circumstances: Fetal demise Indications for which there are contradictory recommendations between ACOG and NICE are the following: Severe IUGR History of precipitous labor Maternal diabetes (after 38 completed weeks gestation) Coverage Guidance: Induction of Labor NEW DRAFT FORMAT FOR HERC 1/3/2013 6 Overall Summary EIOL likely increases the risk of Cesarean section in nulliparous women, and possibly in multiparous women. It also increases the risk of operative delivery. EIOL at less than 39 weeks incre ases the risk of NICU admission for infants. EIOL has strong evidence of net benefit for gestational age over 41 weeks and prelabor rupture of membranes, while EIOL for macrosomia is the only indication for which there is evidence of net harm. There are a number of indications for EIOL for which there is insuff icient evidence of net benefit or harm. Indications for which there is conflicting recommendations include the severe IUGR, maternal diabetes and history of precipitous labor, although the latter likely reflects differences in the health care delivery system. [ Evidence Source ] GRADE FRAMEWORK - *NEW* The HERC develops recommendations by using a modified version of the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system. GRADE is a transparent and structured process for developing and presenting evidence and for carrying out the steps involved in developing recommendations. There are four elements that determine the strength of a recommendation, as listed in the table below. The HERC reviews the evidence and makes an assessment of each element, which in turn is used to develop the recommendations presented in the coverage guidance box. Indication Balance between desirable and undesirable effects Quality of evidence Costs Values and preferences Recommen - dation Post-term pregnancy (gestational age >41 weeks) Net benefit (May reduce perinatal mortality and meconium aspiration syndrome. IOL not found to increase cesarean delivery.)

Against: The subcommittee is confident that the undesirable effects of adherence to a recommendation outweigh the desirable effects. Weak recommendation In Favor : the subcommittee concludes that the desirable effects of adherence to a recommendation probably outweigh the undesirable effects, but is not confident. Against: the subcommittee concludes that the un desirable effects of adherence to a recommendation probably outweigh the desirable effects, but is not confident.

Low = Further research is very likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and is likely to change the estimate. Very low = Any estimate of effect is very uncertain. POLICY LANDSCAPE - *NEW* There is a current quality measure developed by the Joint Commission for Accreditation of Hospitals Organization that pertains to elective induction of labor. The measure is titled \"Perinatal care: percentage of patients with elective vaginal deliveries or elective cesarean sections at greater than or equal to 37 and less than 39 weeks of gestation completed\". This measure is not currently endorsed by the National Quality Forum. No related measures were found from other entities when searching the National Quality Measures Clearinghouse .

It is a general guide, and must be used in the context of clinical judgement. It is not possible to include all possible scenarios and factors that may influence a policy decision in a graphic format. While this framework provides a general structure, factors that may influence decisions that are not captured on the framework include but are not limited to the following: Estimate of the level of risk associated with the treatment, or any alternatives; Which alternatives the treatment should most appropriately be compared to; Whether there is a discrete and clear diagnosis; The definition of clinical significance for a particular treatment, and the expected margin of benefit compared to alternatives ; The relative balance of benefit compared to harm; The degree of benefit compared to cost; e.g., if the benefit is small and the cost is large, the committee may make a decision different than the algorithm suggests; Specific indications and contraindications that may determine appropriateness.

CALL TO ORDER Alissa Craft called the meeting of the Health Technology Assessment S ubcommittee (HTAS) to order at 1:00 pm. The order of the agenda was revised so that Dr. Keenen could be present for the discussion of Vertebroplasty, Sacroplasty and Kyphoplasty. 2. MINUTES REVIEW No changes were made to the September 24, 2012 minutes. Approved 3- 0 (Ahmann, Craft, MacKay) . 3. COVERAGE GUIDANCE PROCESS Coffman reported that at the Health Evidence Review Commission's October meeting there was lengthy discussion generated by the EbGS Femoroacetabular Impingement (FAI) guidance. The subcommittee found ambiguous evidence, and the guidance says there is insufficient proof of efficacy, without recommending coverage or noncoverage. Some OHP medical directors provided feedback requesting a clearer coverage determination in cases like this where evidence is not sufficient ; otherwis e they need to make decisions as Medical Directors of individual plans . Making such decisions can be time consuming and could be inconsistent . They feel that the Commisssion and subcommittees are the correct bodies to make these decisions. In light of this feedback, t he Commission has requested a re-review of FAI . Staff and chairs are discussing possible changes to the coverage guidance process to better deal with areas where there is ambiguous evidence as well as clarifying the roles the various subcommitt ees. Staff and chairs are also discussing possible changes to the format in which guidances are presented , HTAS 11 -26-12 Minutes Page 2 including the GRADE format as well as a format developed by staff that would provide ratings similar to the Consumer Reports magazine. Coffman asked the subcommittee members whether they are comfortable in the role of making specific coverage recommendations or GRADE -style recommendations. After discussions the consensus of the group was that it will be making a clear yes or no coverage recommendation on topics that are presented, using \"may cover\" in certain cases where absolutely necessary. 4. REVIEW OF PUBLIC COMMENTS A) Continuous Blood Glucose Monitoring in Diabetes Mellitus Craft reviewed the coverage guidance from the meeting materials . Alison Little reviewed the public comments and the CEbP's recommended responses. Craft offered an opportunity for public comment , but no one wished to testify. No changes were made to the draft coverage guidance, as shown below: A motion was made to approve the draft coverage guidance as written and forward to HERC. Motion approved 4- 0 (Ahmann, Craft, MacKay , Waldmann ). B) Diagnosis of Sleep Apnea in Adults Craft reviewed the coverage guidance from the meeting materials. The subcommittee did not receive public comments during the public comment period. Craft offered an opportunity for verbal public comment, but no one wished to testify. No changes were made to the draft coverage guidance, as shown below: HERC COVERAGE GUIDANCE Real-time continuous glucose monitoring systems should be covered for Type 1 diabetes mellitus patients with HbA1c levels greater than 8.0% or a history of recurrent hypoglycemia, for whom insulin pump management is being considered, initiated, or utilized . Real-time continuous glucose monitoring systems should not be covered for Type 2 diabetes mellitus patients. Retrospective continuous glucose monitoring systems should be covered for Type 1 diabetes mellitus and should not be covered for Type 2 diabet es mellitus. HTAS 11 -26-12 Minutes Page 3 A motion was made to approve the d raft coverage guidance as written and forward to HERC. Motion approved 4- 0 (Ahmann, Craft, MacKay , Waldmann ). C) Treatment of Sleep Apnea in Adults Craft introduced the topic. Alison Little reviewed the public comments and the CEbP's recommended responses. The subcommittee discussed recent changes to the draft guidance. After discussion, the subcommittee opted to remove the reference to impaired cognition (which may be difficult to assess and costly to document) and elected to keep the other changes . The following revised draft reflects the changes requested by the subcommittee: HERC COVERAGE GUIDANCE The following diagnostic tests for Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) should be covered for adults: 1. Type I PSG is covered when used to aid the diagnosis of OSA in pat ients who have clinical signs and symptoms indicative of OSA if performed attended in a sleep lab facility. 2. Type II or Type III sleep testing devices are covered when used to aid the diagnosis of OSA in patients who have clinical signs and symptoms indicative of OSA if performed unattended in or out of a sleep lab facility or attended in a sleep lab facility. 3. Type IV sleep testing devices measuring three or more channels, one of which is airflow, are covered when used to aid the diagnosis of OSA in patients who have signs and symptoms indicative of OSA if performed unattended in or out of a sleep lab facility or attended in a sleep lab facility. 4. Sleep testing devices measuring three or more channels that include actigraphy, oximetry, and peripher al arterial tone, are covered when used to aid the diagnosis of OSA in patients who have signs and symptoms indicative of OSA if performed unattended in or out of a sleep lab facility or attended in a sleep lab facility. HTAS 11 -26-12 Minutes Page 4 A motion was made to approve the draft coverage guidance as modified and forward to HERC. Motion approved 4- 0 (Ahmann, Craft, MacKay , Waldmann ). D) MRI for Breast Cancer Diagnosis Craft reviewed the coverage guidance from the meeting materials . Staff reported that the subcommittee received no written comments during the public comment period. Craft offered an opportunity for public comment, but no one wished to testify. No changes were made to the draft coverage guidance, which read as follows: HERC COVERAGE GUIDANCE Coverage of treatment for Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) in adults should be limited, as follows: CPAP should be covered initially when all of the following conditions are met: 12 week 'trial' period to determine benefit. This period is covered if apnea - hypopnea index (AHI) or respiratory disturbance index (RDI) is greater than or equal to 15 events per hour, or if between 5 and 14 events with additional symptoms including excessive daytime sleepiness (Epworth Sleepiness Scale score > 10), or documented hypertension, ischemic heart disease, or history of stroke; Providers must provide education to patients and caregivers prior to use of CPAP machine to ensure proper use; and Positive diagnosis through polysomnogram (PSG) or Home Sleep Test (HST). CPAP coverage s ubsequent to the initial 12 weeks should be based on documented patient tolerance, compliance, and clinical benefit. Compliance (adherence to therapy) is defined as use of CPAP for at least four hours per night on 70% of the nights during a consecutive 30 day period. Coverage of mandibular advancement devices (oral appliances) should be provided. Intensive weight loss programs (if provided in the benefit package) should be covered for patients with obesity and obstructive sleep apnea. Surgical options may be covered for treatment of OSA when a diagnosis has been made, CPAP or other non- invasive treatments are not effective or not tolerated, and patients have been informed of the benefits and risks of surgery. HERC COVERAGE GUIDANCE In women with recently diagnosed breast cancer, preoperative or contralateral MRI of the breast should not be a covered service. HTAS 11 -26-12 Minutes Page 5 A motion was made to approve the draft coverage guidance as written and forward to HERC. Motion approved 4- 0 (Ahmann, Craft, MacKay , Waldmann ). 5. REVIEW OF NEW DRAFT COVERAGE GUIDANCES A. PET Scans for Breast Cancer Wally Shaffer presented the revised evidence summary for PET Scans for Breast Cancer and the new draft coverage guidance was discussed. Shaffer discussed the Choosing Wisely evidence source and that it also includes expert opinion along with an evidence- based review. He also noted that the HTAS review is narrower in scope, as the Choosing Wisely documents include CT as well as PET scanning. No public comments were offered. The committee discussed the use of the words \"routine\" and \"routinely\" in the draft from the meeting materials. After discussion they decided to remove these words, and change \"as surveillance testing\" to \"for surveillance testing.\" The updated draft is as follows : Action: A motion was made to approve and seconded to approve the draft coverage guidance as modified . Motion approved 4 -0 (Ahmann, Craft, MacKay , Waldmann) . The draft guidance will be posted for a 30- day comment period. After the motion was approved, Craft confirmed that a quorum is likely to be present for the Feb. 25 th meeting. Shaffer asked the committee to discuss whether to include quality measures from the National Quality Measures Clearinghouse (NCMC) as background information in draft coverage guidances. Craft asked whether providing this information would aid in making decisions. Little clarified that some quality measures are endorsed as evidence- based and others may not be. Little offered to provide the HERC COVERAGE GUIDANCE PET scanning should not be covered in initial staging of breast cancer at low risk for metastasis (asymptomatic individuals with newly identified ductal carcinoma in situ, or clinical stage I or II disease). PET scanning should not be covered as a modality to monitor response to treatment of breast cancer. PET scanning should not be covered for surveillance testing for asymptomatic individuals who have been treated for breast cancer with curative intent. HTAS 11 -26-12 Minutes Page 6 committee with a summary of t he history of the NCMC. The subcommittee decided not to make a decision pending review of that summary. The group recessed for a few minutes until Keenen could be present for the next topic. 6. REVIEW FINAL DRAFT COVERAGE GUIDANCE ON VERTEBROPLASTY, SACROPLASTY AND KYPHOPLASTY Craft reviewed the draft coverage guidance for Vertebroplasty, Sacroplasty, and Kyphoplasty and the accompanying note about malignancy. Dena Scearce of Medtronics provided oral and written comment, along with a proposed definition for the word, 'routine'. The draft she distributed contained the following language: An osteoporotic compression fracture is not \"routine\" if: 1) the patient is hospitalized due to pain that is primarily related to a well -documented acute fracture 2) the severity of the pain prevents ambulation or creates significant impairment to normal activities of daily living (ADLs); or 3) the pain is not adequately controlled with oral medication or the patient is unable to tolerate oral pain medication. In each of the above situations, the patient must have failed an appropriate trial of conservative management. Craft used the Medtronic draft as a starting point but in discussion, the committee made several changes and confirmed other language from the draft : Changed the \"or\" to \"and\" so that both inability to walk and inadequate pain control are needed in order for the condition to not be considered routine. Changed \"hospitalized\" to \"hospitalized under inpatient status. \" Decided to strike the phrase \"creates significant impairment to normal activities of daily living (ADLs) .\" Affirmed the requirement for a well -documented acute fracture (the group decided that an MRI would not be required for such documentation). Changed \"ambulation\" to \"unassisted ambulation\" Discussed whether to include a time requirement for conservative management, or strike the clause about conservative management. In the end the committee agreed to leave the language without specifying a specific t ime period, as the appropriate time period may vary for individual patients. Added a statement that sacroplasty should not be covered regardless of whether the fracture is considered routine. The resulting coverage guidance reads: HTAS 11 -26-12 Minutes Page 7 Note: This coverage guidance does not address vertebral fractures related to malignancy. A motion was made to approve the draft coverage guidance as modified and forward to HERC. Motion approved 4- 0 (Ahmann, Craft, Keenan, MacKay) . 7. PUBLIC COMMENT No additional public comment was offered. 8. ADJOURNMENT The meeting was adjourned at 3 :00 pm. The next meeting is scheduled for February 25, 2013 from 1:00 -4:00pm in Room 117B of the Meridian Park Hospital Community Health Education Center in Tualatin. HERC COVERAGE GUIDANCE Vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty should not be covered for routine osteoporotic compression fractures. An osteoporotic compression fracture is not \"routine\" if: 1. The patient is hospitalized under inpatient status due to pain that is primarily related to a well -documented acute fracture, and 2. The severity of the pain prevents unassisted ambulation, and 3. The pain is not adequately controlled with oral or transcutaneou s medication The patient must have failed an appropriate trial of conservative management. Sacroplasty should not be covered.

Members Absent: Som ; Marks, MD, Vice -Chair . Staff Present: Darren Coffman; Cat Livingston, MD, MPH; Also MD and Shannon Vandegriff, CEBP; Denise Taray, DMAP; Dr. Paul Just, Smith & Nephew; Terese Scollard, Oregon Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics ; Ann Demaree, RN; Nan Heim, Andrea Herzka, OHSU. Roll Call/Minutes Approval/Staff Report The meeting was called to order at 2:06 p m and roll was called. Chan reviewed the agenda. Minutes from the October 4, 2012 EbGS meeting were reviewed and approved. Action : HERC staff will post the approved minutes on the website as soon as possible. Coffman shared that at its October meeting, the HERC discussed some possible changes to the coverage guidance process and requested a more conclusive recommendation for the topic of Femor oacetabular Impingement (FAI) Syndrome surgery . In addition, HERC wanted further thought and possible modification to the coverage guidance process, particularly in areas in which there is weak or insufficient evidence. The OHP Medical Directors wanted the HERC to make difficult decisions , particularly in areas in which there is insufficient evidence. Staff and HERC leadership have been discussing potential options to update the coverage guidance development process. After discussing a variety of modifications to the process there was general consensus to recommend moving towards a format based on the GRADE methodology. Chan discussed the GRADE methodology, sharing its strengths as an open international collaboration with involvement of leaders of ev idence- based medicine. It specifically makes recommendations based on other factors in addition to the strength DraftEvidence- based Guidelines Subcommittee Minutes, 12/6/12 Page 2 of the evidence. Domains that are incorporated include the balance between desirable and undesirable effects, the quality of evidence, costs (or resource allocation), and values and preferences. A GRADE -based format would allow HERC to make final coverage recommendations that were \" strong \" or \"weak \" based these domains . Westbrook asked about how to deal with bias in working with the GRADE methodology. Chan clarified that this would be very different in a full guideline development process compared to how this may be done through the coverage guidance process. Finding independent sources of information about patient values and preferences can be challenging. Coffman also described the possibility for coverage guidances to go through their originating subcommittee first and then to the Value- based Benefits Subcommittee, prior to going to HERC . Coffman also shared that a rules advisory committee has been convened to develop administrative rules for the coverage guidance process. The rules address revisiting coverage guidances and interactions with the public and industry. The final rules are being revised and would go into effect in February 2013. Livingston discussed the question as to whether a \"policy landscape\" section containing a summary of a search of the National Quality Measures Clearinghouse should be included in coverage guidances. This suggestion was made by an OBGYN who suggested it was important to consider national quality measures as part of our coverage guidance process. Staff presented t wo examples of coverage guidances with policy landscape sections added. Joondeph shared t hat on the metrics committee there were a number of discussions about the national standards and how health plan metrics should relate to them . Aligning information may be important. Chan said it was important to be aware of what is going on from a national metrics standpoint, but expressed concern about basing coverage guidances on these metrics, which may not be supported by evidence. If the committee is trying to influence cost -effective , efficient care, we should be challenging some of these m etrics. Stecker stated that it is challenging to have opposing recommendations from different bodies which have significant clout nationally . He suggested HERC follow some national quality measures. Chan said that we should not necessarily follow the metrics if they are wrong and may want to ask national bodies to change their metrics in some cases . Overall the group agreed that having guidelines from the National Quality Measures would be helpful as they consider the evidence. REVIEW PUBLIC COMMENT AND FINALIZE RECOMMENDATIONS Topic: Management of Recurrent Acute Otitis Media In Children Discussion: Livingston opened discussion of the draft coverage guidance. T here were no written or verbal public comments. Discussion was primarily about how DraftEvidence- based Guidelines Subcommittee Minutes, 12/6/12 Page 3 the guidance might change if HERC elects to change to a more GRADE -like format. After discussion the Subcommittee made no changes to the guidance. Action: Approved draft coverage guidance by a vote of 7- 0 with no changes from the version which appeared in the meeting materials. The coverage guidance text approved by the committee is shown below: Topic: Cervical Cancer Screening Discussion: There were concerns about whether the guidance would prevent a physician from doing a screening after 4 years and 6 months when it is due every 5 years . After discussion the subcommittee decided to add a footnote clarifying that details such as exact intervals should be determined by each payer. Actions: Approved draft coverage guidance by a vote of 7- 0 with the following changes from the version which ap peared in the meeting materials. 1) Add a footnote: \"Exact interval limitations are to be decided by individual plans. \" 2) Change the title to \"Routine Cervical Cancer Screening \" The coverage guidance text approved by the committee is shown below: HERC COVERAGE GUIDANCE Prophylactic antibiotics should be covered for recurrent acute otitis media.* Tympanostomy tubes may be covered for acute otitis media only for recurrent acute otitis media. Adenoidectomy or adenotonsillectomy should not be covered for the treatment of recurrent acute otitis media. *Recurrent acute otitis media is defined here as three or more episodes in six months or four or more episodes in one year. Note: Coverage guidance for chronic otitis media with effusion is addressed in a separate document. DraftEvidence- based Guidelines Subcommittee Minutes, 12/6/12 Page 4 HERC COVERAGE GUIDANCE Cervical cancer screening should be covered in women 21 to 29 years old with cytology alone, not more than every 3 years***. HPV testing with or without cytology should not be covered Cervical cancer screening should be covered in women 30 to 65 years old either with: Co-testing not more than every 5 years*** Cytology alone not more than every 3 years*** Cervical cancer screening should be covered in women over 65 years old Until adequate screening is achieved* Until 20 years*** after regression or appropriate management of a high-grade precancerous lesion Cervical cancer screening should not be covered for the following populations: Women less than age 21 Women who have had a hysterectomy with removal of cervix for non- cervical cancer related (i.e. high grade precancerous lesion, i.e. CIN 2 or 3, or cervical cancer) Women over age 65 who have had adequate prior screening and are not otherwise at high risk of cervical cancer Specific testing considerations: Either liquid based cytology or conventional cytology are appropriate and should be covered. HPV testing should not be covered for further triaging when low -grade squamous intraepithelial lesions or higher are diagnosed The above recommendations also apply to women who have had abnorm al testing but whom are indicated to resume routine screening.** * Adequate screening is defined as 3 consecutive negative cytology results or 2 consecutive negative HPV results within 10 years of the cessation of screening, with the most recent test occurring within 5 years. ** Management of abnormal cytology and HPV testing is not addressed in this coverage guidance. The United States Preventive Services Task Force refers to the American Cancer Society, American Society for Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology, and American Society for Clinical Pathology guideline (Saslow 2012) to address management of abnormal results. ***Exact Interval Limitations are to be decided by individual plans. Note: This guidance does not apply to women who have received a diagnosis of a high- grade precancerous cervical lesion or cervical cancer, women with in utero exposure to diethylstilbestrol, or women who are immunocompromised (such as those who are HIV positive). DraftEvidence- based Guidelines Subcommittee Minutes, 12/6/12 Page 5 Topic: Treatment of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder Discussion: Little reviewed part of the public comment disposition. Westbrook raised concerns that the guidance doesn't address other forms of therapy, such as group therapy , that she has had success with. Little clarified that AHRQ looked broadly at this topic and did not find evidence to support the long -term effectiveness of other types of therapy. The subcommittee discussed whether it was too limiting to focus on the evidence- supported parenting programs. Members raised concerns about lack of coverage for other modalities such as psychot herapy and group therapy, especially where parent behavioral training is not available or appropriate (e.g. in cases of sexual abuse by a parent ). It was noted that these other therapies are currently covered under OHP and would be unlikely to change since this language does not include a recommendation of non-coverage. Several panel members raised d iscomfort with recommending therapies for which there is no evidence. A number of proposals were made to recommend coverage for group therapy. The decision was made not to vote on the issue at this time . Staff will answer some questions raised in the discussion and consult again with experts in the field. Actions: 1) Little to reexamine AHRQ report to ensure that there is no evidence for other forms of behavioral therapy/psychotherapy/group therapy. 2) Staff will o btain expert input from two experts with different areas of expertise and bring comments back to the next meeting. 3) Staff to bring back two versions of the guidance at the next meeting. 4) Subcommittee to complete review of public comment disposition at next meeting. Topic: Coronary Artery Calcium Scoring Discussion: Little reviewed the public comment disposition document. Stecker said the evidence that this technology affects outcomes is weak. He said that the place where most clinicians like to have it as a tool is for asymptomatic patients. For symptomatic patients, he has never heard of a cardiologist using it. Chan said at his institution he has seen it used in the past for patients who present at the emergency department with chest pain, who are at low risk and for whom other diagnostic work returns negative findings, to clear them to be released from the ED. Stecker and Chan agreed that it isn't currently being used for this purpose at present. Stecker said the main use would be for asymptomatic intermediate risk patients, and the evidence and cost effectiveness are not sufficient for him to feel that it should be covered in a resource constrained environment like the Oregon Health Plan . Actions: 1) Approved the coverage guidance as it appeared in the meeting materials 7-0. The coverage guidance text approved by the committee is shown below: DraftEvidence- based Guidelines Subcommittee Minutes, 12/6/12 Page 6 PREVIOUSLY DISCUSSED D RAFT CCTA is best studied in the ER in lower risk coronary patients. He said that the m ost important effect is on clinical logistics (having people discharged from the ER faster) rather than improve health outcomes. There are downsides to CT scans in ERs, that once you allow it for one thing it will start getting used for other indications. It can also be used in the emergency department for medical -legal reasons rather than to improve outcomes . He would be concerned about recommending coverage for this technology based on non -robust evidence, and would support noncoverage. Chan said that according to the table on page 88 of the packet, any male with typical angina would have a 30 percent risk of myocardial infarction, so for typical angina you could only do it on young women. He also doesn't see a lot of utility for this service. Stecker said that from the standpoint of lowering the cost of admissions by discharging people from the emergency room, calcium scoring would be a better option as it is a cheaper test with less radiation. Chan also raised concern about operationalizing option 2\u2014in the emergency department it is unlikely that clinicians would use the criteria from the study to decide when to use the technology . Actions: 1) The subcommittee accept ed option 1 from the meeting materials on a 7- 0 vote, to be posted for public comment . The coverage guidance text approved by the committee is shown below: Topic: Femor oacetabular Impingement (FAI) Syndrome Surgery Discussion: Livingston introduced the topic. The purpose of this discussion was not to discuss the clinical facts but rather to discuss how to deal with this topic , HERC COVERAGE GUIDANCE Coronary Computed Tomography Angiography (CCTA) should not be covered. HERC COVERAGE GUIDANCE Coronary artery calcium scoring (CACS) should not be covered. DraftEvidence- based Guidelines Subcommittee Minutes, 12/6/12 Page 7 as HERC requested a re- review. Based on the administrative rule that is being developed, the subcommittee may need to obtain additional expert input in order to come to a clear coverage recommendation. Livingston asked for input from the subcommittee on how to obtain expert opinion on this topic as well as other s. Chan pointed out that this kind of issue will be faced on other topics. Livingston suggested that in that case it would be better to wait until the HERC settles on a process before addressing FAI again. Coffman said that one suggestion was to use the eGov subscription notice to announce that we are looking for expert representation for a particular topic. Coffman said we can get more specific on that if HERC so chooses. Chan said that the ideal time to have expert input would be when the subcommittee first addresses the topic. Livingston suggested that staff and chairs could confer as to whether to solicit an expert before the subcommittee meeting. Chan suggested that it might be good to have that discussion with the entire subcommittee rather than just the chairs. Livingston agreed that this is a reasonable approach. No formal action was taken. Actions: 1) Staff to work with HERC to develop rule and procedures and updated process before FAI is reviewed again. Topic: Neuroimaging for Headache Actions: This topic was not discussed and will be discussed at a future meeting. Public Comment: Three individuals provided public comment. Dr. Paul Just, Director of Global Healthcare Economics for Smith & Nephew , testified about FAI syndrome . He said that a significant amount of research has taken place since the evidence search relied on for the evidence review. For FAI, he said there are many reports and none say that FAI does not work; this is different than for many other topics where research is inconclusive. He also said that delaying surgery more than six months can result in a higher incidence of complications, including hip arthroplasty. In evaluating the literature (despite the lack of level 1 studies) he said there is no evidence showing a return to activity with conservative care and consistent reports of good outcomes with surgery. Andrea Herzka, Asst. Professor of Orthopedics at OHSU , testified on FAI syndrome. Regarding conflicts of interests, she has been an instructor on the use of this surgery but no longer is. She said the evidence review in the coverage guidance says that , overall , none of the studies demonstrate that one specific treatment results in better outcomes than the other. She mentioned studies from Chris Larson in Minneapolis showing improved outcomes from newer techniques compared to older techniques . She said that FAI surgery is a relatively safe procedure. She said that there is no level 1 study and it would be unethical to DraftEvidence- based Guidelines Subcommittee Minutes, 12/6/12 Page 8 assign patients to a nonintervention group given the availability of an effective surgical approach, and that t hese patients often have difficulty walking and sitting and doing other common tasks . The data to date shows that the best available treatment is the surgical approach. Many of them (but not all) do well. Commercial payers have developed strict criteria for the surgery and suggested that the subcommittee create guidelines. She offered to be involved as needed. Terese Scollard testified on adult disease related malnutrition. She disclosed no conflicts of interest. She said that this condition has been shown to cause high costs in Europe, where they have come up with algorithms and treatment plans. She cited a May 2012 report which defines disease- related malnutrition more precisely, and said that the costs of waiting to treat malnutrition are very high. She said that early intervention inside and outside the hospital is important to effective treatment . She sees this as an opportunity for Oregon to encourage use of these consensus guidelines and screening tools. Livingston said that this subcommittee is tasked mostly with making coverage guidances and asked Scollard whether there are elements of the needed treatment that typically aren't covered. Scollard said that it's not the coverage; rather it is just practice guidelines and standards that are needed to make sure that the condition is monitored and treated appropriately. Livingston said that this subcommittee looks at guidelines about once a year and could consider this topic and see if it meets the criteria of what kinds of guidelines to develop. Scollard offered to assist in any way she can. Actions: 1) Staff to review whether disease related nutrition is a good candidate for a future guideline. Issues for next meeting: Next meeting: February 7, 2012 at Meridian Park Hospital Health & Education Center, room 117, 2- 5 pm. The meeting was adjourned at 5 p.m. "}
