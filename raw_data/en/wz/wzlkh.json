Patient Deliveries/Gifts At this time, we are not accepting deliveries for patients. This includes deliveries from local florists, Amazon and UPS to name a few. The Nuture Gift Shop, located in the main lobby of the hospital offers a delivery service, which includes fresh flower arrangements, balloon bouquets, stuffed animals, puzzle books and simple necessities. The Gift Shop is open weekdays, 7 am to 8 pm, and weekends, 10 am to 6 pm. For inquires or to place an order, please call (631) 444-3133. When visiting patients, visitors are allowed to bring items, such as Mylar balloons (we do not allow latex balloons) or floral arrangements (we do not allow potted plants). In most areas of the hospital, these items are permissible with the exception of our intensive care units (ICUs) and/or if the patient has a restriction based on their treatment or diagnosis. Before the visit, it is best for visitors to check with unit staff to ensure the patient is permitted to have items brought to their room.
