These modalities include: - Phototherapy: harnessing the healing power of natural sunlight to prevent cancer, reverse clinical depression, alter moods, increase bone density and much more. - Color therapy: using selected wavelengths of natural sunlight to create a physiological, psychological or energetic response in a patient. - Homeopathy: using the \"memory of water\" to imprint a patient with the healing properties of selected substances. - Sound therapy: the therapeutic use of sound waves to create a healing response in the patient. Music therapy is one branch of sound therapy. - Spiritual healing: harnessing the power of prayer and focused intention to alter the health outcome for a patient. Also called \"non-local medicine.\" It is well supported by double-blind placebo studies. - Mind/body medicine: harnessing the power of the patient's own mind to affect healing. This is typically accomplished through meditation exercises, laughter as medicine, or creative visualization exercises. The proven power of the placebo effect demonstrates the enormous healing potential of this modality (in tens of thousands of medical studies, the placebo effect has been proven more effective than any prescription drug known to mankind). - Acupuncture: the use of tiny needles to alter the flow of chi (energy) through the body for a specific health reason. - Magnetic therapy: the use of permanent magnets or electromagnets to catalyze a [healing](https://www.naturalnews.com/healing.html) response in the patient. Some magnetic therapies attempt to augment the Earth's magnetic field; others deliver high-energy magnetic bursts in an attempt to destroy cancer tumors. - Crytals, gems and rocks: the harnessing of vibrations from crystals and other rocks for healing purposes. All crystals vibrate. In fact, if you are reading this report, you're using crystal vibration right now! (The CPU clock in your computer operates on a timing signal generated by a crystal.) - Electromedicine: applying small electrical currents to selected points on the body to accelerate healing, repair broken bones, create changes in muscle training and body tension, destroy invading bacteria, and other uses. The body already relies on electromedicine for internal healing. All bones, for example, are piezo-electric devices that create an electric charge when stressed, attracting minerals like calcium to the site of the charge. In addition, a continuous electric current, when applied to the skin over a blood vessel, kills bacteria present in the blood. Electromedicine has great potential for healing. There are many other areas as well, but these represent some of the most popular vibrational [medicine](https://www.naturalnews.com/medicine.html) technologies being used today. Unlike the other technologies mentioned in this report, much of the technology already exists for vibrational medicine. Every therapy mentioned above is being used right now in the United States and around the world. The challenge is to see their use become widespread and accepted by practitioners of western medicine. Unfortunately, most practitioners of modern (western) medicine are steeped in an outdated mindset of drugs and surgery and tend to shun any therapy that isn't sanctioned by the pharmaceutical industry. Let's take a closer look at the kind of paradigm shifts that will be required in modern medicine in order for vibrational medicine to earn increased credibility. A brief history of western medicine Looking at the history of western medicine, the modalities and belief systems are readily divided into three chronological phases: 1. Physical medicine. 2. Chemical medicine. 3. Energetic medicine. Physical medicine describes the sort of medicine practiced by the western world in the 19th early 20th centuries. If a foot became infected, the doctor cut it off. Surgery was regarded as a \"heroic\" procedure (to a very large degree, it still is), and disease was understood to be caused by the physical malfunctioning of physical organs. Chemical medicine emerged in response to the discovery of penicillin and the realization that certain chemicals -- prescription drugs or antibiotics -- could target and destroy infectious disease. This belief continues to this day, where diseases are now commonly described as \"chemical imbalances\" that must be treated with a lifetime of prescription drugs. Today, western medicine is firmly seated in the belief system of chemical medicine. Pharmaceutical companies, which dominate today's medical landscape, rely exclusively on this paradigm to market their products and convince patients they need potent chemicals in order to be happy, healthy or sane. This is why nearly all diseases and symptoms are presently described as chemical imbalances that can be corrected with expensive drugs. This belief is a distortion, however. Energetic medicine (vibrational medicine) is just starting to be explored by the medical mainstream. In energetic medicine, the powerful effects of subtle energy systems are explored and leveraged for healing. Energetic medicine recognizes the whole of the patient rather than the parts (as in physical medicine). Energetic medicine also believes that the human body is not a chemical dumping ground, and that both disease and health have core underlying causes that go far deeper than mere symptoms. The future of medicine is vibrational Tomorrow's medicine will no doubt increasingly rely on vibrational medicine. Not only is it a more advanced perspective on the true causes of disease and health, but it can be offered to patients with virtually no side effects and at very low cost. As one simple example, if a doctor can help a patient laugh heartily for five minutes, the patient will be significantly helped in all three areas: physical, chemical and vibrational. From a physical point of view, the very act of laughing moves lymph fluid, promotes the oxygenation of body cells and organs, and improves circulation. From a chemical point of view, laughter results in the creation of literally tens of thousands of dollars worth of healthful brain chemicals (if you had to buy them, that is) that improve mood, enhance alertness, etc. From an energetic point of view, laughter helps relax the patient's body and mind, opens them to enjoying interaction with others, and literally restructures their internal energies. That's just one reason why Dr. Patch Adams, popularized in the movie with Robin Williams, relied so heavily on laughter as a powerful healing tool. In a very real way, laughter is perhaps one of the most powerful healing tools available to mankind, and yet today's hospitals and doctors' offices are hardly places that inspire unbridled joy. The power of placebo Interestingly, vibrational medicine has already been proven by literally tens of thousands of clinical studies to be the single most powerful healing tool known to western medicine, and yet it remains largely ignored by the very same people conducting the studies. Let me explain: in most clinical trials, there is something called the placebo effect which describes the level of healing that takes place in patients who were given no drugs and no surgery but who thought they received the drugs or surgery. For example, they would be given inert pills or subjected to a \"sham surgery\" that actually resulted in no real surgical operation. This is standard practice in clinical trials. But even though the patients don't receive the drugs or surgery as part of the study, they routinely show permanent improvements in their health. One study of Parkinson's patients proved that this genuine health improvement remained strong even twelve months after the placebo surgery, and the measure of improvement was objective: even the medical staff agreed that patients showed measurable improvements. Obviously, if patients are getting better thanks to the placebo effect, it can't be the drugs or surgery that's causing the improvement. The healing effect is caused by the mind of the patient. Their belief in the drug or surgery is what's causing them to get better, not the actual drug or surgery (since they didn't receive either). Now here's the amazing part: if you take a closer look at these tens of thousands of studies, you'll find that the placebo effect has been proven effective in treating approximately 30% of all disorders and diseases. That's right: this single mind/body tool has been scientifically proven to reverse or improve 30% of all diseases and symptoms: heart disease, stroke, arthritis, cancer... you name it. The proof is right there in the studies. This is astonishing: mind/body medicine offers us a powerful healing tool that works with no negative side effects and zero cost... and it's effective against practically any disease or condition. So what does western medicine do with this knowledge? They discard it. The placebo effect is routinely tossed or ignored. It's considered a \"false\" result by medical researchers, even when the numbers prove it to be not just real, but perhaps the most powerful healing tool of all. Truth is whatever agrees with your beliefs Why does this happen? Doctors, researchers, surgeons and others in the medical community function like everyone else: when presented with evidence that contradicts their firmly held belief systems, they discard the new evidence because it doesn't fit their internal model of the way the world works. Accordingly, the mountain of evidence supporting the placebo effect gets routinely discarded not because it isn't compelling and scientific, but because modern medicine doesn't understand how it could work. It doesn't fit the model. And it's not just the placebo effect that gets ignored. Homeopathy is also routinely ignored or even attacked by western medicine for the simple reason that western medical technology doesn't understand how it works, either. In a homeopathic remedy, an extract from a particular element such as a flower, a plant, or even a poison like arsenic, is mixed with water and then diluted to such extremes that there's not a single molecule of the original element remaining in the final mixture. Yet the final mixture holds the \"memory\" or the \"vibration\" of the original element that was used, and it exhibits scientifically measurable and verifiable effects on biological systems (both humans and animals) when consumed. The evidence showing that homeopathic remedies work is not merely compelling, it is scientifically robust. An honest researcher reviewing the clinical evidence on homeopathy can only reach one of two conclusions: either homeopathy works, or controlled, double-blind placebo clinical trials don't work. In other words, if you measure the effect of homeopathic remedies using the same science and scrutiny as clinical drug trials, you get a significant result that proves homeopathic remedies work. And yet western medicine continues to throw out this scientific reality, not because it hasn't been scientifically proven, but because it doesn't fit the model. Homeopathy is one of the most promising areas of vibrational medicine. Homeopathic remedies can help people fight infectious disease, reverse cancer and diabetes, improve their brain function, detoxify their systems, recover from wounds more quickly, increase fertility, and accomplish a long list of other health benefits. Phototherapy Phototherapy represents a rapidly emerging branch of vibrational medicine, and it's being slowly accepted by the scientific community. In experiments with infrared light, NASA (National Aeronautics and Space Administration) has shown that flesh wounds like scrapes, cuts and burns, [heal](https://www.naturalnews.com/heal.html) 40% faster when exposed to a few minutes of infrared LED light each day. The mere presence of the light causes the body to accelerate its healing. Light is a powerful healing tool, and no light is more available than our own [sun](https://www.naturalnews.com/sun.html). The sun is a source of tremendous healing potential. With natural sunlight, people can reverse prostate cancer and breast cancer, reverse clinical depression, enhance their bone density and prevent osteoporosis, vastly improve circulation, accelerate wound healing, and experience a long list of other significant health benefits. And yet, remarkably, nearly the entire population of the western world has been taught to believe that sunlight is dangerous. People are warned to \"stay out of the sun!\" They slather on sunscreen, they wear heavy clothing, and they avoid the sun at all costs. Meanwhile, rates of prostate cancer are skyrocketing and vitamin D deficiency is now one of the most common nutritional deficiencies in America, Canada and Europe. With daily exposure to natural sunlight, the body creates its own vitamin D and puts it to work preventing prostate cancer, breast cancer and a long list of other disorders. People need natural sunlight. It seems so obvious that it's almost ridiculous having to point it out. And yet fear of the sun is so deeply ingrained in western societies that merely mentioning the phrase, \"sunlight is good for you...\" earns you gaping stares from practically everyone. Clearly, the human species didn't evolve under fluorescent lighting: it evolved under the natural sun, and as human beings, we depend on frequent exposure to the sun for optimum health. Without sunlight, in fact, we cannot function in a healthy way. The growing problem of Seasonal Affective Disorder, where people experience deep depression due to lack of sunlight, is just one of the many clues pointing to the reality that people need natural sunlight in order to be healthy. Lack of sunlight is even part of the reason we're seeing an epidemic of obesity: sunlight exposure diminishes cravings for carbohydrates and sweets by balancing levels of serotonin in the brain. Surgical sound waves Another promising area of vibrational medicine involves the use of sound waves for manipulating both physical tissues and energetic fields in the body. For this discussion, I'll stick with the physical tissues. I first discussed this technology concept in 2001 with Jonathan Goldman, a sound healing pioneer working more on the spiritual side than the medical side of sound therapy (http://www.HealingSounds.com). By using standing waves of low frequency sound combined with subtle variations in the frequency and wavelength, we can directly control fluids (like blood and lymph) and even manipulate tissues in the human body without needing invasive surgery. How? Cymatics = the study of sound on physical matter Sound restructures physical matter. This is evidenced by observing the effect of sound waves on grains of sand spread across the top of a large drum. If you hum into the drum, the sand will form physical patterns that coalesce across the drum head according to slight variations in pitch and amplitude. The science is called cymatics, and much of the original work in this area was conducted by the late Hans Jenny. (See http://www.cymaticsource.com for information.) In cymatics, we see that sound creates waves of force that can move physical objects either towards or away from the source of that sound. In my own experiments using tone generator software, home speakers, sheet metal, and dirt from my back yard (how's that for high-tech?), I was able to propagate grains of dirt and sand along a radiating path from the source of the sound by simply altering the frequency of the sound. (You have to watch the amplitude, however, because if the sound waves are too strong, the grains of sand will leap right off the sheet metal.) For example, if you start with a sound frequency of 300 hertz (300 cycles per second), and then slowly reduce the frequency (pitch down the sound), it will elongate the wavelength of the sound and the grains of sand will slowly move away from you. If you start at a low frequency and increase the pitch, the grains of sand will move towards you as if on a conveyer belt. This same technology, I proposed in 2001, could be used in the bodies of patients to move body fluids and massage organs, among other uses. Diabetic patients, for example, frequently experience a critical lack of blood supply to their feet due to diabetic neuropathy. By using sound generators under the soles of their feet and broadcasting a sound sequence that slowly increases pitch (then repeats from the original low tone after ramping up), you can actually draw blood into the feet and minimize damage from neuropathy. The same approach can be used for any organ or limb in the body. Sadly, such medical devices do not exist today. Yet this merely scratches the surface of potential for sound therapy. Imagine using two sound sources and coordinating their configuration of standing waves so that peaks of force can be pinpointed along the X and Y axis. Now add a third sound source so that you can operate in three dimensions. With such a system, doctors or surgeons could manipulate internal organs or biological structures with precision without needing to slice into the patient's body with scalpels. It's non-invasive surgery through the miracle of sound. To date, no such system exists, but they are theoretically possible. There has been, however, some exciting new research emerging in the world of \"medical acoustics.\" Dr. Alexander Sutin at the Stevens Institute of Technology in New Jersey recently presented six papers at the Acoustical Society of America where he described a phenomenon known as time-reversal acoustics that promises to revolutionize modern medicine. Time-reversal acoustics will allow a whole new approach to imaging (seeing inside the body), destroying kidney stones, targeting tumors and even conducting surgical procedures without needing to invade the body. Such technology blends the often mysterious world of vibrational medicine with today's so-called \"hard core science\" to bring significant new healing modalities to the world of medicine. If sound can be widely accepted as a healing technology by organized medicine, further exploration into phototherapy, homeopathy and acupuncture is likely to follow. And that's how modern medicine graduates from a stage two (chemical medicine) paradigm and moves into stage three (vibrational medicine). Wrap up In all, vibrational medicine represents the next phase in the evolution of healing technology. It delivers powerful healing with no negative side effects and at very low cost. When fully embraced by the medical community, vibrational medicine will make chemicals and prescription drugs virtually obsolete. When it comes to vibrational medicine, the science is already here: reliable studies prove its efficacy. But what's needed is the acceptance of this technology by the medical community, and that acceptance will take time to achieve.
