The Tibetan medical system is based upon a synthesis of the Indian ( [Ayurveda](/index.php/Ayurveda)), Persian ( [Unani](/index.php/Unani)), Greek, indigenous Tibetan, and Chinese medical systems, and it continues to be practiced in [Tibet](/index.php?title=Tibet&action=edit&redlink=1), [India](/index.php?title=India&action=edit&redlink=1), [Nepal](/index.php?title=Nepal&action=edit&redlink=1), [Bhutan](/index.php?title=Bhutan&action=edit&redlink=1), [Ladakh](/index.php?title=Ladakh&action=edit&redlink=1), [Siberia](/index.php?title=Siberia&action=edit&redlink=1), [China](/index.php?title=China&action=edit&redlink=1) and [Mongolia](/index.php?title=Mongolia&action=edit&redlink=1), as well as more recently in parts of Europe and North America. It embraces the traditional [Buddhist](/index.php?title=Buddhist&action=edit&redlink=1) belief that all illness ultimately results from the \"three poisons\" of the mind: ignorance, attachment and aversion. Like other systems of traditional Asian medicine, and in contrast to [biomedicine](/index.php/Biomedicine), Tibetan medicine first puts forth a specific definition of health in its theoretical texts. To have good health, Tibetan medical theory states that it is necessary to maintain balance in the body's three principles of function [phlegm](/index.php/Phlegm)]. [Lung](/index.php?title=Lung_(Tibetan_Buddhism)&action=edit&redlink=1) is the source of the body's ability to circulate physical substances (e.g. blood), energy (e.g. nervous system impulses), and the non-physical (e.g. thoughts). In embryological development, the mind's expression of materialism is manifested as the system of rL\u00fcng. There are five distinct subcategories of rLung each by the quantitative and qualitative characteristics of heat, and is the source of many functions such as thermoregulation, metabolism, liver function and discriminating intellect. In embryological development, the mind's expression of aggression is manifested as the system of mKhris-pa. There are five distinct subcategories of mKhris-pa each by the quantitative and qualitative characteristics of cold, and is the source of many functions such as aspects of digestion, the maintenance of our physical structure, joint health and mental stability.
