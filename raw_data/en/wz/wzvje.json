Commonwealth Serum Laboratory records show the trials were carried out on babies as young as three months in five institutions between December 1959 and early 1961. Quadruple antigen, containing Salk polio vaccine, was not publicly released until November 1960. An investigation by the Melbourne Age, reported in the Herald at the weekend, revealed that millions of doses of Salk vaccine produced by the then government-owned CSL between 1956 and 1962 were contaminated with a monkey virus called SV40. Researchers have found traces of the virus in a range of human cancer cells, including mesothelioma lung disease. It is not clear from the CSL records whether polio vaccine used to produce quadruple antigen used in the tests came from contaminated batches. The federal Health Minister, Tony Abbott, has ordered a departmental inquiry into CSL's decision to release contaminated vaccines and any risks associated with it. Health authorities stressed there was no proven link between SV40 and cancer and have also reassured the public that polio vaccines still routinely given to all babies were safe and free from the virus and other known contaminants. However, a national support group for victims of contaminated medical products yesterday called for a royal commission into CSL. \"The track record of CSL demonstrates the need for a royal commission into all their operations,\" said Charles MacKenzie, president of the Independent Blood Council. CSL research records in the National Archives show that 56 babies under the age of 12 months were used in the Victorian vaccine trials. One baby is recorded as having died of meningitis in August 1960, less than three months after finishing a course of three quadruple antigen injections. The records list the names of the institutions, the names and ages of the babies, the doses of quadruple antigen given and the results of blood tests conducted before and after the vaccinations to measure polio antibodies. There is no indication of who gave formal consent for the babies to be used in the trials, which were carried out by CSL's virus research department. Further development and use of the quadruple antigen, which also provided vaccination against whooping cough, diphtheria and tetanus, appeared to have been abandoned during 1962-63. Salk vaccine was replaced with Sabin oral polio vaccine by 1965. The Age revealed in 1997 that Victorian babies homes and orphanages had been used by several medical and research bodies, including CSL, for trials of a range of experimental vaccines. The reports led to inquiries by the state and federal health departments, which concluded that there was no evidence of any other similar medical trials. Neither report referred to the quadruple antigen trials. The state government report, a copy of which has been obtained under freedom of information by Melbourne researcher Brenda Coughlan, found no record of the Department of Human Services providing formal consent for state wards to be used in trials. The Age's revelations were examined by the Senate's inquiry into mistreatment of state wards, which said in its report in August that it was unclear who was legally responsible for allowing the children to be used. It concluded that any long-term health effects on children used in the experiments were unknown. Dr Rachel David, director of public affairs at CSL, which was privatised in 1994, said it would have been a logical decision to trial the new vaccinations in such institutions at that time, when community attitudes were different, because \"lots of kids died of communicable and vaccine preventable disease\". \"It's easy to pass judgement in retrospect, but I'd suggest we can't do that. In that day and age people didn't give consent for any medical procedures really, not in the way we understand informed consent now, where they have to sign a form and it is a very "}
