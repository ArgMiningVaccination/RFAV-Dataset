Are you looking to get started with meditation, but don't know how to begin? Or maybe you've tried meditating before but didn't see any results. In either case, using crystals for meditation can be a great way to get started. In this blog post, we will discuss 5 simple steps that will help you get the most out of your meditation session. We will also talk about the benefits of using crystals for meditation and some of the best crystals to use for beginners. Step One: Choose the Right Space The first step in meditating with crystals is to choose the right space. This could be anywhere from your bedroom to a quiet spot outside. The most important thing is that you find a place where you feel comfortable and can relax. If possible, try to avoid areas that are too noisy or bright. Once you've found the perfect spot, sit down in a comfortable position. You can either sit on the floor or in a chair. If you're sitting on the floor, you can cross your legs or sit in the lotus position. If you're sitting in a chair, make sure your feet are flat on the ground and your back is straight. Step Two: Select Your Crystal Now that you've found the perfect spot to meditate, it's time to select your crystal. There are many different crystals to choose from, so take some time to look through our collection and see which one speaks to you. Crystals such as amethyst and rose quartz are great for beginners. These crystals will help to calm and relax you, making it easier to meditate. Another option of crystals you can consider is those that have a strong connection to the element of water. Crystals such as selenite and blue lace agate are excellent for meditation and can help you to connect with your intuition. Once you've selected your crystal, don't forget to cleanse it. This is an important step as it will help to remove any negative energy that the crystal may have picked up. There are many different ways to cleanse your crystals, but we recommend using either sage or palo santo. After cleansing your crystal, you should charge it under the sun or moonlight. Once you are ready to use it, hold it in your hands and close your eyes. Visualize the crystal glowing with light and energy. Allow this light to fill your body and mind with positive energy. Step Three: Set Your Intentions Before you begin meditating, it's important to set your intentions. This means that you should focus on what you want to achieve during your session. Some common intentions include relaxation, peace, calmness, and healing. You can also set personal intentions such as connecting with your intuition or manifesting a specific goal. The most important thing is to be clear and concise about what you want to achieve. Once you've set your intention, take a few deep breaths and allow yourself to relax. Step Four: Start Meditating Now it's time to start meditating. Begin by focusing on your breath. Breathe in through your nose and out through your mouth. As you breathe, visualize the air moving through your body and filling you with positive energy. Continue to focus on your breath for a few minutes, and then begin to focus on your intention. Allow the crystal you've chosen to help you connect with your goal. Visualize the crystal glowing with light and energy as it helps you achieve your desired outcome. Continue to focus on your breath and let all other thoughts fade away. If you find your mind wandering, simply bring your attention back to your breath. Step Five: End Your Meditation When you're ready to end your meditation, slowly open your eyes and take a few deep breaths. Take a moment to sit in silence and reflect on your experience. Then, give thanks to your crystal for its help and guidance. Place it back in its original spot, or you can carry it with you throughout the day. Remember to cleanse and charge your crystal regularly. Meditating with crystals is a great way to relax and connect with your intuition. By following these simple steps, you'll be on your way to achieving your goals, manifesting your desires and getting the most out of your meditation session.
