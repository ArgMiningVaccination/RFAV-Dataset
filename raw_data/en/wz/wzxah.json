Foreword This report is the product of a conference convened by staff of the Office for Sub\u00ad stance Abuse Prevention (OSAP) to explore more practical ways of addressing in a cul\u00ad turally relevant manner, the needs of Black youth at high risk. In calling the conference, OSAP is attempting to determine what is clinically relevant for the African-American population and to examine both psychoso\u00ad cial and biological factors. The conference participants discussed and debated the cul\u00ad tural issues over 2 days. The conference deliberations were guided by the critical issue of how to translate pragmatically the theoretical discussions of culture into programmatic activities. In doing so, several key questions must be answG\u00b7ed. For ex\u00ad ample, what is the role of culture in alcohol and other drug (AOD) use and/or abuse? Are there contemporary values in the African-American community that resist and/ or promote AOD abuse? What are the cultural precepts, values, and norms that have endured and promote positive psychosocial development and thus serve as \"natural resistances\" to AOD use or abuse? What is Afrocentricity? How do we make this concept operational? These are difficult questions because the answers re\u00ad quire us to think culturally and to look at realitv from a different theoretical and philosophical perspective. In this process of reconceptualizing prevention services for African-American people, it is important to note that African\u00ad American service providers, as members of a cultural tradition, have daily provided practical answers to these theoretical ques\u00ad tions. This has not, however, been ac\u00ad complished in a systematic manner. It is clear that there are some important natural support systems in the African-American community that are successful in prevent\u00ad ing AOD abuse. It is not clear which programmatic strategies implied by these natural support systems are most effective for African-American youth, family, and community, and why. As we attempt to respond to the AOD abuse issues confronting African-American communities, we have to address the etiol\u00ad ogy of drug abuse. Is there a process for identifying indicators of high risk from an African-American perspective? What are these indicators? What are the environmen\u00ad tal influences and/or political factors that enhance prevention or make alcohol and other drugs readily available? What struc\u00ad tures (internal or external to the family or community) place African-American youth at high risk? Are there family structures that are more resistant to AOD abuse? Are there socioeconomic conditions that con\u00ad tribute to AOD abuse in the African\u00ad American community? At the end of 2 days of continual discus\u00ad sion, dialog, and debate, the conference par\u00ad ticipants felt that it was necessary to continue the work and develop a written report reflecting the issues raised and help\u00ad ing to point OSAP in the proper direction for service delivery. This document repre\u00ad sents the refinement and culmination of this effort to address systematically this issue of culture in service delivery. Rose C.

Goddard Alcohol and other drug (AOD) abuse has emerged as the leading social, economic, Plld health problem facing the African-American community. In addition to contributing to the excess deaths in the Black community from cancer, strokes, hy\u00ad pertension, cirrhosis of the liver, and heart diseases, AOD abuse is a major factor in the increase in crime, family violence, the grow\u00ad ing rate of violent deaths among Blacks, and the depletion of the future resources of the African-American community. Alcohol and other drug abuse, furthermore, leads to an erosion of life chances, an erosion of family life, and the erosion of the cultural tradi\u00ad tions and sense of community life for Blacy-s. It is a multifaceted problem that af\u00ad fects the Black community at many different levels and for which there is no simple solution. Over the past 15 years the African\u00ad American community has witnessed several attempts to provide AOD abuse prevention services, which have generally failed to solve the issue. Over this time, a group of scholars and practitioners (Nobles 1984; King 1985; Akbar 1985; Asante 1988) has ar\u00ad gued that service delivery to African Americans is doomed to failure when it does not recognize or build on the cultural integrity of the African-American com\u00ad munity. The inability of previous programs to significantly prevent AOD abuse has brought to the forefront the issue of cultural consistency as the key ingredient in provid\u00ad ing services to culturally diverse com\u00ad munities. However, even with the call for culturally consistent program development and implementation, there remains the ques\u00ad tion of pragmatically translating the theoretical discussions of culture into programmatic activities. The Office for Substance Abuse Preven\u00ad tion (OSAP), as the central governmental agency in the field of AOD problem preven\u00ad tion, provides critical leadership in the at\u00ad tempt to make service delivery to African-American youth at high risk consis\u00ad tent with traditional African-American cul\u00ad ture. As part of this creative process, OSAP has convened two major technical discus\u00ad sions to explore the general applicability of African and African-American cultural traditions to the alcohol and other drug abuse prevention field. One group, the Morehouse Meeting of Afrocentric Scholars, consisting primarily of scholars and theoreticians, met in Atlanta to discuss the general issues of African cultural traditions and AOD use and abuse. A second group, an African-American work group, made up of scholars, service providers, and preven\u00ad tion practitioners, convened in Washington, D.C., to grapple with some of the critical questions raised in translating theory into practice. This report attempts to continue these discussions and provide a starting point for the development of authentic prevention strategies for use in African-American com\u00ad munities, many of which constitute high\u00ad risk environments for African-A.\"llerican youth. It is not designed as a \"how to\" manual. Nor does it mandate the specific detail of programmatic activities. It should serve as a working model that highlights the key components of AOD abuse preven\u00ad tion that is consistent with traditional African-American culture. It recognizes that the specific aspects of any program must be grounded in the different concrete condi\u00ad tions surrounding the target population, which shares a common philosophical and cultural foundation. 1 An African-Centered Model of Prevention for African-American Youth at High Risk The report is organized into three sec\u00ad tions. Section I presents an overview of the AOD use/ abuse problem. The scope of the problem is presented in chapter 1, which provides the background information on AOD use/ abuse in the Black community. Lawford L. Goddard presents some of the current statistics that attest to the severity of the problem and explores the general en\u00ad vironmental context of AOD use/abuse. Is\u00ad sues relating to environmental stress, the influence of the media, popular culture, and advertising campaigns fu'1d promotions are also examLr\\ed. Dr. Goddard indicates that these are the primary external environmen\u00ad tal factors that affect the AfTican-American community. In chapter 2, Dr. Goddard addresses the features in the family system that could be considered precursors to AOD use/abuse. He suggests that the Black community is systematically exposed to conditions of un\u00ad derdevelopment that make it difficult for the family to perform its basic functions of preparing children for participation in the wider society. He further indicates that the Black family is experiencing a process of cul\u00ad tural disalignrnent wherein the rules that govern its behavior are inconsistent with traditional African-American values and cul\u00ad tural foundations. The evidence of this dis\u00ad alignment is the incidence of AOD use/abuse. In chapter 3, Ornowale Amuleru\u00ad Marshall explores the economic and politi\u00ad cal implications of drugs in the African\u00ad American community. He suggests that the presence of alcohol and other drugs in the Black community represents part of the process of sociostructural violence that the Black population faces in this country. For him, AOD use/abuse is a manifestation of intrapersonal, interpersonal, and institutional violence, all consequences of sociostructural violence that arise in an unjust society. In chapter 4, Patricia A. Newton discus\u00ad ses the issues of biological vulnerability and their relationship to AOD abuse. Alcohol and other drug abuse is highly complicated. Dr. Newton explores the way in which ordi- 2 nary behaviors that are associated with dietary practices could serve as the precur\u00ad sor to addictive behavior. She examines the issue of melanin as it relates to African Americans and discusses the way in which the biochemical structure of African Americans could potentially make them mOTe vulnerable to AOD dependence. As a resource for section I, chapter 5 provides a review of the general literature dealing with AOD abuse issues. The list of abstracts of the literature dealing with sub\u00ad stance use/abuse in the African-American community highlights the lack of a COllSis\u00ad tent theoretical or methodological approach to these issues. Section II presents current applications and future directions for prevention ser\u00ad vices. The section's major thrust is the high\u00ad lighting of current approaches to AOD use/abuse prevention in an attempt to ex\u00ad tract those features that are achieving some form of success. In chapter 6, Milton Morris explores the theoretical issues surrounding the concep\u00ad tualization of the prevention issue in the African-American community and under\u00ad lines the complexity of the issue. Prevention is not a simple act. He suggests that the way we define the nature and meaning of prevention has implications for determining the type of activities that we engage in, who the key actors are, what their roles are, and what outcomes are sought. Thus, much ef\u00ad fort is needed beforehand in providing a conceptual framework for the issue of prevention, and Mr. Morris points out the problematic nature of prevention activities within the African-American community. In chapter 7, Dr. Goddard continues the discussion of issues concerning the concep\u00ad tualization of AOD abuse prevention and deals with the features in the African\u00ad American family that serve as natural resis\u00ad tors to AOD abuse. Dr. Goddard suggests that the traditional Black family system is based on the affirmation of life and promotes the growth and development of the child. The family performs several critical functions that serve to stabilize and place the child in a particular social context that facilitates effective social functioning, and these functions minimize the pressures to engage in self-destructive behavior. In chapter 8, Janet Pinkett addresses the critical role of spirituality in African\u00ad American society and suggests that a deep spiritual conviction was the essence of the Black family's social reality. Spirituality es\u00ad tablished a sense of a higher purpose in life and placed everyday suffering and pain within a broader context of one/s beingness. The spiritual element in the Black family enabled its members to transcend and trans\u00ad form their experiential conditions so that they were able to function effectively in a society that denied them the full benefits of membership. Ms. Pinkett concludes this chapter with suggestions of ways to incor\u00ad porate the spiritual dimension into a preven\u00ad tionmodel. In chapter 9, Leonard C. Long docu\u00ad ments the weaknesses and errors of tradi\u00ad tional approaches used in the delivery of services to African Americans. Essentially, Mr. Long suggests that these models are in\u00ad adequate and that prevention and/or inter\u00ad vention strategies based on these models would be inadequate for Black pcpulations. He concludes by presenting the charac\u00ad teristics of a program in Dallas that is based on the application of an Afrocentric value system. In chapter 10, Robert J. Courtney, Jr. provides empirical data about features of successful programs. In his summary, Dr. Courtney lays out some of the main lessons that the field of prevention has learned, which are based on an assessment of prevention demonstration projects OSAP has funded in the past. In chapter 11, Dr. Goddard presents results from site visits to three current prevention programs. The programs are in different regions of the country, and all have achieved some success. In their own way, these programs reflect the variety of is\u00ad sues confronting the African-American com-Introduction munity. The programs represent new and promising, but largely untested, prevention designs and strategies. These programs' benefits suggest the nature of what could constitute potentially \"successful\" program\u00ad ming. Section III comprises a discussion of the components of an Afrocentric model of AOD abuse prevention. In chapter 12, Wade W. Nobles and Dr. Goddard discuss the nature and charac\u00ad teristics of an Afrocentric model of preven\u00ad tion. This prevention model provides the framework for the development of programs whose activities are infused with the culture of African Americans. The philosophical foundation of the program, the teaching techniques, and the specific ac\u00ad tivities are all consistent with the traditional culture. The prevention model examined in this chapter represents one step in the long history of African-American scholars and practitioners responding to the need to develop services. It is an attempt to present formally and systematically the strategies and processes that draw from and build upon the collective wisdom of African and African-American people. It is not the final or definitive word on the issue; rather, it represents the current stage of transition in the developmen t of the African-American population. It should serve as a stimulus for the creative development of other sys\u00ad tematic approaches to address the variety of forces affecting the community. Chapter 13 provides a selected Afrocentric reading list developed by scholars a11d practitioners of the Institute for the Advanced Study of Black Family Life and Culture. These readings represent some of the salient theoretical and empirical works by scholars who have adopted the Afrocentric paradigm for the study of the African-American experience. The list is im\u00ad portant in providing a framework and sug\u00ad gestions for the establishment of study groups to discuss and analyze the written materials. It is suggested that in the process of engaging in study groups families can be reunited, the community can be revitalized, 3 --------------------------- An Afrlcan-Centared Model of Prevention for African-American Youth at High Risk and the process may help stimulate the natural immunities to AOD abuse. It should be obvious that no one docu\u00ad ment can completely cover the variety of is\u00ad sues concerning AOD abuse prevention; several critical issues lie outside the scope of this report. For example, the question of the effects of public policy on the AOD abuse spectrum is extremely complex and broad in scope. However, it is important to men\u00ad tion briefly two issues that appear to be most critical in this discussion. On one hand, public policy has a diffusion effect that produces conditions that place in\u00ad dividuals at risk of substance-abusing be\u00ad havior (Nobles and Goddard 1989). On the other hand, public policy creates environ\u00ad ments that, in many instances, retard References Akbar, N. The Community of Self. Tallahassee, Fla.: Mind Production and Associates, 1985.

That is, people become reluctant to seek help out of fear that par\u00ad ticipation might make them vulnerable to loss of social benefits like subsidized hous\u00ad ing, public assistance, and health care. Mentioning these two issues hardly scratches the surface of issues in a considera\u00ad tion of public policy's impact on AOD abuse. However, it does raise, and leaves open for discussion, the importance of public policy issues in discussing AOD abuse. It is hoped that this report will allow a reexamination of AOD abuse prevention from a new and different perspective that may lead to an analysis of previously neglected areas of social inquiry.

Goddard The problem of drugs is a longstanding problem that has been approached from different angles-educational, legal, and health, to name a few. Across the Nation, city after city and community after com\u00ad munity are reporting the ever-increasing involvement of people with drugs, par\u00ad ticularly young people. Alcohol and other drug (AOD) abuse has reached epidemic proportions in America. In 1985,17.7 million Americans aged 18 years and older were su\u00a3f~ring from the negative effects of alcohol abuse. In the same year, 4.6 million adolescents aged 12 to 17 years experienced such negative consequences of alcohol use as poor school performance, trouble with parents, or in\u00ad volvement with law enforcement. Lifetime prevalence data from the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) 1988 Drug Abuse Study indicate that there were some 9 mil\u00ad lion youth 12 to 17 years old who had used alcohol; 2.5 million lifetime marijuana users; 3.4 million lifetime illicit drug users, and some 590,000 lifetime cocaine users. For everyone person identified in drug-related activity there are three to five persons direct\u00ad ly connected to that individual (Nobles et al. 1987), so the extent of the AOD abuse prob\u00ad lem reaches far beyond the actual numbers, staggering as they may be. 11 An African-Centered Model of Prevention for African-American Youth at High Risk Epidemiology of Drugs This overview focuses on two types of drugs commonly found in the African\u00ad American community, licit (alcohol, prescription drugs, tobacco) and illicit drugs (marijuana, heroin, cocaine). For the purpose of this discussion, given the man\u00ad date of the Office for Substance Abuse Prevention (OSAP), the focus is on one licit drug, alcohol, and on the three illicit drugs. Licit Drugs: Aicohol Alcohol use and abuse are so common in the Black community that excessive drink\u00ad ing by adults appears to have become ac\u00ad ceptable behavior with little or no stigma attached to it. The research literature indi\u00ad cates that Black people tend to be group drinkers, drinking in a social context with friends and relatives. Black people also tend to drink more frequently and heavily during the weekend. Street drinking is a so\u00ad cial custom amor:z many young Black people-drinking on the street corner, out\u00ad side liquor stores, in :;.utomobiles, and in front of homes and stores. However, as a group, Black people have higher numbers of both abstainers and heavy drinkers than Whites. Data from the NIDA 1988 Household Survey indicate that among adolescents (12-to 17-year-old age group), 37 percent of African Americans, compared with 54 percent of Whites, reported having ever used alcohol. In general, Black people are status-conscious drinkers, paying more attention to brands of liquor and their prices (although Blacks make up only 11 percent of the national population, they purchase 30 percent of all the scotch whisky sold). Blacks are less likely to view alcoholism as an illness and are slow in confronting exces\u00ad sive drinking as a social problem requiring professional help. Consequently, the in\u00ad volvement of Blacks in the treatment process occurs very late in the onset of al\u00ad coholism and is often by order of someone in the legal system. In a recent report prepared by the Fanon Research and Development Center of 12 the Charles Drew University of Medicine and Sciences, it was indicated that ap\u00ad proximately 16 percent of the Black popula\u00ad tion is alcoholic. Alcohol use has increased over 86 percent since 1979, with 65 percent of Black youths engaging in regular use weekly, the first drinks being taken between the ages of 8 and 10 and girls experimenting almost as often as boys. The health effects of alcohol use are devastating. Alcoholism is a secondary diag\u00ad nosis in 65 percent of hospital heds; it is im\u00ad plicated in 61 percent of job absenteeism, 84 percent of traffic deaths, 70 percent of suicides, 80 percent of homicides, 90 percent of stabbings, 70 percent of all violent crimes, and 60 percent of automobile accidents. The long-term deleterious effects of al\u00ad cohol on the African-American population are revealed in the differential mortality rate from cirrhosis of the liver, a degeneration of the liver caused by prolonged abuse of al\u00ad cohol. The incidence of cirrhosis for urban Black males under 35 years of age is 12 times higher than that of any other com\u00ad parable group. In 1987, the overall death rate for cirrhosis for Black males was 22 per 100,000, almost double the rate for White males at 12 per 100,000. The Black female death rate for cirrhosis of the liver was 9 per 100,000 compared with 5 per 100,000 for White females (NCHS 1990). In attempting to understand the etiol\u00ad ogy of alcohol use among adolescents, Har\u00ad ford (1985) indicated that Black abstainers reported higher proportions of SchOOL peers to be nondrinkers. Additionally, he indi\u00ad cated that Black abstainers, when compared non-Black abstainers, viewed the per\u00ad sonal effects of drinking-the use of alcohol as a coping mechanism to deal with per\u00ad sonal problems and stress-as the moet lm\u00ad portant reason for not drinking. The implication of these findings is that Blacks who have positive peer influences and who appear to be confident in their own ability to deal with life and competent in solving problems are less likely to use alcohol. Background and Scope of the Alcohol and Other Drug Problem Illicit Drugs According to official data, the overall in\u00ad cidence of illicit drug use in the Black population is about the same as that for Whites. Data from the 1985 NIDA National Household Survey on Drug Abuse showed that about 32 percent of each group had used drugs illegally at some time in their lives. Lifetime use of alcohol is lower for Blacks than Whites (75 percent versus 89 percent), about the same for marijuana (33 percent versus 34 percent) and higher for heroin (1.4 percent versus 1 percent). In tenns of current use the pattern remained substantially the same, with 13 percent of Blacks and 12 percent of Whites reporting having used illicit drugs in the previous month. Current use data indicate that a higher proportion of Blacks than Whites had used marijuana (7'.2 percent versus 4.5 percent) and roughly the same proportion had used cocaine (1.8 percent versus 0.7 per\u00ad cent) in the previous month. Among youth, the surveys indicate that Black youth (12 to 17 years old) have slight\u00ad ly higher levels of drug use. In 1991, 7.1 per\u00ad cent of African Americans in the group aged 12 to 17 reported having used some type of illicit drugs in the previous month versus 6.7 percent for White youth. African\u00ad American youth have higher lifetime rates for marijuana (13.7 percent versus 13.2 per\u00ad cent in a lifetime) and higher rates for cocaine (1.7 percent and 2.4 percent in a lifetime) than White youth. These data, while they point to the mag\u00ad nitude of the problem, should be taken with some caution. Primm (1987) has indicated that there is no sound body of information on the AOD abuse problem in the African\u00ad American community because both the NIDA National Household Survey on Drug Abuse (1991a) and the NIDA Drug Abuse Among American High School Seniors, Col\u00ad lege Students, and Young Adults (1991b) survey are unlikely to include in their samples the poorer segments of society or the school dropouts among whom AOD abuse is generally much higher. In addition, these surveys are based on samples in which Blacks are underrepresented. Conse\u00ad quently, the data might represent a sig\u00ad nificant undercount of the incidence of AOD abuse in the Black community. However, there can be little doubt that drug use and abuse have reached epidemic proportions in the Black community. The in\u00ad cidence of marijuana and heroin use ap\u00ad pears to have stabilized, but cocaine use has skyrocketed in the past 10 years. Data from the NIDA 1988 National Household Survey indicate this pattern of increased use of cocaine in the African-American popula\u00ad tion. In terms of lifetime use among the 12- to 17-year-old age group, 1.7 percent of African-American youth, as compared with 2.4 percent of White youth, had used cocaine/ crack cocaine; in 1987, the rates were 1.5 percen t for African Americans and 1.5 percent for White youth. However, among the young adults in the 18-to 25- year-old age group, although lifetime and recent rates are lower for African Americans than Whites, previous-month use rates are higher for African Americans than Whites (3.1 percent versus 1.7 percent). The lower rate of drug use among African\u00ad American youth is also revealed in the data from the NIDA High School Senior Survey, which was completed by the University of Michigan. During the period 1985-1989,40 percent of White male students reported using marijuana and hashish compared with 30 percent for Black male students. The emergence of crack cocaine has brought the more expensive and damaging cocaine into the reach of the poorer sectors of the community. Crack cocaine is potent, easy to hide, easy to use, deadly, and cheap. In California it can be bought for as little as $5; in New York $1 crack cocaine is avail\u00ad able. The main danger with crack cocaine is its potency: one \"hit\" appears to be never enough to satisfy the feelings of euphoria experienced. Crack cocaine users have said that the high obtained from it is so intense that th~re is no desire to come down. Con\u00ad versely, the low is so low that they never waItt to experience that feeling. Conse- 13 An African-Centered Model of Prevention for African-American Youth at High R!sk qentIy, most crack users lose self-control as they want to experience the euphoria over and over. They steal,lie, cheat, and sell their bodies, their belongings, and their oroperty, all in quest of another hit from the r>ipe. Crime, violence, and prostitution have be\u00ad come bypro ducts of the crack cocaine epidemic sweeping the Black community. The real danger of this drug is that it is affecting the very young members of the Black community. These young people often have limited knowledge and refusal skills and hence are unable to make ap\u00ad propriate decisions about participation. With its low prices and ease of use and storage, more and more young people are witnessing drug use at a yowlger age and are likely to be caught in its web of entrap\u00ad ment. Available data indicate that the recent upsurge in AOD abuse has been con\u00ad centrated among the younger population, and available medical data indicate that the progression of crack cocaine addiction comes much faster than with alcoholics or abusers of other types of drugs. The context of drug use in the Black community is especially problematic in that most children learn about drugs from, and are offered drugs the first time, by their friends. Most children know someone who uses drugs and have actually seen someone doing so. The implication of this is that children are exposed at early ages to the presence of drugs and can identify the be\u00ad havioral modalities associated with drug use. Although alcohol and oLL~er drugs have been discussed separately, it is important to point out that the prevailing pattern of AOD abuse in the Black community is one of polydrug abuse. Nobles and his as\u00ad sociates (1987) have found that for the Black community alcohol serves as the gateway drug to more addictive drugs. This may be changing with the introduction of inexpen\u00ad sive crack cocaine, which might now make it the gateway drug. The newness of the crack cocaine epidemic has precluded a sub\u00ad stantial body of knowledge to determine the role of crack cocaine as a gateway drug. 14 Recent data from NIDA's national drug abuse warning network (DAWN) system (NIDA 1990) indicate that nany of the patients presenHng themselves at emergen\u00ad cy rooms in hospitals across the country are polydrug users, the most common pattern being cocaine and alcohol. Effects of AOD Abuse It has become evident that AOD abuse is having a severe impact on the well~being and life chances of the African-American community. The behavioral lifestyle as\u00ad sociated with AOD abuse increases the prob\u00ad ability of early death through several preventable causes. Using the concept of \"excess death,\" Lhe Secretary of Health and Human Services Task Force on Black and Minority Health (1985) reported that 42 per\u00ad cent of all African-AmericdIls who die before age 70 could be considered excess deaths. The concept of excess death \"expres\u00ad ses the difference between the number of deaths actually observed in a minority group and the number of deaths that would have occurred in that group if it experienced the same death rates for each age and sex as the White population.\" In addition, the data indicate that six causes of death-cancer, cardiovascular disease and stroke, homicide and accidents, chemi\u00ad cal dependence, diabetes, and infant mor\u00ad tality-account for 80 percent of the mortality observed among African Americans. Alcohol and other drugs are risk factors associated with all of these causes of death, except diabetes. Apart from the health consequences of AOD use, the African-American community is more likely to be victimized as a result of the drug culture and drug-related activities. Results from the 1986 Survey of Inmates of State Correctional Facilities (Innes 1988) in\u00ad dicate that inmates report high levels of drug use prior to the commission of the crime for which tIley were incarcerated. For example, of the African-American inmates only 21 percent had never used any type of illicit drug. Six out of every 10 African\u00ad American inmates (62 percent) had used drugs regularly in the past; 1 out of 2 (51 _______________ B_a_c_kg::;..r_ou_n_d, ~:md ~ope of the Alcohol and Other Drug Problem percent) had used drugs in the month before the offense, and 4 out of 10 (41 per\u00ad cent) had used drugs on a daily basis before the offense. Roughly half (48 percent) had used the major drugs--cocaine, heroin, PCP, LSD, and methadone-before the of\u00ad fense. Data from the study also indicate that drug use usually begins in the middle-to\u00ad late teenage years. The median age for first drug use was 15 years with regular use at 16. For the major drugs, the median age for first use was 16 years and regular use at 17. As for contact with the juvenile justice sys\u00ad tem, the data indicate that the median age for first arrest (17 years), first probation (16 years), and first incarceration (19 years) tended to come later than the onset of first use of drugs. The relationship between drugs and crime is critical because the African\u00ad American community has suffered from higher rates of violent and household crime victimization than other ethnic com\u00ad munities. In addition, violent crimes com\u00ad mitted against African Americans tend to be more serious than those committed against Whites; offenders were more likely to have weapons in violent crimes against African Americans and African-American victims were more likely to be injured and sustain serious injuries. Data from the DAWN system reveal the extent of the health, emotional, and social consequences of AOD abuse in the African\u00ad American community. Among the African Americans who present themselves at emer\u00ad gency rooms wiUl an AOD-related problem, there are distinct patterns of emotional problems. Males are more likely to show chronic effects (13.8 percent) and unex\u00ad pected drug reactions (14.0 percent) as the reasons for their contact with the emergen\u00ad cy room, while females are more likely to in\u00ad dicate overdosing (72.6 percent). This pattern also reveals itself among the young: for the Whi te males in the 6-to 17 -year-old age group, the primary reason is overdose and unexpected reaction (79.1 percent and 9.5 percent,respectively), while among the White females, it is primarily from overdos-ing (90.0 percent). Among the older adoles\u00ad cents (18-to 19-year-old age group), the pat\u00ad tern was essentially the same. Similarly, the reasons for the use of drugs reveal differen\u00ad tial gender patterns. Among the males in the 6-to 17-year-old age group/53.S percent use drugs for suicide and 29.4 percent for psychic effects. Among the White females, the vast majority (66.9 percent) use drugs for suicide. In the male 18-to 19-year-old group, psychic effect was the primary reason for drug use (24.2 percent) while suicide remained the primary reason in the female group (76.0 percent). Without a doubt, the primary effect of AOD abuse in the Black community is one of death, devastation, and destruction as lives are lost, careers are destroyed, families are torn apart, and future resources are depleted. Environmental Context of AOD Use in the African\u00ad American Community The question of AOD abuse in the Black community has been linked to three general processes. The primary processes that have an impact on the Black population include economic exploitation, White supremacy (racism) I political dommation, and psychosocial stress. As a result of these con\u00ad ditions, the psychiatrist Chester Pierce (1974) has indicated that life in the urban area is often characterized by an \"extreme mundane stressful\" environment. By \"ex\u00ad treme mundane\" stress Pierce refers to stress that results when actors perceive no rewards or relief from their constantly wor\u00ad risome quest to survive on a day-to-day basis. Living in the urban environment is ex\u00ad tremely stressful for the Black population in general and particularly for tl1e adolescent. The extreme environment of tile ghetto is loaded with \"offensive put-downs,\" which Pierce classifies as social trace contammants that promote acceptance of (1) a devalued state and (2) hopelessness. In this condition, people require accessible escape mech\u00ad anisms in order to contmue to function at a 15 An African-Centered Model of Prevention for African-American Youth at High Risk ------~----------------------- level of minimum survivability. In an earlier work, Pierce (1970) noted that the Black population, and particularly adolescents, are constantly bombarded by \"rnicroaggres\u00ad sions,\"l small-scale offenses on the psyche of the person, by which they are hindered in their attempts to realize basic functional im\u00ad peratives required for normal adjustment in society. This repeated bombardment produces a cumulative impact, structural in nature and long-term in its duration, on the personality of the urban ghetto dweller. This constant assault, he contends, produces a condition of \"status dislocation,\" in which the individual cannot effectively function and seeks escape mechanisms (i.e., AOD abuse) to enable survival. Pierce notes in this regard that the twin interactional and mutually reinforcing effects of racism and stress condition those so victimized to opt for addictive escapism. Similarly, Akbar (1985) has indicated that the impact of living in an oppressive, racist environment produces a condition hl characterizes as \"self-destructive disorder.\" The victims of self-destructive disorder respond to condi\u00ad tions of oppression by attempting to destroy their involvement with reality through prac\u00ad tices of personal and / or social destruction. The impact of White supremacy has been exacerbated by changes in the basis of American economic life. The restructuring of the economy has, in fact, affected the Black population to such an extent that it has created a permanent underclass. The benefits of the Civil Rights struggle have been severely eroded by the massive retrenchments and cutbacks in the basic in\u00ad dustries of automobiles, steel, and rubber, in which Blacks had made significant in\u00ad roads in the 1970s. These effects are manifest in the high levels of unemploy\u00ad ment and underemployment among the Black population, the increase in the num\u00ad ber of people living in poverty, and the general sense of despair and hopelessness experienced by many Blac!< youth, demonstrated by the increase in suicides (Davis 1981; Griffith and Bell 1989). The underclass has been swollen not only by an ever greater number of Black males who are experiencing extensive periods of unemployment, but also by those who have dropped out of the labor market completely. Lacking appropriate marketable skills, without information about oppor\u00ad tunities in the labor market, and symbolical\u00ad ly separated from the wider society, the members of the underclass survive at a mini\u00ad mal level. In this context, they find it rela\u00ad tively easy to opt for those \"escape mechanisms\" that Pierce has noted. Participation in drug-related activity represents an attractive alternative to pover\u00ad ty and despair. It offers escape to users and quick profits to dealers. For others of the un\u00ad derclass, participation in a drug-related life\u00ad style becomes part of the normal routine of living. The small area around their horne represents the extent of their social world. The second process is the general availability of alcohol and drugs in the Black community. The research literature clearly indica tes tl1a t in the Black com\u00ad munity liquor stores are the most commor. form of small business. The corner liquor store flourishes in the urban central city and is the prime source of availability of al\u00ad coholic beverages for Black youths. The spa\u00ad tial geography of these communities reveals an excessive number of retail liquor outlets: along the major street that runs through any large urban black community an alcohol retail outlet is found on almost every other block. The presence of these stores, in addi\u00ad tion to the visible advertisements, would seem to reinforce the pressures to engage in drinking. TIle following are examples of micro aggression: A cashier requires three pieces of identification from a Black person to cash a check but only one from a White person. A clerk follows a Black person around a department store in the belief that the Black person intends to rob the store. A restaurant staffer seats a Black person at an inferior table or serves the Black person after later arrivals. 16 Background and Scope of the Alcohol and Other Drug Problem Illicit drugs are now commonplace within the urban environment, with drug sales taking place on almost every comer and at all times of the day. The salesmen, guards, and lookouts in this process are generally impoverished, angry adolescents who are willing to take up arms and lay down their lives for a piece of the lucrative crack cocaine market. Lacking any remorse or sense of moral obligation, too many of these you ths carryon their business with utter disdain for legal authorities and en\u00ad gage in open warfare for control of the trade. Drug trafficking has become a highly rewarding economic activity for poor inner-city youths, providing them with the trappings of material wealth. The third general process is the impact of the media. Our society is media-oriented, and there is no doubt that the media have helped to project the image that the way to solve a problem or to feel good is to take something-a pill or a drink. In addition, popular television programs like \"Miami Vice,\" although antidrug in format, show us the luxuries of the drug scene-the wealth, the fancy homes, the lavish parties, the posh cars, and the other symbols of prosperity; but do not show us the squalor, the suffer\u00ad ing, and the harsh economic realities of the drug user. With alcohol advertising, the general image the media project is that alcohol is as\u00ad sociated with success, wealth, and having fun. In addition, the urban community is in\u00ad undated with billboards proclaiming the message that drinking is fashionable and of\u00ad fering high-priced alcohol as the standard against which to measure one's worth. These ads all advocate the purchase of dark\u00ad colored, hea vy-bodied distilled alcohol, which has a much higher ethanol content than light-colored distilled alcohol. Further, the use of athletic heroes as marketing repre\u00ad sentatives in commercials for alcohol strong\u00ad ly affects the susceptibilities of the Black adolescent male in particular. When his favorite hero appears in a commercial or on a billboard drinking a particular brand of beer, wine cooler, or hard liquor, the impres\u00ad sionable adolescent is likely to emulate the behavior of the hero as role model and to engage in that behavior. Vast amounts of money are also spent on alcohol advertise\u00ad ments each year in magazines like Ebony, Jet, and Essence, which are aimed at the Black community.2 In addition to the visible signs such as alcoholic beverages advertising, popular cul\u00ad ture, in the form of the music of the younger generation, promotes and fosters an AOD\u00ad use environment. Many of the popular songs endorse reckless, risk-taking be\u00ad havior, often leading to a subtle erosion of the cultural substance of the community, its morals and values. The rap singer, in many instances, assumes the role of \"renegade\" and is perceived as someone able to over\u00ad come the limitations and restrictions of the society and gain a \"piece of the pie.\" This image of success and the means of acquir\u00ad ing that success stretch the boundaries of ac\u00ad ceptability and accountability, suggesting the breakdown of the moral code. While the general AOD abuse literature for the most part emphasizes that the poor Black family is at risk, it is important to point out that all Black families are at risk for AOD abuse. While class differences reflect important socioeconomic realities, the institutional processes that produce the \"micro aggressions\" and the small-scale as\u00ad saults on the psyche of the African American do not acknowledge or recognize class or status. Indeed, the microaggressions are potentially more devastating at the higher socioeconomic level because success\u00ad ful Blacks are more likely to recognize the affronts and be taken aback by them since they do not expect them. In fact, success might disarm the successful Black of the psychological coping skills that act as a 2 See Hacker, G.; Collins, R; and Jacobson, M. Milrketing Booze to Blacks.

Goddard In discussing the processes of the African\u00ad American family that make it mor~ sus\u00ad ceptible to alcohol and other drug (AOD) abuse, it is suggested that cultural disalign\u00ad ment-a process whereby the family's ethosic order or set of guiding principles is inconsistent with the traditional African\u00ad American cultural substance-is the primary precursor of AOD-abusing behavior. From the perspectives and testimony of former participants in the drug lifestyle and consultants, experts, and observers of illicit drug-related activity, it is clear that there has emerged a \"drug culture\" that,like all cultures, has a general design for living and particular rules that govern, and define as normal particular standards of conduct. In contrast to African-American culture, the general design for living in the drug culture is (1) trust no one and (2) anything is pos\u00ad sible. The subsequent rules by which one lives and the value system guiding one's be\u00ad havior in the drug lifestyle emphasize such traits as selfishness, individualism, violence, hostility, and impulsiveness. In essence, the drug culture emphasizes immediate gratification, hedonistic pleasure, and lack of concern for others. The behavioral patterns (persistent pat\u00ad terns of dishonesty, callousness, and ir\u00ad responsibility without signs of remorse or motivation to change) consistent with the features of the emerging drug culture are reflective of the most devastating psych\u00ad iatric malad y, psychopathy. The drug 19 An African-Centered Model of Prevention for African-American Youth at High Risk culture is, in fact, creating a \"psychopathic\" environment wherein \"effective family functioning\" is determined not by the rules or moral values of one's sociocultural group, but by the dictates of a system of deviance and chaos. As the producer of a psychopathic en\u00ad vironment, the emerging drug culture and the subsequent shift in cultural orientation among African-American families is a most powerful danger that African-American children and families must confront daily. The primary environmental socialization ex\u00ad perience that African-American children face, given the presence of drug-related ac\u00ad tivity in the African-American community, is one of violence, fear, hostility, tension, criminalization, and community disunity. Thus the emergent drug culture has become the dominant environmental influence in the lives of African-American families and children. To the extent that families ex\u00ad perience this cultural disalignment, there is tension and potential conflict within and be\u00ad tween families. As more and more African\u00ad American families and children begin to internalize the laws, rules, and codes of con\u00ad duct of the drug culture, we are beginning to see a permanent, and possibly irre\u00ad versible, change in the nature of African\u00ad American families and children. Cultural disalignment, therefore, poten\u00ad tially serves as a precursor to drug use/abuse (Nobles and Goddard 1989). As people become out of alignment with their own cultural substance, the behavioral modalities they express become inconsistent with that substance and lead to general dys\u00ad function in society. Alcohol and other drug abuse represents the physical manifestation of deep-seated patterns of dysfunctional be\u00ad havior in society. Nobles and his colleagues (1987) have indicated that the features of the drug culture are antithetical to the essence of African-American cultural precepts. That is, the drug culture themes of trust no one3 a..'1d anything is possible produce a value orientation that is inherently individualistic and without any regard for others. The im\u00ad plication of this is that connectedness and bonding with others, which is a central fea\u00ad ture of traditional African-American cul\u00ad ture, have not been developed. Nobles and his associates suggest tha~ the absence of this principle serves as a primary precursor to aberrant social behavior. The impact of the drug culture is such that parents have to compete witll a culture that provides in1mediate gratification and material goods to its participants. The glamor, glitter, and material possessions of the drug dealers serve as a powerful mag\u00ad net, enticing more and more African\u00ad American children into the web of self-destructive behavior. The drug dealer emerges as someone who has been able to create an alternative economic activity that provides the material vestiges of power. In the presence of high levels of unemploy\u00ad ment,limited educational attainment, and the adoption of a materialistic value orienta\u00ad tion, drug dealing and drug-related activity emerge as perceived viable economic alter\u00ad natives for some urban African-American youth. It should be emphasized that African\u00ad American families are confronted by a phenomenon that is simultaneously aber\u00ad rant, addictive, and perceived as economi\u00ad cally viable. On the one hand, in response to economic impoverishment, participation in drug trafficking appears as the only option for family economic viability and hence be\u00ad comes reasonable and acceptable. On the other hand, the very same act of participa\u00ad tion represents behavioral dysfunction and social deviance. The outcome of this para\u00ad dox is that the moral dilemma and personal conflict associated with participation in il\u00ad legal activity that benefits the family becomes a precipitative basis for the expres\u00ad sion of severe feelings of psychological 3 The evidence, however, seems to indicate that the mother-child bond remains unbroken, even when all other ties are severed. 20 stress and / or trauma in African-American youth. Thus, the climate of drugs produces families that are simultaneously victims and representatives of an emerging drug lifestyle. Another hypothesis is that self\u00ad destructiv; behavior results fro~ the inability of the family system to master Its environ\u00ad mental context and to provide the basic processes necessary for its survival. The family is the framework within which children undergo socialization and within which we observe, learn, and acquire the cultural values that both protect, and ex\u00ad pos~ us to the omnipresent negative inferen\u00ad ces 111 our community. Additionally, the family is a subsystem embedded in the con\u00ad text of the cultural milieu of the wider society. The wider society provides the mechanism to validate the family's sense of well-being. The family can be considered a hub of an interlocking network of relation\u00ad ships. Within and around the family revolve the major institutions of society: the educational system, the labor market, the legc:I.system, the human ecosystem, the political system, and the media. These in\u00ad sti~tions function generally to enable the child to make a smooth transition from the world of the home to the world of the wider society .. The probl~ we are witnessing in the AfrIcan-Amencan community is an out\u00ad come ~f the fact that the major institutions of soaety, rather than allowing dynamic growth and development of the African\u00ad American ~ommunity,have become agents of oppressIOn and underdevelopment that prev7~t the African-American family from acq:urmg a sense of human well-being, which would enable African-American children to become fully integrated into society's fabric. This process manifests itself ~ gener~ features like economic exploita\u00ad ~on, racIal uppression, cultural su ppres\u00ad SlOn, and political domination. The problem of the Black population in American society is, clearly, societal. If one looks at the fact that (1) African-American un\u00ad employment remains twice as high as White Familial Precursors to Drug Abuse unemployment; (2) African Americans ex\u00ad perience serious crime more often than their White counterparts; (3) only 51 percent of African-American youth in the United States complete high school and only 29 per\u00ad cent of African-American high school graduates are enrolled in college; (4) 13 per\u00ad cent of all births in the United States are to teenagers and 29 percent of the teen births ~e African Americans; and, (5) the general\u00ad Ized health status of the African-American population is worse than that of the White population (Nobles et al. 1987), then one can see that the problems of the African\u00ad American community are svstemic to the sociocultural reality of America. Each of these social factors is linked to the status and treatment ot African Americans in qeneral, and African-American males in par\u00ad ticular. Although the African-American female has been victimized, the extent of the victimization is not as great as in the treat\u00ad ment of males. For example, the American economy's current transition from an industrial\u00ad manufacturing base to an inforrnation\u00ad producing base is eroding the econOlnic viability of the African-American family. Al\u00ad ready, some of the gains made by African P,unericans in s~ed and semiskilled occupa\u00ad tions (blue:::ollar Jobs) are being lost to the structural changes taking place in the prime manufacturing sector of the economy (e.g., steel, automobile, and rubber industries). In addition, given the high level of teenage un\u00ad en:tI?loyment, ~ significant proportion of the Afncan-American population will !!row into ad~thood without having the exp~ience of gainful employment, a condition that is like\u00ad ly to hin~:r or lim~t the economic viability of new families. Available data (Rones 1984) in\u00ad dicate further that Blacks tend to remain un\u00ad employed longer than Whites and to become discouraged from staying in the labor force at higher rates than Whites, with the conse\u00ad quence that Blacks \"see\" and experience the negative consequences of unemployment far more often and in more different forms than Whites. As the American economy at\u00ad tempts to retool its technology to increase productivity and maintain a competitive 21 An African-Centered Model of Prevention for African-American Youth at High Risk edge in the world market, technological and scientific advances (e.g., robotics,laser, com\u00ad puters) are increasingly being introduced into the workplace. As this process unfolds Black workers, in general, are being increas\u00ad ingly displaced because an information\u00ad producing economy requires a different pool of skilled workers (e.g., computer programmers, analysts, image makers) than that which currently exists. Black workers do not now have these skills, and they are not being trained to acquire them. Educa\u00ad tion statistics indicate that Black high school students are failing at higher rates, are not taking college preparatory classes, and are dropping out at alarming rates (Goddard 1989). A recent study completed by the Rand Corporation indicates that racial segrega\u00ad tion in schools creates unfavorable oppor\u00ad tunities for Black students to learn mathematics and science (Oakes 1990). The hnplication of these data is that Black and other minority students are not being given the opportunity to obtain a basic foundation in mathematics and science that would prepare them for the changing labor market.

Chapter 3 Political and Economic Implications of Alcohol and Other Drugs in the African-American Community Ornowale Arnuleru-Marshall ThiS discussion attempts to respond to the following two questions. Are there political and economic conditions that con\u00ad tribute to alcohol and other drug (AOD) abuse in the African-American community? What culturally appropriate elements should be cultivated to improve the health and viability of life in the African-American community? Several years ago, Frantz Fanon (1969), the late African-Caribbean psychiatrist whose work offers a useful theoretical framework from which to think about these issues,leveled the charge that \"estab\u00ad lishment\" psychologists seek to explain everything by movements of the individual's psyche, deliberately leaving out of account the special political and economic character of the social situation. In his view, lithe events giving rise to the disor\u00ad der are chiefly the bloodthirsty and pitiless atmosphere, the generalization of inhuman practices and the firm impression that people have of being caught up in a vaitable apocalypse\" (Fanon 1968). To think about the etiology of AOD abuse within the experience of people of African descent in America, the focus of the discus\u00ad sion must be on the macroecological con\u00ad text. It would be futile to attempt to understand, explain, or modify either familial or individual phenomena without 23 An AfrIcan-Centered Model of PreventIon for AfrIcan-AmerIcan Youth at HIgh Risk an antecedent analysis of the particular economic and cultural circumstances of the historical situation of African Americans in this society. The etiological position taken here, therefore, is that the psychobehavioral at\u00ad tributes of the individual are primarily reflections of the ecological systems in which he or she is located. As Fanon (1967) put it, \"we can say that every neurosis, every abnormal manifestation, every affec\u00ad tive erethism in an his [or her] ... situation.\" Even as the individual is affected by the family, the family is in turn conditioned by the eth\u00ad nocultural and sociostructural experience of the racial group to which it belongs. What this suggests is that the environment can be subdivided into micro-and macrodimen\u00ad sions, with the psychobehavioral features of individuals and their families representing microecological factors. These microecologi\u00ad cal factors must, however, be subsumed on the macro level, within the ethnocultural ex\u00ad perience and sociostructural placement of the racial group to which the individual belongs. Alcohol or other drug abuse or ad\u00ad diction, in its advanced stages, is understood best as a rather complex biopsychosocial malady. There would seem to be a con\u00ad fluence of etiological factors that are impli\u00ad cated in its onset, some of which are specific to the particular substance. Other factors are more characteristic of the individual, and some inhere more solidly in the environ\u00ad ment. This approach to thinking about the etiology of AOD abuse is consistent with the public health tradition that makes dis\u00ad tinctions among the agent, the host, and the environment. These distinctions, though time-honored and helpful, are not dear and there is some degree of overlap in their boundaries. It is, nonetheless, useful in a consideration of the political and economic contributors to AOD use, abuse, and addic\u00ad tion, to briefly discuss some factors that may be subsumed within each of these categories. When one focuses attention on the agent, which in this case is mind-altering 24 drugs, licit or illicit, the ways in which and the degree to which they are available, inter\u00ad dicted, regulated, and marketed influence the incidence of drug use and addiction. Other factors related to the drug itself that have an impact on the onset of addiction are its addictive potency, as well as the frequen\u00ad cy, duration, and quantity of its use. The point is that these are variables, specific to the drug itself, which, in particular pemmta\u00ad tions, represent relative degrees of risk to the development of drug addiction. Conse\u00ad quently, these are variables that can be tar\u00ad geted in prevention activities. The kind of host variables that are most pertinent are essentially biogenetic in na\u00ad ture. It has been clear for some time that ad .. dictive disease, like heart disease, occurs more commonly in certain families. Since the biogenetic basis of this familial risk has been established (Wallace 1985), the implica\u00ad tion is that different groups (such as races) might also be expected to exhibit differen\u00ad tial risk and to respond differently to mind\u00ad altering substances. Although this area of AOD abuse risk might deserve further in\u00ad vestigation, it will minimally explain the anomalies that are observed in the complica\u00ad tions of AOD abuse among African Americans. Despite the recent resurgence in interest in biogenetic etiological explana\u00ad tions (Talbott 1986; pected that they will explah1 only a comparatively modest contribution to an indi vid ual' s overall risk. The more popularly accepted basis of AOD abuse risk is the environment, on both the micro and macro levels, which requires considerations of the political and economic conditions that affect and define African\u00ad American existence, in general, in this society. The nature of the historical position of Black people in relation to the fundamen\u00ad tal productive and social processes in American society has been characterized as violent. Bulhan (1985) defined this kind of violence as any relationship, process, or con\u00ad dition by which an individual or a group constrains the physical, psychological, and/or social well-being of another individual or --------------------------------------- group. He suggests that there are, in fact, at least four types of violence: sociostructural, institutional, interpersonal, and intraper\u00ad sonal. Sociostructural violence is the most lethal and least discernable form of violence because it causes premature deaths in the largest number of persons while presenting itself as the natural order of things. Oppres\u00ad sion, as a condition and process, rests primarily on sociostructural violence that in turn fosters institutional, interpersonal, and intrapersonal violence. Sociostructural violence pervades the prevailing values, the environment, social relations, and in\u00ad dividual psyches; its most visible indicators are differential rates of mortality, morbidity, and incarceration among different groups in the same society. Alcohol and other drug abuse in aU its many presentations can be understood, at once, as intrapersonal, inter\u00ad personal, and institutional violence-all of which are consequences of the sociostruc\u00ad tural violence of an unjust social order. Employing Bulhan's indices, there can be no doubt that Blacks, and particularly Black men, experience higher rates of mor\u00ad tality, morbidity, and incarceration than Whites in this society. In 1987, for every 100,000 White femal(:s of all ages, 384.1 died as a result of all causes of mortality. This is contrasted to a rate of 586.2 for Black females. White males had a total mortality rate of 668.2, and Black males led these race/sex groups with a total rate of 1,023.2 for every 100,000 Black males of all ages (NCHS 1990). In fact, among the 111eading causes of death in 1987, Black males ex\u00ad perienced the highest rate of mortality for eight of them. For the remaining three causes of death, White males had the highest rates of mortality caused by chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases and suicide while Black females had the highest rate of death from diabetes mellitus (NCHS 1990). This consistent pattern of excessive death targeting African Americans in general and African-American males in particular is hardly a phenomenon that can be simply dismissed as a function of chance. Political and Economic Implications of AODs Regardless of the index one chooses, a similar pattern of excessive vulnerability to morbidity or sickness emerges among Black persons. Whether one uses limitation of ac\u00ad tivity, self-assessment of health, hyperten\u00ad sion, high-risk serum cholesterollevels, obesity, physician contacts, dental visits, or hospitalization, Black people continue to display higher rates of morbidity than any other racial/ethnic group (NCHS 1990). Finally, the picture associated with in\u00ad carceration is a particularly dramatic one in that the differential victimization of Blacks and especially Black males cannot be missed. African Americans have much higher arrest rates, convictions, and im\u00ad prisonment rates than Whites-often for the same criminal offenses. In the Federal sys\u00ad tem, African Americans, merely 12 percent of the national population, contribute 31 percent of incarcerated persons. In State facilities in Alabama, Washington, D.C., Georgia, Louisiana, and Maryland, Black prisoners comprise at least 60 percent of their prison populations. In another 23 States, Blacks comprise between 23 and 59 percent of the prison population. Needless to say, the overwhelming majority of these Black inmates are young males. (Brickhouse 1988). In Georgia, for example, Black males who represent 11 percent of the State's total population are fully 56 percent of the State's prison population (Thompson 1989). These patterned differentials in mor\u00ad tality, morbidity, and incarceration are in\u00ad dicative of an unjust social order, that is, one characterized by political and economic injustice. Their relationship to AOD abuse is not mere! y an indirect one. The major causes of Black avoidable mortality and hospitalization are directly associated with tobacco, alcohol, and other drug use and ad\u00ad diction, while the overwhelming majority of incarcerated individuals in this country have AOD involvement historief. There is consistent evidence that for many African Americans caught up in chemi\u00ad cal dependency (or, more descriptively, chemical slavery) their initial involvement was that of drug-free, \"petit\" retail drug 25 An African-Centered Model of Prevention for African-American Youth at High Risk dealers (Reuter et aI. 1990). Their drug de\u00ad pendence followed their desperate economic efforts. The economic condition of most Afrkan Americans is one of systematic underdevelopment. Poverty is generously shared among the communities of darker hue. 1111986, the median Black family in\u00ad come was 57 percent of the median White family income and 31 percent of Black per\u00ad sons, as opposed to 11 percent of White per\u00ad sons,lived in households whose incomes fell below the poverty level. The poverty of Black children was particularly striking: 44 percent of Black children and 16 percent of White children lived in poor households in 1985. These children under age 18, who made up less than 20 percent of the poor Black population in 1970, were more than 45 percent in 1985. Fully one-third of the Black poor, compared with only one-sixth of the White poor, were children in families headed by a single female. Black married\u00ad couple families had nearly three times the income of Black female-headed families in 1986-a fact worth noting because it is es\u00ad timated that 86 percent of Black children will likely spend some time in a single\u00ad parent household, usually a mother-only family (Jaynes and Williams 1989). There are those who view this as an ex\u00ad cuse rather than a cause, arguing that the poor can still find subsistence employment as an alternative to the drug culture. The fact is that unemployment is a serious source of poverty and of medical indigence in this country, resulting in higher mor\u00ad bidity and mortality rates for African Americans. A large number of unemployed low-income workers get no unemployment insurance benefits and Black unemploy\u00ad ment rates ar~', on average, twice that of White Americans. Among those who have dropped out of the labor force, and among Black teenagers, the picture is quite a bit more dismal. Even when disproportionately employed in low-wage jobs, usually un\u00ad protected by tenure and seniority, the Black working poor are acutely sensitive to the 26 recessions and expansions of business cycles (Jaynes and Williams 1989). The labor experience of Blacks por\u00ad tended early in life as they are systematically underdeveloped in public education. There continue to be large and persistent gaps in the educational quality and achievement out\u00ad comes of Black and White Americans. Black high school dropout rates remain higher than those of Whites while the performance of Black students on achievement tests lags behind that of Whites. Since the mid-1970s, the college-going chances of Black high school graduates have declined, and the proportion of advanced degrees awarded to Blacks has decreased (Jaynes and Williams 1989). Concentrating on educational failure\u00ad a certain ldnd of \"mentacide\"-however, limits our view to only one of the ways in which American education violates African\u00ad American students. The term \"mentacide,\" which was coined by Dr. Bobby Wright (1976), is used here to refer to a process that results in intellectual atrophy secondary to chronic educational failure. Another sig\u00ad nificant violation occurs as Black students are confronted with the forces of miseduca\u00ad tion, which pern1eates the American educa\u00ad tional system. The limited number of African-American students who appear, by traditional educational indices, to succeed are often transformed by the process of rnis\u00ad education into caricatures of the European providers of their \"education.\" Ironically, their miseducation tends to be a direct result of their success in these educational institu\u00ad tions. This \"miseducated\" class finds itself in\u00ad capable of creativity or inventiveness and become victims of \"conceptual incarcera\u00ad tion\" (Nobles 1985). They remember only what they have read in European-American textbooks and become, not the replica of Europeans, but their caricature (Fanon 1968). The \"miseducated negro\" (Woodson 1933; Karenga 1982) does not simply fail to develop solutions to the dilemma of his or her group but she or he fails even to ac\u00ad curately apprehend the nature of the posi\u00ad tion and resulting condition of that group. Excessive mortality, morbidity, incarcer~ ation, poverty, unemployment, mentacide, and miseducation are among the factors exemplifying violence that is characteristic of the historical and structural placement of African Americans. There are a number of other factors that also reflect the violent na\u00ad ture of the macroecology of African Americans; however, space does not permit an elucidation of all of them. Nonetheless, in a discussion of AOD use/ abuse/ depend\u00ad ence among African Americans, it is an ab\u00ad solute necessity to address two of these additional factors: environmental pollution and racism. The differential exposure of Black people to environmental pollution as an ex\u00ad pression of sociostructural violence is a mat\u00ad ter that has not begun to attract nearly the attention it deserves. It has been observed for some time that Black people, se\u00ad questered as we are in densely populated, inner-city communities, are exposed to ex\u00ad cessive levels of toxic chemicals from automobile and industrial pollution. Addi\u00ad tionally, the older buildings in which many economically disadvantaged Black people live are themselves suspect as endemic sources of particulate pollution. Moreover, Black workers are disproportionately as\u00ad signed to work under conditions that are carcinogenic and life threatening in multiple ways. Yet, acknowledging these aspects of environmental pollution is merely intended to introduce the fact that communities of the culturally different and poor are pol\u00ad luted with toxic, mind-altering, and li\u00a3e\u00ad threatening chemicals. This activity raises the specter of chemical warfare. Despite all the furor and political postur\u00ad ing about the \"war on drugs,\" there is still a lack of information about, and law enforce\u00ad ment attention to, the largely non-Black, wholesale drug dealers who make the mar\u00ad riage between the Colombian cartels and the Black petit retail drug dealers in inner\u00ad city and small-town America. If one per\u00ad mitted oneself to be influenced by national drug policy architects, one would accept the Political and Economic Implications of AODs idea that the principal players in this social epidemic are limited to the cartels in Colom~ bia and Black and Hispanic \"street hustlers\" locked in the confines of the extreme en\u00ad vironment. The Crips, the Bloods, the Miami Boys, and others of their ilk have even been elevated to the level of highly or\u00ad ganized crime syndicates to account for the absence of a sophisticated infrastructure in the United States of wholesale drug traffick\u00ad ers, bankers, truckers, and warehousers who exploit the desperation in our com\u00ad munities in a targeted way. The fact is that there are simply not enough Black people in this country em\u00ad powered in ways that are prerequisite to the management of the volume of drugs that this country imports. Americans consume more than 60 percent of all the illicit drugs produced in the entire world. The U.S. House of Representatives Select Committee on Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs es\u00ad timated that in 1986 the United States im\u00ad ported 150 tons of cocaine, 12 tons of heroin, 30,000 to 60,000 tons of marijuana, and 200 tons of hashish, to add to another 4,000 tons of \"homegrown\" marijuana, and another 100 tons of \"homemade\" miscel\u00ad laneous psychotropic substances. It is wide\u00ad ly recognized that a highly disproportionate share of these chemicals find their way to the poorest concentrations of African Americans. What is not as easily recog\u00ad nized, despite all of the frenetic law enforce\u00ad ment activity, is how. The targeting of the Black community for the relentless rain of mind-altering, toxic chemicals is not limited to those substances that the empowered have chosen to desig\u00ad nate as illicit. A rather competent expose of the way in which the alcohol beverage in\u00ad dustry conspires to target our communities was provided by the Center for Science in the Public Interest (Hacker et al. 1987). That inner-city communities are inundated with retail liquor outlets and outdoor and other advertisements facilitating self-sedation has long been recognized. The activity of the tobacco industry in this regard is also 27 An African-Centered Model of Prevention for African-American Youth at High Risk sinister, as illustrated by the recent Uptown episode involving RJR Nabisco's plans for Philadelphia.4 Few Black people operate in the corridors of power and decisionmaking that facilitate the targeting of our com\u00ad munities by dealers of licit and illicit drugs. Moreover, certain elements of so-called Black leadership are often gagged by these very interests into collaborative postures. The fundamental importance of racism in the experience of African and primarily African-descended people in America demands that it receive special treatment here. It has played a particularly complex role independently and in interaction with other facets of sociostructural violence. Al\u00ad though there are clearly other non-Black, and even White, population subgroups that can be shown to experience dispropor\u00ad tionate measures of sociostructural violence, in the Black experience political and economic oppression never operated alone as constraining dynamics. For African Americans, the point must be appreciated that our differential exposure to sociostruc\u00ad tural violence in this country cannot be fully comprehended apart from racism in its macro and micro forms. Racism, like violence of which it is a spe\u00ad cial form, is a highly mystified phenomenon in that most Americans, Black and White, only understand it in some of its interper\u00ad sonal varieties. As a matter of fact, African Americans historically have demonstrated a willingness to actively express intolerance for segregated facilities, policies, and life\u00ad styles. Our aspiration has been that the color of a person's skin should not be used to determine the content of the person's mind. This romantic preoccupation with color blindness has distracted us from some of the more intractable and dangerous forms of racism. Unable to get beyond inter\u00ad personal racism or, in certain rare cases in\u00ad stitutional racism, the reality that these expressions of racism are caused or spawned by sociostructural racism is hardly ever comprehended. Sociostructural racism is being defined as the historical and systematic arrange\u00ad ment of productive and social relations in this society so that they, without extraordi\u00ad nary intervention, develop a certain racial group and, dialectically, underdevelop other racial groups. Another form of racism that is given little attention is intrapersonal racism or self-hatred on the part of the vic\u00ad timized. Intrapersonal racism is the inter\u00ad nalization of White supremacist notions, views, and values within the psyche of the oppressed. This partial discussion of racism, par\u00ad ticularly intrapersonal racism, brings into focus the second question to which this paper is intended to respond. What cultural\u00ad ly appropriate elements should be cul\u00ad tivated to improve the health and viability of life in the African-American community? This question concerns the strengthening of the cultural fabric of African Americans such that culture can function as a source of immunity or resilience to the violent forces operating in our environment. The preeminence of culture as an issue has been promulgated (Karenga 1989). Further, it has been asserted that the fundamental proposi\u00ad tion confronting the African in America is cultural domination (Nobles 1985). The role of culture as insulation against excessive mortality was implied by Diop (1986), as he acknowledged that \"imperialism ... killed the being first spiritually and culturally, before seeking to destroy it physically.\" The implication is that spiritual and cultural in\u00ad tegrity strengthens a people, making their physical destruction more difficult. The cul\u00ad tural domination of African-American people compromises our ability to resist and protect ourselves from the onslaught of sociostructural violence in our experience, 4 RJR Nabisco had attempted to test market in Philadelphia a new brand of cigarettes, Uptown, especially developed for African Americans. A coalition of health and community activists, supported by Secretary of Health and Human Services Dr. Louis W. Sullivan, was successful in having the campaign withdawn. 28 thus permitting this violence to produce lethal, synergistic permutations. It can be said that African Americans have never been more spiritually and cul\u00ad turally depleted than we are in the current epoch. A convenient way of explaining this statement is offered by the WEUSI model contributed by Williams (1981), which dis\u00ad tinguishes three types of Black realities. \"WE\" was used to signify biological Black\u00ad ness or a primary biogenetic affiliation with the African racial stock. \"US\" was used to signify cultural/ spiritual Blackness or the gestalt of African cultural survivals that persisted independently of the conscious in\u00ad tent of African-descended people, a kind of \"collective unconscious.\" \"I\" was used to signify psychological Blackness or the presence of African consciousness in individuals. Obviously, the phylogenetic legacy of biological Blackness was only modestl y at\u00ad tenuated by the holocaust of chattel slavery. As will be elaborated later, it was the psychological Blackness or African con\u00ad sciousness of individuals that immediately received the most overt assaults during the initial holocaust. The cultural Blackness or \"collective unconscious\" of Africans proved to be more intractable and resilient even though it too was subjected to a gradual and protracted erosion, which started with the holocaust. Since then, the slow and progressive loss of African cultural sur\u00ad vivals has continued over time, although this process has been largely imperceptible to most of us. Indeed, the comparatively recent opportunity to desegregate or, more accurately disaggregate, served to escalate the pace of this process of deracination. This is actually why the signs of collective strain-a veritable smorgasbord of social epidemics-are currently most prominent, despite the fact that the present level of sociostructural violence can be said to be less intense than it was during earlier his\u00ad torical periods. We are currently function\u00ad ing with a seriously compromised level of cultural immunity, now in the late stages of our protracted psychocultural trauma. Political and Economic implications of AODs There can be no equivocating the fact that, in order to begin to dissect the psycho cultural trauma of Africans in America, it is necessary to return to the original nature of our encotmter with European Americans. The holocaust of chat\u00ad tel slavery must be revisited, no matter how painful the analysis (Fan on 1968). The centrality of this multigenerational holo\u00ad caust in etiological explanations of contem\u00ad porary African-American behavior has been more recently asserted by leading African\u00ad American personality theorists such as Akbar (1984). This is the corridor of anguish in which our connectedness to a glorious past was fractured. There was a time when the ancestors of contemporary African Americans, because of the level of their spiritual and cultural development, were equated. with the Divine. The land of our an\u00ad cestors in antiquity was referred to as \"The Land of the Gods\" (Williams 1974). This was the precursor civilization that yielded unparalleled cultural, spiritual, and t~,:h\u00ad nological development among these early Africans or Kemites. It was during this clas\u00ad sical era, in fact, that these Africans gave the world the foundations of medicine, astror.iJmy, mathematics, monotheism, ar\u00ad chitecture, and much more. Additionally, the more recent West African kingdoms that yielded most of the Africans who now inhabit the so-called New World, had, prior to European. aggression, operated as highly organized, complex societies (Rodney 1974). The experience that reduced these self\u00ad determining and self-reliant Africans to \"darkies,\" \"niggers,\" \"coloreds,\" \"negroes,\" and ''blacks'' was the holocaust of chattel slavery. Some important aspects of this holocaust are atrocities that occurred on the continent of Africa itself, while others oc\u00ad curred characteristically during the \"Middle Passage\" of human cargo. These are, how\u00ad ever, beyond the scope of this paper. The focus here is limited to the barbarous objec\u00ad tives that the contrived environment of the slave plantation was designed to achieve. There were two primary ways in which enslaved Africans were to be modified so 29 An African-Centered Model of Prevention for African-American Youth at High Risk that they would serve the European agenda. First, they had to become completely dependent on the Europeans for the satisfac\u00ad tion of basic human needs. Nobles and his colleagues (1985) identify five basic func\u00ad tions of this type: (1) the act of procreation (sex); (2) the provision of sustenance (food); (3) the provision of shelter and/or protec\u00ad tion (security); (4) the provision of recupera\u00ad tive time and space (rest and recreation); and (5) the provision of developmental guides (education). Any enslaved African who resisted the tremendously concen\u00ad trated pressure to rely on \"the other\" for the satisfaction of his or her basic needs con\u00ad fronted the most heinous atrocities and, fre\u00ad quently, death. Second, enslaved Africans were re\u00ad quired to deny their names and nationality. The existential and cultural connection to Africa had to be severed. Thus, the symbolic adoption of slave names and associated identities, devoid of historicity (e.g., darkie, colored, negro), was necessary. Any people's humanity is seriously reduced by the loss of their collective memory; there\u00ad fore, the planned dehumanization of Africans into chattel required the cultivation of cultural and historical amnesia. Ultimate\u00ad ly, Africans had to be completely ruptured from their Africanity, or cultural and spiritual moorings, in order for their enslavement to be successful. Thus Africans were denied the \"inalienable\" human rights of self-definition, self-determination (self\u00ad control), and self-defense (self-reliance), as part of the system of forced dependence to which they were exposed. Parenthetically, these issues were fundamental to the discus\u00ad sions of ''Black power\" almost three decades ago. The current faddish use of the word \"empowerment,\" when applied to African Americans, should be understood in this context. It can mean no less. The psychotic denial of the true and objective na\u00ad ture of Black reality was inculcated during chattel slavery so that enslaved Africans would corne to accept their immediate ex\u00ad perience as unremarkable, uncrirninal, civi\u00ad lized, and even Christian. 30 It is important to indicate that the enslavement enterprise was never totally successful. Despite several generations born into the holocaust, Africans continued to resist consciously and even unconsciously, through collective unconscious or inadver\u00ad tent cultural instincts. Chattel slavery did nonetheless foster, with varying degrees of success, alien-self knowledge, antiself at\u00ad titudes, and self-destructive practices (Akbar 1981). This is the very complex of knowledge, attitudes, and behavior, which continue to function as tertiary enablers, but not causes, in the etiology of AOD abuse and related social epidemics and define a psychopathology of collaboration. Consequently, interventions to prevent alcohol, tobacco, and other drug abuse must be culturally appropriate as well as cultural\u00ad ly specific and culturally sensitive. The lat\u00ad ter two terms are often interchanged with each other as if to imply that they refer, in general, to the same parameters. The much less frequently used term \"culturallyap\u00ad propriate\" is occasionally used in ways that further obfuscate these related concepts. I have begun, as a consequence, to argue for a dear distinction among these three con\u00ad cepts. They can be shown to relate to quite different purposes. When the label\"cultural\u00ad ly specific\" is attached to a particular inter\u00ad vention, it merely suggests that the intervention was designed for, or is targeted to, a particular cultural group. This fact alone will not qualify it as a culturally sensi\u00ad tive model. Cultural specificity would seem to be a necessary but insufficient condition for cultural sensitivity. A particular intervention designed for a particular cultural group can be said to be \"culturally sensitive\" if it is also informed by an anthropological familiarity with the pertinent behaviors, ideas, attitudes, values, habits, beliefs, customs, and so forth that are peculiar to that group. This idea is related to the concept of social validity promulgated by Baer (1984), which involves the accept\u00ad ability of an intervention to those in\u00ad dividuals most closely connected to it. A number of programs, projects, materials, and interventions are being developed so that they satisfy this condition. However when efforts, particularly those developed for oppressed persons, are limited to satisfy\u00ad ing the condition of cultural sensitivity, they inevitably incorporate features of pathology because oppression endemically breeds pathology. Cultural sensitivity is, therefore, an insufficient, albeit diagnostically neces\u00ad sary, requirement for programs that seek to be culturally appropriate. This does not mean, however, that it is necessary for every aspect of an intervention to be accept\u00ad able to those for whom it is intended. The requirement that is necessary, but insuffi\u00ad cient, is that the intervention be developed from a familiarity with the cultural phenomenology, including the cultural pathology, of the targeted group. Culturally appropriate interventions would additionally have to be prescriptive\u00ad ly designed to heal the peculiar psychocul\u00ad tural trauma of the targeted group. According to Nobles and his colleagues (1985; 1989), culture, as a moral demand sys\u00ad tem, has the power to compel behavior and the capacity to reinforce ideas and beliefs about human activity. It is consequently being proposed that efforts to identify, repair, or heal the existing traumatic psychocultural ramifications of the holocaust are required to strengthen the resilience of Afrkan Americans. What is being prescribed is the cultivation of own\u00ad race knowledge, own-race preference, and own-race maintenance. These three categories of measurable outcomes, cor\u00ad responding to the areas of knowledge, at\u00ad titudes, and practices, represent the Critical Cs: Africentric Consciousness, Africentric Commitment, and Africentric Conduct. This is the prescribed psycho cultural reparation that is expected to inoculate African Americans against the consequences of our continuing disproportionate exposure to sociostructural violence. Put another way, this psychocultural reparation will enhance the capacity of the African-American com\u00ad munity to cope with the political and economic realities of our lives. Political and Economic Implications of AODs Incremental improvements in the de\u00ad gree to which African and African\u00ad American memory is restored, African identity is reclaimed, and a spiritually based collective responsibility is cultivated will progressively reduce our vulnerability. It is not enough to give our youth reasons to say no to drugs; they must also be given some\u00ad thing to which they can say yes. They need a clear purpose, a reason for living that is greater than their individual lives. A con\u00ad scious sense of connectedness to the histori\u00ad cal African experience, and a strong sense of associated personal responsibility, will result from the cultivation of a sense of peoplehood. Interventions designed to prevent AOD abuse or any other health problem among African Americans that are not generously laced with features that chal\u00ad lenge our amnesia will have limited and short-lived effectiveness. Clearly, an impor\u00ad tant aspect of the rehabilitation of our psycho cultural health is our increasing ability to provide the necessary resources to heal ourselves and to regain control over the socialization of our youth. We cannot only look to the public sector or to White philanthropy for assistance because they can, at best, merely facilitate the develop\u00ad ment of this capacity. Ultimately, seli\u00ad reliance, a prerequisite of freedom and maturity for any people, will have to be con\u00ad fronted. The problem of AOD abuse, when con\u00ad sidered in the context of sociostructural violence, is appreciated as an essentially political problem requiring a political solu\u00ad tion. The earlier discussion of the victimiza\u00ad tion of African Americans by sedimented violence inherent in this society was in\u00ad tended to make the case that our experience is essentially a colonial one. It is a \"colonial relationship\" with the empowered in this society because, unlike them, Black people, as a group, do not enjoy a reciprocally deter\u00ad ministic relationship with the environment in which we are situated. We are not fully enfranchised so that the ecology in which we develop or falter can be said to be the product of our organized behavior. Our en\u00ad vironment was organized and is controlled, 31 An African-Centered Model of Prevention for African-American Youth at High Risk regulated, and recreated daily by others who are largely unresponsive to our needs, wishes, and views. The only realistic range of choices that are available to African Americans psychobehaviorally as in\u00ad dividuals, or culturally and politically as a group, is located between the poles of resist\u00ad ance and collaboration. Whether the col\u00ad laboration is a function of cooperation or submission and the resistance is conditional or unconditional, our repertoire is still cir\u00ad cumscribed by the fact that African Americans are controlled by an unrelenting bombardment of sociostructural factors over which we exercise very limited, if any, reciprocal control.

Newtan In the context of a definition of \"vulner\u00ad ability\" -being open to attack or capable of or being physically wounded (or mental\u00ad ly injured)-substances classified as licit or illicit can both render the human organism susceptible to biological vulnerability. Ac\u00ad cordingly, any meaningful discussion of al\u00ad cohol and other drug (AOD) abuse issues and biological vulnerability as it relates to the African-American community and in particular, its young people (who have been targeted as a group \"at high risk\") must begin with understanding the fact that the biology of the human organism has no use for the terms \"licit\" or \"illicit./I The issue of licitness in exposure to risk is all too often ignored in the African-American com\u00ad munity in identifying risk patterns of be\u00ad havior, treatment strategies, and prevention. It is not, however, the purpose of this discussion to focus on issues of licitness or illicitness in AOD use and abuse patterns. Nevertheless, it would be a serious over\u00ad sight in the context of exploring the biologi\u00ad cal entity as a whole, if AOD use and abuse is not made relevant to the serious risks im\u00ad posed, often unconsciously, on the African\u00ad American community by not including licit chemicals and drugs (e.g., caffeine, nicotine, sugar, salt, alcohol} along with the illicit (e.g., cocaine, opiates, hallucinogens, amphetamines, barbiturates). 35 An African-Centered Model of Prevention for African-American Youth at High Risk Far example, in African-American cammunities there are excessive numbers af fast-faad chain autlets menus affer an abundance high chalesteral, and chemical This calarie, high-salt junk faads readily available at the neighbarhoad and corner stares at law cast, places families in a cycle af licit faad chemical addictian that seems the mast can\u00ad scientiaus af praximity number af liquar stares, cigarette machines, and aver-the-caunter single cigarette purchases at these stares, alang with \"sexy\" billbaard and magazine advertisements, all serve as strang incen\u00ad addictive behaviars munity itself.

Given the dietary patterns, physiolagi\u00ad cal structure, and neurachemical campasi\u00ad tian af African is critical far this discussian. Understanding the rale af melanin is especially critical far the African-American papulatian, given re\u00ad search data that discuss the relatianship be\u00ad tween the taxic effects af these \"licit\" drugs and chemicals and melanin stability within African papulatians (Barnes 1988). The physialagical and pathaphysiolagi\u00ad cal effects af melanin and melanagenesis is prafaund and remains largely an enigma to. Western scientists. There have been, haw\u00ad ever, significant advances in melanin re\u00ad search aver the past fifty years (Eberle 1988; grawth) suggests that melanin is becaming a seriaus candidate far future clinical inves\u00ad tigatians (Eberle 1988). Melanin is a highly functianal chemical that regulates essentially all bady functians and activities (figure 1).

While melanin exists in virtually all human beings, it reaches its highest functianal expressians and cancentratians in humans classified as Blac...k ar Africans (figure 2).

They produce moderate levels of melanin and show a moderate risk of developing skin or other organ cancer. Type V These individuals are brown-skinned and include Indians, MalaYSians, Mexicans, Puerto Ricans, and other Spanish-Portuguese-speaking Latin American people. They produce moderate to high levels of melanin. Their eyes and hair are deep brown or black. They seldom develop skin cancer. Type VI These individuals are black in color a.'1d include Africans (Egyptians, Ethiopians, Nigerians, and so forth), African Americans, and Australian aborigines. Their eyes and hair are black. They have virtually no incidence of skin cancer.

Furthermore, he suggests that these foodstuffs should represent the central focus of the African-American diet, rather than the present diet that is high in fat, cholesterol, sugar, and salt. As a result of dietary toxins to which African Americans are exposed daily, and given the issue of biological vulnerability, several questions related to AOD abuse and hiological vul\u00ad nerability come to mind. Do African-American diet patterns often associated with known medical conditi.ons (e.g., high blood pressure, stroke, diabetes, renal failure) also serve to promote the development of \"crav\u00ad ings\" for various chemicals in these diets' food and set up a similar pattern in developing \"nonfood\" (drug) crav\u00ad ings? What is the relationship of these food\u00ad based chemical substance cravings to tobacco, alcohol, opiates, cocaine, and so forth? Do the chemicals create or stimu\u00ad late cravings in terms of setting up the biological precursor conditions for other drug cravings? Do the withdrawal effects from foods create similar emotional and central nervous system (eNS) irritability in the human organism and thereby render it vulnerable to addictive behavior through some mechanism involving melanin-mediated pathways? How does this effect differ among African and other population groups? Does the regular ingestion of toxic foods render the African American biological\u00ad ly\"weak\"? What effects, if any, do these toxic licit foods and chemicals have on rendering African Americans more vulnerable to the use and abuse of other toxins and drugs (e.g., opiates, cocaine, alcohol) through the destabilization of the melanin molecule? With regard to AOD abuse diagnosis, as\u00ad sessment, and the impor\u00ad tant. The of melanotropins means that the potential ex\u00ad ists for one structure to exhibit various physiological functions, depending on specific additional residues present in the molecule that alter the hormonal informa\u00ad tion of the \"core\" chemical structure. Toxic drugs and chemicals such as cocaine, LSD, and marijuana are very similar in chemical structure to melanin and to the subunits that make up the melanin substance (e.g., tyrosine, melatonin) (see figures 3 and 4). According to Barnes (1988) these similarities in chemical structures cause the addictive and toxic effects 01 these drugs to work at a faster pace, cause the user to experience higher \"highs\" and lower \"lows,\" and remain in the \"Black Human\" [sic] system for longer periods of time. When chemicals have similar structures, they will attract each other and, physically as well as electromagnetically, react (marry) with each other, thus forming a hybrid (see figure 5). Accordingl y, a toxic chemical like cocaine has the potential to copolymerizeS into the melanin structure. Once the reaction of copolymerization is complete and the molecule becomes stable, it may remain in\u00ad tact in various melanin centers throughout the body for several months. (Barnes 1988; Slavinska and Slavinski 1982; Inges 1984; Baweja et al. 1977). The available literature clearly indicates the central role of melanin in controlling mental and physical activities (Baer 1988; McGinness 1972; Mizutani and Massalski 5 Copolymerization is the ability to incorporate several different chemical units into the chemical structure of a plastic or rubber to obtain a specific property. 38 Issues of Biological Vulnerability 1976; McGinness et al. 1974). Melanin in the iris of the eye is directly related to an individual's reaction time or quickness of movement (Lerner 1984). In addition, melanin can bind and release most known elements <e.g., calcium, iron, zinc, potas\u00ad sium, sodium} essential for proper body me\u00ad tabolism (Baer 1988; Curzon 1975). Melanin can undergo several chemical reactions at Figure 3. Toxic/useful alkaloids one time through \"oxidation-reduction\" reactions. Through these mechanisms, for example, smoothness of movement and \"rhythm\" are thought to be facilitated (Gan et al. 1976,1977).

This is manifested frequently in African-American culture through various religious ceremonies, moments of creative inspiration (Le., jazz and improvisation), various dreams, trance states, and so-called telepathic communication. It is not clear what happens to the African-American cul- 40 ~CH---CH NCR, II -\"\"\"\"\"\"':CH CH ture when exposure to toxins (cl1emicals, drugs, and energy-depleting foods) occurs at various age levels in the population. However, the implications are clear in terms of biological vulnerability for all African Americans, in particular the young. Melanin is present very early in the ectoderm of the human fetus and things toxic to this system can be, and are, Issues of Biological Vulnerability FigureS, 2 D MELANIN +D COCAINE H [I '--------' MELANIN-COCAINE SPECIES 2 D MELANIN FRAGMENT \" \\ I I / ~D:: .,..... ....... / I I \\ \"\u00ad COCAINE (Causes Delayed High or Death) Source:Barne~1988. devastating for normal human growth and development and render the growing fetus vulnerable to a host of developmental difficulties, Barnes (1988) suggests that when a toxic drug like cocaine and a \"life chemical\" like melanin \"marry,\" a new species is created that has properties (traits) of melanin as well as the harmful drug (e.g., cocaine). This new species generally is incompatible with life functions, For example, since melanin serves as a \"storehouse\" for neurotransmit\u00ad ters,like serotonin and dopamine, the com\u00ad bination of melanin and cocaine serves to cause the release of these life-and-death neurotransmitters into the body. That is, in the case of cocaine intoxication the body will make an attempt to use cocaine-be- 41 ----- ~-------- An African-Centered Model of Prevention for African-American Youth at High Risk cause it is structurally similar to melanin\u00ad to do the job of serotonin and dopamine. Thus, certain neurotransmitters like serotonin and dopamine are depleted from the body, reducing the total amount of melanin in the body. ''When the body has completely used up the cocaine and it real\u00ad izes that the natural chemicals (melanin, serotonin, dopamine) are not available for regular body metabolism,\" says Barnes, \"it triggers a reaction called craving .... The body has been tricked into thinking that the cocaine chemical is melanin, serotonin, and so forth\" (Barnes 1988). Significant stressors (e.g., malnutrition, exercise, energy source depletion, extreme emotional and/or physical conditions) may have a trigger effect on the release of this cocaine, once it has been copolymerized, from the melanin molecule into the blood. The amount and concentration released under these circumstances is not controlled by a given individual. This effect is not de\u00ad pendent upon how much cocaine has been snorted, smoked, or injected nor the fre\u00ad quency with which it has been used (Barnes 1988). Thus, the human organism becomes a time bomb when this depolymerization (Le., spontaneous triggering) occurs between melanin and cocaine. In fact, the amount released may be so great as to cause seizures .. \"delayed trips,\" positive urine drug testing (even if there has been no cocaine used for several weeks or months), or sudden death (cardiac cmestii) (Barnes 1988). It appears painfully obvious that the greater the total concentration of melanin centers in the body, as in the African\u00ad American population for example, the greater the ability for copolymerization with cocaine or other toxic drug substances with a chemical structure similar to melanin. Thus, there is an enhanced risk of developing the deleterious effects on the body associated with depolymerization. It is important to point out that toxins and chemicals (e.g., foods, drugs, certain antibiotics, neuroleptics in the treatment of various mental disorders) all have the poten\u00ad tial for destroying the melanin molecule since many of them have chemical struc\u00ad tures similar to melanin's. Therefore, it ap\u00ad pears logical that the earlier the exposure of the melanin molecule in the life cycle of humans to such toxins, the greater the vul\u00ad nerability to pathophysiological (deleterious) effects on the life-force energy (melanin). Thus, in terms of biological vul\u00ad nerability, the African-American fetus, in\u00ad fant, child, or adolescent exposed to these toxins is in immediate and grave danger from alteration of major body functions in nearly every bodily organ system. It is known that melanin can organize it\u00ad self and other chemicals, thus showing the potential to reproduce itself. Therefore, if a condition occurs where the ability to produce melanin is altered or reduced, melanin itself can take over and control similar mechanisms to continue its produc\u00ad tion in the body (Barnes 1988). It is docu\u00ad mented that exposure of an animal to stress stimuli (e.g., restraint, shock, chemicals) provokes a three-to tenfold increase in cir\u00ad culating melanotropins. Emotional stress (fear and conflict) elicits a in circulating adrenalin, noradrenalin, ACTH, B-endorphin, and MSH (Tilders et al. 1985). This is a stimulus-response reaction that makes the organism hyperalert and hyper\u00ad vigilant and thus better able to defend and protect itself during a brief period. How\u00ad ever, at what age of the organism this occurs and at what level of melanin con\u00ad centration this property manifests itself has yet to be clearly established; this has profound implications and raises some major questions. Does exposure to drugs over short periods actually serve to stimu\u00ad late melanin production? Are the effects the same for longer periods? Is this capacity for 6 It is possible that the deaths of basketball player Len Bias and football player Don Rogers of the Oeveland Browns might be due to this spontaneous triggering. 42 ---------- ---~----------------- melanin self-reproduction still active after long-term exposure to various toxins? If certain brain receptors are blocked by various toxins then there is a reduction or prevention in the secretion of MSH and ~ endorphins exposed to emotional stress (Berkenbosch et al. 1981). Given the ques\u00ad tion of biological vulnerability, what effects does this response have on African\u00ad American population groups in terms of the groups mounting appropriate responses (e.g., protection, feeding) when exposed to severe and prolonged emotional stressors in the presence of toxic chemicals (Le., drugs)? Do melanin centers after such repeated ex\u00ad posure(s) create a form of \"biological apathy\"? Does this constitute a maladaptive stress response? What are the long-term im\u00ad plications, physically, mentally, and cul\u00ad turally of such maladaptation? Does exposure of highly melaninated people with rich concentration of melanin centers to toxins change the overall ability of the African-American population to manifest or, alternatively, lose creativity, memory, spirituality, and so forth? Does the active use of drugs by African-American women while pregnant and by men at the time of impregnation lead to permanent alteration in melanin centers of the fetus? Is this altera\u00ad tion compatible with life or a life form as we have come to know and understand it in terms of growth and development in reach\u00ad ing cognitive, physical, emotional, and neuroendocrinological milestones? The African-American community is just beginning to see the first effects of drug\u00ad exposed (e.g., crack cocaine) babies. As these vl.l1nerable children enter the early phases of life development and attempt to master the required adaptational skills (developmental milestones, entry into the educational system, social skills, neurologi\u00ad cal growth along with emotional stability) consistent with survival, their specific and/ or unique biological vulnerabilities will be revealed. What are the social, politi\u00ad cal, ethical, cultural, and spiritual implica\u00ad tions associated with the manifestation of such vulnerabilities? Issues of Biological Vulnerability If African-American biological vul\u00ad nerability is being affected by the environ\u00ad ment in which the African American is nurtured from the womb to the grave, what is the type and quality of life force being created in the community? In a world with dwindling resources where and how will the African-American community find \"homeostasis\" from a biological, cultural, political, and spiritual standpoint? What kind of prevention and treatment strategies ought to exist in light of the devastating and present realities of chemicals, drugs, and foods, that is, exposure to licit and illicit toxins? These are not easy questions. Indeed, they serve to create more questions than could possibly be posed (let alone answered) in the scope of this discourse. However, in terms of biological vul\u00ad nerability, if they are not asked and given serious discussion, the opportunity may never exist again to create a \"world view\" consistent with life itself. Already the danger signs are appearing. It seems that the apathy, feelings of help\u00ad lessness, slow reaction times, inappropriate environmental and biological responses to stress stimuli, and denial, features that are presently manifest in African-American communities, represent something greater than behavior modification and operant con\u00ad ditioning. While there are no hard data, it is plausible to suggest that these features may represent the first or preliminary phase(s) of the effects of chemical, drug, and food toxins on melanin centers, thereby altering the reaction time, cognitive abilities, memories, and creative energies in a specific type of human. Never has there been in the history of humanity and certain\u00ad ly not in African-American communities, a time when humans have been plagued by so vast an array of devastating biological toxins that affect the mind, body, and \"souls of Black folks.\" Never has there been in the experience of human existence the real pos\u00ad sibility and risk of having the basis of genetic life itself-melanin-permanently al- 43 An African-Centered Model of Prevention for African-American Youth at High Risk tered for African Americans, as well as all humans. As for prevention and treatment strategies as they relate to the issue of biological vulnerability, our efforts have fal\u00ad len short of the desired effects because it seems that we have been using a band-aid approach.

Goddard The field of alcohol and other drug (AOD) abuse research on Black popula\u00ad tions is still largely unstructured, without a paradigm to facilitate a critical perspective or a set of consistent theories to guide a his\u00ad torical understanding of the phenomenon of abuse. For example, from 1980 to 1989 there was a shift in emphasis in the field of al\u00ad coholism study from seeing alcoholism as a set of categorical and discrete conditions af\u00ad fecting particular groups presumed to suf\u00ad fer from an illness of uncertain etiology to seeing alcoholism as an endpoint in a drink\u00ad ing continuum that begins with normal drinking. In this shift there is also a unitary concept, which assumes that all persons af\u00ad fected are substantially the same, to multi\u00ad variate models that focus on more complex questions by looking at differences between groups and individuals? However, each re\u00ad searcher begins his study with a new and different perspective and, oftentimes, looks at different sets of factors that could account for the observed differences in alcohol use without developing a theoretical rationale for the choice of explanatory variables. The consequence of this is a proliferation of theories, conceptual frameworks, and paradigms with little or no consistency among researchers. Tenns are used indis\u00ad criminately to mean different things for 7 The theoretical work of Jdlinek, 1977, has provided the framework for the unitarian concept, which had dominated the field. 47 --------- An African-Centered Model of Prevention for African-American Youth at High Risk different researchers, and there is little or no consistency in conceptual definitions. Thus, it is not impossible to see two researchers using the same terms but coming to entirely different conclusions about the same sub\u00ad ject. There is, consequently, no accumulated body of knowledge informed by previous research in the field. Hence the fundamental purpose of the scientific process, the ac\u00ad cumulation of a body of knowledge based on systematic and consistent research, is largely unfulfilled in this field. The analysis of the epidemiology of Black drinking behavior suggests that very little is known about the prevalence and in\u00ad cidence of drinking in the Black community. This lack of information stems basically from the inappropriateness of the samples used in previous research. By a.'1d large, the primary means of data collection has been from captive populations, e.g., hospitals, prisons, schools, and so on. Although these populations are important in their own right, they do not necessarily represent the wider population in general and limit the generalizabilityof the data obtained. What is needed is a broader base for sample selec\u00ad tion that would allow us to examine in natural settings the natural course and in\u00ad cidence of drinking behavior in the Black community. The issue of assessment and diagnosis addresses the problems inherent in the at\u00ad tempt to arrive at a definition of what con\u00ad stitutes chemical dependence-a still very much misunderstood phenomenon. The question of definition is of critical impor\u00ad tance for the Black population since how one recognizes and defines has implications for problem resolution. To what extent does a person's viola tion of the norms relevant to his or her immediate social milieu lead others in this milieu to make the \"primary\" identification of that person as an abuser of chemical substances, leading to a secondary identification as an official diagnOSis and in\u00ad tervention? What happens when the person who makes the initial assessment of AOO abuse is outside the specific cultural milieu of the person being assessed? Available re- 48 search data indicate that diagnostic differ\u00ad ences exist among patients of various ethnic groups and that clinicians from different eth\u00ad nic groups perceive the world differently than each other. The question of diagnosis is one fraught with contradictions and difficul\u00ad ties because the cultural norms of the group define the state of wellness. Within the Black community there is a cultural perspec\u00ad tive on the cause of illness and well-being that is incompatible with the disease con\u00ad cept of alcoholism. The search for the causes of drinking be\u00ad havior has been largely concentrated in two areas, the intrapsychic level and the biologi\u00ad cal level. At the intrapsychic level, a great deal of research has been conducted focus\u00ad ing on the psychological attributes of people who are actually involved in drinking. At the biological level, the focus has been on identifying those biological\"markers\" that would differentiate between people who be\u00ad come alcoholic and those who do not. Al\u00ad though these approaches have produced some important results, they have largely failed to explain a significant proportion of the variation found in the data. Generally speaking, then, these models have been in\u00ad complete as explanatory paradigms. A broader perspective that includes psychoso\u00ad cial, cultural differences is needed if we are to further the process of understanding the nature of the factors that serve as precursors to drinking. Although we know a great deal about drinking behavior in the Black community, very little is actually understood. We do know, for example, that women tend to be abstainers, but when they do drink they tend to become heavy drinkers. However, we know very little about how and why this process occurs. We also know that heavy drinking is concentrated among middle\u00ad aged Black males, but We do not know why this pattern occurs. We also know that Black male teenagers in general begin drjnking later than their White peers. Again, we are limited in knowing why this process occurs. Based on the general review of the litera\u00ad ture, three general areas of concern need to Alcohol and Other Drug Abuse Uterature. 1980-1989: Selected Abstracts be addressed, developed, and expanded within the research field: 1. There is a need for the development a11d utilization of a theoretical perspective for Wlderstanding AOD abuse issues in the Black community. 2. There is a need to incorporate a broader Wlderstanding of the way in which cul\u00ad tural features influence the pattern of, and response to, use and abuse of chemicals in the Blarl< community. 3. There is a need to develop methodologi\u00ad cal consistency in the analysis of issues related to AOD use in the Black community. The following abstracts of a sample of the literature on AOD abuse reflect the in\u00ad herent problemr: in the field. These issues highlight the shortcomings of the research literature. In the absence of a unifying theory and methodology, the field has developed in a haphazard, random fashion with little or no continuity or consistency among researchers. Thus, there has not developed a cumulative body of knowledge based on a process of systematic data collec\u00ad tion guided by a theoretical orientation specifying the critical areas of interest. In the absence of this unifying perspective what ultimately results is a great deal of con\u00ad fusion and erroneous interpretation of the data that do not provide the critical body of knowledge necessary to guide the preven\u00ad tion and intervention field.

This report describes research on the as\u00ad sociation between subjective expected utility of drinking and the drinking be\u00ad havior of children 10 to 13 years of age.

Ethnicity and drinking in North\u00ad ern California: A comparison among Whites, Blacks and Hispanics. A!cohol and Alcoholism 19:31-44, 1984. The drinking patterns and problems of samples of non-Hispanic Whites, Blacks, and Hispanics are reported. Results of this large sample (N=4~06), cross-cultural study suggest that drinking patterns and the prevalence of alcohol problems vary sig\u00ad nificantly with age among the different eth\u00ad nic groups, particularly in males. Blacks and Hispanics are described as having less restrictive views toward alcohol use than Whites. The importance of these factors in planning efforts is noted. Caetano, R., and Herd, D. Black drinking practices in Northern California. American Journal of Drug and Alcohol Abuse 10(4):571- 587,1984. The data for this research came from three independent community surveys COH\u00ad ducted between 1979 and 1980 in the San Francisco Bay area. All surveys followed the same sampling plan and only probability techniques were employed. Of a total of 4,150 adult respondents, 1,206 identified themselves as Blacks and are analyzed in this report. A total of 29 percent of the females but only 16 percent of the males are abstainers. Frequent heavy drinkers com\u00ad prise 22 percent of the males but only 6 per\u00ad cent of the females. Among males, heavier drinking and alcohol problems are highest among those in their thirties and, therefore, cannot be associated with a youthful life\u00ad style as it happens in the U.S. general population. Characteristics such as income, employment status, and education are not associated with drinking. Religion, how\u00ad ever, is associated with drinking patterns and fWldamentalists have significantly more abstainers and light drinkers than other groups. These findings are also dis\u00ad cussed in light of Black culture and mi\u00ad nority status. It is suggested that drinking patterns among Blacks are influenced more by internal nom1S originating from common cultural and sociopolitical characteristics than from norms associated with class af\u00ad filiations in the larger society.

Findings indicate some similarities and important dif\u00ad ferences between Black and White women in terms of selected factors. When social background factors are held constant, race continues to be a significant predictor of selected drinking behavior factors. In addi\u00ad tion, White problem-drinking women are more likely than their Black counterparts to perceive difficulties in male-female relations as a major cause of their alcohol problems. Findings suggest tl1at race is a 5ignificant 50 predictor of differential drinking behavior. Implications for improving alcoholism prevention and treatment services for women are discussed.

This study deals with a population group that has been neglected in the re\u00ad search literature, namely Black female high school students from rural backgrounds. Not smprisingly, the proscriptive and abstinence nonns in the community resulted in drinking styles of a surreptitious nature in a setting of less restraint. Conse\u00ad quently, there were some signs of problems with alcohol such as experiencing complica\u00ad tions, getting high, and drinking for utilitarian reasons. The factors that in\u00ad fluenced the girls to drink, however, were similar to those of other studies. Harford, T.e. \"Alcohol Use Among Black Teenagers and Young Adults.\" Paper presented at the NIAAA Conference on the Epidemiology of Alcohol Use and Abuse Among U.S. Ethnic MLlority Groups, NIH, Bethesda, Md., 1985a. This paper describes drinking patterns and alcohol-related problems among Black teenagers and young adults. Surveys of high school students indicate that alcohol abstinence rates are higher for Blacks than for non-Black teenagers and that lower proportions of Black teenagers are heavy drinkers. The 1978 national survey of senior high school students revealed that the lower prevalence of heavier drinking among Black teenagers persisted when relevant demographic variables were controlled. The findings further suggested that the onset of drinking among Black teenagers, relative to other students, appears to be delayed. Drawing upon both the 1978 national sur\u00ad veyand a recent household survey con\u00ad ducted in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, data are presented with respect to several measures of alcohol use, the context in which alcohol is used, and attitudes related to alcohol use. Harford, T.e. Drinking patterns among Black and non-Black adolescents: Results of a national survey. In: Wright, R, and Watts, T., eds. Prevention of Black Alcoholism: Issues and Strategies. Springfield, Ill.: Charles e. Thomas, 1985b. The overall objective of this study is to identify factors relating to the use of alcohol within each of racial! ethnic student groups. The 1978 National Survey was limited to senior high school students and the overall sample of Black students was 496. The present study draws upon the earlier 1974 National Survey, which encompassed a wider age spectrum and a larger sample of Black students. The present analysis com\u00ad pared students who indicated in the ques\u00ad tionnaire that they were \"Black,\" not of Hispanic origin (N=930) and all other non\u00ad Black students (N=12,192).

To hypothesize that there are no sig\u00ad nificant differences among alcoholics of dif\u00ad ferent sexes, ages, races, cultures, and social classes is illogical and empirically un\u00ad founded. Yet it is still often maintained that \"an alcoholic is an alcoholic\" and thus should be subject to the same alcoholism policies, services, and treatment ap\u00ad proaches. Alt.~ough there are similarities common to all alcoholics, there are also qualitative and quantitative differences among various social groups of alcoholics\u00ad differences that should bear consideration in decisions concerning alcoholism treat\u00ad ment and research. 51 An African-Centered Model of Prevention for African-American Youth at High Risk Harvey, W.B. Alcohol abuse and the mack community: A contemporary analysis. Jour\u00ad nal of Drug Issues 15(1):81-91, 1985. Social problems that have a negative and disproportionate impact on Black Americans include crime, substandard hous\u00ad ing, nutrition, and medical care. But, as serious and complex as these matters are, al\u00ad cohol abuse is considered by some re\u00ad searchers to be the number one mental health problem affecting Black Americans. From a cultural standpoint, frustration, al\u00ad cohol availability, and a tolerance toward al\u00ad cohol consumption contribute to alcohol abuse among Blacks. However, racism and the accompanying effects of poverty, ghet\u00ad toization, unemployment, and under\u00ad employment must also be recognized as significant contributory factors to alcohol abuse, particularly in Black communities in urban areas. The thrust of current social thought and resultant treatment approaches appear to support the provision of in\u00ad digenous and culturally sensitive methods as means of combating the problem. Herd, D.A. /I Alcohol Use and Alcohol Problems: A Review of the Literature 0'1 American Blacks.\" Paper presented at the NIAAA Conference on the Epidemiology of Alcohol Use and Abuse Among U.S. Ethnic Minority Groups, NIH, Bethesda, Md., 1985. This paper examines the literature on Blacks and alcohol use in the post-World War II period. Areas covered in the review include epidemiological, clinical, social sur\u00ad vey, and ethnographic findings. The focus of the review is on the prevalence and pat\u00ad terns of alcohol-related problems and al\u00ad cohol consumption. In me area of alcohol-related problems, several areas of re\u00ad search are discussed. First, epidemiological trends on liver cirrhosis and esophageal can\u00ad cer morbidity and mortality are explored. Second, indicators of psychosocial/be\u00ad havioral problems such as arrests for public drunkenness, arrests for drinking and driv\u00ad ing, and hospital admission statistics are ex\u00ad amined. Third, self-reported social problems related to alcohol use from sur\u00ad veys of the general population are 52 described. The discussion of drinking pat\u00ad terns reviews the findings from both eth\u00ad nographic and '5urvey studies of drinking patterns. Recent findings from a national survey of Black and Hispanic drinking pat\u00ad terns are highlighted. This part of the paper focuses on the sociocultural aspects of drink\u00ad ing patterns, including demographic corre\u00ad lates of alcohol use, norms and attitudes toward alcoholic beverages, and social con\u00ad texts of drinking. The final section of the paper compares and contrasts findings about alcohol consumption and alcohol\u00ad related problems described in the literature. Areas of agreement and disagreement, in\u00ad cluding reasons for conflicting findings, are explored and discussed. Based on this dis\u00ad cussion, gaps in the literature and the needs for future research on Blacks and alcohol are identified. Humphrey,J.A.; Stephens, V.; and Allen, D.F. Race, sex, marihuana use and alcohol intoxication in college students. Journal of Studies on Alcohol 44(4):733-738, 1983. In college students, alcohol intoxication was more frequent in men than in women, in Whites than in Blacks, and in White women than in Black women.

The Black woman, alcohol and preven tion: An empirical explora tion. In: Wright, R., and Watts, T.D., eds. Prevention of Black Alcoholism: Issues and Strategies. Springfield, Ill.: Charles C. Thomas, 1985. This study proposes that Black women may have some unique difficulties with al\u00ad cohol and that these difficulties may involve one or more of the following systems: host, access, and environmental context. Each of these systems aIh.l ensuing prevention strategies is explored through a comparison of Black and White women in the following areas: 1. How Black women differ from White women as hosts, Black women's access to alcohol, and the environmental con\u00ad text in which they drink are questions tha t are examined. 2. Only those who drink are \"at risk\" of developing problem drinking practicee. Given that a large percentage of the Black female community may abstain, the identification of those most likely to use alcohol could be useful. Demo\u00ad graphic predictors of alcohol use are therefore considered and compared with those of White women. 3. Finally, for those who may be \"at risk\" (Black and White women who do not abstain) the relative salience of host characteristics, access, and context are considered. This study is based upon a secondary analysis of data collected by 1. Harris in January of 1974. A random multistage cluster sampling design was used to obtain a sample representative of the U.S. popula\u00ad tion 18 years and older (N=1,594). There were 65 Black females and 652 White females in the sample. King, L.M. \"Biobehavioral Indices of Al\u00ad coholism in a Black Community: Research Findings.\" Paper presented at the NIAAA Conference on the Epidemiology of Alcohol Use and Abuse Among U.S. Ethnic Minority Groups, NIH, Bethesda, Md., 1985. This paper examines the current re\u00ad search on the biobehavioral bdices of al\u00ad coholism among Black Americans. An examination of this literature is evaluated via a biobehavioral model developed in 1982 by King and his colleagues, which evaluates a set of complex relationships (biological, economic, social, and cultural) to derive various degrees of development and underdevelopment. Alcoholism is viewed as an outcome of underdevelopment. Further, the paper discusses the design of a new study that focuses on deriving biobehavioral indices of alcoholism in a selected Black community. Using data col\u00ad lected among a group of 300 Black twins be\u00ad tween the ages of 15 and 55, multivariate analyses are used to isolate factors that best predict alcohol-related problems among the twins. The initial hypothesis is that al\u00ad coholism is a specific multivariate syndrome with both biological and social parameters. King, S.W. Black females and alcoholism: Prevention strategies.

This chapter is an attempt to better un\u00ad derstand Black female alcohol abuse and al\u00ad coholism by (1) examining the available literature on Blacks and alcoholism and WO.nen and alcoholism, (2) discussing the implications and explanatory nature of this literature as it relates to Black females and alcohol abuse and alcoholism, and (3) recommending some prevention strategies to minimize the incidence of alcoholism among this subgroup that is highly at risk.

Journal of Studies on Alcohol 46(1):72-80, 1985. Bales' theory that sociostructural factors that produce stress for members of a SOciety increase the rate of alcoholism is examined 53 An African-Centered Model of Prevention for African-American Youth at High Risk to explain variations in the levels of al\u00ad coholism in the 50 States. Two types of so\u00ad cial stress are conceptualized and measured at the State level. The first, the \"life events\" model, is based on life changes that require aoaptation. An index is described in which (negative) personal life events in 15 categories (e.g., divorce and plant closings) are aggregated for each State using macro measures. The second model is based on the idea of chronic stressful conditions, and is measured through the Measure of Status In\u00ad tegration and the Index of Relative Oppor\u00ad tunities. Alcohol-related problems are measured by death rates for cirrhosis, al\u00ad coholism, and alcohol psychosis, and by per capita alcohol consumption. Both stressful events and stressful conditions are corre\u00ad lated with all indicators of alcoholism at the State level, 19 of 20 correlations being in the theoretically expected direction. Correla\u00ad tions are enhanced when age, urbanicity, the percentage of Blacks, low income, and education are controlled for. The three macro measures of stress taken together ex\u00ad plain 27 percent of the variation in cirrhosis death rates, 14 percent of the variation in al\u00ad coholism and alcoholic psychosis death rates, and 47 percent of the variation in al\u00ad cohol consumption rates. Lipscomb, W.R., and Goddard, L.L. Black family features and drinking behavior. Jour\u00ad nal of Drug Issues 14(2):337-347, 1984. The structural features of the Black fami\u00ad ly are explored in detail: the social organiza\u00ad tion of Black family life, the functions of the Black family, and the concrete material con\u00ad text within which the Black family exists. Also examined is the contextual relationship between the family and its environment and how this interchange affects the family sys\u00ad tem and the behavior of its constituent mem\u00ad bers as manifested in patterns of drinking behavior. While most of the work is highly de\u00ad scriptive, the logic of discovery underlying this article is guided by a theoretical model that suggests that the features of Black fami\u00ad ly life, as well as the pattern of drinking be\u00ad havior, are unique and that such uniqueness 54 derives from the cultural world-view of Black people. Accordingly, it is suggested that current Black drinking patterns are a product of historical traditions and practices originating from the African continent that have been modified by the concrete histori\u00ad cal experience of Blacks in America.

In order to study the examiner effect on self-report of drug use by high school stu\u00ad dents, three types of examiners and four types of data, including self-report of drug use, were manipulated. Analyses revealed that type of examiner had a Significant ef\u00ad fect on the reports of drug use but not on measures of mood, social support, and per\u00ad ception of drug use by other teens.

Frequen\u00ad cyand sequence of drug use: A longitudinal study from early adolescence to young adulthood. Journal of Drug Education 16(2):101-119,1980. Although AOD use has been found to be acquired in a series of stages or steps, the exact nature of this progression has not been firmly established, nor has such a process been corroborated for life periods other than adolescence. In this study, AOD use data obtained from 654 adolescents were used to examine changes and sequenc\u00ad ing of drug involvement over an 8-year period from early adolescence to young adulthood. Cannabis use peaked during late adolescence; liquor, stimulants, and nonprescriptive medication increased steadily over the 8-year period; hypnotics and psychedelic use increased through late adolescence and remained stable through young adulthood; and early experimental use of cigarettes decreased to more com\u00ad mitted use over the 8-year span. In a latent variable model that did not include nOl.l\u00ad prescription drugs and cigarettes, alcohol use significantly influenced later cannabis and other illicit drug use, whereas cannabis use predicted later illicit drug use for the earlier life period. Only the cannabis effect remained at the older age period, when drug use patterns appeared to become more stable and firmly established. However, when cigarettes a,nd nonprescription drugs were added to the model, quite different results emerged. Based on this more com\u00ad prehensive analysis, it was concluded that there are several interrelated mirtisequences of drug involvement; cigarettes playa prominent role as a gateway to cannabis and other illicit drugs; Chid at hight:r levels of involvement there is a synergb'dc or reciprocal effect of increasing involvement. Again, the later developmental period was much more stable with somewhat different patterns of influence. Nobles, W.W. Alienation, human transfor\u00ad mation and adolescent drug use: Toward a reconceptualization of the problem. Journal of Drug Issues 14(2):243-252,1984. Drug-related dependence and alcohol addiction have become in many ways char\u00ad acteristic of the American way of life. Having reached down to America's children, the rampant spread of alcoholism and drug abuse remains one of this country's most pressing unsolved 55 An African-Centered Model of Prevention for African-American Youth at High Risk problems, with many scholars recognizing that no single factor can explain its etiology or serve as the basis of its remediation. In this ill'tide, the author reviews the conventional conceptualization of the prob-\u00ad lem and provides the basis of a reconcep\u00ad tualization that has the potential for explicating how seriously alcoholism may be embedded in the fundamental American cultural fabric. It is suggested that adoles\u00ad cent alcoholism may be symptomatic of the crisis found in the American value base where there is a gap between the meaning of human being and the experience of human being, which results in a self-con\u00ad scious sense of alienation. The implication of this work suggests that the remediation of adolescent alcoholism requires the trans\u00ad formation of American culture. The author briefly suggests that an African-based trans\u00ad formation may be what is needed. Swift, C.F.A., and Beverly, S.

Prevention of Black Alcoholism: Issues and Strategies. Springfield, Ill.: Charles C. Thomas, 1985. Attempts to trent Black patients through outreach programs designed for and used primarily by the White community have been singularly unsuccessful. Although al\u00ad coholism helpers should have knowledge of the social, economic, and cultural realities of the lives of minority alcoholics, few programs have been staffed with helpers equipped to serve minority populations. The result of this lack of resources is that most Black alcoholics receive no treatment at all. This chapter describes a program in which Black ministers were invited to assist in attempting to provide resources to con\u00ad front the problem of Black alcoholism in a midwestern community. Two separate but related programs were established: The Court Counselor Aide program, in which 56 Black ministers provided counseling for mis\u00ad demeanor offenders, and a court class in al\u00ad coholism, which used the ministers in teacher / therapist roles.

British Journal of Addiction 75(4):381- 388,1980. This study systematically evaluates the presence of alcoholism and alcohol problems in a large sample of Black male heroin addicts. Of 192 addicts, 24 percent were diagnosed as alcoholics and 13 percent as probable alcoholics when objective criteria for alcoholism were used. An addi\u00ad tional19 percent reported isolated problems with alcohol. Thus, 56 percent of this sample of addicts had experienced some problem because of alcohol. The occurrence of such problems as medical complications from alcohol and use of nonbevera.ge al\u00ad cohol indicated the seriousness of their al\u00ad cohol use. Among subgroups of the study sample, the highest rate of alcoholism was in add;cts currently addicted--49 percent, while the lowest rate of alcoholism was in addicts who were in successful treatrnent- 22 percent. Thus, a sizable portion of the heroin addict population is having problems from the use of two drugs\u00ad heroin and alcohol. Section II Current Applications and Future Directions for AOD Abuse Prevention for African-American Youth at High Risk Chapter 6 The Complex Nature of Prevention in the African-American Community: The Problem of Conceptualization Milton Morris ThiS report was first meant to be a review of relevant literature that would iden\u00ad tify specific approaches to alcohol and other drug (AOD) abuse prevention proven effec\u00ad tive or showing potential for success with African Americans. A common, publicly ac\u00ad cessible data base was selected; the ERIC and PsychLIT computerized references covering the period 1983-1989 were used. These sources were chosen because they represent the normal starting point for the serious study for any number of social is\u00ad sues on college and university campuses. They were augmented by a second body of information, generally less accessible to the public, developed by the Office for Sub\u00ad stance Abuse Prevention (OSAP) and other public agencies affiliated with the preven\u00ad tion movement. The formation of OSAP in 1986 has led to a dramatic growth in the number of prevention programs to deter AOD abuse. In 1987, OSAP funded 130 demonstration projects, of which 24 focus directly on African-American youth and their families. It is disheartening to report that there are virtually no published data available describing the prevention programs aimed at African-American youth. Indeed, only two programs of this nature were reviewed in the literature covering this report's period of investigation. Of 334 articles in 59 An African-Centered Model of Prevention for African-American Youth at High Risk computerized sources concerning African Americans and alcohol and other drugs, fewer than 50 were even marginally related to prevention programming. This number represents less than 15 percent of the litera\u00ad ture. At the outset, therefore, it is fair to say that, so far as African Americans are con\u00ad cerned, tested and documented prevention programming is more myth than reality. Consistent with this perspective, Wright and Watts (1985) earlier found that there were a number of primary and secondary prevention efforts targeting alcohol-related problems in the African-American com\u00ad munity, but none reported a systematic evaluation of program effect.s The scope of the research was broadened to investigate the prevalence and incidence of AOD abuse among African Americans to is0- late the factors believed to contribute to effec\u00ad tive prevention programming. This change peI1llits the development of the implications from the literature about the nature and mean\u00ad ing of prever~tion. Patterns of AOD Abuse: Implications for Prevention Various authors (Monroe-Scott and Miranda 1981; Crowley 1985) indicate that African Americans differed from Whites and other ethnic groups in their patterns of use. For in\u00ad stance, African Americans as a group have a higher rate of abstainers and heavy users than Whites, and African-American adoles\u00ad cents have a lower level of drinking than their White counterparts. Crowley \"vrites: Race and dropping out of school, factors usually associated with lower social status, are associated with higher proportions of abstaining, contrary to stereotype but in keeping with previous research (Radosevich et al. 1980). Being African American, a high school dropout, or not working at the time of interview are all significantly associated with low probabilities of drinking. Moreover, Crowley reports that the greatest problem African Americans report is a tendency to lose control over their drink\u00ad ing, while Whites report a tendency to dis\u00ad play aggressive behavior. Crowley made no attempt to account for these differences.9 However, her research does show that simple correlations between either socioeconomic status or race and alcohol use are dubious. Maddahian and colleagues (1985) com\u00ad pleted a longitudinal study that examined single and multiple patterns of alcohol, tobacco, and other drug use for four ethnic groups. African-American students reported the highest frequency of multiple use of cigarettes, alcohol, and cannabis, while White and Hispanic students had the highest frequency of AOD use with either cigarettes or cannabis, or both. Furthennore, at the end of the 5-year period, 21.5 percent of the African-American participants were nonusers. Only the Asian population (with 29.2 percent as nonusers) demonstrated a similar progression. Roughly 12 percent of Whites were nonusers. Maddahian reports two other significant findings: (1) over a 5-year period, 50 percent of all users moved to a lower level of 'Use, and (2) African Americans, over time, tended to use fewer drugs or decrease their levels of use com\u00ad pared to other groups. The authors' inves\u00ad tigations did not pennit them to identify the specific cause of the changes they observed. One suggestion, however, is that socializa\u00ad tion or maturation played a part. Although these differences are interesting, in the 8 'These aSAP programs are reviewed later in this document in the chapter by R.J. Courtney and will not be included in this section. 60 Of course, it is entirely possible that significant program activity has eluded the process of documentation, or that more fully developed activities are not yet available to the general public. Many of the OSAP dr:monstratioll projects included evaluations that have not yet been published. The Complex Nature of Prevention In the African-American Community absence of an analysis that attempts to ex\u00ad plain them, their help in understanding prevention is limited. The changes do show, however, that left to their own devices, about half of the young people studied had internal and/ or external motivations that worked to limit their progression in the use of substances. Those motivations are not yet fully understood nor, indeed, is it under\u00ad stood what propelled the others to maintain or increase their levels of use. One of the better informed and most focused appraisals of the etiology and pat.:. tern of AOD use in the African-American community was written about youth living in the Bronx. Although dated, the article by Richard Dembo (1979) is critical in that it at\u00ad tempts to bring theory and practice together in the design and implementation of preven\u00ad tion programming. Dembo approached this task by working with young people and several key professionals to develop a sur\u00ad vey that was administered in a local school. One of the issues Dembo examined was the role that ethnicity and social adjustment played in determining the pattern of drug use. Regarding ethnicity he found that among African-American youth AOD use was more strongly correlated with an unin\u00ad tact household while AOD use by Puerto Rican youth was best predicted by how they perceived their relationship to their family. Dembo also questioned the clinical or \"isolated case\" approach to drug preven\u00ad tion. He writes: The youth are best seen as internalizing features of their environment in such a manner that they fit in with their self\u00ad conceptions. Hence, focusing on the youngsters as individuals (or psychological entities) or on the cultural values which are prevalent in their neighborhood would provide limited understanding of them and their sub\u00ad stance taking behavior. Cultural values become important when they are incor\u00ad porated into people's self-perceptions and are reflected in their activities. In brief, the young people he inter- viewed were not \"maladaptive.\" They responded logically to their perception of the requirements of their environment. Dembo further argues that how youngsters see themselves in relation to the \"tougher\" role models in their neighborhood is a bet\u00ad ter predictor of future AOD use than whether or not their friends use alcohol or another drug. The clear implication is that successful prevention activity must have a holistic perspective that strengthens a person's real or perceived ability to cope with his or her environment. The process is integrative and inclusive of the significant personal and communal elements of his or her life. Another level of insight into African\u00ad American patterns of AOD use derives from the literature on AIDS prevention. Peterson and Marin (19Se) report that SO percent of all injected-drug users are African American and Hispanic. They also cite evidence that African-American and Hispanic users were more likely to engage in sharing drug paraphernalia than their White counterparts. It is not clear to what extent sharing needles is related to the cost of the equipment or, alternatively, repre\u00ad sents evidence of a form of social bonding. The authors proceed to argue that because most injectable drug use occurs outside treatment programs, methods of reaching this population should make use of out\u00ad reach techniques that are not incriminating and that allow face-to-face interaction. More important, some strategies aimed at mini\u00ad mizing the harm caused by injected drug abuse (for example, needle exchanges, AIDS prevention education, or etiological re\u00ad search) could benefit from the cooperation of users. Cooperation between users and nonusers in the goal of reducing the harm caused by AOD abuse is a prudent step toward attaining the goal of a society free from chemical dependence and addiction. The literature cited provides informa\u00ad tion that helps clarify a factual basis for the development of a different approach to prevention programs. The literature does not show a pattern of use in the African\u00ad American community that exceeds that 61 An African-Centered Model of Preventfon for African-American Youth at High Risk found in other ethnic communities. The im\u00ad plication of this is that the significant prevention issue for African Americans might lie elsewhere. For example, there are at least three other aspects of drug-related behavior that have implications for preven\u00ad tion in the African-American community. In addition to the abuse of alcohol and other drugs, the African-American community must be concerned with the presence of more potent illicit drugs, the large numbers of youth involved in the distribution of illicit drugs, and the violence associated with drug occupations. While these problems are inter\u00ad related, the range of alternative solutions is not necessarily the same. The cultural destabilization associated with distribution may have a more deleterious effect on the African-American community than the use of the illicit drugs themselves. For example, the interaction between the condition of poverty and the involvement of young African-American males in the sale and dis\u00ad tribu ti on of illicit drugs for economic gain leads to a distorted value structure among participants. Nobles and colleagues (1987) have documented the effect of this interac\u00ad tion of negative social conditions upon African-American culture. Their work indi\u00ad cated that the value system of the drug enh'epreneur is opposed to those values characteristic of the traditional African\u00ad American community and can ultimately lead to the destruction of that cultural system. Second, the review of the literature sup\u00ad ports the call for a more culturally consist\u00ad ent or culturally legitimate approach to prevention. For example, Maddahian shows that, left to their own devices, a certain per\u00ad centage of youth will decrease their use without planned intervention. Apparently, they take advantage of environmental sup\u00ad ports and/or constraints already in place. The implication is that there are strengths in the sociocultural milieu of these young people that help keep significant numbers of them from abuse. It would appear that a more efficacious approach for prevention would be to identify and bolster those con\u00ad structive cultural qualities, both personal 62 and institutional, within the community that help people survive an environment where alcohol and other drugs are avail\u00ad able. That is, the focus of prevention should be on developing those natural resiliencies in communities that support individuals who may be at risk for AOD use. The over\u00ad all implication of the literature is that the key \"action\" in developing a prevention strategy may have more to do with strengthening community and cultural foun\u00ad dations than with combating the specific ad\u00ad dictive agent. This last point brings up the question of the tools of prevention. Programmatic Tools of Prevention: Two Case Studies The ERIC and PsychLIT data bases reported only two specific drug prevention programs for African-American youth. Though their task is similar, they provide examples of two different approaches or prevention tools. One program explicitly claims to be \"culture-specific.\" The other does not. Both exhibit strengths and weaknesses. The first program is the \"Soulbeat\" project described by Maypole and Ander\u00ad son (1987). The motivation for the Soulbeat project was derived from a perceived lack of African-American support for a commllJ.\"1ity substance treatment and prevention center. The authors met with the agency directors and determined that there was a need to in\u00ad clude African-American families and churches in program design and implement\u00ad ation. Later, a decision was made to train 14 yourlgsters as actors who would perform in community schools and churches. Scripts and skits were based upon common events surrounding AOD use and abuse in the African-American community. The primary goals were to influence the knowledge, values, and behavior of the young actors. In addition, discussion sessions following the performances allowed the actors, staff per\u00ad sons, and audiences to clear the air about common misperceptions about alcohol and other drugs. ----------------------- ~------ ~-- The Complex Nature of Prevention In the African-American Community The SOLllbeat project, by the authors' own admission, had serious shortcomings. The effects of the plays and skits were not rigorously evaluated. Only anecdotal evidence that the youth had developed a new norm against AOO use was offered as proof of positive outcome. No longitudinal studies were done either with the youth or in the community. Also, according to the authors, four of the youths did not complete the requisite training in AOD abuse that was intended to provide an information base for the young actors. Oespite these rather obvious shortcomings, the activity did make use of institutions within the African-American community. It also allowed young people to interact with their parents and peers. The second program was much more structured. Beaulieu and Jason (1988) describe an 8-week AOD use prevention program aimed at seventh grade students in an African-American elementary school. The program randomly selected two classes to be experimental and three others to be control groups. The intervention consisted of a combination of educational strategies including information sharing, decisionmak\u00ad ing and problem-solving techniques, and the development of social competence skills. In addition, peers served in the class\u00ad rooms as helpers and role models demonstrating the attitudes and skills under discussion. Both the experimental and control groups were pre-and posttested in three areas: (1) an assessment of student knowledge about alcohol, tobac\u00ad co, and marijuana; (2) a problem-solving and thinking scale tha t assessed the students' ability to generate alternatives; and (3) an assessment of AOD use. In addi\u00ad tion, students were asked to rate the strengths and weaknesses of the program. The experimentCll group received treatment immediately after the pretest. After 8 weeks, both groups were posttested. Then the control group participated in the pro\u00ad gram. Afterward, both groups were posttested again. The results from the posttests were in the direction expected. After participation in the program both groups showed significant knowledge gains. The results from the problem~solving scale were mixed. Both groups were found to have a better grasp of how to respond positively to drug-related conflicts-that is, both groups of students were able to iden\u00ad tify and express a preference for ap\u00ad propriate direct and indirect approaches when solving interpersonal conflicts. How\u00ad ever, the differences found in the experimen\u00ad tal group were not significant. Also, neither group transferred this knowledge to non\u00ad AOO-related circumstances. Finally, there was no noticeable effect in either group upon the decision to use alcohol or other drugs. The authors account for the failure to find significant differences in self-reports of AOO use by citing the possibility of methodological issues associated with the use of self-assessment scales. They also remark that students reported low levels of initial use, which may mean that reduction was not a reasonable expectation. This program avoided the major prob\u00ad lem that plagued the program developed by Maypole and Anderson and developed an evaluation strategy. However, it relied upon self-reports. In fact, this may be a justified limitation of the field because, by the authors' own data, very few youngsters reported a problem with AOD use. What this program seems to lack, however, is the level of interaction characterized by Soul\u00ad beat. The students appeared to be more or less passive recipients of the infonnation provided by classroom teachers. The pre\u00ad vious discussion indicates that this is probably not the most effective approach. This, in part, accounts for the students' in\u00ad ability to transfer social interaction skills to other settings. The knowledge gained, even though retained, is not instrumental in the life of participants. These programs, despite minor differ\u00ad ences in structure and execution, are more alike than unlike. They both derive from a deficit theory and purport to teach informa\u00ad tion or skills. They both seem to have been organized without significant input from the participants. If the results are accepted 63 An African-Centered Model of Prevention for African-American Youth at High Risk as reported, they were most effective at information exchange. One did not measure change in behavior and the other did not detect a change. In the Soulbeat project the family's role, while visible, was largely pas\u00ad sive. The other program completely ignored the family. This is not to say that either of these programs was without merit, only that in their execution they reached for rather modest goals. A third program receives only a brief mention because we do not have access to a full description or evaluation. Kurnpfer (1987) has pioneered a family-oriented inter\u00ad vention for the treatment and prevention of AOD-related incidences. Her approach con\u00ad sisted of three aspects or components: a behavioral parent-training program, a children's skill-training program, and a com\u00ad ponent bringing both groups together. Al\u00ad though we have no evaluation results to present, the review of the literature suggests that this approach, if combined with values and techniques consistent with the cultural substance of the subject group, is closer to what will be required in the next decade. The focus is on making systemic changes. A fourth program reviewed here is the HAWK Federation Manhood and Develop\u00ad ment Training Program developed by Nobles and Goddard (1988). Although not developed as a traditional A OD abuse prevention program, it has implications ior the field of prevention in terms of suggest\u00ad ing a more expansive approach to preven\u00ad tion planning itself. The HAWK Federation was developed as an attempt to intentional\u00ad lyand overtly influence the values and moral character of young Black males. The sole and singular mission of the HAWK training program is to develop competent, confident, and conscious African-American men. Through a process of intentionally in\u00ad troducing to young men the qualities, at\u00ad tributes, attitudes, and responsibilities of African and African-American men of excel\u00ad lence, the HAWK project stimulates in. their c.'1aracter the desire to become high achievers and the best at whatever they do. In so doing, the HAWK process aims at 64 developing in each young man (1) some\u00ad thing he does exceptionally well (com\u00ad petence); (2) a belief that whatever the task, he can be successful at it (confidence); and, (3) an awareness of the historical greatness of African and African-American men and their personal responsibility for the future continuation of that greatness (conscious\u00ad ness). In regard to youth development, the motivation factor embedded in the HAWK Federation development and training pro\u00ad gram is found in the Afrocentric cultural precepts of the cardinal virtues of Maat (I.e., truth, justice, righteousness, harmony, propriety, balance, and order)-the prin\u00ad ciples of initiatory mastery and codes of proper conduct. These serve as the ethos or set of guiding principles that govern the con\u00ad duct of the young men in the program. The HAWK Federation has universal prevention and intervention capabilities: it is, in es\u00ad sence, a universal prevention-intervention program that addresses simultaneously the problems of alcohol and other drugs, gang violence, academic failure, low aspirations, and poor self-esteem. The utility of this program for preven\u00ad tion is currently being evaluated. The pretest data indicate that the youth are ex\u00ad periencing a strong sense of family, appear to be bonded with the family, and admire parents as role models. Analysis of the data indicates that the youth in the program are very knowledgeable about drugs and drug\u00ad related behavior in the community, are ex\u00ad posed to the risk of AOD use, and that some have already begun to experiment with alcohol and other drugs. Analysis of psychosocial risk factors indicates that the youth are experiencing high levels of stress: feelings of helplessness, a sense of entrap\u00ad ment, tension, boredom, and a perception of monotony in their life. In terms of be\u00ad havioral modalities, the youth seem to indi\u00ad cate a lack of self-discipline and respect and recognition of authority. In addition, these youths' attitudes indicate that they view women as incapable of being self-sufficient or mastering their own destiny, as rigid and inflexible, and dependent in their relationships. Such attitudes are very The Complex Nature 0f Prevention In the African-American Community disparaging and sexist. When they are coupled with the attitudes that show a sense of sexual irresponsibility, all present a profile that could result in the sexual ex\u00ad ploitation and domination of women, un\u00ad safe sex practices, and an increase in risk-taking behavior. In summary, the pretest data indicate an attitudinal disposition and behavioral modality among the youth that produce a profile of being \"self-destructive\" and at risk. With the posttest data the project will be able to point to the efficacy of this model for the transformation of the behavior of Black adolescents. Positive Directions for African Americans In the absence of a large literature base to draw upon, it is a risky business to single out features that contribute to successful prevention programming. Nonetheless, several authors do offer opinions on this matter. The work of Dembo (1979) raises a host of concerns about the implementation of prevention programs in general. Dembo's review of the literature covered programs that, for the most part, did not in\u00ad clude African-American youth. He con\u00ad cluded that the basic elements of a successful prevention program were largely ignored. Here are some of his concerns. There is need to develop drug preven\u00ad tion programs for non-youths and non\u00ad white, middle-class persons ... many programs continue to regard the in\u00ad dividual user as the focus of concern. Secondary interest is usually given to the social and cultural experience of users ... many drug prevention programs take place in institutional set\u00ad tings such as school with relatively few program activities occurring in the com\u00ad munity ... substantial discrepancies ... exist between student ratings of the ef\u00ad fectiveness of prevention programs and the rates of participation in these ac\u00ad tivities .... As a case in point, 22 percent of the students surveyed indicated they had been exposed to talks by ex-addicts; but, this technique was rated as effec\u00ad tive by 63 percent of those who had ex\u00ad perienced it. Dembo's elaboration of these factors led him to the conclusion that, in general, programs delivered by parents or peers are more effective than those delivered by teachers or program staff. Further, young people respond more positively to settings that allow for interaction and cross-examination of the issues. Finally, he concludes that too much emphasis is placed on primary preven\u00ad tion, because already high rates of prevalence suggest the increased need for secondary in\u00ad terventions. Although there is no obvious reason to presume that Dembo's findings would not apply to African-American youth, similar surveys need to occur within the African-American conununity. Other authors stress cultural factors even more strongly. Borrowing from the literature on the treatment of alcoholism by Womble and Brisbane (1986) there are several injunctions that may prove useful in the area of prevention. The authors urge practitioners to broaden the concept of treat\u00ad ment to include key family members and fic\u00ad tive kin. They also argue that colorblindness has 01Jtlived its usefulness. In this regard, Mrican-American pride can be a source of strength for the individual. They observe that African-American men do not benefit from programs designed for Whites be\u00ad cause the programs are built on assump\u00ad tions-Le., that they are employed, believe that with sobriety they can achieve a healthy social and economic life, and have insurance and an employer concerned that they recover-that do not apply to African\u00ad American men. The authors feel that African Americans should be employed in treatment programs that serve them. In\u00ad deed, along similar lines, research in the treatment of AOD addiction suggests that when patients and therapists agree on sig\u00ad nificant aspects of their treatment, there is some improvement in outcomes (Nurco et al. 1988). In the general literature on social learning theory, Brown and Inouye (1978) 65 An AfrIcan-Centered Model of PreventIon for AfrIcan-AmerIcan Youth at HIgh Risk and Taylor (1980) in a series of experiments have shown that African-American youth are more likely to emulate a model's be\u00ad havior when the model is perceived as similar in attributes (e.g., ethnicity, sex) to them. Thus, in a slightly different manner, both N urco and Brown provide evidence that for African Americans the content of the treatment is best received when it con\u00ad forms to their perceptions of what the world is like (Le., is congruent with their cultural substance). Extended to the arena of preven\u00ad tion programming, these data lend credence to Dembo's insights. These writings also provide general support for the cultural consistency framework for prevention programs. What seems to be critical is that there is the connection based on the cultural experience rather than on the life exper\u00ad iences of the service provider. Finally, Gary and Berry (1984) point out that the African-American community is diverse in its attitudes toward AOD use. Their survey of 411 African-American adults showed that being male, young, and single was most positively correlated with favorable attitudes toward such use. What is important here, however, is that they report that sociocultural factors such as race consciousness and community or religious involvement were all negatively correlated with alcohol and other drugs. They suggest that instead of a strong emphasis on anti\u00ad abuse messages there should be an en\u00ad couragement of positive racial identity. They also suggest that a more system\u00ad oriented, as distinct from a person-oriented, approach to prevention be taken. These authors apparently believe that self\u00ad conscious involvement in community im\u00ad provement lessens the probability of indulgence in alcohol and other drugs. According to the best information avail\u00ad J~1~, the main thrust of a culturally consis\u00ad tent and/or legitimate prevention program would be to strengthen those elements of community most responsible for personality formation. Home, schools, and jobs that work to maintain a sense of community and importance of family ties best reduce the 66 likelihood for self-abusive behavior. Preven\u00ad tion programs must be prepared to grapple with the stress produced by the individual's perceived or actual failures in these basic areas of life. How to accomplish this goal, however, remains a mystery. Consequently, little can be said except that several authors view reducing these kinds of stresses as central to the prevention effort (Gary and Berry 1984; Womble and Brisbane 1986). In summation, when intervention is necessary it must have as its object em\u00ad powermentrather than imprisonment. Prevention programs should focus upon the aspects and institutions in the African\u00ad American community that have traditional\u00ad ly opposed self-abuse such as community\u00ad based organizations, the church, and self\u00ad help groups. The work of Gary and Berry (1984) and Womble and Brisbane (1986) sup\u00ad port this proposition by identifying the demographic correlates of drug use in the African-American community. It is also vital that prevention programs grapple with the issue of congruity between both the in\u00ad dividual and the service providers and the services provided and the cultural expecta\u00ad tions of the people who receive those ser\u00ad vices (Nurco et al. 1988; Dembo 1979). It seems that it does matter, at least for African Americans, whclber the client has something in common with the service provider. More research is needed to deter\u00ad mine to what depth and extent a shared point of view plays a role in prevention and recovery. Nurco's work with heroin abusers suggests that, at a minimum, agreement on aspects of service needs and modes of treat\u00ad ment may influence outcome. Finally, ac\u00ad cording to Dembo, prevention programs need to listen to potential clients in the design and implementation of programs. Specifically, programs should use presenters who are similar to the groups being served and formats that allow for dis\u00ad cussion of issues, and should include in\u00ad dividuals who have firsthand experience with the substances under consideration. Programs should not presume that the young user of alcohol and other drugs is responding irrationally to his environment. The Complex Nature of Prevention In the African-American Community These techniques represent the begin\u00ad ning of the development of a conceptual framework for prevention. They do not yet represent the complete and essential com\u00ad ponents of successful prevention in the African-American community. Frankly, however, the review of the field suggests that more systematic work has to be done in the evaluation of prevention programs before we can begin to identify the com\u00ad ponents of a satisfactory program from the perspective of African Americans. The Social and Cultural Characteristics of Prevention for African Americans Monroe-Scott and Miranda (1981) indicate that African people imbibed alcohol (and possibly other drugs) but use was not an oc\u00ad casion of sodal decay. What is important about prevention is the identification of \"nalural constraints\": not only was al\u00ad coholism frowned upon socially but, be\u00ad cause each person produced his own product, supplies were limited to what one could grow, with priority given to food crops. If the lessons implicit in this brief synopsis are understood correctly, they pro\u00ad vide a standard for designing prevention ef\u00ad forts consistent with the character of African-American peoples. The key words to be drawn from the Monroe-Scott and Miranda report are \"environment\" and \"control.\" The idea that has general applica\u00ad tion to current efforts at prevention is that the locus of control is within the sociocul\u00ad tural organizational structure and processes of the community. This means that the en\u00ad vironment that allowed drinking condoned the practice according to a pattern of rituals and daily routines. There was little need to exert external control because, in the context of vital personal and institutional relation\u00ad ships, the \"choice\" of excessive or abusive behavior was simply irrational from the individual's point of view. The analysis by Monroe-Scott and Miranda supports Dembo's perspective and the need for prevention programs to focus on the en-vironmental factors that determine the real world experiences of the adolescent.. The meaning of these analyses is that protective factors are within the community and that the prevention programs should increase the natural resilience and protective factors in the community, rather than seek to change arbitrarily some behavior of the tar\u00ad get population. Accordingly, prevention programs must be consistent with the culture of the target population. Nobles (in print) makes a conceptual distinction between culturally consistent and culturally legitimate. Cul\u00ad turally consistent means that the personnel and programmatic activity (e.g., behavior, values, attitudes, policies, practices, proce\u00ad dures) are congruent with the cultural sub\u00ad stance of the particular target population served. Culturally legitimate means that the program/ services must respect and reflect the image and interest of the people they are intended to serve. Culturally legitimate prevention services must be recognized and respected by the target population as well as acceptable by, and accountable to, their community. Prevention is an act of affirma\u00ad tion, not simply denialj it is holistic and not segmental. In other words, effective preven\u00ad tion activities should not split the world into parts such as envil'Onment, host, and agent, as in the public health model, but treat the whole life of the individual in the context of community. While it may be true that what con\u00ad stitutes legitimate prevention activity is a complex and unsettled matter, Milgram (1987) identified the pertinent questions: Prevention of what and for whom needs to be defined in a realistic fashion. Will the education program be designed to attempt to preVeJ;lt alcohol! drug use for life or until a certain age, to minimize risks related to use, to prevent alcohol! drug-related problems, to prevent socie\u00ad tal ills related to alcohol and drugs or to prevent alcohol/ drug dependency. A~'Teement is also necessary on the philosophical issues related to alcohol! drugs. Is alcohol accepted as part of 67 An AfrIcan-Centered Model of Prevention for AfrIcan-AmerIcan Youth at HIgh Risk American society? Are drugs and/ or which drugs are accepted for use by society? Is there a distinction between lov.-11sk and high risk drinking / drug made by adolescents? The thrust of lVUlgram's queries are at the heart of the matte;t'. Is it true that any drug use diminishes the quality of an ideal communal life? If the answer is in the affir\u00ad mative, is it right or necessary that a com\u00ad mu..mty should \"wage war\" (using current terminology) against itseli or its members to eliminate all use? The informaiion available does not allow defiIlitive replies. However, the tendency is to answer in the negative for both questions. The way of thinking that best complements Milgram's queries is that any prevention effort must invite, arid evolve from, community participation. This is no panacea, however, because it is likely that members of the cornmlli\"'1it'f will dis\u00ad agree or that dissent simply will not be tolerated. In addition, addiction that ap\u00ad pears to be roeted in the intimate workings of tlle human psyche or to be a product of the individual's cultural experiences is not easily amenable to coercive resolutions. Prevention specifically seeks to alter, modify, or replace those effects and their corollary predispositional factors that are harmful to the development of public life, such as drug use by minors, drug-related violence, or the disabling of the family as a consequence of addiction. Thus, a sophisti\u00ad cated prevention strategy must have the capability to thrive in an environment where there is disagreement over what role certain substances will play in the society. A Reassessment of Prevention Obviously, how one defines the nature of prevention efforts will determine the kinds of activities pursued as prevention. Underly\u00ad ing the process of prev('!ntion is a set of at\u00ad titudes toward both dr...:gs in general and specific drugs. From a prevention perspec\u00ad tive, what is first required is an appropriate, that is, more functional, definition of the 68 problem itself. In this regard it is an ad\u00ad vance to speak of AOD abuse and the fac\u00ad tors that predispose a community of individuals to adopt self-destructive behaviors. The perspective that most accurately reflects the reality of dependence experience treats abuse behaviors as symptoms of a deeper social malady-not as root causes in and of themselves. While there are undoubt\u00ad edly many paths to abuse, a cornmon thread that runs through many cases is the in\u00ad ability to reconcile individual social and psychological expectations with public realities. Nobles (1984) refers to Ulis aspect of addiction as a measure of society's \"coef\u00ad ficient of alienation\" and describes it thus: The degree to which one variable (Le., the meanmg of human being) is unre\u00ad lated to other variables (Le., the ex\u00ad perience of human beings) is a measure of the degree of alienation in the society. The \"coefficient of alienation\" is there\u00ad fore associated with the fundamental \"meaning\" of human being found in society and the degree to which a people's exper ~~nce is defined by (Le., congruent with) that meaning. This language helps us focus on socially systemic attributes rather than the specific and individual effects of addictive agents. It is important for us to note that this reassessment of prevention provides a dif\u00ad ferent framework for service delivery in that dedsiorunakers frequently pursue the issue of AOD abuse through paradigms that posit personal character flaws and individual weaknesses as the \"cause\" of dependence\u00ad related problems (Nobles 1984). The litera\u00ad ture reviewed indicates that the utility f)\u00a3 this paradigm as a tool for designing and implementing prevention programs is high\u00ad ly questionable and unlikely to produce ap\u00ad propriate behavioral changes. In the light of the literature review, there is a need for es\u00ad tablishing a more expansive and refined con\u00ad ceptual framework that would address the issue of prevention with a world view that can embrace and help discriminate between ------------------------ The Complex Nature of Prevention In the African-American Community competing attitudes. Failing to do this results in the interlocking of prevention ideas and attitudes with general attitudes about public behavior, which serves to fur\u00ad ther confuse the issue of prevention. For example, one of the barriers to an in\u00ad clusive and frank discussion of the role of al\u00ad cohol and other drugs in public life is the easy, though unwarranted, assumption that a community has no viewpoint other than what is popular. This produces such anomalies as select private organizations ad\u00ad vocating legalization of some drugs, with the remainder of the public either opposing them or remaining neutral. A natural conse\u00ad quence of this condition is that the channels of public communication become increasing\u00ad ly polarized. Loaded language is used to capture the hearts and minds of the public. Advocates of abstinence conjure up images of lung cancer and fried eggs for brains. Ci villibertarians bemoan the loss of the American Way and the rise of \"thought police\" or \"health police.\" Meanwhile ba1anc\\~l hrumony, and objectivity fall by the wayside. The energy and genuine goodwill of the public is frittered away by ceaseless conflict over what should be done about the problem. Unfortunately, the problem is never presented in a way that lends itself to thoughtful discussion, agreement, and mutually satisfying resolution. The better we understand the nature and scope of prevention programming as it occurs in the Mrican-Arnerican community the better able we are to create, identify, and choose among various strategies for preempting the debilitating effects of abuse behavior. According to Nobles (in press), all humans live between the interface of their concrete reality and their mass of subjective experiences (Le., culture). The result of this meeting between \"mind\" and llmatter\" is a sphere of comprehension or what he calls \"psy-::'hosphere.\" He goes on to say that in one's psychosphere, everything is not only perceived as connected, everything is connected. Accordingly, because the substance, subject and society are con\u00ad nected, interactive and mutually inter-dependent, \"optimal prevention\" efforts must deal with all of them simultaneously .... That the analysis by Nobles reinforces the need to expand the parameters of prevention to include other areas of poten\u00ad tial change or program development has been recognized for some time. According\u00ad ly, the scope of prevention programming, at least for Mricru1 Americans, must reach beyond the imposition of constraints or changing behavior of young people at risk. Nobles's theoretical notions of the existence of the psychosphere suggest a potentially important conceptualization for the preven\u00ad tion process. The existence of the psycho\u00ad sphere and the perceptual connectedness of elements suggests that prevention has to be holistic. It has to address host, environment, and agent Simultaneously. Consistent with this approach, the principal prevention ac\u00ad tion would create activities that overlap at the three different levels and simultaneous\u00ad ly enhance the individual's ability to negotiate his or her environment. This theoretical direction is consistent with Nobles's earlier work (1989) wherein he sug\u00ad gests that \"community inoculation would be a prevention strategy driven by the goal of introducing' something' into the target community which is designed to stimulate the community's own production of its in\u00ad digenous protective agents and processes.\" Prevention activities, in this view, would seek to intluence the external conditions that define the world as the user perceives it. In this way, Mrican-American preven\u00ad tion moves beyond the narrow issue of AOD abuse as an individual phenomenon. Within this expanded view of preven\u00ad tion, the critical question becomes more than how to change attitudes but also how to create a network of familial and institu\u00ad tional relationships that proscribe initial abuse and thereby create conditions where resistance to abuse is sustainable. The impli\u00ad cation drawn from the literature is that the point of attack most effective for preventive intervention is the relationship behveen the individual and the functional elements (Le., 69 ----- ------------------~------------------------ An African-Centered Model of Prevention for African-American Youth at Hlgh,Rlsk people and institutions) in his or her en\u00ad vironment, and not the drug itself. From this vantage point, the prolifera\u00ad tion of abuse behaviors is seen as indicative of a fundamental crisis in human social development. Merely changing attitudes without changing underlying conditions produces a form of alienation that, in itself, contributes to dissatisfaction with one's self and thereby may even contribute to continu\u00ad ing escapist impulses. Any substantial change in privately held attitudes requires an equivalent material change in the environment that mirrors and supports that new way of thinking. As described by Nobles and colleagues (1987) the roots of this process of change begin with the most elementary and vital requirement for human development and transformation-\u00b7\u00ad the family. The authors posit that in order for a people to maintain themselves as a so\u00ad cial group they must successfully satisfy life's imperatives (e.g., sustenance, security, sex, shelter). A family system that cannot negotiate these basic requirements lacks the basic tools to produce a human being whose personality is positive and intact. It follows logically that the culture of such families over time will disintegrate. The individual will be left with no means for developing (or even knowing) how to interact with others in ways that strengthen a sense of ef\u00ad ficacy, connection to others, and durability. This theoretical orientation suggests that in\u00ad struction prevalent in most prevention References Beaulieu, M.A., and Jason, L.A.

Ohio State University: 70 programs, which often fails to reach the deep structures of social life, will simply ex\u00ad hibit onI y minor idiosyncratic success. The power of the theoretical formulation by Nobles and colleagues for successful preven\u00ad tion is that it directs the prevention process to recognize that, by redefining the pro\u00ad cesses by which we give meaning to life, the prevention efforts will permanently effect the desired change in individual demand for AOD substances or abuse behaviors. To a great extent, current research has failed to understand prevention from an African-American perspective. What is known has to take the form of theory be\u00ad cause there are very few cases of docu\u00ad mented or proven African-American prevention activities. The purpose of prevention is to define and execute all those activities that prepare people for clear, effec\u00ad tive, and accepted roles that meet material and spiritual needs. The focus of prevention activities, therefore, is not just individuals but the social institutions that create and nurture the individual. The enduring prob\u00ad lem of abuse behaviors is significantlyre\u00ad lated to the failure of current social structures to meet these needs. We end as we began. Prevention is much talked about but there is little systematic evidence of what constitutes effective prevention in African-American communities. Perhaps this will be the first step in a more rigorous attempt to acquire knowledge through the evaluation of prevention service delivery. Center for Human Resource Research.

Goddard Several scholars have called into ques\u00ad tion the ability of traditional attempts at treatment and/or prevention to affect the alcohol and other drug (AOD) abuse prob\u00ad lem in the Black community. Swift and Beverly (1985) suggested that attempts to treat Black patients through outreach programs designed for, and primarily used by, the White community have been largely unsuccessful. Similarly, Nobles (1984) has indicated that in the treatment of adolescent alcoholism and drug abuse, the scientific literature reflects the assumption that adolescent AOD users have a personal \"character flaw\" because of their genetic make-up, sociohistorical background, or dividual psychological construct. It is ac\u00ad cordingly the \"correction of the character flaw\" that becomes the target of clinical in\u00ad tervention. In challenging this concep\u00ad tualization of the problem, Nobles (1984) further noted that adolescent AOD use may be more symptomatic of the crises found in contemporary American culture that results in personal and self-conscious alienation. This sense of alienation can be related to the feelings of loss of self-control and the search for meaning in life expressed by adolescents. King (1985) also has suggested that alco\u00ad holism in the Black community is sympto\u00ad matic of the failure of individuals to obtain a sense of balance in negotiating the irre\u00ad ducible subsystems of human interaction in 73 An African-Centered Model of Prevention for African-American Youth at High Risk which they find themselves. Thus, treat\u00ad ment of the alcohol problem without ad\u00ad dressing the wider issue of the individual's viability in society, which is the traditional orientation to prevention and/or treatment services, is unlikely to produce lasting change. The underlying problem of why one begins to drink and to engage in self\u00ad destructive behavior, according to King, necessarily needs to be addressed before the syrnptom-alcoholism-can be cured. Akbar (1984) has suggested that in the process of restoring mental order the in\u00ad dividual has to become aware-that is, pos\u00ad sess awareness is the focus for self-discovery, self-acceptance, self-help, and, ultimately, self-preservation. Similarly, Kagan and Knight (1979) have in\u00ad dicated that self-esteem in children is par\u00ad tially a function of the extent to which children live up to their cultural nonns. Kaplan and colleagues (1983) also have found that the ability of the individual to overcome negative life events is enhanced by the nature and meaning of family sup\u00ad port and the substitutability of supportive relationships. Evidence from social learning theory also indicates the need to match the client with the therapist or service provider. Brown and Inouye (1978), in a series of ex\u00ad periments, were able to document the criti\u00ad cal role that vicarious learning plays in the motivational and attitudinal structures of Black adolescents. The basic premise of the Brown (1979) experiments is that to the ex\u00ad tent that people perceive a \"model\" as being similar to themselves (i.e., attribute similarity), they are equally likely to view their own behavioral outcomes as similar to or likely to be the same as those incurred by the model (Le., outcome similarity). At\u00ad tribute similarity operates as an especially critical factor in determining the impact of vicarious experience with Black and minority children. TItUS, in the case of a prevention/intervention program, to the ex\u00ad tent that the Black youth at risk identify with teachers, youth workers, and so on, they are more likely to model their behavior after them (that is, more likely not to engage in dysfunctional social behavior). 74 In addressing the debilitating effect that AOD abuse has on the Black community, it is apparent that a concerted effort is re\u00ad quired on a variety of levels. There is no single magic cure for the problems created by AOD abuse. However, the primary em\u00ad phasis is on the need to develop primary prevention activities that provide people with the capacity to withstand pressures to engage in AOD abuse. There is also the need for treatment and intervention ac\u00ad tivities that provide hands-on services to people already engaged in AOD abuse. Finally, there is the need for advoca.:y ef\u00ad forts that attempt to detennine public policy on zoning policies, land use patterns, and so forth. Primary prevention encompasses those activities directed at specifically identified vulnerable groups at high risk within the community for whom measures can be taken to enhance their level of positive functioning (Goldson 1977). The ultimate goal of primary prevention is to increase people's capacity for dealing with crises and for taking steps to improve their own lives. Consequently, primary prevention by defini\u00ad tion must concern itself with the social development of the individual and provide the individual with the skills necessary to function at an optimal level in the SOciety. That is, the goal of primary prevention is to facilitate the achievement of personal, social (interpersonal), and functional competence. Two general strategies can be utilized in primary prevention. The first, focusing on the individual, attempts to strengthen in\u00ad dividual capacities and/or decrease in\u00ad dividual vulnerabilities. The second strategy focuses on the societal level and at\u00ad tempts environmental modifications through planned social change. It has be\u00ad come apparent that both strategies have to be used in a comprehensive model if there is to be success in prevention activities. The Mrican-Arnerican family is a term used to characterize a group of people who may be biologically and spiritually bonded or connected and whose members' relations to each other and the outside world are governed by a particular set of cultural belic:fs, historical experiences, and be\u00ad havioral practices. It is important to note that this analysis does not suggest the exist\u00ad ence of a single, monolithic type of Black family. In fact, Billingsley (1968) has iden\u00ad tified 11 different types of Black families, based on the presence or absence of children and relatives in the household. There is diversity in Black families; how\u00ad ever, within that diversity one is able to ob\u00ad serve a comprehensive common cultural theme that historically characterizes Black families. That is, the substance, the essence of family is the same; the form the fanilly takes is different based on the concrete ex\u00ad periences of its members. In terms of cultural beliefs, the root foundation of the African-American family can be found in the African ontological prin\u00ad ciple of consubstantiation, which asserts that the essence of all things is of the same sub\u00ad stance (Le., spirit, energy). In effect we are, therefore, one because we essentially have the same spirit. In terms of historical ex\u00ad perience(s), beginning with the New World American slave trade, the salient and most constant character of our experience in America is racist degradation, political domination, and economic exploitation. In terms of the behavioral practices, Black human dynamics can be characterized by the synthesis of African retentions and/or residuals and the creative ability to invent something new. Hence, the IIAfrican\u00ad American family\" is a group of people who (1) are bonded by their racial and cultural heritage; (2) believe that \"something\" con\u00ad nects us together (Le., consubstantiation); (3) are shaped by a peculiar experience out of which was forged the amazing grace and stature to constantly and collectively resist societal injustice and inequity; and (4) are capable of expressing the will and intent to openly negotiate and attempt to change the real world mnditions of the times. In effect, these are the things that Black families, regardless of status or condition, have in common. Although these features are com\u00ad mon to .A.1rican-American families, it is im\u00ad portant to note that these features are not all Natural ResIstors In AOD Abuse Prevention present in the African-American family today. In light of these ideas, it is clear that the family struch.!res most resistant to dysfunc\u00ad tional (self-destructive) behavior (AOD abuse) are consistent with, and predictable from, the u'aditional African-American culture. The traditional African-American fami\u00ad ly process is the affinl1ation of life with a model of family functioning that is child centered. By this is meant that the purpose of the African-American family focused on, even required, the presence of children, and that the family did whatever was necessary to sustain life and the continuation of the family spirit. The family exists for the growth and development of children rather than the self-actualization of the adult mem\u00ad bers of the unit. The functional African\u00ad American family is characterized as having an extended family with sig\u00ad nificant male participation; having a strong emphasis on parenting strategies that reflect the cultural themes of the sense of excellence and the sense of appropriateness; having a value orientation that is a reflection of the Afrocentric principle of maat (truth, justice, righteousness, propriety, harmony, balance, and order); having childrearing practices geared to developing a sense of humaneness in children and emphasizing responsibility for the family unit; and having a strong sense of spirituality based on the belief in a Supreme Being that manifests itself in the way of life of African Americans and is reflected in the kinds of connections between and among African Americans that indicate they are of the same substance. Another factor that enabled African- American families to resist AOD use or abuse is the practice of adult responsibility, or community control, for the welfare and well-being of the children of the community. 75 An AfrIcan-Centered Model of Prevention for Afrlcal'l-Amerlcan Youth at HIgh Risk That is, in the traditional African-American community the social organization of families reveals a close network of relation\u00ad ships within and between families not neces\u00ad sarily related by blood. This principle of inc1usivity is functional inasmuch as these \"social relatives\" or para-kin are almost in\u00ad distinguishable from biological and/ or legal relatives, and plays a major role in the main\u00ad temmce of social order in the community. Children in the traditional community belonged to the community, and any adult member of the traditional community could, and did, discipline any child who vio\u00ad lated,in whatever form, the values and mores of the community. Thus, every adult in the traditional culture assumed respon\u00ad sibility for every child and in the exercise of that responsibility was able to maintain so\u00ad cial control. Generally, childrearing practices in the Black community were characterized by family orientation and unconditional love that place a special emphaSiS on strong ties and respect for elders, and see the child as possessing a natural goodness. Children were socialized to assume significant responsibilities for the family's well-being and to express mature social behavior at an early age. Older siblings were responsible for taking care of younger ones, and all shared in responsibility for the family by perfom1ing important chores. Self-reliance and responsible behavior were inculcated earl y on in Black children as a reflection of the cultural world view that suggests that all is interconnected, and thus everyone has a part to play in the welfare and survival of the whole. On a cogpitive level, the respon\u00ad sibilities assumed within the household by children reinforced their self-esteem and provided appropriate skills to negotiate the adult world and the wider social system. In performing these duties African\u00ad American children were able to develop a sense of competence and self-confidence. These two notions were taught to the very young to foster the belief in the children that they were masters of their own des\u00ad tinies. Therefore, children w\",:,e strong 76 enough to withstand pressures to engage in AOD abuse behavior. The cultural themes of the sense of excel\u00ad lence and the sense of appropriateness be\u00ad came the framework for child development in the traditional African-American family. The sense of excellence encouraged the child to strive for perfection while impart\u00ad ing their own personal style in behavior. The sense of excellence, with a strong work ethic and orientation toward achievement, enabled Black people to succeed in every walk of life to which doors were open. In ad\u00ad dition, the sense of appropriateness provides the framework in which behavior is governed by notions of formality, civility, and deference. These cultural themes created behavioral modalities that indicated to Black people that some things (i.e., AOD use/abuse) were not acceptable within the family structure. These modalities, were, in tum, reinforced and supported by the cul\u00ad tural practices of the community (e.g., adult responsibility and community control). The traditional African-American fami\u00ad ly performed five important functions that, upon completion, promoted a sense of well\u00ad being in children and, thereby, minimized the risk of engaging in self-destructive be\u00ad havior (e.g., AOD use/abuse). The first was the legitimation of being\u00ad ness through which the family provided the children with a sense of identity and of belonging to something-the grounding that enabled the children to understand and recognize their connection to something greater than themselves, to understand responsibility for self, family, and com\u00ad munity. Second was the provision of codes of conduct by which the family gave the children a set of guiding principles-an ethos-for determining the way in which they should live their lives. The codes of conduct enabled the recognition of the boundaries of acceptable behavior beyond which one could not step, and established a strong sense of self-discipline and self-con\u00ad trol. The third, elasticity of boundaries, al\u00ad lowed the children to express their unique characteristics without being negatively sanctioned. This function allowed growth and development, expression of differences, testing different modes of behavior, and development of a sense of independence and individual identity while, at the same time, it expressed the fundamental same\u00ad ness among family members. It is through the provision of information or knowledge, the fourth function, that the children corne to understand the context in which they lived and must operate. The family allowed the children to be able to discern between fact and fantasy and to make appropriate decisions, based on the codes of conduct, about their own behavior. Last, the media\u00ad tion of concrete conditions provided the children with the necessary guidance to negotiate their environment and enabled them to develop a sense of security.

Natural Resistors In AOD Abuse Prevention strengths are those traits that facilitate the ability of the family to meet the needs of its members and the demands made upon it by systems outside the family unit. Its strengths, as outlined by Hill, are (1) a strong orientation toward work, (2) a strong orientation toward achievement, (3) a strong sense of spirituality, (4) strong family ties, and (5) adaptability of family roles. It is clear that these family strengths represent an important and critical ingredient in the lives of Black individuals. They enabled the Black family to deal ,vith the harsh realities of survival in a society that was inherently unjust, to ease the psychological trauma as\u00ad sociated with daily life and hence to avoid the kinds of \"escape mechanisms\" that AOD use/abuse represent. The internal for\u00ad titude of the Black family enabled its mem\u00ad bers to survive without succumbing to self-destructive behavior.

Examination of those historical traditions that have con\u00ad tributed to a nation's rise and fall give a people the impetus to perpetuate valuable traditions and do away with destructive ones. A review of African and African\u00ad American history reveals that the quality of spirituality, that is, perpetual adherence to intensely spiritual values held by Africans and African Americans, has proven useful in the struggle to survive and triumph over hostile forces that should have otherwise threatened their existence (Felder Toldson 1982). It is believed that through examination of the use of spirituality in African and African\u00ad American history, prevention strategiSts could gain helpful answers about the development of an effective Afrocentric model for alcohol and other drug (AOD) use prevention for youth at high risk. The following discussion involves such an examina tion. In reviewing spirituality's use in African and African-A .. nerican history, the resulting implications for prevention strategists are discussed in light of the work 79 An African-Centered Model of Prevention for African-American Youth at High Risk group's effort to develop adequate strategies for prevention of AOD use among African-American youth at risk. At the con\u00ad clusion of this discussion, practical steps to be taken by prevention strategists are proposed to help ensure the incorporation of a spiritual awareness and enrichment component in the Afrocentric model for AOD abuse prevention. Tracing the History of Spirituality's Use by African and African-American Ancestors A Look at the African Worldview The African world view begins with the belief that there is a God who, through many manifestations, is revealed as Creator of and Cause for all that exists. This Supreme Being, termed \"God,\" is viewed by most Africans as being both transcendent and imminent-that is, both near and far all at the same time (Karenga 1989; Mbiti 1970; Parrinder 1976). It is because God exists that Africans believe \"we\" exist ... and Parrinder 1976). God's presence in all Creation is reason enough for Africans to live in harmony with nature and fellow human beings. Held sacred is the commitment to wholesome family and community living; such commit\u00ad ment is expressed through the mechanisms of ritual ceremonies such as rites of passage, corporate worship, and marriage ceremonies (Karenga 1989; Mbiti 1970). Respect for the collective worth of the community influences the African's convic\u00ad tion to take no credit as an individual for ac\u00ad complishments and achievements in life. Instead, credit for such successes are given to God, one's ancestors, one's community, and one's family (Asante 1989; Karenga 1989; Mbiti 1970). This sacred treatment of God, ancestors, and fellow humans is born 80 out of the view that spiritual forces bind God and people together so that all exist\u00ad ence is one; all existence comprises a collec\u00ad tive and unified whole so that \"I cannot do without you nor can you do without me\" (Grier and McCobbs 1971; Karenga 1989). The world view seen in the African's sacred treatment of God, ancestors, and all of Creation is clearly and intensely spiritual. This world view informs prevention strate\u00ad gists that reality originates and operates in the spiritual dimension. Ufe events such as birth, death, puberty, and even harvest and other seasonal events are viewed as mere expres\u00ad sions or manifestations of these invisible, spiritual realities (Karenga 1989; Parrinder 1976). The African worldviewwould then suggest that all behaviors, including AOD abuse, are spiritual manifestations or mis\u00ad guided attempts at spiritual expression. This can be explained by examining the difference between the European and African modes of thought and expression. \"The European mind tends toward the literal, while African cogni\u00ad tive structures are more heavily expressed as symbolic. African culture is replete with sym\u00ad bols and symbolic behavior that reflect a religious world view. If these symbols are ap\u00ad proached literally, African behavior makes no sense, and we become primitives who act like children\" (Richards 1989). Why give God credit for a task you have just completed? Be\u00ad cause doing so acknowledges Him as the source of the talent, resources, wisdom, ener\u00ad gy, and opportunity to perform the task. \"African world view is characterized by Unity, Harmony, Spirituality, and Organic In\u00ad terrelationship. The European worldview is characterized by Compartmentalization (isola\u00ad tion, separation), Control (power relation\u00ad ships), Conflict (tension), Materialism, and Mechanical Relationship\" (Richards 1989). These are values diametrically opposed to the African ethos. Therefore, AOD use by African\u00ad American youth can be viewed as a substitute coping mechanism for a missing spiritual ethos. An African worldview would then sug\u00ad gest to strategists that effective prevention of AOD use among African-American youth at high risk necessarily incorporates mechanisms designed to heighten spiritual aware;ness and sensitivity among African\u00ad Amencan youth and their families. A review of the historical mechanisms that were used to this end are given attention in here. Historical Mechanisms Found in Ancestral Traditions to Perpetuate Spiritual Awareness Dispositions of faith, hope, love, and duty were promoted and reinforced in the an\u00ad cestral traditions as well as with our more immediate elders. This spiritual ability was inculcated by personal and social rituals that celebrated any and every event sig\u00ad niiicant to individual, family, and com\u00ad munity life. Events celebrated included b~thJ death, puberty, and marriage ... even ram, harvests, and i:he like (Parrinder 1976). The corresponding celebrations for these events were designed to promote and/ or reinforce their significance in the minds of African people (Grier and Iv;<:\u00ad Cobbs 1971; Parrinder 1976; Pasteur and Toldson 1982). A brief discussion is given here about three of these Significant African and African-American rituals: rites of pas\u00ad sage, corporate and individual worship, and the process of modeling and mentoring (eldership) that gave credence to the reverence for African elders and ancestors as the manifestation of the spiritual bond and continuity. When the life of the community is threatened, ritual is used to provide a sense of order, which enables commwuty mem\u00ad ~ers to deal wi~ th~r problems in a posi\u00ad tive manner. RituallS psychologically healthy and allows for constructive release of potentially destructive tensions and emo\u00ad tions. African diasporic ritual drama in North America began with the hush har\u00ad bors, night sings, and prayer meetings, Spirituality In the African-American Community which were the forerwmers of the Black church service, lithe penultimate expression of formalized African Diasporic Ritual Drama in North America\" (Richards 1989). Rites of Passage Every significant stage of life was marked by a rite of passage indicating mastery of a Rarticular level of life. Birth, puberty, mar\u00ad nage, and death were especially significant \"moments\" in lif~, and the rite associated with each of these held special spiritual significance. The ceremonies were aimed at celebrating the spiritual and physical trans\u00ad formation and transition of the African youth from the unborn (invisible) to the born (visible), childhood to adulthood from . ' smgleness to marriage, and from life to afterlife. Rites of passage served as social me0anism~ for sensitizing participants to theIr God-gIven call to confident, com\u00ad petent, and conscientious living. The rites signified the cultivation of those qualities that brought efficacy to African youth in facing and resolving life challenges (Par\u00ad rinder 1976). Historically, the backbone of African\u00ad American religious organization is the procef3s of initiation, training, and ritual throu~~ which.novices g~knowledgeof the ;pmt and ntual practice that enable functioning effectively in society. Rites-of\u00ad passage ceremonies are a source of affirma\u00ad tion for the young and provide the community with the opportunity to express love, pride, and respect for its youth. Through rites of passage the young learn that there is always a \"correct path ... and in the event they make a wrong turn .. . they have a community that values them as members and will help them find the way back\" (Warfield-Coppock 1990). ''We come from a culture of tremendous order, which provided us with a viable belief system, and whir.h guided behavior and moral inter\u00ad relationship .... We corne from a morally ordered, spiritual universe, where the 81 An African-Centered Model of Prevention for African-American Youth at High Risk practical business of life, where science and technology, were always grounded within a sacred and religious framework\" (Richards 1989). Incorporated in contemporary rites-of-passage training agendas are areas of educational preparation suggested by Moore and others (1987): (1) family history, (2) sex education, (3) history of our people, (4) spirituality/community spirit, (5) taking care of self, (6) housek.eeping/finances, (7) assertiveness/leadership, (8) values clarifica\u00ad tion/ future planning, (9) time management/ organization skills, and (10) art and dance. The rites-of-passage rituals signify the intentional cultivation of \"spiritual qualities\" that can facilitate proper decision\u00ad making and natural resistors to negativity among African-American youth as they face the present temptation to resort to AOD use to cope with a hostile, racist environment. Prevention strategists are, therefore, ad\u00ad vised to look at rites-of-passage rituals as a way to facilitate and record the develop\u00ad ment of confidence, competence, and con\u00ad sciousness among today's African-American youth at high risk. Corporate and Individual Worship Another ritual frequently found in African\u00ad American tradition is the ceremony of cor\u00ad porate and individual worship. Spiritual awareness and vibrancy were sustained among African Americans through par\u00ad ticipation in community and individual wor\u00ad ship ceremonies. These ceremonies always carried with them the quality of \"soul\" unique to African people (Grier and Mc\u00ad Cobbs 1971i Parrinder 1976i Pasteur Dating back to the ancient \"rain dance,\" a ceremony conducted by African priests at the beginning of the rainy season to invoke God's blessing of rain upon the agrarians in the upcoming season, Africans have historically engaged in high\u00ad spirited, energetic, musical, emotional, and rhythmic ceremonies of worship to God (Parrinder 1976i Pasteur and Toldson 1982). 82 The event of such worship served several purposes. First, th~ worship ceremony kept the participant in touch with and aware of the Creator and the Creator's will. Second, in creating an atmosphere of heightened spiritual awareness, the worship ceremony reinforced in the African's mind the existence of the relationship between the participant and the Creator. Third, the emo\u00ad tional, energetic expression involved in African-American worship provided oppor\u00ad tunity for cathartic release for the par\u00ad ticipant that restored mental health and balance in face of pressures found, par\u00ad ticularly among slave ancestors. Fourth, the worship ceremony enhanced communion among African and African-American brothers and sisters so that oneness of pur\u00ad pose and aim were a sustained reality among community members. Such an out\u00ad come manifested in the African American's spiritual transcendence over the distressful life-threatening opposition (Grier Cobbs 1971i Pasteur and Toldson 1982). Clearly, African-American history has shown how the \"church\" experience ha, served as a source for direction and inspira\u00ad tion when other mechanisms failed in times of peril (Davis 1986i Eng et al. 1985; Grier and McCobbs 1971i Pasteur and Toldson 1982). In this regard, prevention strategists are advised to develop methods for the res\u00ad toration of tlle use of corporate, as well as in\u00ad dividual, worship to heighten spiritual awareness among African-American youth as a viable prevention strategy. Restoration, revival, reclamation, and re\u00ad creation of spiritually oriented rituals like corporate worship as well as rites of pas\u00ad sage would prove useful to prevention strategists in deterring African-American youth at high risk from AOD use. Some con\u00ad temporary practices to add to the repertoire of traditional rituals could be Sl.\u00b7:'\u00b7itual en\u00ad richment support groups, retre'~b, and scrip\u00ad ture study from an Afrocentric prevention perspective. Such practices could be defined and developed in future discussions. ----<- ------------------ Eldership 10 Models and mentors were adult members of the African family and community. It was elders, in particular, who claimed responsibility for rearing and guidhlg the younger generation toward wholesome and effective living (Karenga 1989; Mbiti 1970; Warfield-Coppock 1990). The vehicles of modeling and mentoring are viewed as mechanisms traditionally used by Africans to heighten spiritual awareness because these mechanisms were the daily means by which values in life arid the treatment of God, others, nature, and knowledge were in\u00ad stilled in African-American youth. In Africarl-American history, the Black church has not only been a source of models and mentors, but a training ground. Pastors, deacons, youth leaders, and church mothers all took on and accepted the responsibility of being positive role models and spiritual leaders.in the community. Modeling and mentoring did not mere\u00ad ly entail teaching by talk but also by action. Hence elders, arid even ancestors, were not mere figureheads in the Africarl mind; rather, they represented qualities of in\u00ad tegrity, uprightness, wholesomeness, and reverence for God--qualities that demanded the respect and reverence of the Africarl youth (Karenga 1989; Mbiti 1970; character qualities, mentors in\u00ad creased their impact and influence on African youth so that integrity, courage, and faith were more readily perpetuated among youth the task of prevention of AGD use among African-American youth demands the identification and utilization of models and mentors, be they parents, aunts and uncles, ministers, laity, profes\u00ad sionals, or fellow youth and young adults. Spirituality In the African-American Community Such model individuals should be sought out and trained for the task of prevention at whatever cost. Resources that put prevention strategists in touch with such individuals should be tapped as much as possible, for the task is great and the laborers are few. Prevention service providers must find the natural helpers in the African-American community and use their talents and abilities to become effective in prevention activities. The African-American church is a viable unit for the initiation of a spiritual aware\u00ad ness and enrichment component of the Afrocentric model for AGD abuse preven\u00ad tion. This position is taken here in spite of the African-American church's p~esent record of proselytizing community mem\u00ad bers while simultaneously failing to con\u00ad tribute to the enhancement of those members' quality of life. The church posses\u00ad ses a wealth of potential for advancing AGD abuse strategies Lrt the African\u00ad American community. Consistent with their philosophy, prevention strategists have his\u00ad torically looked to community resources that by nature serve as sources of strength for the community in advancing the cause of prevention (Davis 1986; Eng et at 1985; Felder 1989; Karenga 1989). The African\u00ad American church is such a resource. Historically, the church has cham\u00ad pioned the interests and concerns of African Americans, providing direction and correc\u00ad tion, influence and encouragement, ad\u00ad vocacy, hope, and even representation in the general society (Eng et al. 1985; Karenga 1989). In the absence of wealth, formal train\u00ad ing, and political clout, the African\u00ad American church has historically served as un alternative locus of positive identity and influence for African Americans (Eng et al. 1985). The abundance of potential believed here to exist in the African-American 10 Eldership, rather than mentoring and modeling, is the preferred term. Mentoring is the responsibility of elders .. and modeling becomes the task of youth. 83 --------------------------------------- An African-Centered Model of Prevention for African-American Youth at High Risk church for advancing prevention strategies lies in its ability to excite the common spirituality and, through it, bind a diversity of African-American people, lifestyles, socioeconomic conditions, ages, sexes, and even political differences together for a pur\u00ad pose that is primarily spiritual in nature (Davis 1986). In addition, on the practical side, oftentimes the church possesses well-defined networks that would allow prevention strategists to tie into a large num\u00ad ber of resources; e.g., special interests groups, ministerial groups, and denominational alliances. These networks offer to preven\u00ad tion experts expanded accessibility to people, particularly those with the desire and potential to be mentors and models for African-American youth; some prevention experts from other disciplines ll have, in fact, made use of that very resource. Pointers for Using the African-American Church in Advancing Prevention Strategies for African\u00ad American youth at High Risk After this brief review of the African\u00ad American church's usefulness in advancing strategies for the prevention of AOD use among African-American youth, it is ap\u00ad propriate to present strategies to accomplish t.'Us task effectively. .. Prevention strategists should establish relations with pastors of churches who demonstrate the potential for urban mindedness by responding to preven\u00ad tion concerns. Prevention experts should then form partnerships with those pastors in developing prevention networks within the respective churches (the NIH approach). .. Prevention strategists should be avail\u00ad able to the ministries as a resource for providing continual technical assistance. .. Prevention strategists should train cllurch leaders to educate youth mem\u00ad bers in Afrocentric philosophy, thus helping the leaders to incorporate the African cultural piece into the religious teachings and to implement rituals like rites of passage and kwanzaa. .. Prevention strategists should respect the identified ministry's ability to address the young members' risk factors in a manner consistent with the respective denominational belief while maintain\u00ad ing a proper application of African philosophy (Asante 1989; Davis 1986). Conclusion After reviewing spirituality's use in both African and African-American history, dis\u00ad cussing the implications of history fer prevention strategists, and identifying tenta\u00ad tive steps toward incorporating a spiritual awareness and enrichment component in the Afrocentric model of AOD abuse prevention, one discovers a challenge con\u00ad fronting prevention strategists. It involves facilitating a process of restoration and revival in the African-American com\u00ad munity. Specifically, it is the dual challenge to restore t.1.ose historical mechanisms that 11 One such group is the National Institutes of Health, a division of the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS). 'This group sponsored the Hypertension Reduction Project (DHHS Secretary's Report 1986), a project in which identified members of African-American churches allover the country were trained to monitor the blood pressure of other members on a regular basis. In addition, health professionals were (are) authorized by partidpating pastors to give ''hypertension awareness\" talks to the respective congregation during worship services and at conferences. The present reduction of hypertension among African Americans in urban communities has been attributed, in part, to the success of this church-based prevention strategy (DHHS Secretary's Report 1986). Other church-based projects that have belm initiated within the past two decades are the Congress of National Black O\\urches' Anti-Drug Campaign in Washington, D.C., and the North Carolina Wellness prevention project directed by Dr. Eugenia Eng of the Department of Health Education, School of Public Health in Otapel Hill, North Carolina (Eng et al. 1985). 84 kept spiritual values and morals alive among African people and, equally, to revive the spiritual consciousness of African Americans, a consciousness once so power\u00ad ful in the African-American community. The pressure for African and African Americans to conform to the lifestyle and vice of negative forces is not new, nor is the presence of oppression. What is a relatively new phenomenon, however, is the willing\u00ad ness of African Americans to give in to those forces by conforming. Materialism, capitalism, evolutionism, racism, and extreme individualism are all products of the Westernized system to which African Americans have been bound for the duration of their history. Traditional\u00ad ly, African Americans resisted such con\u00ad formity, choosing instead to cleave to a higher order of existence, of integrity and strong character, an order that offered spiritual and mental freedom even in face of physical bondage. \"Before I be a slave, I be buried in my grave and go horne to my Lord and be free.\" Today some African Americans have replaced spiritual victory with materialistic defeat by accepting the enslavement to Western philosophy: ''If you can't beat 'ern, join 'ern.\" Attitudes of hedonism, dog eat dog, and an eye for an eye now prevail in the African-American community.

Adults have in many ways aban\u00ad doned their responsibility to be models and mentors to the next generation. The proliferation of AOD abuse and related be\u00ad havior is in fact suggested by the erosion of traditional African values in the African\u00ad American community. Therl;.! must be a restoration and revival of values that were once treated as impor\u00ad tant-values of respect, love, dignity, and in\u00ad tegrity. These very qualities were once valued among African Americans. Now they m us t be the necessary ingredients pos\u00ad sessed by African-American youth if the goal of deterring youth at high risk from AOD use is to be achieved. The mission behind the task of develop\u00ad ing an African-Centered Model for AOD Abuse Prevention Among African\u00ad American Youth at High Risk is unques\u00ad tionablya spiritual one. The prevention strategist is primarily challenged to ac\u00ad complish the task in a manner consistent with the truth behind that mission. Incor\u00ad porating a spiritual awareness and enrich\u00ad ment component in the model that uses spiritual resources presently available in the African-American community, as well as those drawn from history, is the means to accomplish the mission and the task with maximum success.

Chapter 9 An Afrocentric Intervention Strategy Leonard C. Long Th() experience o\u00a3 African-American } \"uth in America should have some\u00ad thing to contribute to any model of preven\u00ad hun. Although many models can and have been used as tools in the analysis of the Black youth experience, we will examine two models identified in the book Haroest\u00ad ing New Generations: The Positive Develop\u00ad ment of Black Youth, by Useni Eugene Perkins, and published in 1986. Perkins discusses the limitations in using the deficit and the bicultural Eurocentric models when analyzing African-American youth behavior. The deficit model begins with the con\u00ad cept of self-depreciation, and is charac\u00ad terized as genetically inferior, pathological (Blacks as a diseased culture), socially disad\u00ad vantaged, culturally deprived, and possess\u00ad ing a slave culture. For example, the term \"culturally deprived/' as defined in the deficit model in reference to low-income African-Americans, represents a total denial of the existence or value of African\u00ad American culture. From this perspective the culture is viewed as worthless, and by im\u00ad plication suggests that African-Americans are worthless. The Eurocentric deficit model is the most commonly used and the most devastating for African-American youth. The second model, the bicultural, creates self-diffusion and confusion. This model attempts to express the broad diver\u00ad sities in racial and ethnic groups, suggesting that they can all virtually survive in an in\u00ad tegrated society. The implication of this 87 An African-Centered Model of Prevention for African-American Youth at High Risk Eurocentric model is that Black people can maintain part of their own culture and at the same time take on the values of the dominant European culture. However, the bicultur~l model is characterized by slave culture, assimilation, subculture inferiority, and European (mainstream) domination and integration. When bicultural is referred to in this context, it is based on what Dr. Ella Bell, an organizational behaviorist at Yale University, has tenned bicultural stress. That is the psychological schism created when Blacks, in seeking to assimi\u00ad late, start to lose their own identity because of the alien roles they adopt to make it in the majority society. Since such role playing usually requires Black people to negate much of who they are, this self-negation leads to emotional conflict, and hence stress. W. E. B. DuBois diagnosed this phenomenon nearly 100 years ago when he wrote about there being two souls within Black folks-one white, one Black-warring with each other in a desperate need to be ac\u00ad cepted in White America. The bicultural model, in reality, does not acknowledge African culture as equal to other cultures, and still carries some of the characteristics of the deficit model. In summary, the deficit model that is based on self-depreciation views Black people as genetically inferior, socially disad\u00ad vantaged, culturally deprived, pathological, and possessing a slave culture. The bicul\u00ad tural model is based on a process of self\u00ad diffusion and is characterized by an emphasis on slave culture, assimilation, sub\u00ad culture inferiority, ethological modification, and European or mainstream domination. It is necessary to reiterate at this point that neither of these models acknowledges the existence of African culture nor does either one address the self-determination ex\u00ad hibited by Blacks throughout history or look at the collective Black sense of awareness. These models have been developed and created by scholars who have limited or no knowledge or understanding of Black be\u00ad havior. These two frames of reference il\u00ad lustrate how the Eurocentric framework 88 tends to result in an inappropriate, inac\u00ad curate, and negative perception for develop\u00ad ing prevention programs for African Americans. This is borne out clearly when we ex\u00ad amine the issue of the \"socialization\" of the Black you th implicit in these two models. Regardless of the theoretical models used, traditional socialization of Black youth in America must be viewed in its historic set\u00ad ting. The condition of the Black youth of today has been detennined by not only what has taken place, but what has been per\u00ad ceived as taking place in Black youth's en\u00ad vironment. When we examine some of the environmental characteristics described by Perkins (1986)-a hostile environment, a scientific colonialism, the institution of racism, the colonization of education, a colonized culture, the institution of street life-it is quite reasonable to understand cer\u00ad tain behavioral outcomes. Dr. Leon Ches\u00ad tang, a Black psychiatrist, writes, as quoted in Perkins (1986): Three conditions, socially detennined and institutionally the Black experience: social injus\u00ad tice, societal inconsistency and personal impotence. To function in the face of anyone of them does cruel and unusual violence to the personality. To function in the face of all three subjects the per\u00ad sonality to severe crippling or even destruction. These three conditions, however, confront the Black person throughout hi~ life, and they detem1ine his character dcyeliJpment. Dr. Carter G. Woodson (1933) states that the so-call:'!d modern education (colonized educatiGH) does others so much more good than it does the Negro, because it has been worked out in confonnity to the needs of those who have enslaved and oppressed weaker people. In a hostile environment the Black child must confront reality not only in tenns of race but also in terms of various il\u00ad legal, amoral, or violent events that may occur in his or her environment. -. --..,--In order to fully understand African\u00ad American youth's conditions, one must understand how they perceive their environ\u00ad ment and why certain behavioral patterns develop that may be self-destructive. The outcomes from the traditional models\u00ad deficit and bicultural-generally tend to be youth who are confused, have low self-es\u00ad teem and a depreciated character, and tend to cr:zage in reactive behavior. On the other hand, when the socializa\u00ad tion process (e.g., rites of passage) is ex\u00ad amined from an Afrocentric base or foundation we are able to recognize and identify different environmental charac\u00ad teristics and, therefore, different and posi\u00ad tive behavioral outcomes. When examining the socialization process from an Afrocentric perspective one is guided toward recognizing a supportive environ\u00ad ment, strong family units, and supportive 8econdary institutions (e.g., schools, churches). Close kinship bonds and the ex\u00ad tended family are directly traceable to the traditional African culture, which valued the group above the individual. The be\u00ad havioral outcome of this environment was youth that had a strong sense of discipline, well-defined roles in family and com\u00ad munity, a positive self-concept, and self\u00ad appreciation. The Afrocentric perspective yielded a collective self-realization and Black liberation. This perspective was also characterized by nationalism, a sense of collective consciousness, and emphasis on African culture and philosophy. Afrocentric models of prevention must be based on African philosophy, religion, psychology, culture, and the integration of these areas into the issue of Airican\u00ad American survival in the 1990s. In his book Afrocentricity, Molefi Kete Asante (1988) maintains that in order to develop an Afrocentric base, one first has to believe in the existence of an African cul\u00ad tural system, then juxtapose African and American ways, and, finally, recognize the An Afrocentric InteNentlon strategy values derived from the African-American experience. The knowledge, art, beliefs, and cus\u00ad toms transmitted among individuals of an ethnic group have long been recognized as significant determinants of the behavior and values of members of that group. The Afrocentric model provides three essential qUalities: a sense of identity, a sense of his\u00ad tory, and a sense of struggle. These qualities are necessary in developing a positive per\u00ad sonality. Perkins (1986) states that a knowledge and appreciation of one's true identity is paramount to the development of a positive personality; that a race without knowledge of its history is a race without understanding of its roots; and that we must teach Black youth how to struggle, what it actually is, and what it is not. As a result of their exposure to harsh conditions, African youth developed a great deal of strength and adaptability, which enables them to adjust to, and cope with, the world and, hence, to survive. When developing intervention strategies, it is necessary to look back and focus on the strengths of the youth that enabled survival despite the institution of slavery and the separation of farnily,12 Some of the tradition~ al strengths include the ability to adapt to an oppressive en\u00ad vironment without being debilitated; the ability to survive with little guidance from the family because of forced separation (although with excel~ lent guidance from the African\u00ad American community, e.g., the church, extended family); the desire to be free; a strong work orientation to assume ad ult responsibilities; respect for the elders; and 12 It is necessary to point out that it was Black people, not just youth who survived slavery. 89 An African-Centered Model of Prevention for African-American Youth at High Risk + an obedient attitude to further the welfare of everyone and not just the individual. Basically, the youth of today still have the first three strengths. However, the last three have been disregarded and need to be (re-)integrated into the minds of the youth. In recent years there has been the addition of two more strengths: a strong group orien\u00ad tation that places high value on peer relationships and manifests itself in the form of gang membership, and the ability to recover from setbacks and defeats. In the book Afrocentric Theory and Ap\u00ad plications: Adolescent Rites of Passage, Nsenga Warfield-Coppock (1990) concludes that the critical components of an Afrocentric model for prevention and intervention should in\u00ad clude the following: + deprogramming, reeducation, and train\u00ad ing, including manhood and woman\u00ad hood training; sex and family life education; fitness, health, hygiene, and nutrition; history and cultural rituals; educational reinforcement of basics; financial management; and spiritual enrichment + inter genera tional involvement and a council of elders to draw upon the ex\u00ad periences and advice of the other generations coordination of an intensive-care team of staff and resource professionals to as\u00ad sist families in crisis and provide intervention Other areas suggested for inclusion in the model are African-American history and culture, time management and organization\u00ad al skills, hygiene/ care and etiquette, housekeeping and finances, values clarifica\u00ad tion/ future planning, assertiveness and leadership, art and dance, and sex educa\u00ad tion (Moore et al. 1987). These components, along with the com\u00ad ponents of vocational exportation and the institution of the streets, are incorporated in a program that is being implemented in Dal- 9{) las, Texas, referred to as the Rites of Passage (ROP) (exhibit 1). The West Dallas Community Centers, Inc. (WDCC) Rites of Passage Project seeks to aid youths between the ages of 9 to 12 years in breaking the cycle of teenage preg\u00ad nancy, alcohol and other drug (AOD) abuse, criminal mischief, and possible undereduca\u00ad tion and/ or drop-out status. This project, in\u00ad corporated in the West Dallas Community in 1988, uses an Afrocentric and holistic ap\u00ad proach in building self-esteem, self-image enhancement, leadership development, and cultural inculcation. An Afrocentric approach, that is, where Africa is the center of study in its actual physical dimensions and the diaspora of its people, and in social, cultural, and spiritual concepts, has been instituted by the WDCC Rites of Passage. The project seeks to rees\u00ad tablish the ties between Africans and African Americans. Youths are taken through a study of African history, high\u00ad lighting great African kings and queens. Africa is viewed by the project's youth as the cradle of civilization. The young have studied Africa as the origin of architecture, hieroglyphics, monotheistic religion, astronomy, astrology, road and sewage sys\u00ad tems, mathematics,libraries, and maritime travel. Through this, the youth inherit a sense of a heightened self-image as they begin to identify with this continent of the ancient pyramids and fertile soils, and that yields vast amounts of diamonds and gold. Every workshop and session produces an African concept, whether it is bused on African ideas in economics, values, spirituality or sexuality, personal hygiene, or time management. Youth in the project are taught African rituals and chants, are in the process of learning Swahili, and are being introduced to African styles and dress. The Afrocentric approach provides the individual youth with a sense of belong\u00ad ing, self, and knowledge. The WDCC Rites of Passage Project not only adopted an Afrocentric approach, but also a process based on a holistic concept. This process deals with meeting physical, An Afrocentr!c Interventlon strategy mental, and spiritual needs. Projects and workshops deal with providing infonnation that accommodate the youths' physical, mental, and spiritual well-being. Youth par\u00ad ticipate in week-long camps and in workshops featuring specialists in their respective fields who impart important in\u00ad formation, which has a specific impact in that each youth is assigned a mentor who helps to educate and aid the youth in using these specialists' skills in real1i\u00a3e. These mentors, along with ROP staff, also work with the youths' parents. At least one hour per week is spent \\\\rith each parent in iden\u00ad tifying factors that may distract from the youth's growth and in seeking possible solu\u00ad tions to these factors. Parents are also in\u00ad volved in workshops and, through WDCC, participate in cultural events and activities in the community and throughout the city. Martial arts classes, cooking, and nutrition classes, presentations by health specialists, Exhibit 1 . West Dallas Community Centers, Inc. Rites of Passage Project Family History. This area encompasses the immediate family genealogy/history as well as the concept of the extended family or community. Parents are instrumental in su\u00ad pervising the data gathering for this area. Spiritual/Community Spirit. Without focusing on any specific religion, the initiates should gain an understanding of the concept of spirituality and how it continues to work in the lives of Africans and African Americans. African-American History and Culture. Initiates should have a basic understanding of the history and accomplishments of African leaders, heroes, and heroines. Time Management/Organization Skills. This area covers the cultural concepts of time as well as developing skills in managing time (the European concept) and organizing tasks. Taking Care of SelflEtiquette. This broad area covers personal care and hygiene and in\u00ad cludes nutrition, exercise, hair and nail care, use of cosmetics, dress, clothing, and so forth. Social '.lkills are also covered and can include introduction to home entertaining. Housekeeping/Finances. Initiates should receive a thorough understanding of the over\u00ad all management of the household. They should also understand economics in general and how to use money to maintain control of their lives or business in the African-American community. Values Clarification/Future Planning. This area covers the basic importance of under\u00ad standing one's values. Future planning is an exercise to assist initiates in establishing future goals and plans for achieving. Assertiveness/Leadership. This broad area covers the concepts and practices of leader\u00ad ship in general and in the African-American community, and encourages skill and assertiveness in attaining established goals. Arts and Dance. The initiates should have a basic understa..\"1ding of African influence in music and dance, and how they are of the people of the world with a special ap\u00ad preciation for both. Sex Education. This area focuses on information for and attitudes of the initiates on human sexuality. We suggest teaching this in more than one session with different health care representatives. Initiates should be in sessions that include parents. 91 An AfrIcan-Centered Model of Prevention for AfrIcan-AmerIcan Youth aj' HIgh Risk additional workshops in African history, spirituality, and self-esteem building will further aid in the project's holistic approach to resolving the detrimental spiral of social malady in African-American communities. Based on the Dallas experiences, it seems that the African-American church and community-controlled schools and agencies are the institutions and systems that have been the most responsive in meet\u00ad ing the needs of Black youth and their families. Youth and the community have responded best to the rites-of-passage inter\u00ad vention strategy. The staff of the program believe in its basic philosophy because it makes sense to them. Because staff believe in the rites of passage, they become its best advocates. Thus,it is seen as sincere when presented to the youth, parents, and/ or extended-family members. In addition, this References Asante, M.K. Afrocentricity. Trenton, King-McCreary, and Passage Munual for African-American Girls. New York: Stars Press, 1987. Perkins, U.

Both staff and clients become responsive because the program provides resocialization that in\u00ad eludes the healing process of collective and individual self-realization, reorientation to positive community values, and respon\u00ad sibility and development of culture identity and positive self-esteem. In completing the first year of the WDCC Rites of Passage Project, definite changes in the youths' attitudes, morals, and perceptions of self have been noticed. It is felt, and will be shown through evalua\u00ad tion and assessment, that the Afrocentric and holistic approach to learning and providing experiential knowledge can form the foundation for successful cultural, community-based programs directed at African-American youth.

Courtney, Jr. The Office for Substance Abuse Preven\u00ad tion (OSAP) has funded over 150 prevention and intervention programs aimed at youth considered to be at high risk of becoming invoived in alcohol and other drug (AOD) abuse. OSAP has contracted with Macro Systems, Inc., to evaluate these programs to determine what seems to be working well and to develop plausible logic models to describe why these programs ap\u00ad pear to be effective. Fifty-three of these OSAP-funded programs on high risk were visited. Among these programs, 19 were seen to have a significant proportion of African-American youth. The purpo:::e of this discussion is to provide a synopsis of some of these programs and to synthesize information on their common elements to determine what appears to make them effec\u00ad tive. This paper is not intended as a critical review of these programs' activities or a critique of their evaluation efforts. Al\u00ad though some of these programs are based on or are consistent with Afrocentric con\u00ad cepts, this discussion is not intended to present an Afrocentric model of prevention programs. RaUler, the intent is to describe and synthesize findings of current demonstration programs on high risk tar\u00ad geted to African-American youth. The ideas found herein are based on a review of the site-visit reports on these 19 93 An African-Centered Model of Prevention for African-American Youth at High Risk programs, interviews conducted at 8 programs targeted to African-American youth,13 and plausible conclusions drawn from relevant academic literature of preven\u00ad tion program effectiveness. Based on a syn\u00ad thesis of this information, a logic model describing the relationship of a typical program's resources and activities to its in\u00ad tc...-vening and outcome variables was developed and is presented here. The programs visited are located throughout the United States, primarily in urban and !';ubur\u00ad ban settings. Programs visited are in Washington, D.C.; Baton Rouge, Louisiana; Richmond, California; Martinez, California; Chicago, Illinois; Atlanta, Georgia; the boroughs of Brooklyn and Queens, New York City; and Cincinnati, Ohio. Description of Program Summaries A brief summary of these programs follows. Targeted Alternatives to Substance Abuse (rASA), Sasha Bruce Youth works, Washington, D.C. TASA represents the addition of an AOD use component to a consortium of seven ex\u00ad isting programs, all targeted to youth at high risk, operating lh'1der a single ad\u00ad ministration. The vast majority of the youth in the program are African Americ::an and range in age from 12 to 16. Some of the clients live in facilities operated by Sasha Bruce Youthworks and others live with their families. Targeted youth include youth drug offenders, runaways, pregnant teens, children too young to be put in jail, and street children. The program was initiated because of the recognition that many of the youth in the existing programs of Sasha Bruce Youthworks had direct involvement in alcohol and other drugs or were at great risk because of their families and i;nmediate environment. All youth in the seven programs receive two information lectures, one on alcohol and other drug abuse, and one on AIDS. The youth are subsequently in\u00ad volved in weekly group activities, which in\u00ad clude social/peer resistance skills, crafts/ alternatives, and family therapy. In addi\u00ad tion, most of the youth have the oppor\u00ad tunity to participate in the \"Meet the Challenge\" workshop, which lasts for about 12 hours (six 2-hour sessions), and they also participate in a weekend retreat. Although the Sasha Bruce Youthworks staff is multira\u00ad cial, all the T ASA service activities of the grant on high risk were conducted by the African Americans on the staff. The staff was involved in continual training. Boys and Girls Club of Martinez, California (Rodeo, California) The Boys and Girls Club of Martinez, California, received funding under the umbrella grant given to the Boys and Girls Gub of America. The Martinez Gub estab\u00ad lished a satellite office in a housing develop\u00ad ment in Rodeo, California, which is in another part of Contra Costa county. The Rodeo housing development is a relatively small complex of about 750 units. The hous\u00ad ing authority provides space for the Boys and Girls (\"ub and funding for renovation and expansion of the club's facilities in the development. The club provides after\u00ad school activities for youth from ages 6 to 16. Approximately 65 percent of the youth are African American and about 35 percent Hispanic. The primary purpose of the grant is to create a time and space for youths to come to after school where they can feel safe and protected from AOD exposure. There is no standardized curriculum. Most of the grant's activities are recreation and crafts. The Rodeo Gub does not have the stand\u00ad ardized \"Smart Moves\" curriculum used in some of the Boys and Girls Gub High Risk grants at other sites. Membership in the 13 Program personnel, clients, parents, political and community leaders, school,law enforcement, and social service personnel who work with the program, or who are affected by the program, were interviewed. 94 Rodeo Club was growing and the club ap\u00ad peared to be well utilized. It should be noted that all of the recreation resources of the Rodeo housing complex were placed under the auspices of the club. Also, the club provided a place for youth to go to until their parents returned from work. Ser\u00ad vices are provided by two staff people, a White male and a Hispanic female. The club has been successful in involving parents by sponsoring an annual talent show featuring the youth. Gateway Project, YMCA, and New Perspectives, Richmond, California Gateway Project provides a comprehensive case-study approach with therapeutic sup\u00ad port for about 100 youths at high risk. Ap\u00ad proximately half the youth are African American and range in age from 13 to 16 years. The Gateway Project represents a cooperative venture of two community\u00ad based organizations: the local YMCA and a community-based prevention program, New PerspectivesJ which operates programs in four counties in the Bay Area of California. The grant's activities are a combination of recreation and group and in\u00ad dividual therapy. Both the recreation and therapy activities focus on enhancing coping skills and self-esteem. The Gateway staff is housed in four junior high schools, and the staff members provide the core of the counseling services for those schools. The youths at high risk are identified in their schools by Gateway staff or by school personnel, who together compose a school's CARE team. A family therapist and a family outreach/service coordinator are on the Gateway staff to provide services to the youths and their families. These services in\u00ad clude therapeutic support to families, chan\u00ad neling and guiding the families to essential health and welfare services, and serving as an advocate for the child within the family. Many of the grant's activities are cultural in focus and are designed to promote mutual understanding and awareness of the multi\u00ad cultural environment and to foster pride Prevention and Intervention Programs and identification within the respective cul\u00ad tures. Recreation plays a key role in the grant. Recreation objectives are closely coor\u00ad dinated with the therapy services and are designed to enhance the therapeutic objec\u00ad tives of the youths on a case-by-case basis. The youths are also involved in a sun1mer retreat program, which is a highlight of the Gateway program. Key staff members in the recreation and family components are African American. All staff persons are in\u00ad volved in close supervision of the case load and involved in continuing training offered by New Perspectives. Catholic Diocese of Brooklyn, Boroughs of Brooklyn and Queens, New York City The pupil services of the parochial schools operated by the Diocese of Brooklyn have expanded their services to parents and stu\u00ad cents to prevent AOD use problems among their pupils. A similar program has been in operation in the schools of the diocese for about 15 years. This program provided (con\u00ad versational) rap groups for students and training for teachers and volunteers to con\u00ad duct these groups. TIle grant's activities are an expansion of the existing pupil services program to include educational experiences for parents, classroom education on AOD use prevention for fifth and sixth graders, support groups for children of AOD\u00ad abusing families, parent support groups, and individual and family therapy, as needed. The majority of the services are provided at the schools, with some services offered at the main 01' satellite offices of the scl1001 district. Although pupil services are consistent across all the schools, each school is sovereign and controlled completely by its respective parish or church in both finan\u00ad ces and curricula. The Diocese of Brooklyn operates a huge school district, and the ra\u00ad cial makeup of each school is diverse. Some of the schools that elected to participate irt the program have a majority of African\u00ad American youth, many of Carihbean heritage. In schools with a majority of African-American stud\u20ac!1ts, the staffs 95 An African-Centered Model of Prevent!on for African-American Youth at High Risk attempt to modify the schools' AOD use materials to be culturally sensitive and ap\u00ad propriate. A large portion of the program's efforts involves training t~achers in AOD use issues and in building a cadre of teachers to conduct the program's activities. No one on the staff is an African American. SUPER II, Atlanta, Georgia The Substance Prevention a..'1d Education Resource Project (SUPER II) is a combined effort of the Metropolitan Alcoholism Coun~ cil of Atlanta, the Atlanta local Boys and Girls Clubs, and some of the local public housing developments. The program provides AOD abuse infonnation and skills for parents and youth to improve family functioning. SUPER II is a short~term inter\u00ad vention service aimed at male and female youth, aged approximately 10 through 12. The \"'11ajority of the youth at high risk are African-American males. Parents or guard\u00ad ians of these youth are included in the inter\u00ad vention service, the service being delivered in eight different sessions, each lasting about 2 hours. The sessions are delivered over, approximately, a 3-week period. In some of the sessions parents and youth meet together; in oilier sessions, parents and youth meet separately. The ses\u00ad sions are designed to provide information about alcohol and other drugs and to develop specific skills for the youths to in\u00ad crease their resis tance to peer pressure to use drugs. Other specific skill development activities are designed to improve frunily communications and family functiOning. The eight sessions include activities designed to improve the youths' assertive\u00ad ness, independent thinking, and self\u00ad esteem. After the initial seven sessions are completed for the youths and their parents, an eighth session is given 1 month later as a booster or follow-up session. This session seems to be attended only by the youths. Changes were expected in the following variables: assertiveness, independent tlUnk\u00ad ing, improved self-esteem, resistance to peer pressure, increased knowledge of alcohol and other drugs, and increased family com- 96 munications. All the direct line program staff and volunteers are African American. Significantly, many volunteers served as role models for the youth and were paired with them in the training when the parents of the youth did not attend. Most of the volunteers are African-American male col\u00ad lege students from Morehouse College. Greater Alliance for Prevention Services (GAPS), Chicago, Illinois (Austin, Garfield, and Lawndale communities) GAPS is a community organization effort to empower individuals and groups in three communities on the West Side of Chicago to establish effective community- and school\u00ad based prevention programs. The program activities include five strategies: education, media, alternatives, cultural heritage, and public policy. Approximately 80 percent of the services are targeted to Afric,:n-American youth at high risk and approximately 20 per\u00ad cent Hispanic youth at high risk. Cultural heritage activities are con.ducted in specific ethnic or racial groups. Most of the grant's activities center around training and em\u00ad powering core teams of adults in the three communities to implement their specific ac\u00ad tion plans. Prominent in the membership of these teams are African-American churches, businesses, law enforcement, social service providers, poUticalleaders, and others. Community action plans consist of organiz\u00ad ing highly visible community activities to \"make a statement\" within their com\u00ad munities of their resolve to address and con\u00ad front the drug problems on the West Side of Chicago. These activities are also designed to influence law makers to reduce the availability of drug paraphernalia in the community. Tl-.is activity proved very suc\u00ad cessful, and an antiparaphemalia law waC) passed and signed by the Governor of Il\u00ad linois on the steps of a local church. Other very visible activities are community parades and weekly prayer vigils conducted in front of known drug houses in the neigh~ bothoods. Culturally specific after-school ac\u00ad tivities are carried on in several schools. These activities include drama, dance, and drwnming. An important component of the program includes support to existing parent groups who are present at the s?,oo!s daily and who provide support functIons ill the classrooms. Southern University Drug Prevention Program, Baton Rouge, Louisiana The Southern University Drug Prevention Program (SUDPP) provides intervention and prevention services to youth at high risk in the northeast section of Baton Rouge. Southern University is predominantly African American. All the youth at high risk are African Americans and are approximate\u00ad ly ages 12 through 14. The grant's services are delivered on alternating Saturdays, for 3 hours, on the university campus. The program is composed of five major components. First, the youths receive about an hour and a half of a skills-building cur\u00ad riculwn, Le., the Quest Curriculwn. Second, recreation activities follow the skill-building component and last approximately 1 hour. Third, in addition to the Saturday sessions, the youths are enrolled in a companion pro\u00ad gram where university-age students volun\u00ad teer as big brothers and big sisters to call and contact the youths in person on the Saturdays that the program is not con\u00ad ducted. Sessions with the companion may consist of a telephone call, an outing with the companion, or a home visit. Fourth, the youths are invited to participate in a swn\u00ad mer program in which they live at the university campus for 1 month, including weekends. This component provides a skill\u00ad building curriculwn, recreation alternatives, a field trip in which the students are . provided activities focused on local Afncan\u00ad American heritage and culture, and ac\u00ad tivities concerning character development and with spiritual emphasis. Fifth, a parent support group provides AOD information to parents and general support to the ac\u00ad tivities of the SUDPP program in the homes of the youth at high risk. All the program staff members and volunteers are African Americans. Prevention and Intervention Programs Crossroads, Cincinnati, Ohio The Comprehensive Afro-American Adoles\u00ad cent Services Project, also caIled the Crossroads Program, is a seven-component program aimed at African-American youth, their families, and the community in which they live. Four of the components are targeted on a core group of adolescents and their families, with the remaining three com\u00ad ponents targeted on the community at large and/ or to community leaders. Three of the four youth components are provided to all of the core group of adolescents; the fourth component is optional and is contingent upon the needs of the individual adolescent. The seven components are described here. First, there is an education and orienta\u00ad tion program with 14 sessions of ap\u00ad proximately 2 hours each, delivered over a 7-week period. Second, there is a process group that evolved into a rites-of-passage group, which consists of 20 sessions of ap\u00ad proximately 2 hours each, delivere? in 2 ses\u00ad sions per week over a la-week penod. The third component is a community involve\u00ad ment/ action project, origin all y considered an optional component but evolving into a standard service for the core group, which lasts typically for about 8 weeks. This com\u00ad ponent has the participants developing a community project whereby they give ser\u00ad vices back to the community. This com\u00ad ponent is also considered a continuation of the rites-of-passage group, and the youths are guided through this portion of the pro\u00ad gram in small groups that are meant to be\u00ad come d social and emotional support network. Fourth is a transitional living pro\u00ad gram, which is optional. It depends upon the needs of individual youths; that is, if a youth is in need of alternative living arrangements, the staff members have developed options in the community, or even in their own homes. The fifth component is an education ser\u00ad vice offered to African-American youth in schools and at the juvenile court by a cooperative agreement; this component 97 An African-Centered Model of Prevention for African-American Youth at High Risk consists of a 14-session curriculum similar to the education orientation process given to the core groups. The sixth component provides information to the community at large. This part of the program is delivered in two ways: through a weekly cable television program and through training for other agencies and community groups. The cable program and the training consist of cultural education and awareness and .have as their goal the increase in the community's awareness about the needs and issues of a.dolescent African Americans. The seventh component is entrepreneurial training, and is targeted to youth who come into the pro\u00ad gram by a variety of referral routes. This component is optional and depends on the needs of the individual youth and last for 10 2-hour sessions. Common Program Themes An emphasis on cultural specificity appears to be ru. important consideration in these programs. However, only two of the programs, Crossroads and GAPS, specif\u00ad ically cited Afrocentric principles as guiding the development and implementation of their programs. Most of the programs, nevertheless, attempt to incorporate the values of African-American institutions in local communities. These values include an emphasis on the extended family and on spirituality. These v::uues appear to operate implicitly and explicitly within the local cul\u00ad ture and they are very evident in the per\u00ad sonal philosophies of staff members. The one truly multiple cultural program visited, Gateway, also appears to be closely con\u00ad nected to the African-American community institutions and to the community institu\u00ad tions of the other ethnic groups represented by the participants at high risk. Staff mem\u00ad bers often talked about the importance of these institutions and their values as a focus of motivation for the youth. The vast majority of staff members of these programs appear to be exceptionally dedicated to the programs and they appear to demonstrate a personal commitment to the program. 98 Staff personnel note that frequent ex\u00ad posure of youths to extreme levels of en\u00ad vironmental stress contributes to real and perceived threats to personal safety. Most programs expressed the importance of providing a sense of safety and protection as a key to successful program imple\u00ad mentation. Two of the programs, SUPER II and GAPS, had outcome data based on stand\u00ad ardized instruments showing the positive relationship of program variables to reduc\u00ad tions in AOD experimentation and/ or abuse and to other expected changes in in\u00ad tervening variables. The GAPS program also includes a culturally specific stand\u00ad ardized. instrument that showed positive results correlated with the program's ac\u00ad tivities. A third program, Crossroads, is ex\u00ad pected to have outcome data based on standardized instruments very soon. It is difficult to determine clearly which of the programs on high risk should be con\u00ad sidered to be strictly primary prevention in focus. Most of the programs have com\u00ad ponents that could be considered primary prevention; most also include secondary prevention and intervention services as part of their service continuum. No attempt, there\u00ad fore, is made to distinguish primary from secondary prevention services in this model. Development of a Logic Model A \"typical\" or representative logic model was developed to describe the features of a successful program. The definition of suc\u00ad cess is based on t.l-te programs' ability to pro\u00ad vide services to an identified population at risk and to demonstrate evidence, formal or anecdotal, of the success of their intended ef\u00ad forts. The model is to provide a graphic rep\u00ad resentation of the logical relationships of the programs' activities to intervening variables and to outcomes. The logic model, therefore, describes the flow of program activities to their outcomes and the important interven\u00ad ing variables that contribute to the apparent positive outcomes of these programs. Individual program logic models were devised for each of the 19 programs. Not all of these programs are equally successful in meeting their established program goals. However, all appear to enjoy at least moderate success and all contribu.c greatly to this learning process and the develop\u00ad ment of the model. Where available, data based on standardized instruments to measure the effectiveness of these programs were reviewed. Conclusions drawn from the interviews are also used. Interviews pro\u00ad vide insights into why the programs are suc\u00ad cessful as well into how specific problems and obstacles are addressed. For the sake of discussion and explana\u00ad tion, a single logic model was developed to describe the important, and possibly critical, features of the programs. The logic model presented here is not intended as a final or definitive presentation of AOD use preven\u00ad tion programs for African-American youth at high risk. Rather, it is presented for descriptive ease for purposes of discussion. The modelis seen as dynamic and subject to revision based on information learned from these and other demonstration programs and research efforts. Many consistent themes were observed that appear to contribute to the positive out\u00ad comes and the high degree of positive acceptance these programs seem to have generated. All the personnel interviewed credited many of their ideas in designing these programs to findings in the extant prevention literature and in ideas based on commonly C1.ccepted clinical approaches and practices. The representative model is shown in exhibit 2. A brief discussion of the model is given here. Description of the Model Inputs Staff competence is deemed critical for pro\u00ad gram success. Senior staff members need to be competent in administrative skills, pro\u00ad gram planning, community interface, and developing and establishing rapport with the youth at high risk. The staffs of the Prevention and Intervention Programs stronger programs communicate a commit\u00ad ment and zeal for their work that is \"con\u00ad tagious\" for the youth and for the community in which the programs operate. The stronger programs also advocate the im\u00ad portance of providing a professional sup\u00ad port base of training for their line staff in which senior staff personnel are directly in\u00ad volved. Senior staff personnel are able to communicate a clear vision of their programs' missions to junior staff members and to the communities. Program success appears to be en\u00ad hanced by contact and identification with the broader African-American community in which the youths live. Almost without ex\u00ad ception/ there were strong community leaders willing and available to be support\u00ad ive and directly involved with the youths. The stronger programs nurture political, economic, and religious contacts within their communities, and some programs are very ambitious in the extent of their com\u00ad munity organization. Rather than demonstrating the effectiveness of a model targeted on a few selected youths, the programs focus on entire communities so as to build a base of support and action within the communities that could affect the lives of all community youth. The programs appear to benefit greatly from the input by the communities and targeted youth. The result of such input is that the youth and the communities have a sense of shared ownership, which generates commitment to the programs, and this commitment seems to act as a catalyst for empowering both the youth and the com\u00ad munities. Preconditions Program success appears to be enhanced when attention is given to stimulating the \"core\" motivation of the youths. In the programs visited, the core motivation was described in differing termsi however, there are commonalities throughout all the programs. The motivation is paraphrased as enhancing the youths' sense of identity and belonging to their communities.

Intervening Variables Many of these African-American youths at high risk do not live in protective environ\u00ad ments that offer consistent physical and emotional security. For those fortunate to live in a safe home, security often does not extend beyond its boundaries. Many youth at high risk are often direct or potential vic- 100 Intervening Variables Provide haven fOJ.' physical and emotional security Skill development Provide positive role models Support for behavior and attitudf-' ~hange from peers Foster hope and direction for future Improve self-esteem Recreation and alternative activities Dedsionmaking skills Outcomes Understanding and incorporation of identity and heritage Decrease substance abuse Involvement in ongoing process for positive self\u00ad direction lims of physical and emotional abuse in their homes, and face a hostile environment in their neighborhoods. With such security absent, there is a notable lack of trust in the youths' personal interactions. In some in\u00ad stances, it is necessary that the programs ad\u00ad dress this void in physical and emotional security by attending to the youths' need for shelter and adequate food and clothing. Therefore, one of the principal benefits of\u00ad fered by these intervention and prevention programs is offering a haven, in which the youths can be children and learn useful coping mechanisms and be free from the strain created by fear of personal harm. This protected environment gives the youths ,---------------------_._------ --- liberty to hope for a future and to develop and plan activities that can affect that future. Program success appears to be en\u00ad hanced by multiple-strategy approaches. Some of the strategies used in the programs are education, alternatives, media and com\u00ad munity awareness, family involvement, so\u00ad cial policy, and cultural heritage. Although these programs do not have the luxury of in\u00ad cluding all these strategies, most programs give attention to such strategies through long-term planning. Although the long\u00ad term plans are not fonnally implemented in many of the programs, nuances of these strategies are visible in the existing program activities. Program success seems enhanced by multiple services targeted on single clients. Most African-AmeIican clients ill these programs for youth at high risk are in need of a variety of services. The services that ap\u00ad pear most critical to program success are education/ information, alternative / skill development activities, recreational ac\u00ad tivities, \"guardian\" services, self-esteem and decisionrnaking activities, availability of interactions with positive peer and adult role models, availability of support groups, adequate housing, and attention to other basic survival needs. Program personnel often note that cul\u00ad turally specific materials are needed but are not typically available, and that materials and program activities need to be relevant to the personal experience and environment of the youth. A diversity of program materials are utilized with these African\u00ad American youth at high risk and, in most cases staff members, either through forethought or intuition, modified the materials to catch the youths' imagination. Outcomes Program personnel believe that one of the important outcomes is to impart an under\u00ad standing of cultural heritage and facilitate its incorporation into the development of the youths' self-identity. Attempts are made to develop support systems and integrate Prevention and intervention Programs the youth into an ongoing base of service support. The support base is meant to pro\u00ad vide the youth with skills and feelings of empowerment in order to become self\u00ad directed. All program personnel want to decrease AOD use or the potential for it, some programs are able to demonstrate reductions in AOD experimentation and use within specified time frames. Summary and Recommendations These initial evaluations of OSAP demonstration programs for African\u00ad American youth at high risk provide worthwhile insights into understanding the effectiveness of the programs. Although the sample of programs reviewed is too small to be considered a meta-analysis, several very clear trends emerge from the sample. The first conclusion is that programs with targeted education and skill-building com\u00ad ponents, with sufficient amount of contact with the youth, show measurable changes in both intervening and outcome variables. Specifically, three of the four programs that attempt to measure outcomes of self-esteem, locus of control, AOD use and/ or delayed onset of use are able to demonstrate posi\u00ad tive changes. It is likely that more of the programs will show such changes when the final evaluation measurements are complete. Three ingredients appear to contribute to these positive results. First, adherence to a structured curriculum with clear objec\u00ad tives evidently contributes to the findings' clarity. Second, it seems that a basic mini\u00ad mum contact with the youth is needed to facilitate such changes. Based on the current programs, a minimum of 20 hours of service contact over a period of apprOximately 6 weeks is needed to achieve positive results. Third, it seems critical that program staff of African-American heritage be very visible and directly involved in the service delivery. Although there are several ex\u00ad amples of programs that include staff from other cultural backgrounds that were suc\u00ad cessful, in each case, these personnel work 101 An African-Centered Model of Prevention for African-American Youth at High Risk alongside African-American staff. In the one instance where there is no African\u00ad American staff, the program cites this as a significant problem and suggests that it con\u00ad tributes to a lack of positive results. There appear to be at least three major limitations to these evaluation efforts, which restrict the generalizabilily of the findings. The first limitation is that the find\u00ad ings are all based on short-term measure\u00ad ments, that is, pre-post designs taken over a period of 2 months or less. No long-term data are currently available on these programs that can provide insights into the durability of these effects over time. Longer term, longitudinal studies are needed to in\u00ad crease the confidence in program outcomes. A second limitation is that all the evalua\u00ad tions are based on changes measured within the individual youths and did not address broader changes in their communities. Such changes would be expected from the logic model proposed in this study and expected from the Afrocentric model as outlined by Dr. Lawford Goddard in other sections of this report. Intervening variables that measure community changes and go beyond the individual level of analysis should be included in future evaluations. The third, and perhapa the most critical, 102 limitation of the findings is the propensity to focus only on self-esteem and locus of control as intervening variables. Only one program attempts to measure cultural iden\u00ad tification as an intervening variable, which proves to be a positive and insightful find\u00ad ing. Again, the Afrocentric model of AOD use prevention proposed by Dr. Goddard provides a theoretical base for other inter\u00ad vening variables, which should be included in future program evaluations of African\u00ad American youth at high risk. Looking past the data provided by standardized procedures, the majority of the programs studied appear to enjoy wide and very positive acceptance in their com\u00ad munities. Most of the \"key informants\" in\u00ad terviewed were able to cite specific changes they noted in their communities as a result of the youth at high risk demonsh'ation pro'\u00ad gram. Many intervening variables that are typically difficult to measure with stand\u00ad ardized tests, such as spirituality, commit\u00ad ment to family, and cooperation in the community are evident in these anecdotal reports. It is strongly recommended that more systematic attention be given to these anecdotal findings in future evaluation efforts. Chapter 11 Site Visit Report of Three OSAP Grants Targeting African-American Youth at High Risk Lawford L. Goddard In an attempt to understand the nature of prevention programs and to observe what appears to be working with African\u00ad America..'1 youth at high risk, the author visited three projects that were funded by the Office for Substance Abuse Prevention (OSAP). The purpose of these site visits was to observe the range and diversity of programs that target African-American youth at high risk, to document the similarities, if any, that exist among these programs, and to see what features of these programs could inform the model. The three sites chosen, Atlanta, Cincinnati, and Boston, represent different psychocultural and ecological realities confronting the African-American community. For the pur\u00ad pose of these site visits, the case study methodology was adopted as the most ap\u00ad propriate technique for understanding the features and characteristics of the different programs. The Case Study: Definition and Requirements The purpose of the case study method is to study intensively the background, current status and/ or environmental interactions of a given social unit. The case study is an in\u00ad depth investigation of a given sodal unit resulting in a complete, well-organized picture 103 ~ -~~~ ------------~- ~~ --------- --------- An AfTlcan-Centered Model of Prevention for AfTlcan-Amerlcan Youth at High Risk of the social unit under examination. Case studies tend to examine, across a large num\u00ad ber of variables and/ or conditions, a small number of the social units of interest. The sodal unit for this study is a subset of three drug abuse prevention and inter\u00ad vention programs at selected agencies that have been identified as having some success in reducing the incidence of, and attitude toward, alcohol and other drug (AOD) abuse. These agencies/programs are also selected to reflect the geographical distribu\u00ad tion of the African-American population. The scope of a case study may encom\u00ad pass the entire life cycle, a selected segment, specific factors/features, or the totality of elements and/or events relative to the social unit under examination. For this analysis the scope of the case studies will address specific prevention/ intervention features (elements) and specific programmatic fac\u00ad tors (events). In addition, the factors to be examined include program characteristics, current status of the program, consequence of the program for African-American youth at risk, utilization of African-American cul\u00ad ture in the program, and factors that affect and/ or reflect cultural consistency. Case Study: SUPER II Early Intervention Demonstration Project, Atlanta, Georgia I. Program Mission/Description: Abstract The Substance Abuse Prevention and Educa\u00ad tion Resource Project (SUPER II) modifies and expands its first program, which has been operating in an after-school format in 12 metropolitan Atlanta school systems. The program seeks to limit further experimenta\u00ad tion or increase L.., young people's use of gateway drugs, whether used alone or in combination with other illicit drugs. Targeted youth are taught assertiveness, resistance to negative peer pressure, decisionrnaking, and independent thinking along with information about the dangers of 104 AOD use. Parents and parent surrogates learn about AOD abuse and how to im\u00ad prove their parenting skills so that they are neither too lenient nor too authoritarian. Both parents and children are taught to im\u00ad prove their communication skills. SUPER II has extended the earlier pro\u00ad gram to reach targeted youth and their parents in additional schools and through community agencies serving economically and educationally disadvantaged youth, mostly from (female) single-parent households. The program has trained the staff of three community organizations-the Boys Club of Metropolitan Atlanta, the Girls Club of Metropolitan Atlanta, and Exodus, Inc., an agency providing education to high school dropouts and supportive services to youth at high risk of dropping out. These community staffs deliver program services to the targeted youth of their agencies and select and train youth as role models for the program's two peer skills sessions. A law enforcement officer, who has also received training, is training seven officers of the city's police department to teach me legal aspects section of SUPER II. This expanded program will eliminate or curb the use of alcohol and other drugs by the target group who will have enhanced self-esteem,more assertiveness, and greater ability to make decisions for themselves. Their parents will know more about the risks of alcohol and other drugs and be bet\u00ad ter parents. This program is significant for combin\u00ad ing new knowledge of AOD use interven\u00ad tions with an already existing, nationally recognized early intervention program. SUPER II is making this early intervention model available to a much larger popula\u00ad tion by working with community organizations. II. Program/Site Characteristics The Metropolitan Atlanta Council on Al\u00ad cohol and Drugs (MACAD) is the sponsor\u00ad ing agency for the SUPER II project. MACAD has a long history of involvement with the local community, operating in the community for 20 years. This history has enabled the agency to earn the trust and support of the local community and estab\u00ad lish links with other organizations. The staff of MACAD is multiethnic. However, the ad\u00ad ministrative/management staff appears to be predominantly White, while the pro\u00ad gram/treatment staff appears to be mostly Bla.ck. There is little turnover at the ad\u00ad ministrative/management level, but at the program/treatment level there is a high de\u00ad gree of turnover. The agency provides train\u00ad ing for its staff about twice a year to improve the quality of personnel. III. PreventionjlnteNention Process The SUPER II project has a 24-hour cur\u00ad riculum delivered in 12 2-hour sessions over a l-year period. There are 7 \"core\" sessions presented in a 2-to 3-week period, followed by 5 \"booster\" sessions presented 3 months after the end of the core sessions. The project delivers services to both youth and parents. In fact, one of the requirements for youth participation is that parents agree to go through the fu1l1-year involvement in SUPER II. SUPER II sessions are led by adult facilitators, peer facilitators, and law en\u00ad forcement officers. Some sessions are held for parents or youth alone, while others are held with the YOUtll and parents together. The facilitators receive training at varying levels of intensity (20 hours for adult facilitators, 6 hours for teen facilitators, and 2 hours for law enforcement officers) from a variety of expert consultants in their fields. The heart of the program is the adult facilitators who provide the leadership, gUidance, and direction for the program. It is the adult facilitators who make the cur\u00ad riculum corne alive and become meaningful for the participants. The sessions are led by a team of two adult facilitators. Most of the teams are composed of women only; how\u00ad ever, there are a few teams that are made up of male and female facilitators. During the site visit, we were fortunate to 'witness one Site VIsit Report of Three OSAP Grants of the male-female facilitator teams in operation. The curriculum activities (or youth cover issues of assertiveness skills, self\u00ad esteem building, decisionmaking skills, and AOD use information. The curriculum ac\u00ad tivities for parents cover issues of self\u00ad esteem building, discipline, positive com\u00ad munication skills, listening skills, self\u00ad evaluation skills, and warning signs assessment. Separate workbooks are developed for youth and parents. The workbooks are well developed, the graphics are appealing and depict images of African Americans, the lan\u00ad guage is appropriate for the target popula\u00ad tion, and the messages are clear and on target. IV. Relevant RelationshipS/Links MACAD has established links with other service and community-based organizations in the metropolitan Atlanta area. These \"host\" agencies supply the SUPER II target population from among their youth mem\u00ad bership along with parents/ guardians of such youth at r.igh risk, recruit and retain participants, provide facilities for the pro\u00ad gram activities, off-1: incentives for par\u00ad ticipation, and provide members of their staff to be trained as facilitators. The use of existing agencies that already have contact with, and are serving, the target population is one major factor accounting for the suc\u00ad cess of the SUPER II program in that MACAD does not have to undergo the cost\u00ad ly process of recruiting participants for its program. V. Program Consequences Based on pre-and posttest analysis, data in\u00ad dicate that the SUPER II program is achiev\u00ad ing some significant effects in knowledge, attitudes, and behavior related to alcohol and other drugs. Data from the second year of the project indicate that there were sig\u00ad nificant self-reported decreases in the fre\u00ad quency of use and amount of use of alcohol and other drugs. There were also significant 105 An African-Centered Model of Prevention for African-American Youth at High Risk decreases in the number of AOD-related be\u00ad havior problems and physical effects of AOD use. In addition, U1ere was a reported increase in knowledge of alcohol and other drugs among both parents and youth. The program also reported increased knowledge of good communication skills for both parents and youth. Parents reported improved family functioning, and youth reported improvements in ability to resist peer pressure. A natural byproduct of the program is the development of friendship networks among participants. During the site visit we were able to witness some close relationships among the par\u00ad ticipants, both adults and youth. It is not clear whether these networks were natural (i.e., the people knew each other and had formed these networks before) or had been created as a result of participation in the program. In summary, the SUPER II program has been able to achieve some success in reduc\u00ad ing the incidence of AOD use ,md improv\u00ad ing the knowledge base of its participants. The pl'Ogram has also achieved some suc\u00ad cess in enhancing areas of psychosocial competences that are likely to reduce the likeliliood of engaging in AOD abusing behavior. VI. Assessment of Cultural Consistency The SUPER II project does not reflect any utilization or application of African\u00ad American cultural precepts. Essentially, it is a program that has been developed and tried in other settings and has been adapted to serve the target population of this area. Although the program delivery is done primarily by African-American facilitators, there is no evidence of infusion of culture in the content of the training materials. The materials are the standard information about alcohol and other drugs and some practical skills in, for instance, self-esteem, decisionmaking, and assertiveness that are common to all people. The success of the program has a great deal to do with the 106 ability of MACAD to network with existing agencies already serving the targetpopula\u00ad tion. It is the host agencies and their staffs who, through their experience with the com\u00ad munity, are able to bring to life the training materials. Site Visit: Afro-American Adolescent Project, CincinnatL Ohio I. Program Mission/Description: Abstract TtJs project is an expansion of the Crossroads Unit of the Alcoholism Clinic of the University of Cincinnati College of Medicine. It incorporates culturally specific prevention, treatment, and rehabilitation services for Black adolescents. The project integrates the beliefs, historical and cultural perspectives, values, and problem-solving styles of Black Americans with an under\u00ad standing of the dynamics of AOD use and the processes of treatment, intervention, and prevention for this population. Project activities are aimed at both individual youths and the community as a whole. The project offers holistic treatment and rehabilitation services to adolescents and their families, whether suffering from AOD abuse or other sociopsychological illnesses. Psychological and medical consultation is provided along with primary clinical ser\u00ad vices. Staff members have developed five models of prevention and treatment strategies designed to stimulate individual and group growth and development. These models use the concepts of (1) chemical de\u00ad pendency, (2) cultural enrichment, (3) skills development, (4) family dynamics, and (5) process/identity. Treatment is geared toward empowering participants, boosting their self-esteem, and encouraging them to be self-sufficient through such services as job training. Project personnel are working to improve the early identification of adoles\u00ad cents who need counseling. The project's outreach activities and community services are aimed at prevent\u00ad ing AOD problems. Here, the staff members adopt the approach that individuals are part of intricate nerNorks linking them to their immediate and extended families. Al\u00ad cohol and other drug education is offered to parents and other community members. In addition, project staff personnel have estab\u00ad lished cooperative relationships with com\u00ad munity service organizations, particularly juvenile service providers. The project's 15-member advisory board provides input and quality assurance and acts as an advocate of community needs at the local, State, and national levels. A 4O-member Afrocenter Service Providers Consortiwn has been created and meets monthly. Members work to fill service gaps and reduce duplication, as well as to central\u00ad ize case management and act as advocates for the target population. If positive results are demonstrated for this project, its model may be generalizable to other parts of the city and State that have large Black populations. II. Program/Site Characteristics The Alcoholism Clinic of the University of Cincinnati College of Medicine is the spon\u00ad soring agency for the African-American Adolescent Alcohol and Drug Program (AAADP). AAADP is one of five different service delivery programs that form the Multicultural Adolescent Unit (MAU). The Alcoholism Clinic has a long history of in\u00ad volvement with the local community, operating in the community for over 25 years. This history has enabled the agency to earn the trust and support of the local community and to establish a number of links with other organizations. The staff of AAADP is Black at both the administra\u00ad tive/management and program/treatment levels. The program has experienced no turnover in the past 3 years. This is a remarkable achievement for an agency that provides services in a high-stress activity and reflects the uniqueness of the staff selec\u00ad tion process. The program's directorindi-Site Visit Report of Three aSAP Grants cated that, although degrees are important, the program is more concerned with the ideological orientation of new employees. It is considered very important to select people for the program who in their social practice demonstrate an emphasis on collec\u00ad tivity, group centeredness, and community involvement. The agency provides oppor\u00ad tunities for growth and development of its staff and encourages the staff to improve its academic achievement. The MAU holds biweekly staff meetings as a means of team building, information sharing, and skills building. In this way MAU works to develop a comprehensive approach to the delivery of services to en\u00ad sure that there is no duplication of services within the network and that service needs are met. We were able to witness one of these staff meetings during the site visit. The training session was devoted to team bullding and served to provide a framework for understanding interper\u00ad sonal, as well as cultural, differences and the need to coordinate the provision of ac\u00ad tivities for the target population. III. Prevention/Intervention Process AAADP offers its activities in three phases as the core arena for its service delivery in three targeted areas in the city of Cincinnati. Phase I is a general orientation, evaluation stage in which participants receive basic in\u00ad formation about alcohol and other drugs. Phase II is a structured 7-week program of individual/family therapy and participa\u00ad tion in an intensive Afrocentric group process. During the 7-week program, 14 ses\u00ad sions about 2 hours long are given. Phase III is an outreach stage in which youth and their fanillies participate in an extended recovery program at their neighborhood satellite center. AAADP provides its services through five cornponents-clinical treatment, education/training, community outreach, the wazir, and research and evaluation. Much of AAADP's activities are con\u00ad cerned with the development of the adolescents' communities as a necessary condition for the ultimate transformation of 107 ----.------- An African-Centered Model of Prevention for African-American Youth at High Risk the youth. As part of this thrust, AAAOP has begun to disseminate and operational\u00ad ize the nguzo saba as guiding principles to govern social behavior through its com\u00ad munity outreach activities. In addition, AAADP has constituted a community \"wazir,\" or council of elders, who are developing the community standards of be\u00ad havior, and an agency wazir that provides input in case referral, problem identifica\u00ad tion, and resource sharing. The education/ training component is the arena in which the social transformation of the youth takes place. In this component, the formal programmatic curriculum ac\u00ad tivities for youth cover issues of cognitive restructuring, cultural awareness, identity formation, proactive coping skills, decision\u00ad making, and AOO use information. In addi\u00ad tion, the youth in phase III of the program are being trained as change agents/ facilitators to lead groups in their com\u00ad munities. These youth, some of whom have had AOO problems, have made a personal \"no AOO use\" commibnent and/ or have maintained a period of 30 days free from al\u00ad cohol and other drugs. The program at\u00ad tempts to build on the experience of these youth in an interactive self-help mode. During the site visit we witnessed one of the training sessions with the youth. The session was led by a team of two facilitators, a man and a woman. The session involved problem solving-critical thinking in an open discussion format. There was full par\u00ad ticipation by the youth. The two trainers worked well together and provided a sup\u00ad portive envirorunent for the youth to ex\u00ad press their viewpoints. At the conclusion of the training session, the participants joined hands in the \"unity\" circle and recited in unison a Pledge of Identity that affirmed their being and sense of purpose in life. IV. Relevant Relationships/Links The Alcoholism Clinic has established links with existing community organizations that provide the framework for the delivery of a coordinatro set of services. The Alcoholism Clinic has established a consortium with 40 108 service delivery agencies to coordinate the service delivery to the target group. In addi\u00ad tion, Llrrough its community advisory board and the community wazir the agency has taken steps to ensure the active cooperation of a wide cross-section of the city's popula\u00ad tion. During the site visit, we were able to witness one of the meetings of the wazir and assess the extent to which it is address\u00ad ing issues relevant to the development of African-American youth. In this regard, the clinic has established close working relation\u00ad ships with the Cincinnati public schools, the social services deparbnent, and the juvenile justice system. The clinic is also working with Cincinnati Youth in Cooperation to conduct a weekly cable television program promoting an antidrug use message. V. Program Consequences AAADP has developed a pre-and posttest design to evaluate the effectiveness of its program activities. At the time of the site visit, program staff members were analyz\u00ad ing and writing up the results of the evalua\u00ad tion. However, preliminary analysis indicates that the program had achieved some success in terms of self-reported decreases in the frequency and amount of use of alcohol and other drugs. The greatest success was reported in those youth who had gone through all three phases of the program. The data indicated that, among this group, there was no recidivism in AOO use among 40 to 50 percent of the par\u00ad ticipants. There were also significant changes in self-esteem and other areas of social life. In particular, these youth showed changes in school performance and im\u00ad provement in school behavior, with a reduc\u00ad tion in suspensions from school. In addition, through the community involvement, the you ths were able to develop social bonds with peers who reflected, and thereby rein\u00ad forced, the youths' sense of identity. VI. Assessment of Cultural Consistency AAADP is Afrocentric in its orientation and prilosophy. It is based on the belief that some basic strengths exist in the African\u00ad American community, that the strengths come from traditional African-American cul\u00ad ture, and that the strengths can be used to combat pressures to engage in AOD use. The philosophical orientation recognizes thai there are, similarly, some processes in contemporary society that might lead to AOD use. The strategy is to ground the ac- ti vities of the program in theoretical ideas developed over time. In a real sense, the pro\u00ad gram serves as a sort of empirical validation of theoretical issues. The overall objective of the program is the development of the whole person. That is, the program is committed to the creation of a person who operates by an alternate mode of existence or being and whose ac\u00ad tion serves as a model for the community. The program's central focus is on creativity. In other words, there is the recognition that people have within themselves the ability to create something new and different to deal with and transcend their environment. Thus, staff members are always willing to try something new and different to get the job done. In terms of practice, the program reflects a high utilization and application of African-American cultural principles and precepts. There is an emphasis on com\u00ad munalism, spirituality, and harmony in the program activities. Similarly, there is a deliberate infusion of culturally consistent materials into the content of the program. The nguzo saba as a code of ethics is utilized in the program as both a set of guiding prin\u00ad ciples and as an infusion into the cur\u00ad riculum materials in use. The program staff uses proverbs, folktales, and parables to il\u00ad lustrate points and to apply explicitly abstract general principles to specific life situations. In terms of skills acquisition, there is a deliberate attempt to provide sys\u00ad tematic culturally consistent skills develop\u00ad ment and/ or training for both staff and clients. As indicated previously, staff mem\u00ad bers are selected on the basis of their philosophical orientation and affiliation with or membership in the cultural com-Site Visit Report ofThree aSAP Grants munity of African Americans. In terms of the people factor of the program, there is no discontinuity between the staff and the tar\u00ad get group for whom services are developed. In addition, there is support for special '/en\u00ad culturation activities/ experiences,\" as manifested in the program's rites-of\u00ad passage activity. Site Visit: Targeted Primary Prevention Demonstration Project-Substance Abuse Prevention ProgrClm is a neighbor\u00ad hood of lower social-economic status in greater Boston. The Substance Abuse Prevention Program (SAPP) is targeted on youth who are economically disadvantaged and who experience a number of the factors of high risk known to contribute to AOD use problems. Factors such as delinquency, school failure, and emotional difficulties, as well as family isolation and parental stress all contribute greatly to the status of the program's targeted population. Roxbury Comprehensive Community Health Center is collaborating with local schools, religious institutions, and social and community ser\u00ad vice agencies to provide an integrated net\u00ad work of pr\\~vention, intervention, and evaluative services for the community. SAPP seeks to reduce AOD use through coordhated activities with the community institutions. This coordinated referral and treatment system will be responsive to the specific needs of the target population. The program provides comprehensive education sessions to youth (includingpreg\u00ad nant teens), parents, and key community members about the causes and consequen\u00ad ces of AOD use among the target popula\u00ad tion. Education sessions are held in schools, community recreation agencies, and religious institutions. Pregnant teens learn 109 An African-Centered Model of Prevention for African-American Youth at High Risk about the adverse effects of alcohol and other drugs on the fetus and themselves. In addition, training sessions are given to youths, parents, and key community mem\u00ad bers on identifying youth at high risk, making treatment referrals, and undertak\u00ad ing specific prevention strategies. This train\u00ad ing prepares participants to become prevention leaders and carry out prevention activities. Teachers, counselors, social workers, and other professionals with limited formal training in AOD use are taught to identify youth at high risk, to give them appropriate referrals and other assistance, and to learn effective prevention strategies. SAPP has been working with several city and State agencies, schools, community organizations, developers of low-income housing, and churches in the local area. Working together provides an integrated network of prevention, intervention, and evaluation services for community resi\u00ad dents. This program is the only integrated network of prevention, intervention, and evaluation services in this part of Boston. SAPP's involvement of community service organizations will increase community awareness about the effects of AOD use, particularly on unborn children; about where users can get help; and what can be done to prevent its occurrence. The project will also stimulate social support networks among community members; such support should relieve much of the stress t.hat low\u00ad income people confront daily. II. Program/Site Characteristics The Roxbury Comprehensive Community Health Center is the sponsoring agency for SAPP. The center has a long history of in\u00ad volvement with the local community, operating in the community for 21 years. This history has enabled the agency ~o earn the trust and support of the local com\u00ad munity and to establish a number of links with other organizations. The staff of SAPP is predominantly Black (85 percent) at the program and treatment level and at the sup\u00ad port staff level; however, at the adrninistra- 110 tive/management level, the staff appears to be predominantly White. This was a demonstration project initially funded for 2 years; the original staff was terminated at the end of the grant period for lack of funds. A new staff has been reconstituted. The program's director indicated that, while academic degrees are important, the pro\u00ad gram is more committed to hiring people who demonstrate a high level of experience and involvement in the community and awareness of the community's needs. This makes the agency very responsive to the needs of the community and enables the agency to better provide services to the tar\u00ad get population. The agency offers oppor\u00ad tunities for the growth and development of its staff through regular monthly training sessions. 1/1, Prevention/Intervention Process SAPP's goal is to reduce AOD use among the targeted youth through education, train\u00ad ing, and intervention. The first focus of ac\u00ad tivities at SAPP is on education, through which participants receive basic information about the causes and consequen(;es of AOD use/abuse. The education component of the program is aimed at youth of ages 11 to 21 and their parents, as well as key community members. The education ses ;ions are given in local schools, churches, and youth recrea\u00ad tion centers. The education activities are delivered in eight sessions, each lasting 1 hour, at eight sites-three schools, two recreational youth centers, one church, the local Department of Social Services, and the Roxbury Comprehensive Community Health Center. Seminars are also presented, in an informal manner, in the waiting rooms at the Roxbury Comprehensive Community Health Center and in conjunction with teen pregnancy classes. The second focus is on training activities. Training sessions are held for service providers, housing officers, and other community residents, with the goal of helping them develop the skills to identify, assist, and intervene with youth at high risk and their families. The training ac\u00ad tivities are geared to the development of \"gatekeepers\" who can identify the early signs of AOD use and begin the process of intervention and early treatment. A critical component of the training is the peer educators, who are adolescent:i trained to provide support and AOD use education to youth. Through this strategy, the program attempts to influence the decisionrnaking skills and values of youth in a way that helps them make informed choices about their behavior. The final focus of SAPP is on intervention services, which provide con\u00ad sultation, assessment, counseling, psychotherapy, and referrals for adoles\u00ad cents and their families currently involved in AOD use. SAPP uses (;I two-pronged approach to primary preventiun. The peer educators are the lead change agents in getting the mes\u00ad sage out onto the streets, while the profes\u00ad sional staff delivers the message in the schools and community-based organiza\u00ad tions. Through this coordinated set of ac\u00ad tivities, SAPP expects to have an impact on the incidence and prevalence of AOD abuse in the targeted population. IV. Relevant Relationships/Links The Roxbury Comprehensive Community Health Center has established links with ex\u00ad isting agencies and organizations providing the framework for the delivery of a coor\u00ad dinated set of services. The center has close networking with the school system, churches, the public housing agency, the social servicp.s department, and other com\u00ad munity-based organizations. These links provide the center with the opportunity to reach youth at high risk. V. Program Consequences Based on pre-and posttest analysis, data in\u00ad dicate that the SAPP is achieving some sig\u00ad nificant effects in knowledge, attitudes, and behavior related to alcohol and other drugs. Data from the project indicate that there are significant self-reported decreases in the fre\u00ad quencyand amount of use of alcohol and other drugs. There also is a reported in-Site Visit Report of Three aSAP Grants crease in knowledge of alcohol and other drugs among both parents and youth. The data indicate that the educational activities have a greater effect on older children: youth in the fifth grade and higher showed a significant increase in knowledge about al\u00ad cohol and other drugs, with third and fourth graders least affected. In summary, SAPP has been able to achieve some success in reducing AOD use and improving the knowledge base of its participants. In addition, the program has achieved some success in enhancing ar~':\\s of psychosocial competencies that are l' ly to reduce the likelihood of engaging in AOD-abusing behavior. VI. Assessment of Cultural Consistency SAPP appears to be a program searching for an identity. On the one hand, it might reflect a commitment to and orientation toward African-American cultural beliefs, values, and practices; on the other, it ap\u00ad pears to be a traditional service delivery pro\u00ad gram. That is, the health posters displayed in the waiting room of the parent organiza\u00ad tion, Roxbury Comprehensive Community Health Center, reflect African-American im\u00ad there is a highly visible and com\u00ad mitted African-American staff and an intense participation in the local com\u00ad munity. However, apart from these visual images of African-American people, there does not appear to be a prevailing emphasis on cultural orientation in the actual training activities. Although the program delivery is done primarily by African-American facilitators, there is no evidence of infusion of culture in the content of the training materials. The materials are the standard in\u00ad formation about alcohol and other drugs and some practical skills (e.g., self-esteem, decisionrnaking, assertiveness) common to all people. The success of the program has a great deal to do with the ability of SAP pIS staff to establish links with existing agencies in the community and to be perceived as ac\u00ad ting in the interest of the target population. It is the staff that through its knowledge of, 111 An African-Centered Model of Prevention for African-American Youih at High Risk and experience with, the community is able to bring to life the training materials. Program Comparisons and Summaries The three sites visited reflect the diversity of the African-American community and the variety of orientations developed to address AOD abuse concerns. The three sites repre\u00ad sent the continuum of programs in existence in the African-American community. The SUPER II program could be considered the traditional approach to AOD use preven\u00ad tion, while the Alcoholism Clinic represents the infusion of African-American cultural values and principles in the service delivery process. Between these two extremes is SAPP. It is not fully infused with African\u00ad American cultural orientation, but it has recognized the need for a program to repre\u00ad sent the image and interest of its client population. All three programs demonstrate some level of success in their program ac\u00ad tivities. The available evidence indicates that there is an increase in knowledge about alcohol and other drugs and their harmful effects. Similarly, self-report data indicate a decrease in the use of alcohol and other drugs. The relatively short life of these programs does not allow us to determine the extent to which these early changes can become long-term and permanent. The Al\u00ad coholism Clinic provides us with some ten\u00ad tative evidence that suggests that a change in value orientation could lead to substan\u00ad tive changes in behavioral praC'ces. !tis not clear what aspect(s) of these three programs provides the success we ob\u00ad serve. Each site differed in terms of the tech\u00ad niques used, the information provided, and how it was provided. Similarly ,leaderShip and characteristics differed from site to site. However, what was common to all three 112 sites was a dedicated and committed staff at the service delivery level. All training facilitators observed during the site visits showed their commitment to the youth in their training sessions. The training facilitators were genuine, enthusiastic, and inspired. It was clear that this was not just a job to them, but that they had some vested interest in the youth. As such, they were able to hold the youth's attention and interest. The results of the site visits highlight the complexity and, at the same time, the simplicity of prevention efforts in the African-American community. Simply stated, trainers and facilitators who are genuine, enthusiastic, and believe in what they are doing can, and does, have an im\u00ad pact on African-American youth at high risk. The key implication is that the agent of change is critical in whatever interventions are developed and implemented for African\u00ad American youth at risk. A somewhat more ccunplex issue is the processes or techniques utilized in the prevention activities. Provid\u00ad ing basic information on alcohol and other drugs without a cultural basis does lead to an increase in knowledge and change in at\u00ad titudes, but not necessarily to changes in beliefs and behavior. Cultural reorientation does lead to changes in behavior and beliefs. However, the processes by which these changes become apparent are not clearly documented. Thus the program\u00ad matic mix of cultural issues, information base, skills development, and staff inputs are still largely undefined and speculative in nature. The benefits of the site visits are to highlight the need to provide for a sys\u00ad tematic approach grounded in both theory and practice in an attempt to create programmatic components that can be repli\u00ad cated in other sites across the country. Section III Toward an African-Centered Model of Prevention for African-American Youth at High Risk Chapter 12 An African-Centered Model of Prevention for African-American Youth at High Risk Wade W. Nobles and Lawford L. Goddard There is an African proverb that states, \"When spider webs unite, they can tie up a lion.\" It is the expectation that an African~centered model of prevention would help to create and guide the pr~ grams, activities, and practices that would enable African-American people to \"tie up the lion\" of alcohol and other drugs in the community. In the process of restoration of order in the African-American community, there are several critical components of an African\u00ad centered model of prevention for the family that need to be implemented. Establish African~entered theories of human development and transformation; Develop culturally consistent interven\u00ad tion, prevention, and treatment methods; .. Create African-based development and training programs in response to the concrete conditions affecting the viability of African peoples; Create contemporary examples of tradi\u00ad tional African-American techniques of child development without violating the traditional cultural core; and Develop methods and processes designed to force societal institutions to respect, reflect, and incorporate the cultural integdty and expressions of African peoples. 115 An African-Centered Model of Prevention for African-American Youth at High Risk Theoretical Foundations of an African-Centered Model The importance of culture in p~ogr~ development and implementatIon 15 derived from the fact that culture represents the vast structure of behaviors, ideas, at\u00ad titudes, values, habits, beliefs, custorr:s, lan\u00ad guage, rituals, ceremonies, and practices \"peculiar\" to a particular group of people, and that it provides them with (1) a ~eneral design for living and (2) pattern~ for ~t.er\u00ad preting reality. As such, culture IS a cntical component in determininp program ~evel\u00ad opment and implementation because It de\u00ad termines how we see the world, and the way we see the world is reflected in our behavior. Based on over 20 years of research on Black family life and culture we have been able to document that Black culture in the United States is the result of a special mix\u00ad ture of our continued African orientation operating in another cultur~ milie~ that is primarily defined by U:e p~osophical and underpmrungs and Goddard 1984; Nobles et al. 1987a, 1987b; Nobles and Goddard 1989). Accordingly, it is the African perspective that is at the base of the Black cultural sphere. Similarly, it is the continuation of that African world view that is at the root of the special features in Bla~ lifestrles. I~ is the continuation of the Afncan onentation that, in part, helps define the \"gener~ design for living and the patterns for mter\u00ad preting reality\" for, or characteristic of, Black people. The term used to classify the African and African-American cultural sys\u00ad tem is Africanity or \"the African-centered paradigm.\" A brief discussion of African philosophical principles and cultural sub\u00ad stance is provided here. African Philosophy and African\u00ad American Cultural Precepts In terms of the nature of being in the universe (ontology), the African belief sys\u00ad tem understands that all things in the 116 universe are \"force\" or \"spirit\" (Mbiti 1970). In believing that all things, including humanity, were endowed with the same Supreme Force, the African also believed that all things are \"essentially\" one, i.e., in\u00ad terdependent and interc~nnected. For t~e African, the world view IS based on the Iden- tification of ''being (existence) in the . universe\" as a cosmologI\u00ad cal \"participation in the Suprerr:e Force.\". Parenthetically, it follows that, if ontologIcal\u00ad ly the African believes that the nature of all things is force, the African, accordingly, views the variety of cosmic beings as quan\u00ad titative alterations of the same Supreme Force (Thomas 1961). That is, the classifica\u00ad tion of ''beings'' and the ''level of be~.g\" be\u00ad comes a classification of forces or spmts. For the African, a natural feature of the universe is the multiplicity of forms and mo\u00ad ments. That is, the African believ~s the universe to be alive. Consequently, the African's relation to the universe is charac\u00ad terized by a belief in the paramountcy and primary importance of life. What ch~ac\u00ad terizes African peoples' understanding of the universe is, consequently, a simul\u00ad taneous respect for the concrete detail in the multiplicity of forms and the rejection of the possibility of an absence or vacuum of forms. In terms of the primary characteristic of relations within the universe (Le., axiology), the African conception of the world ~d phenomena in it amounts to a set of mter\u00ad changing syntheses (connections) and con\u00ad tradictions (antagonisms) linked to the particular classification of beings as differen\u00ad tial quantifications of force. As interchang\u00ad ing syntheses and contradictions, the . primary characteristic o~ universal r.elations these \"connective\" and \"antagonistic\" par\u00ad ticipatory sets form the whole of universal relations. Accordingly, Africa-'1s traditional\u00ad ly believe that relations in the universe are determined by elements belonging to the same metaphysical plane, \"participating by resemblance,\" or by elements belonging to different metaphysical planes, \"participat\u00ad ing by difference\" (Thomas 1960). The An African-Centered Model of Prevention for African-American Youth at High Risk dynamic quality of the total universe is, however, thought to be the conciliation of these various \"participatory sets\" (Le., con\u00ad nective and antagonistic). Therefore, the African believes that all things are the same or on one level while different, yet intercon\u00ad nected and interdependent, on another level. Thus the African thinks (conceives) of experience as an intense complementary rhythmic connection between the person and reality. In fact, the conciliation of, on the one hand, the unity of the cosmos and, on the other, the diversity of beings within the cosmos, makes for the special features (e.g., dynamism, interdependence, egalitarianism, variety, vitalism, coopera\u00ad tion, synergism, transformation, optimism) of the traditional African world view. These principles combined represent the core quality and fundamental nature of African and African-American beingness. Some of the most critical traditional African and African-American cultural precepts are the principles of consubstantiation, synergism, vitalism, egalitarianism, humaneness, har\u00ad mony, interdependenCE, transformation, and collectivism (figure 6). Figure 6. Cultural structures and African-centered cultural precepts Cultural Structures Ontology (Nature of being-essence) Cosmology (Origin/ structure of universe) Axiology (Primary character of universal relations) Ethos (Set of guiding principles) Ideology (The ideational basis of conduct) Worldview (Most comprehensive ideas about order) Values Orientation Central Belief System African-Centered Cultural Precepts Consubstantiation Notion of all elements (humans, animals, inanimate objects) being of the same sul..,stance Interdependence Idea of all elements in the universe being connected Egalitarianism Nature of relations being harmonious and balanced Collectivism Codes of conduct based on idea of group and/ or collective survival! advancement Transformation Change is movement toward higher level of functioning Cooperation The way things function is based on mutual respect and viability Humaneness Behavior is governed by sense of vitalism and viability Synergism Notion that sum of complementary actions is greater than total effort of individuals 117 An African-Centered Model of Prevention for African-American Youth at High Risk The cultural precepts serve tc guide the assessment, understanding, and evaluation of reality as well as give meaning to it. As part of the cultural substance, values define, select, create, and re-create (or reformulate) what is considered good, valuable, or desirable in the social milieu. In a general sense, the cultural substance of a particular group of people functions like a special set of glasses that, in focusing on reality, per\u00ad ceives and is aware of those situations that are \"meaningful\" and excludes those that are not. Hence, it is primarily through this special set of glasses that the myriad of sen\u00ad sory impressions received by the organism is filtered, organized, and transformed into mental impressions and behavioral disposi\u00ad tions and/ or responses. The values indicative of this African cul\u00ad tural orientation are reflected in the high regard for life, cooperation, interpersonal connectedness by differences, and collective responsibility. Similarly, African behavioral and mental dispositions emphasize notions of commonality, similarity, and syntheSis. The b:aditional African and African\u00ad American lifestyles are guided by the added principles of restraint, respect, respon\u00ad Sibility, and reciprocity. Given that all is not well with the African-American community, it is especial\u00ad ly critical that one does not mistake the cur\u00ad rent behavior of the African-American community for an expression of the culture of the African-American community. It is important to remember that current be\u00ad havior results from the interaction of the cul\u00ad ture and the material condition of a people and that both, culture and condition, must be understood and manipulated if interven\u00ad tion and change is to be achieved. African-Centered Model of Prevention The African-centered paradigm is a quality of thought and practice rooted in the cul\u00ad tural image and interest of African people. As the core and fundamental quality of our beingness and becoming, the African- 118 centered paradigm reaffirms the right of African people to (1) exist as a people, (2) contribute to the forward flowing process of human civilization and culture, and (3) to share with as well as shape the world in response to our energy and spirit. The African-centered paradigm is the intel\u00ad lectual and philosophical foundation upon which we create the political, scientific, and moral criteria for authenticating the reality of African family processes. The African\u00ad centered paradigm refers to the life ex\u00ad periences, history, and traditions of African people as the center of one's analyses. This African-centered model of preven\u00ad tion takes as its fundamental premise the no\u00ad tion that the most effective prevention techniques are those that promote a natural resilience to pathology. In a sense, the model acknowledges that the best preven\u00ad tion strategy is a plan that promotes posi- ti ve development rather than prevents dysfunctional behavior. An African-centered model of preven\u00ad tion recognizes that intervention strategies designed to address behavioral dysfunction in the African-American population must be culturally consistent. \"Culturally consist\u00ad ent\" means that the phenomena (prevention programs, training activities, and so on) can be judged as congruent with the particular cultural precepts that provide people with a \"general design for living and patterns for interpreting (Le., giving meaning to) their reality.\" Accordingly, in this African\u00ad centered model cultural!y consistent service praxis is a systematic process whereby one develops and/ or stimulates the knowledge, skill, ability, attitudes, and character neces\u00ad sary for people to undertake socially defined, goal-oriented, and culturally mean\u00ad ingful activity designed to allow them to (1) achieve mastery of all aspects of human functioning; (2) reproduce, refine, and make explicit their personality in the objective world; and (3) validate their self and kind. An African-centered approach to the delivery of alcohol and other drug (AOD) use/abuse prevention and treatment programs, then, reflects in its philosophy An AfrIcan-Centered Model of PreventIon for AfrIcan-AmerIcan Youth at HIgh Risk and practice the cultural precepts, ideas, and beliefs of African and African~ American people. It is grounded in, and based on, the cultural precepts that repre\u00ad sent the cultural substance of African Americans. In terms of African~American culture, eight cultural precepts,listed in fig~ ure 6, have been identified as influencing the general design for living and patterns for interpreting reality in the traditional African-American community. These eight precepts represent the philosophical founda\u00ad tions on which the African-centered model is based. In terms of the model, these precepts are made operational as follows: 1. Consubstantiation assumes that all things in the universe have the same essence. In terms of prevention, this precept sup\u00ad ports, in part, the belief that every per\u00ad son is innately and inherently AOD free and can become free from AOD use/abuse. 2. Interdependence assumes that everything in the universe is connected. In terms of prevention, this precept requires, in part, that the information, the process of knowing, and the knower (Le., the tar\u00ad get population) be cOID'lected for op\u00ad timal information internalization to take place. 3. Egalitarianism assumes that the correct relationship between people is one of harmony and balance. In terms of prevention, this precept requires, in part, that the delivery of services and the process of learning be characterized by cooperation and mutuality between the service provider and the client. 4. Collectivism assumes that individual ef\u00ad fort is a reflection and/or instrument of communal or collective survival/ advancement. In terms of prevention, this precept defines, in part, how the in\u00ad trinsic value of prevention/ intervention activities are related to one's ability to contribute to the well-being and welfare of one's community. 5. Transformation assumes that everything has the potential to continually function at a higher level. In terms of prevention, this precept requires, in part, that the delivery of services (prevention/inter\u00ad vention) be designed to guide each client to a higher level of performance/ functioning and understanding of self, family, and community relative to AOD abuse. 6. Cooperation assumes that the optimal way of functioning is with mutual respect and encouragement. In terms of prevention, this precept requires, in part, that the service delivery process provide clients with the attitude, ability, and willingness to contribute to their own, as well as other, human wellness and fulfillment. 7. Humaneness assumes that all behavior is governed by the sense of vitalism and goodness. In terms of preven tion, this precept requires, in part, that every aspect of the AOD use/abuse preven\u00ad tion process restore and reinforce in each client a compassionate commit\u00ad ment to the common destiny of the client and community well-being and welfare. 8. Synergism assumes that the performance outcomes of cooperative effort is greater than the sum total of individual effort. In terms of prevention, this precept re\u00ad quires, in part, that every aspect of the AOD use/ abuse prevention process complement every other aspect and, in so doing, result in greater resilience in the client and protective facmrs in the community. African-American culture defines and determines effective human functiOning for African Americans. African-American cul\u00ad ture should be understood as a significant intellectual and philosophical tool that directly influences our perception of reality and how we come to develop as fully functioning members of society. Hence, every aspect of the AOD use/abuse preven\u00ad tion process (e.g., program development and management, site leadership, program curriculum,learning styles, instructional techniques) will benefit from the infusion 119 An African-Centered Model of Prevention for African-American Youth at High Risk and/or application of African-American cul\u00ad ture. In utilizing African-American culture in the service of drug use/abuse prevention with African-American youth, a culturally consistent service delivery process would reflect (1) the belief that every African\u00ad American youth can lead an AOD-free life; (2) a process whereby knowing and knowledge are connected directly to the youth; (3) programmatic techniques and practices characterized by cooperation and mutuality; (4) the blending of individual achievement with collective advancement; (5) the desire to continually guide each youth to a higher level of understanding and functiOning; (6) the underlying goal of personally contributing to one's own, as well as everyone's, fulfillment; (7) training and learning linked to the student's and community's well-being and welfare; and (8) a process whereby cooperative effort is used to continually develop and expand the natural resilience of youth. The Cultural Foundations of Program Development Most program developers recognize that program development is always in response to a specific human problem and that there is a direct relationship between identified human needs and human functioning. Specifically, when human needs are being met or satisfied, human functioning reflects that condition. When human needs are not being met or satisfied, human functioning will reflect equally that state or condition. Programs, particularly human services programs, are, in part, created in order to structurally address behavioral dysfunction as a reflection of unrnet human needs. In ef\u00ad fect, the rule of operation is that \"needs\" in\u00ad fluence IJfunction(ing) ,\" which in turn determines IIstructure.\" In regard to human services program development, the formula becomes: liTo the extent that human needs are not satisfied, human dysfunctioning will occur; and, in order to remedy the human dysfunctioning, activity must be developed and structured so as to be responsive to the unmet needs.\" 120 Beyond basic needs imperative for species survival (e.g., sex, food, and shelter), most human needs, as well as the impor\u00ad tance of (and the method for) satisfying human needs are determined by culture. As mentioned above and restated here, culture represents the vast structure of behaviors, ideas, attitudes, values, habits, beliefs, cus\u00ad toms, language, rituals, and practices that give people a IIgeneral design for living and patterns for interpreting reality.\" As such, culture emerges as a dynamic human sys\u00ad tem of features, factors, and functions with sets of guiding principles, a'lsumptions, con\u00ad ventions, beliefs, and rules \\:hat permit and determine how members of a group relate to each other and develop their creative poten\u00ad tial. Hence, if there is a direct relationship be\u00ad tween the meeting of human needs and human functioning, and if the significance of both human needs and functioning is cul\u00ad turally determined, then program develop\u00ad ment must be grounded in the same culture that determines human needs and function\u00ad ing. The cultural grounding of program development is further reinforced by the recognition that the effectiveness of human service programs is maximized when programs are in response to or designed for a particular community, constituency, or clientele. A \"community\" is both an identifi\u00ad able area and collection of people who share a common set of experiences, a world view, and a value system. A \"problem,\" in turn, is any issue, agent, or condition that prevents a person or community from meeting or satisfying their needs and / or achieving a sense of well-being. Hence, in program development, one must make sure that the program in its structure and function is as follows: 1. It is grounded in the same culture that gives meaning to human needs and functions; 2. It is relevant and responds to the condi\u00ad tions in the target community; and 3. It addresses the real (actual) problems experienced and defined by the community. An African-Centered Model of Prevention for African-American Youth at High Risk To ensure the cultural grounding of a program or program development, one must design the program so that it is respon\u00ad sive to both the culture of the community and the concrete conditions (problems) ex\u00ad perienced by the community (figure 7). In so doing, one should be able to demonstrate how the general operational theme or the \"mission statement\" of the pro\u00ad gram is related to the culture of both the community or the client and the problems (concrete conditions) they experience. Figure 7. Culturally consistent program development flow chart Determine Consistency of Program Needs/Characteristics Learning Experience Program Consistency 121 An African-Centered Model of Prevention for African-American Youth at High Risk Having determined the consistency be\u00ad tween the characteristics (structure and function) of the program and its mission statement, a \"culturally consistent pro\u00ad gram\" must also demonstrate how its struc\u00ad ture and functions are designed to accomplish a particular objective. Hence, in terms of program develop\u00ad ment, the learning/training or therapeutic experience, the facility or programmatic en\u00ad vironment, and the training or treatment in\u00ad formation/materials, as well as the teaching or therapeutic techniques and methods, must all reinforce and reflect the desire to accomplish specific program objectives, which are evidenced by specific behavioral outcomes in the community or client population. Five Critical Components of an African-Centered Model of Prevention A program/model of services is generally thought of as a set of activities, courses, and/ or instructions bound by an area of specialization. Its essential components are objectives, content, intent, process, and out\u00ad comes. If the program is to be effective, then it must be consistent with and predictable from the cultural substance of the popula\u00ad tion on whom it is targeted. Accordingly, the philosophical grounding of an African\u00ad centered model of prevention is presented in figure 8. In terms of programmatic activities, we believe that the model should have the fol\u00ad lowing characteristics. Objectives In its objectives the African-centered model aims at the development of a sense of con\u00ad sciousness, confidence, competence, commit\u00ad ment, and character in Black adolescents that would make them contributing mem\u00ad bers to family, community, and society. The program activities must enable African\u00ad American adolescents to believe, and ex\u00ad perience the feeling, that there are positive things they can do well and that benefit the Figure 8.

By prOviding the youth with the opportunities to experience success, the program would help to develop a sense of confidence in these youth. Addi\u00ad tionally, the program would develop com\u00ad petence in the you.th through providing them with opportunities to acquire new skills, knowledge, and practices. Finally, the program activities would develop a sense of consciousness in the adolescents by provid\u00ad ing them with an understanding of their resolute position in world history. If African-American adolescents understand the critical contributions they have made to world civilization, then pride, awareness, and commitment to self, family, and com\u00ad munity would become possible. The essen\u00ad tial task of the service delivery process is to create the conditions wherein youth can ac\u00ad quire essential information about the African and African-American contribution to world civilization. By knowing what was in the past youth can begin to conceive an al\u00ad ternate reality to what is at present. Intent The African-centered model in its intent re\u00ad quires a systematic and intentional process of enculturation, immersion in the African\u00ad centered cultural traditions that provides the basis for insulation, and inoculation of African-American adolescents against con\u00ad temporary pressures to engage in self\u00ad destructive behavior. These cultural traditions provide the basis for the develop\u00ad ment and expansion of the natural resilience factors that exist within youth and that have traditionally enabled African-Americans to overcome some of the worst excesses of racism without being destroyed by the process. It should be clear to all participants in the program activities that there is a cul\u00ad tural basis to the program and that it is rooted in African and African-American traditional cultural precepts. Content The content of the African-centered model should be based on, and reflect, an em\u00ad phasis on spirituality. This emphasis is designed to enable youth to perceive and understand such principles as reciprocity, responsibility, restraint, and respect. The content of the program should serve to develop a consciousness, an awareness, of a Supreme Being and the intimate relation\u00ad ship that exists between human beings and the Supreme Being. The language used in the program should be simple and direct, yet challenging to the target population. In their activities the service providers should make use of symbolic imagery-proverbs, analogies, foLktales, and so on-as a primary mechanism for the transferral of in\u00ad formation. The use of proverbs represents an important teaching process within tradi\u00ad tional African and African-American com\u00ad munities that allows the learner to engage in abstract thinking by applying general principles (the proverb) to a specific situa\u00ad tion (the event). It is through this process of synthesis and induction that the learner comes to acquire knowledge of more com\u00ad plex problems. The details of the content component of the African-centered model of prevention are presented in figure 8. Process (Methods) The prevention specialist is the \"bridge.\" It is the prevention specialist's job to make this information come \"alive.\" The prevention specialist must carry the com\u00ad plex and technical information supporting human growth and development to the life and minds of the Black adolescents. The prevention specialist must be able to trans\u00ad late or exchange the information in the con\u00ad tent component of the program to experiences and applications that the Black adolescents can use and understand. In this regard, the following African\u00ad centered processes (training techniques) should be useful: Dramatic consciousness, Mind modeling, Image and interest discussion/ dialoguing, Culturally consistent problem-solving, 123 An African-Centered Model of Prevention for African-American Youth at High Risk .. Metaphoric memory, and Analogical thinking. Dramatic consciousness is a training and development technique wherein the I;reven\u00ad tion specialist teaches youths (1) the fIve dimensions of consciousness and howover\u00ad all awareness can be reveaied by the acts (drama) one performs; (2) how human con\u00ad sciousness results from the interaction be\u00ad tween (interdependence of) an actor, other actors, the dramatic situation, and the residuals of the various dimensions of con\u00ad sciousness; (3) to use creative drama to help the trainee understand the underlying is\u00ad sues and/ or events that drive feelings, thoughts, and behaviors; and (4) to obtain greater awareness by studying the verbal and nonverbal \"script\" of both the actors and the situation, combined with thp. ap\u00ad propriate dimension of consciousness. When youths analyze and understand these relationships, this gives greater meaning to awareness and lJrovides them with a better understanding ~f what is really happening. Mind modeling is a training and develop\u00ad ment technique whereby the prevention specialist utilizes the African-centered ideas, as represented in the lives and work of African and African-American men and women of excellence, to think and act dif\u00ad ferently about situations and problems. In so doing, this tEchnique replaces the trainees' destructive and deviant ideas (thinking) with ideas that are positive and consistent with the cultural precepts and ideas of African people. Image and interest discussion/dialoguing is a training and development technique whereby the prevention specialist teaches youths to (1) locate the image and interest of their own cultural reality in the discus\u00ad sion/ dialogue, and (2) use the image and in\u00ad terest of their cultural reality as the basis for appropriately responding to issues and problems they confront. Culturally consistent problem-solving is a training and development technique by which the prevention specialist teaches youths to develop strategies or solutions 1.24 that will (1) eliminate and/or oppose any condition, situation, or agent that prevents the positive development of themselves, their families, and their communities; and (2.) create and/or reinforce those situations, conditions, or agents that foster positive growth an? develop~ent of the~~elves, their families, and theIr commuruties. Metaphoric memory is a training and development technique wherein the preven\u00ad tion specialist teaches the youth how to go from the known to the unknown via tl:le metaphoric device of comparing the under\u00ad lying, invisible, and/or implied principles, attributes, and qualities of the known to the task of understanding the unknown. By stimulating the memory of known things, especially with proverbs, one is able to apply the principles, attributes, and/ or qualities of the known phenomena to ac\u00ad quire an understanding of the unknown. Analogical thinking is a thought process that (1) utilizes a reference system as an aid to conceptualization and (2) focuses on the identification of \"relationships\" and/or similarities among experiences or phenomena, and thereby reveals the \"syn\u00ad thetic quality\" and \"synergistic capacity\" of all phenomena. In so doing, the analogical process provides thinking with an ever moving and ever flowing quality, as well as the ability to produce a greater effect than the sum of the individual thoughts (ideas) connected by eiU1er inductive or deductive linkages. This model, then, in its process includes a set of thinking, feeling, and doing ac\u00ad tivities that enable African-American adoles\u00ad cents to internalize the African-centered cultural precepts and stimulate the youtI:s' natural resilience against disorder and dIS\u00ad ease. In terms of the process, the African~ centered model must include the same set of symbols and rituals that derive from the cultural precepts. Simply stated, the programmalic activities must involve a set of rituals, ceremonies, and practices that provide for the expression of a sense of humaneness and respect for self and others. For example, youth should serve the elders An African-Centered Model of Prevention for African-American Youth at High Risk and honor and respect them. Similarly, the program site should be decorated to repre\u00ad sent the image of African-Americans, with bright colors, pictures, and symbols of African society and the African-American contribution. Outcomes The African-centered model of prevention suggests the need for the acquisition of a core set of knowledge, attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors that serve as indicators of success\u00ad ful completion of the particular program ac\u00ad tivities. The core knowledge required is that which enables African-American adoles\u00ad cents to maintain their cultural identity and function effectively in an information\u00ad producing and -consuming society. The pro\u00ad gram must, of necessity, include an education component that motivates and in\u00ad spires youths to pursue their education to the fullest. To this end, the African-centered model would provide for an educational thrust that would focus on and reinforce the basic educational skills that enable youth to transcend and transform the delimiting na\u00ad ture of the school system. The core set of at\u00ad titudes that are needed in this process is an understanding of spirituality. Spirituality here refers to the process of understanding the dynamic and interactional relationship between and among elements in the universe. Spirituality is an inner feeling that reveals itself in an understanding of the universe and its operation and attitudes of humaneness and concern for the welfare of others. It manifests itself in behaviors that speak of a sense of being in the service of others rather than in the form of personal self\u00b7\u00b7aggrandizement. The African-centered model has at its center a basic set of values representing the set of guiding principles that determine how the individual lives. The African-centered model does not promote values clarification as a framework for prevention. Through the model the in\u00ad dividual receives a set of values that repre\u00ad sent how he should live his life, and these are standards to which the youth should be held accountable. One core set of values that is useful is the principle of Maat\u00ad values of truth, justice, righteousness, propriety, balance, harmony, and order. Another value system is the nguzo saba, developed and responsibility), ujamaa (cooperative economics), nia (purpose), kuumba (creativity), and imimi (faith). Whatever the system adopted, youths are provided with a set of guiding principles, an ethosic order that governs their social conduct. The African-centered model would produce be\u00ad haviors that represent a sense of commit\u00ad ment to the greater good. In its philosophy, process, and practice the model indicates that the well-being and welfare of the group take precedence over the individual's .. In this sense, youths become contributing members to their families, communities, and society. A feature of the African\u00ad centered model is that youths should do something to make their community a bet\u00ad ter place than it was before. In essence, the transformation produced by the African\u00ad centered model manifests itself in terms of feelings of achieved internal development, excellence in social relations, and sociohis\u00ad torical service and achievement. These char\u00ad acteristics are expressed in the form of moral character, social responsibility, and human conduct governed by a devotion to a higher purpose. The expected behavioral outcomes are summarized in figure 9. These features of the program aspects of the African-centered model are presented in figure 10. The African-centered model of preven\u00ad tion, with its basis of holistic, humanistic, and naturalistic orientation, implies dealing with the totality of the individual's exist\u00ad ence. It should address the social, physical, spiritual, and mental aspects of you ths. It cannot be just an alcohol and other drug (AOD) use prevention program. It has to go beyond the prevention activities and begin to address issues of development in the broader context. Thus, the content of the African-centered model shou1d provide 125 An African-Centered Model of Prevention for African-American Youth at High Risk Figure 9. Desired outcomes of Afrocentric model of prevention Attribute Expressed In Behavioral Modalities Behavior governed by sense of Competence Human Conduct Purpose Planning Productivity Persistence Patience Confidence Social Responsibility Duty Desire Devotion Discipline Consciousness Moral Character Respect youths with the psychosocial skills and at\u00ad tributes that increase their capacity to resist negative environmental influences. The African-centered model should have as a central feature an opening and closing ritual that reaffirms the sense of connectedness and interdependence created in the pro\u00ad gram. The program should use symbols rep\u00ad resentative of the importance and achievement of Africans and African\u00ad Americans in the development of world civilization. The teaching of an African\u00ad centered history is critical in the content of the African-centered model in that it would provide youth with an understanding of the resolute position of Africans and African\u00ad Americans in relationship to world rwe and governance. Other symbols used in the model would be the wearing of kente cloth on occasions of honor and establishment of a dress code with formal and informal dress for project participants, such a code serving as a source of identification and as repre\u00ad sentative of the image the program is trying to project. 126 Restraint Responsibility Reciprocity Righteousness The African-centered model should place heavy emphasis on the traditional cw\u00ad tural themes of the sense of excellence and the sense of appropriateness. The sense of excellence requires that the service providers challenge the youths in the pro\u00ad gram to be the very best they can, that high standards of achievement are set for the youths, that the youths know what the ex\u00ad pectations are, and that the youths collec\u00ad tively strive toward these levels of achievement. The service providers would be doing a disservice if they allowed the completion of activities without setting standards and holding the youths to the ex\u00ad pectations. Holding youths accountable for their performance assists them in develop\u00ad ing a sense of discipline necessary to ensure success. The sense of appropriateness re\u00ad quires that behavior be governed by notions of formality, civility, and deference. The youths have to understand that, while we recognize the principle of interdependence and interconnectedness, there still exists a clear distinction between and among in\u00ad dividuals and that these distinctions need to , An African-Centered Model of Prevention for African-American Youth at High Risk Figure 10.

Thus, the pro\u00ad gram should emphasize the principle of eldership whereby elders (anyone older than the youths) are respected; the practice of entitlement by which one refers to others by tenns of relationship and thereby treats them with dignity (an older person or some\u00ad one in authority is not referred to by a first name, but by titles like Miss, Mister, Auntie, Momma, Poppa, Uncle, and so on); and ap\u00ad propriate language to suit the occasion. 127 An African-Centered Model of Prevention for African-American Youth at High Risk African-Centered Evaluation Criteria for Program Components The development of the African-centered model provides some broad operationaliza\u00ad tion of the core cultural precepts that pro\u00ad vide the general design for living and patterns for interpreting reality for the African-American community. As such, these philosophical principles provide some guidelines for the evaluation of programs targeted on the African-American com\u00ad munity. These guidelines are provided here. Objectives To the extent that the program objectives focus on collective development and/ or transformation, they can be judged as cul\u00ad turally consistent with African-centered cul\u00ad tural precepts. Intent As far as the program intent can be judged as r~.inforcing and respecting the develop\u00ad ment of a being in harmony with the vital goodness of oneself, one's family, and one's community, it can be judged as culturally consistent with African-centered cultural precepts. Content To the extent that the program content shows evidence of materials, ideas, and information reflective of the image (any representation, reproduction, likeness, or impression of African peoples that symbol\u00ad izes and / or reflects the basic quality and na\u00ad ture of a people) and interest (any thing or attribute belonging to, and consistent with, the benefit, growth, and development of a people) of African people, it can be judged as culturally consistent with African\u00ad centered cultural precepts. Process (Method) To the extent that the program process (method) shows evidence o{ being based on 128 a strategy that promotes collective attach\u00ad ment, a sense of self-worth, and recognition and respect for self, family, and community, then it can be judged as culturally consistent with African-centered cultural precepts. Outcome To the extent that the proposed program outcome is a human being who is spiritually rejuvenated, has love of self, family, and community and is willing and able to re\u00ad spect, protect, and defend self, family, and community, then it can be judged as cul\u00ad turally consistent with African-centered cul\u00ad tural precepts. In working with youth at risk from an African-centered perspective, the objective of the prevention/intervention program is the development of a particular kind of hu\u00ad man being who is aware (with knowledge), and can express a sense of unity or collec\u00ad tive self. The content of the prevention pro\u00ad gram sh3ll reflect the same set of signs, symbols, rituals, and practices that give meaning and direction to proper conduct in the African-American community. The process of the African-centered model of prevention shall similarly reflect, for ex\u00ad ample, the practices of harmony and balance. The outcome of the prevention ac\u00ad tivity is a person who is cooperative; who understands and respects the sameness of self, as well as the diversity and difference of forms characteristic of the community; and who has a high sense of responsibility to self, family, and community. An African\u00ad centered prevention program aims to develop a person who is committed to the welfare and well-being of the larger entity rather than to individual self-actualization. That is, the African-centered model calls for the development of a person guided by the concept of \"right conduct,\" which implies the notions of moral character, social respon\u00ad sibility, and devotion to a higher purpose. A person who possesses these characteristics is less likely to engage in such dysfunctional behavior as AOD use/abuse.

George Philosophical Foundations of the African-Centered Paradigm The African-centered paradigm repre\u00ad sents an important philosophical and theoretical concept in the understanding of the African-American experience. The African-centered paradigm is a quality of thought and practice rooted in the cultural image and interest of African people. The African-centered paradigm reaffirms the right of Africans to (1) exist as a people, (2) contribu te to the forward flowing process of human civilization and culture, and (3) share with as well as shape the world in response to our energy and spirit. The African-centered paradigm takes the life experiences, history, and traditions of African people as the center of one's analysis. The paradigm represents an impor\u00ad tant paradigmatic shift in the social-scien\u00ad tific analysis of African-American experience. As a scientific paradigm, it sug\u00ad gests to the scientist what is important for consideration and how he or she should view the unit of analysis. In effect, the African-centered paradigm represents a for\u00ad malized framework that guides the assess\u00ad ment of African reality, and should be the framework the scientist brings to bear on the analysis of any African-American phenomenon (e.g\" alcohol and oti1er drug abuse), 131 An AfTlcan-Centered Model of Prevention for AfTlcan-Amerlcan Youth at High Risk When African-American scholars began to question the validity of the philosophical basis of Western social science for explain\u00ad ing the African-American experience, they started the process of reformulating or recentering the paradigm for the analysis of that experience. The current African\u00ad centered movement is the continuation of a long tradition of questioning Western social science's ability to explain the Black ex\u00ad perience, which was marked by the works of George James, Joel Rogers, and others who engaged in the reanalysis of Black his\u00ad torical experiences. The following list represents some of the major theoretical writings on the African\u00ad centered perspective. The reading list is or\u00ad ganized in three general sections. The first section provides some of the key writings of the initial group of scholars who began to ar\u00ad ticulate the call for the centrality of culture in the analysis of social phenomena. The African scholar, Cheikh Anta Diop, provided the theoretical framework that expanded on, and validated, the earlier works of scholars like J. A. Rogers, George James, and John Jackson. Diop, in Africa, and John Henrik Oarke and Ben-Jochannan, in America, represent the in\u00ad tellectual giants from whose work the African\u00ad centered paradigm developed. The second section represents the ac\u00ad complishr~<.:'nts of the second wave in the development of the African-centered perspectives. Contemporary scholars like Molefi Asante, Karenga, Na'im Akbar, and Wade Nobles expanded upon and refined the theoretical orienta\u00ad tions developed by the first generation of African-centered scholars. The third section of the readings provides a list of some of the contemporary applications of the African-centered ap\u00ad proach to the analYSis of the African\u00ad American experience. These writings cover a broad spectrum of issues and concerns and reflect the diversity of the African\u00ad centered approach. Use of the Reading List This reading list is broad in scope and depth. It represents the historical growth and development of the concept African\u00ad centrism and its application in the analysis of the Black experience. It represents, in part, the critical background preparation necessary for the development of authentic and accurate interpretation of the African experience and the empowerment of African-Americans. Prevention practitioners should help community people, where pos\u00ad sible, to organize study groups14 to read, discuss, evaluate, and apply the information provided in these readings. There is a variety of ways that study groups can be put together. Existing groups, be they religiOUS, fraternal, social, or civic, can set aside some time to study the reading list selections as part of their regular program activities. Community-based organizations can develop study groups that bring together clients to work through the materials in the reading list. Families can es\u00ad tablish a practice of one hour of study and reading per week with the reading list as the framework for study and discussion. An individual can invite one other person to join him or her one day of the week to work through the materials provided. Prevention workers can utilize the readLTlgs to develop criteria for judging the cultural consistency, appropriateness, and relevance of their practice. The potential impact of the reading list can be awesome in that the study groups can form the basis for fami! y reunification, community revitalization, and community empowerment. As individuals, families, and groups study, digest, and reflect on the materials in the reading list, they can begin 14 See Rabishi, The Association for the Study of Oassica1 African Civilizations (ASCAC) Study Group Guide 1991, for examples and guidelines for organizing and managing stu?-y groups. 132 the process of redefining their own reality and response to that reality. In a real sense, the community would become empowered. I. Classical Sources Ben-Jochannan, Y.A.A. African Mothers' Western Civilization. New York: Alkebu-Ian Books, 1971. Ben-Jochannan, Y.A.A.

Key Concepts and Definitions Relative to African-Centered Prevention The flUldamental premise guiding an African-centered model of prevention is the notion that the most effective preven\u00ad tion techniques are those activities and processes that promote a natural resistance to pathology. African-centered paradigm This is a term categorizing a quality of thought and practice that is rooted in the cultural image and interest of African people and that represents and reflects the life experiences, history, and traditions of African people as the center of analyses. Africentric (see Afrocentrism) Afrocentricity (see Afrocentrism) Afrocentrism This term refers to and is responsible for (1) the intellectual and philosophical fOlUlda\u00ad tions upon which African peoples create their own scientific criterion for authenticat\u00ad ing African reality, (2) African peoples' self\u00ad conscious act of creating (African) history, (3) the utilization of the African experience as the core paradigm for higher-level human functioning and liberty, and (4) the continuing quest for an indigenous African\u00ad centered historical and cultural anchor. This reaffirms the right of African people to exist as a people, contribute to the forward flow\u00ad ing process of human civilization and cul\u00ad ture, and to share with as well as shape the world in response to our energy and spirit. Attitude This is a particular state of mind, an opinion, or a feeling about something that lnfluences one's behavior or response toward the thing or person. Axiology This is a component of the cultural factor level that pertains to a people's assump\u00ad tions or beliefs about the primary charac\u00ad teristics of uni versal relationships. Behavior This is a particular manner of conducting oneself or acting in a given circumstance or situation. Belief This is an idea, concept, or notion held to be true or actual, or a mental conviction regard\u00ad ing a set of opinions or principles. Ceremony This is a special, regulated form or set of dignified and usually traditional practices or acts performed in a prescribed manner and only on special occasions. Community This means any identifiable area that (1) has recognizable bOlUldaries (is locatable in time and space); (2) can be defined by its sharing of a common set of experiences, world view, value system, and social institu\u00ad tions; and (3) has a sense of its own \"being\u00ad ness.\" Community empowerment It is the process of developing and I or en\u00ad abling a people to create experiences that are simultaneously designed to represent 141 An African-Centered Model of Prevention for African-American youth at High Risk their view of the world and to secure and/or establish the greater community well-being and welfare. ConSUbstantiation The African ontological precept asserts that the essence of all things is of the same sub\u00ad stance (Le., spirit or energy). This is the root foundation of African-American culture. In effect, we are one because we essentially have the :Jame spirit. Core culture The central portion, strand, or essence of \"the process which gives the group its general design for living and patterns for in\u00ad terpreting reality.\" It is the \"essential spirit\" or energy of the group that characterizes and is reflected in all processes consistent with the group's cultural reality. Cosmology Cosmology is a component of the cultural factor that pertains to a people's assump\u00ad tions or beliefs about the origin and the structure of reali ty (universe). Culture Culture is a human process representing the vast structure of behaviors, ideas, attitudes, values, habits, beliefs, customs, language, rituals, ceremonies, and practices peculiar to a particular group of people, and that provides the people with a general design for living and patterns for interpreting reality. Cultural aspects The cultural aspects comprise ideology, ethos, and world view. Cultural competence This refers to the capacity of an agency and / or object to accept, respect, and give at\u00ad tention to cultural differences. However, if culture is the process that gives a people a general design for living and patterns for in- 142 terpreting reality, and if competence is having the capacity to perfonn a task and/ or know something exceptionally welt then cultural competence should refer to an agency's and/or agent's capacity to under\u00ad stand the knowledge, values, beliefs, and so on, and to perfonn the behaviors (tasks) belonging to a particular cultural com\u00ad munity. Cultural consistency This refers to the criteria that personal and programmatic activity (e.g., behaviors, values, attitudes, beliefs, policies, practices, procedures) must be congruent within the cultural orientation and precepts of a par\u00ad ticular target population. Cultural factors The cultural factors comprise ontology, cos\u00ad mology, and axiology. Cultural manifestations The cultural manifestations are the overt ex\u00ad pressions of a people's culture. They consist of behavior, values, attitudes, and so forth. The cultural manifestations may be authen\u00ad tic, adapted, adopted, or aberrant. Cultural orientation This is a people's generalized perception regarding who they are and what is their resolute position and purpose in the world. It is expressed as a set of themes and values. Cultural postUlates Within the \"thematic imprint\" of a people's cultural orientation, there are basic under\u00ad lying postulates or \"cultural postulates\" about the nature of reality and the ap\u00ad propriateness or utility of particular pat\u00ad terns of conduct. The cultural postulates of a people are revealed in the flow of human thought and action as they relate to and/ or result from the need to develop solutions to common human problems. Cultural sensitivity This refers to the goal of developing an ap\u00ad preciation or admiration for the cultural manifestations <e.g., styles, music, habits, customs) of a particular target population. Cultural substance Cultural substance is a term used to connote the \"aspect\" and \"factor\" levels of the cul\u00ad tural model. Its importance is that the cul\u00ad tural substance gives \"meaning\" to the overt manifestations of a people's culture (Le., their human conduct). Cultural themes They are dynamic affirmations (Le., self\u00ad evident truths) that structure the nature of reality and reflect a people's purpose and their indigenous rules for responding to human experience. Cultural values A complex pattern of attitudes, beliefs, and ideas that give order and direction to human conduct. Development This is any identifiable and measurable change locatable in time and space and recognizable by the senses. Ethos An ethos is the tor,e; character, and quality of a people's life, its moral and aesthetic style and mode. It emerges as a set of guid\u00ad ing principles that define the underlying at\u00ad titude people have toward themselves and their world. Growth This refers to any identifiable and measurable change locatable in time and space and recognizable by the senses. Key Concepts and Definitions Human imperatives Human imperatives are those processes and functions that must be performed in order for a people to continue as a group irrespec\u00ad tive of cultural form. Idea This is a single thought or theme estab\u00ad lished in the mind. Identity In regard to the psychology of a people, the principle of identity reveals and determines the form in which a people's human energy is structured, Identity is the component of oneself that is determined by one's cultural definition(s), and most closely represents and reflects who and how you are. Ideology Ideology is essentially a concept repre\u00ad senting the instrument that provides a cri\u00ad tique of reality. It determines how a people should see its reali tyi and, in so doing, in\u00ad fluences (pOSSibly dictates) the nature of a people's awareness (consciousness). Ideol\u00ad ogy serves as the \"map\" that clarifies and gives perspective to problematic aspects of a people's social reality. Image Image is any representation, reproduction, likeness, or impreSSion of a people and/ or that symbolically stands for, or reflects, the basic quality and nature of a people. Institutions Institutions are clearly defined units with rules, roles, and structures organized for the purpose of task fulfillment and human need satisfaction. Interest Interest is any thing or attribute belonging to, and consistent with, the benefit, growth, and development of a people. 143 An African-Centered Model of Prevention for African-American Youth at High Risk Interpersonal relations Interpersonal relations refer to the charac\u00ad teristic relations within the organized pat\u00ad tern. Moat This is a system of ethics based on the seven cardinal virtues of truth, justice, righteous\u00ad ness, propriety, balance, harmony, and order. Microaggressions They are small-scale affronts and assaults to the psyche of individuals that limit people in their attempts to realize basic human needs. Offensive put-downs They are social affronts or trace con\u00ad taminants that promote acceptance of a devalued state and a sense of helplessness and hopelessness. Ontology Ontology is a component of the cultural fac\u00ad tor level that pertains to a people's assump\u00ad tions or beliefs about the nature of existence or the essence of being. Organizational purpose Organizational purpose refers to the primary purpose of being for the organiza\u00ad tion, its raison d' etre. Hence, it selects and determines what is of importance to the or\u00ad ganization. Paradigm A scientific paradigm serves as the formal\u00ad ized framework that guides the assessment and evaluation of reality. The paradigm is, therefore, a perceptual, cognitive, and affec\u00ad tive achievement representing the organiza\u00ad tional process for understanding. It is the singular screen through which all under\u00ad standing is filtered. 144 Philosophy This is the original synthesis of knowledge; the attitude to the world and to life's problems; the elaboration, often implicit and more confusedly felt than clearly ex\u00ad pressed, of a cosmology. Power Power is the ability to define reality and have other people respond to your defini\u00ad tion as if it were their own. Practice Anything habitually done or repeatedly per\u00ad formed in order to become more proficient in a skill or attitude is a practice. Prevention Prevention refers to both the formal and in\u00ad formal processes or set of activities designed to simultaneously inhibit the sus\u00ad ceptibility to and/or involvement in destruc\u00ad tive and/or dysfunctional behavior and to enhance the positive functioning. The pur\u00ad pose of prevention is to inhibit and/ or halt disease and debilitation by increasing resilience and protective factors within in\u00ad dividuals. Racism This is an unfounded hatred and fear of a ra\u00ad cially different group accompanied by the desire and/ or power to dominate and destroy individually and/ or collectively that which is hated and feared. Relational essences The dimensions of human functioning char\u00ad acterized by interactive and reciprocal processes and relationships that, upon being satisfied, result in the sense of human well-being. Ritual This is a prescribed and rule-governed form or method / procedures for the performance of a solemn and/or sacred event denoting a significant change. Role relations Role relations refer to the proper and/ or customary functions of members of the or\u00ad ganiza tion. Social organization By social organization we refer to the or\u00ad ganized pattern of relations within the or\u00ad ganization. In a general sense, social organization refers to the ethos or set of guiding principles by which the organiza\u00ad tion operates and by which its members must abide. \u00b7U.S. Govornmant Printing Office: 1993 -715-025188025 Key Concepts and Definitions Synergy This is the combined or correlated action of a group of organs or agents whose total ef\u00ad fect is greater than the sum of the individual efforts. In theology, synergy is the combin\u00ad ing of human will with divine grace, which results in \"regeneration.\" World view A people's world view is its picture of the way things in sheer actuality are, the con\u00ad cept of nature, of self, and of society. It con\u00ad tains the people's most comprehensi ve ideas of order. 145 Prepared and published by the Center for Substance Abuse Prevention and distributed by CSAP's National Clearinghouse for Alcohol and Drug Information P.O.
