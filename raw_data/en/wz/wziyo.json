As afollow-up at a Steering Group meeting in Brussels (February 2001) a new foresightactivity on the techno-economic and social impact of enlargement was launchedthe 'Enlargement Futures' project matching both the format of the 'Futures'project and its policy relevance.The 'Enlargement Futures' project examines the main contemporary technological,economic, political and social drivers in the candidate countries and their possibleimpact on technology/science, competitiveness and employment in the enlargedUnion with a time horizon of ten years. In order to achieve its objectives the projectinvolves experts from PACs and EU countries in an interactive process based onworkshops and seminars and supported by background research. The project isstructured around four clusters of issues and challenges for the development ofPACs and their corresponding thematic panels:Economic transformationTechnology, knowledge and learningEmployment and societal changeSustainability, environment and natural resources see meeting notes of 'Prospective Dialogue on EU-Enlargement: Science, Technology and Society', Tallinn/Estonia,September 13/14, 2000, http://www.jrc.es/projects/enlargement/ r4 Table of Contents Executive Summary 3Panel objectives and methodology 10Introduction 11Why the focus on Technology, Knowledge and Learning? 11 Chapter 1Science and Technology Strategies 131.1Science-, technology- research and emerging S&T frontiers 14Issue driven research 211.2 Effective governance of science and technology 22Introduction 22Issues of S&T governance in PACs 23Future directions for S&T policy 31Chapter 2 Knowledge institutions and capacities 332.1 Towards a new knowledge infrastructure 33Introduction 33The system of research and innovation 33Future models of research 402.2 Technology transfer and innovation 41Introduction 41Knowledge and technology flows 41Innovation performance and demand by industry 442.3 Scientific human resources and mobility 47Introduction 47Preserving and building of new assets 48Mobility of researchers in enlarged European Union 502.4 New environment for research and innovation 52Chapter 3 Learning Capabilities 553.1 Training and skills mismatch 55Introduction 55Vocational qualifications and the high tech economy 55Reforming vocational training provision 563.2 Towards world class higher education and training 58Introduction 58Higher education trends 58Accreditation and transferability of skills 623.3 The right to education and the danger of 'dual society' 63Introduction 63Present educational gaps 63Vision 66Future Steps 69Where next? 69Cross-cutting issues to develop 69Science derived Science and Technology priority areas 83Annex 11-2: S&T priorities in recent major prospective studies 90Annex III: Science and Technology framework and priorities in pre-accession countries 94 Executive SummaryIntroductionThe coming ten years will provide a period of possibly unparalleled opportunity forrenewal of the science and technology (S&T) base and the building of necessaryknowledge-society capacities and capabilities in the Pre-Accession Countries (PACs). Thedrive towards restructuring and modernisation of innovation systems at the national leveland towards changing the learning environment in candidate countries is taking place at thesame time as the development of European S&T and education shifts gear, with the launchof the European Research Area (ERA) and the e-Learning initiative respectively. Thepossibilities for synergies and an opening up of national systems provides a one-off chancefor the PACs to find a fast track towards full integration in the European research andknowledge system.However, turning opportunities into reality presents great challenges. In this paper we try tooutline some of the central areas for action today in order that PACs will be able to becomeintegral players in tomorrow's European knowledge-based society. It is important to notethat these actions are aimed not just at the PACs governments and people, but call for aconcerted effort from EU15 member states and industry in order to achieve an effectivemodernisation process.Science and technology strategiesMany PACs particularly the Central and Eastern European Countries (CEECs) have a longtradition of high quality fundamental science and historically prestigious researchinstitutions. The period of transition has eroded the stability that S&T needs in order toflourish, and there has been a squeeze on existing institutions and considerable strains toadapt. Despite these strains, the greater openness of national research systems is leading totheir (re-) integration into the international science base.Other pre-accession countries, such as Malta, Turkey and Cyprus may have notexperienced the structural shocks of transition, but are nevertheless faced with seriouschallenges to carve out a position in the European Research Area and indeed the GlobalS&T system.Whilst fundamental science has held up quite well over the past decade, applied research inCEECs has faced a major downsize. This has accompanied the collapse of industrialresearch activity and the privatisation of public enterprises. In general, there is an urgentneed to redress the balance in the research and development (R&D) systems and toincrease or further adapt applied research to serve the needs of a technologically advancedeconomy.For all PACs the next few years will be ones in which it will be necessary to pursue astrategic pathway to (re-) establish critical competencies and capacities in the key areaschosen. It is necessary to be selective regarding the areas in which excellence is sought; todecide in which areas the search for excellence is a plain necessity, in which areas a lowprofile should be maintained and from which research areas the countries should withdrawaltogether. These considerations form part of a strategy of specialisation on the basis of 36 international synergies as well as competitiveness. They invoke tough choices for allcountries, not just for PACs. This is of course a central theme of the policy framework ofERA. Today even the wealthiest economies can no longer pursue a fully comprehensiverange of S&T options to the highest level priorities have to be set.A closer look at the stated research priorities in published national policy frameworks inPACs indicates a mirroring of priorities that are found across EU Member States andat European level in the Framework Programme. Most national programmes reveal astrong continuation of supply-side driven priorities (i.e. scientific and technologicalopportunity and interests) including emergent 'hot themes' such as biotechnology,nanotechnology, advanced materials and strategic necessitieslikeinformation andcommunication technologies (ICTs). It would be appropriate to investigate the relationshipbetween the priorities selected and the research that is really needed in PACs. Perhapssome research areas are earmarked more as a matter of national pride because they arecutting edge areas. Meanwhile, many national S&T plans also do include issue-drivenpriorities although it is often not clear how they are established. The issues are oftencountry-specific and include ageing population, knowledge-society technologies, specificenvironmental protection demands (coastal margins, natural resources and renewables),cultural identity, linguistic and heritage factors.In particular, we have not been able to relate levels of investments in researchcompetencies to the identified priorities. There is no clear relation between priorities andresources that might send signals about how priority planning affects budget allocation. Forexample, given severely limited resources, it might be that the need to align S&T efforts toexternal funding (such as the EU Framework Programmes) may mean that research effortsare diverted away from domestic strategic capacities and needs.The central challenge therefore relates to the overall system of S&T governance, andconcerns the ways in which the demand and supply of S&T are balanced. On the onehand, a stable and high-level support for fundamental science is needed in order to developa self-sustaining S&T system. But, not all areas can be supported. The choice of what tosupport should be driven by analysis of existing and potential excellence and its relations tospecific demands of the country and its regions. Such decision-making requires the supportof detailed benchmarking of existing performance, and an open process involving allstakeholders in a debate on the identification and setting of priorities. It also requires thedevelopment of a long-term and strategic view of S&T as part of national positioningin its wider context, and one which differentiates between the challenges faced at local,regional and international level.So far, only a few PACs have moved towards such transparency in S&T governanceand only in a partial way covering some constituencies (i.e. based on the efforts of oneministry or a sectoral theme). Efforts such as the foresight exercises in Hungary, Poland,the Czech Republic and Malta may provide a model for a way forward. But there is still along way to go to achieve wide acceptance of these more open systems of governance.PACs are facing the challenge to move from rhetoric to reality in S&T policy. Newmechanisms are needed to implement S&T plans and to allocate the limited financialresources to research really needed by the industry and the society. This implies, amongother things, transparent, open and competitive procedures and criteria. Systematicevaluation of research results and the socio-economic impact of policy measures will also 47 be an important tool of S&T strategy aimed at quality and excellence of research and itsutilisation by industry and society.Knowledge institutions and capacitiesAn essential prerequisite to proper S&T governance is to establish a clear picture of thesupply and demand of S&T and the functioning of the whole research, development andinnovation (RDI) system. This picture is made up first of the research competencies thatconstitute the institutional base of a knowledge economy and the interactions for research,education and innovation. Secondly, there is the demand side and the industrial capacity toabsorb new knowledge and technology. Thirdly, and equally important, there are the peoplethat do researchthe human resources that give life and motion to the knowledge society.In recent years PACs have been following different development tracks and as a resultmany of the R&D institutions left today are self-governing and autonomous, signalling thatgreater openness has been achieved. Recent data giving an aggregate comparison betweensome PACs and current EU members paint a positive picture, suggesting that the PACshave the potential to sustain high-level research systems, at least on a par with severalcurrent EU Member States. However, while such data certainly do give grounds for hope, itwould be premature to assume that the work of reconstructing the knowledge infrastructurehas mostly been done.The main problems relate now in all PACs to the fragmentation of the RDI system, basedon the lack of interaction between the main actors, and thus its insufficient efficiency. Thehistory of central planning in CEECs and the reliance on public funding sources haveinhibited the growth of business-research linkages, and this contributes to the difficultiesthat public research institutes face today. Branch research institutes meanwhile have severedifficulties to retain professional equipment and their best staff.Problems of data collection leave us uncertain whether the quality and relevance of theS&T base is suited to the needs of a knowledge economy, but certainly the lack of scaleand fragmentation of the institutions is a problem. Upgrading and updating the appliedresearch capacity and connecting it to the industrial demand side are therefore urgentpriorities for most candidate countries. There is no set pattern for achieving this upgradingin all PACs. But present developments reveal three important and promising trends thatcould provide a starting point: 1) the strengthening of research teams at universities, 2)the emergence of self-standing centres of excellence, and 3) the growing participationof PAC research teams in multinational research projects.It is often claimed that there is a lack of industrial demand for the services that researchinstitutes can offer. However, competition is driving domestic industry to innovate andapply new technologies, to develop new products or upgrade their quality to meet therequirements of the customers or gain new market positions. Thus, some enterprises arestarting to collaborate with universities or to buy-in the services of individual researchers ona part-time basis. Some others are building up in-house research capacity or turning toemerging players that offer knowledge-intensive services.The survival of the companies has been highly dependent on the speed of change in theirproductivity and competitiveness and thus the ability for fast acquisition and applicationof new technologies. Presently, the main mechanisms for technology transfer in candidatecountries are mostly indirect such as: 5 The inward transfer of 'hard' (product, process) or 'soft' (management) technology,mainly by foreign direct investment (FDI);The integration of localfirms into theinternational production chain bysubcontracting, outsourced assembly processes, provision of distribution services,reverse engineering of products and/or customised production and design;Forging co-operative industrial alliances with foreign partners and learning-by-trad ing.Direct technology transfer is limited to interchange of personnel (spin-offs from researchunits or researcher-led start-ups) and is rather small scale.While foreign direct investment is considered a key vehicle for technology transfer inPACs, it is supported by changes in large domestic enterprises, which have often followed apattern of privatisation and subsequent conversion into subsidiaries or specialised suppliersto multinational corporations. This internationalisation of ownership however rarely resultsin demands on local fundamental research capabilities. However, the need to adapttechnology tolocal circumstances has been facilitated by the availability ofknowledgeable individuals. In addition there are some important examples, where ahighly qualified research workforce has attracted foreign investors to exploit domesticresearch capacity, e.g. Nokia in Estonia and Knorr-Bremse, Ericsson and Siemens inHungary.Generally, bottom-up activities are driving domestic innovation in candidate countries. Thisinvolves collaboration of industry with engineers and scientists or groups of researchers,and networking of enterprises. However, the crucial issue for the further development ofapplied research in PACs is to wire-up the innovation system by encouraginginteraction between business, educational and research institutions. This requires flexibleconfigurations and direct engagement of industrialists in the process of application of newtechnologies. It points towards corporate innovation networks, strategic alliances, andmultidisciplinary research centres. Given that in many cases they are starting from scratchthere may be opportunities for leapfrogging by the creation of new S&T institutions thatmatch the demands of the knowledge society. For example:Build-in industry-university links ftom the start by co-financed laboratories andtechnology centres. Incentives for private sector researchers to work in highereducation on a part-time basis. Flexible career paths between public and privateresearch.Encouragement of intermediaries such as technology transfer centres, privateresearch foundations, industrial associations, chambers of commerce and non-governmental organisations (NG0s).Development of poles of excellence in order to catalyse excellence and competenceat the urban or regional level, by attracting leading researchers to join forces onprojects of regional, national or international importance.The establishment of an environment that fosters innovation culture, encouragesenterprises to innovate and protects industrial and intellectual property rights is animportant condition for building a coherent knowledge system and the take up ofinnovation and technological modernisation in candidate countries.The third, vital, ingredient is scientific human capital. The abrupt decrease in researchcapacity in CEECs, the limited inflow of young people in research career and the more 69 generalised threat of brain drain lead to fears that the lifeblood of research is underthreat. The loss of talented people through emigration to Western Europe and beyondis probably less significant than the 'brain loss' of researchers leaving the scientificlabour force altogether. However, for the whole society this loss might have had thepositive effect of increasing the quality of workers in other economic sectors. Forexample, a positive by-product is that researchers may start their own technology-based companies and hence contribute to growth of innovation activities of theindustry.The market economy sets new requirements for the R&D workforce to developmanagement and marketing skills necessary for the competition for funding, for co-operation with industry and with the international scientific community. Significant policyattention is devoted in PACs also to attracting young researchers into research careers.One aspect is the targeted replacement and updating of the research equipment so that it ispossible for researchers and university teachers to pursue a career in their home countries.Another aspect is the specialised training and the exchange programmes for students andyoung researchers. The rise in technical and engineering studies at undergraduate levelmight be a positive signal of a shifting balance towards more applied research.How to preserve and build new assets and how to increase the research results andinflow of knowledge in PACs are important issues that need to be addressed in order tobridge the gaps in research capacities in PACs. Paradoxically, possible solutions to brain-drain might lie in enhancing the mobility of researchers in an enlarged EU. Theexchange of experience and new ideas, international and regional collaboration andinnovation transfer could essentially contribute in the process of European integration andimprovement of quality all round. It is necessary however also to make serious efforts toreverse the flows of researchers - particularly young researchers - from West to the East.Learning capabilitiesThe process of building human capital and learning capabilities has three important aspects:Meeting the present skills gaps in the labour market;Guaranteeing the medium-term capacity of the S&T training system to delivertechnical specialists, researchers and teachers;Ensuring the longerlterm sustainability of society and economic growth by openinggood-quality education to all citizens.There are concerns that although PACs have a relatively well-qualified workforce the skillsare outdated and not flexible enough. They do not meet the demands for knowledgeworkers in terms of technical skills, general ICT skills or transferable skills. There isevidence moreover that the gap is growing. This issue is thrown into starker terms when itis recognised that most PACs face a demographic decline in their labour force in thecoming years. Reinforcing initial training is important but it will not be enough to meet theneeds to retrain existing workers.As regards the medium term, PACs are on the way to build open and internationallyintegrated higher education. In most CEECs, there has been a very rapid perhaps toorapidgrowth in private universities. Without considering the future consequences of thedemographic decline for this increase in educational supply, there are now moves to assesseducation quality that will probably encourage a rationalisation of higher education. The 71 0 international recognition of the quality of teaching and research in higher educationwill emerge as an increasingly important issue in the development of higher education, notleast because people want qualifications to be recognised by international firms and ininternational labour markets.On the longer time horizon, the wider educational systems will require restructuring inorder to deliver the new forms of content and to adopt new pedagogic methods, especiallyto achieve the shift from traditional methods of instruction to learning. Notwithstandingpotential resistance from a demoralised, under-rewarded and ageing teaching profession,the coming years can only be confronted with confidence through innovations in pedagogicmethods, including new tools and technologies, including e-learning.However, due to the tight budgetary situation there is a growing concern about severeinequalities and people being left out of even basic education. Basically, people withmonetary resources are increasingly buying their children out of the struggling stateeducation system. This trend opens the way to a dangerous downward spiral in which themiddle classes increasingly distance themselves from the state sector. These disparitieshave a particularly strong presence when looking at poorer regions such as decliningindustrial cities or rural areas. Although by such divisive trends the education of thetechnological elite might be secured, they represent a societal time bomb for the PACs.A cohesive society cannot be built if a large proportion of the citizens of 2010 and beyondare locked out of the fruits of the knowledge society.Where next?A report such as this can only scratch the surface of the wide terrain implied by'technology, knowledge and learning' in candidate countries. A number of issues remainwhich might be further explored. How to ensure the widest participation in the knowledgesociety? Are there equal opportunities in S&T between women and men? How toencourage participation of all citizens in open and transparent S&T governance? In whatways are ethical concerns being addressed? The specific challenges and opportunities forPACs in these areas present possible targets of follow-up studies.In the meantime, what futures do the S&T systems in PACs face on the 2010 time horizon?One possible way to look at this is through three scenarios of S&T specialisation profiles atregional and national levels:Full integration: all PACs are integrated into the global/EU S&T system andspecialisedin areas where they could offer excellence or have competitiveadvantage.Regional co-operation: countries and/ or regions consolidate into co-operative blocsin respect to S&T capacity, in some cases these blocs could transcend borders tocreate trans-national innovative regions or corridors.Uneven and multi-speed progress: big variations emerge with some PACs wellintegrated in the global/ EU research area and others struggling to find a profile.Where candidate countries see their competitive advantages in S&T and which targets theyset for future development might produce quite different levels of development. Someexamples might be to aim at achieving the EU average R&D spending level by 2010 or toestablish a more flexible career path for researchers. Others might focus on developing e- 81 1 services and ICTs to speed up economic growth. Further priorities might emphasise widerknowledge society targets and efforts to make life-long learning a reality.It would have been interesting to take the results of this phase of the Enlargement Futureswork further, in order to attempt a future mapping of the knowledge, technology andlearning systems in PACs. This would provide categorisations of PACs on differentindicators and could provide the basis for a categorisation of different strategies fordevelopment relatingtoemerging economic and research specialisationprofiles,demographic profiles and so on. However, the diversity of the different candidate countriesand the lack of consistent and comprehensive indicators presented a real challenge. Thus,while such a project remains worthwhile, the primary requirement for further studiesremains the improvement of the analytical base and the creation of procedures forcomparability across countries. 91 2 Panel objectives and methodologyObjectives: The aim of the Thematic Panel on 'Technology, knowledge, and learning'was to focus on the development of the science and technology base in PACs and thechallenges to innovation and education on the way towards a knowledge society. Themain drivers and issues of change in PACs in these areas and the expecteddevelopments and outcomes on a 2010 time horizon were to be developed andspecified in details. In order to achieve its objectives the Panel involved experts fromPACs and EU member-states in an interactive process based on two workshops,supported by background research.Preliminary phase: In the framework of global technological trends and on-goingactivities related to the European Research Area, the IPTS team considered it essentialto take preliminary stock of current science and technology priorities in PACs inadvance of the Panel's work. A draft document describing the policy framework andthe declared S&T priorities in candidate countries was prepared before the first Panelmeeting and validated by experts of PACs. As starting basis of the Panel's work, theIPTS team prepared also a Discussion paper and a draft Working paper, the laterforming the basis for the full Panel report.First Panel meeting (16-18 May 2001): The objective of the first meeting was todetermine the main issues and challenges for PACs related to technology, knowledgeand learning. In addition to the background papers, some important issues coming outof desk-research were incorporated into three questionnaires on S&T priorities,knowledge infrastructure and learning capabilities submitted to Panel members duringthe relevant sessions in order to support the brainstorming. On this basis the Panelprovided a description of the top issues and identified the linkages between them.Interim Period (June-September 2001): The dialogue with Panel members continuedin preparing the draft Panel report. On the basis of a questionnaire, some Panelmembers provided new inputs and details on the main issues, as well as examples ofgood practice and country specific information, to be considered in the report. Besides,background research was carried out by IPTS in order to have comparable informationfor all candidate countries.Second Panel meeting (17-19 September 2001): The draft Panel report was presentedat the mid-term seminar of the 'Enlargement Futures' project in Prague, together withthe draft reports of the other Panels. Subsequently, the Panel had a second meetingwith the aim of reflecting on the guidance of the Steering Group of the 'EnlargementFutures' project, to discuss cross-cutting issues with other Panel reports and to focuson the possible future options. Three sub-groups were set up to consider opportunitiesfor the future development in PACs in the areas of S&T priorities, knowledge systemsand learning. The outcome of this was that some future options/models were identifiedrelated to some important factors ICT dominance in research, education and thesociety at all; sustainability in research centred on 'star' scientists and reinforcingscience-industry links; speed and scope of the integration of PACs in science,technology and education by 2010.Preparation of final Panel report: After the 'Enlargement Futures' seminar in Prague,a draft final Panel report was prepared and circulated to Panel members by midOctober. Their comments were incorporated in the final report published for aconference in Bled (2-4 December 2001). 1013 IntroductionWhy the focus on Technology, Knowledge and Learning?In today's so-called new economy, learning and knowledge have become key successfactors for international competitiveness with the result that intangible and immaterialresources have overtaken physical and tangible assets in order of importance2. This isreflected by a dramatic rise to the top of the policy agenda of knowledge-related goals.Thus, the European Union embarked in March 2000 on the so-called Lisbon Strategywhere the consensual aim is to make the EU by 2010 \"the most competitive and dynamicknowledge-based economy in the world, capable of sustainable economic growth withmore and better jobs and greater social cohesion ...//... through open methods of co-ordination and benchmarking\". Research and innovation policy is set to become one of thekey instruments for achieving these goals, and in particular, the European Research Areastrategy promises to introduce a more consistent approach to pan-European collaborationand the prioritisation of public research3. Another major tool is the \"eEurope - AnInformation Society for all\" initiative, which aims to increase the take-up of digitaltechnologies and to ensure that everyone has the skills to use them.The scale of this challenge is already very daunting for the present EU members. Theresearch and innovation lag of the EU with respect to the US is well documented. On top ofthis, the technology gap4 between cohesion Member States and EU leaders (France,Germany, Finland, Sweden), has widened in recent years rather than narrowed5. Theimminent accession to the EU of several new members in the coming years amplifies thechallenge even further.In this brief introduction we present an interpretation of what currently are the meaningsbehind the terms technology, knowledge and learning which policy has to adjust to,before coming to the specific focus of the analysis in this report.Knowledge - what we know and what we can do - describes a state or potential for actionand decision in a person, organisation or group. Technology is any systematic knowledgeapplied to practical ends such as problem-solving or extending human capabilities.Learning indicates some change in the state of knowledge often manifested by a change inunderstanding, decision or action. As such, these are fundamental in determining continueddevelopment in all human spheres - society (community, group identity, relationships), theeconomy (the material world, services, work and production), and the realm of ideas andculture (sciences, arts, philosophy).In this report, the arguments we develop draw together data, arguments and prospectiveviews that directly relate to priorities and concerns, which have emerged in the pre- 2 It is said that 25 50 % of economic growth derives from research and technology (COM(2000) 6) or 70 - 80 % from new andimproved knowledge (Key note speech by Professor Charles Edquist Linkoping University, Sweden at The Learning Region andsustainable DevelopmentThe Case of the Oresund Region, Denmark/Sweden 'Building a Cross-border Learning Region'Organised by The Danish Ministry of Education, the Swedish Ministry of Education and Science, The Centre for EducationalResearchandInnovation(CERI)andtheTerritorialDevelopmentService(TDS), OECD17-18June1999,http://www.uvrn.dk/konferencedoecd/speeches.htm#charles)3 COM (2001) 79 final (March 2001), Realising the European Union's potential: Consolidating and extending the LisbonStrategy.

These are mostly articulated in 'tangible' terms that arereadily recognised by all concerned research capacity, education system, investment andspending, technology transfer organisations, etc. in short, the areas which are traditionallyassociated with knowledge and learning systems, and where some measures or indicatorsare available to guide discussion and debate. However, the discussion is informed by thebroader more forward-looking view about what the future challenges for knowledge andlearning systems are. Indeed, the two cannot be divorced one from the other. But themessage that should be in the back of people's minds is that for the pre-accession countries(as indeed for the cohesion countries) there are many ways to the future and futureprosperity. Catch-up, is just one of them, but countries do not necessarily have to follow thesame institutional and capacity developing path that the present prosperous nations havedone. Indeed, to do so might prove to be in some ways quite inefficient, as much of theknowledge infrastructure stock when lock-in occurs, becomes obsolete and a drag onfurther development. Leapfrogging ahead would seem to be a much more attractive andfeasible prospect - especially in issues relating to knowledge and learning where brainpower6is the determinant asset and available wherever there are people. 6see Romer (1998) 12 Chapter 1Science and Technology Strategies 1.1Science-, technology- and issue-driven researchIntroductionIn recent years there has been a resurgence of interest in science and technology (S&T). Onthe one hand, there is renewed wonderment about on-going and dramatic scientificbreakthroughs in nanotechnology, information technology and biotechnology, and all thepotential applications in industry and society that the new knowledge heralds. On the otherhand, many of these same developments elevate concerns that the pace of S&T is out ofstep with human society. That it runs ahead so fast and on such a colossal scale that it seemssometimes out of control. Figure 1: Research drivers I. Science DrivenResearchTechnology/Market(astronomy, earth Driven Research sciences, pure- physics (nanotechnology, chemistry & maths, materials, engineering anthropology, cultural sciences, genomics, and social sciences, anisation & processes archaeology, psyc DrivenResearch(environment, health &medicine, social andeconomic issues, energy,transportation, ...) This interest and these concerns signal a need for increased policy attention to S&T. On theone hand, it is necessary to examine the appropriate position of national innovation andresearch in respect of the frontiers of knowledge. This is particularly important given theescalating cost of maintaining high technology research capabilities. On the other hand,there is a pressure to make sure that policy supports technologies that are really in theservice of mankindi.e. those that meet our needs. For these reasons, S&T policy andpriority setting is receiving increasing attention in all countries. The situation in pre-accession countries (PACs) is an interesting microcosm of this more general story giventheir needs to climb a development trajectory and to surmount particularly large challengesof finding adequate funding in order to achieve a restructuring and modernisation of theirS&T base. BESTCOPYAVAILABLE131 6 PACs face the challenge that they have to play the S&T game at a global level. S&T is nolonger controllable at national or even European level, but follows breakthroughs that aretaking place through the bottom-up efforts of the international research community inuniversities and public and private research centres. In the case of science andtechnology/market driven research (Figure 1) the pace and direction of change are largelydriven by factors lying beyond national borders and policy instruments. National levelpolicy is therefore limited to the more passive act of prioritising the areas to build strengthsand aim at leadership and in which areas to adopt a follower position or let pass by.But, on the other hand, issue driven research responds to policy goals, includingpermanent ones (improving health & the quality of life) and some more circumstantial orcyclical (food safety, privacy & security, energy). Here scientific research is driven bypriorities that have been identified in some way as relating to national objectives. S&T in itsbasic or applied modes, understanding-orientated or technology-orientated is brought tobear in identifying solutions or making progress in one form or another.National S&T policy therefore seeks to strike an optimal balance between thedifferent types of research whether it is driven by issues and policies or from withinS&T.Moreover the dynamic nature of S&T means that priorities setting requires thesupport of forward-looking assessments of where the new emerging frontiers are andwhat the implications are for economy and society. This is one reason for theincreasing interest in foresight studies.Both these questions are tightly constrained by national S&T capability and competenciesin research centres and universities and their level of integration in the international S&Tsystem (see Chapter 2).Future and emerging S&T frontiersA review of four recent prospective studies gives some clue as to the frontiers of S&T inthe coming ten years and beyond reveals a relatively consistent set of broad prioritycategories (see Table 1 and Annex 11-2). In many cases S&T driven priorities are definedby their strategic potential. They may be important in terms of emerging opportunities:perhaps the research is an enabler of new (e.g. biogenomics) or wider multidisciplinaryfields (e.g. nanotechnology). Opportunities can also present themselves in areas whereleadership positions need to be maintained or built up. S&T priorities may relate to thecomplementary competencies needed to maintain and develop technological leadership.For example, ubiquitous computing calls for a range of skills in hardware, software andcommunications fields and other fundamental enabling technology fields (e.g. complexity,advanced materials, nanotechnologies).If we look at the results of a number of recent national foresight studies (Table 2) we cansee a strong orientation towards issue driven priorities such as environmental concerns,ageing population, quality of life or manufacturing performance (even if these areeventually translated into traditional technological categories seen in Table 1). 141 7 Table 1: Summarykey S&T driven priority fieldsS&T field Cited intelligence/knowledge Global trends 2015/Scenarios 2025Emerging Thematic PrioritiesRenewable and recyclable materials Strategic FuturesEmerging Thematic PrioritiesQuantum Computing Millennium Project (UN)Planetary astronomy/space research Millennium Project (UN)Technology fusion leading to new disciplines Global trends 2015/Scenarios 2025Complexity and complex systems Emerging Thematic Priorities Table 2: Key societal topics in recent and on-going foresightsKey theme Main foresightthemeSustainable environment 8Energy 9Built environment, urban life, housing and use of physical space 6Knowledge., skills, lifelong learning, training 5The future of manufacturing 5Healthier living 5Global competition and integration 4Ageing of society 4Mobility and communication 3Changing patterns of working life 3Ethics and privacy 2Values, Culture and Social Cohesion 2The Organisation of Society & 2Crime 2000, IPTS Futures Project 2000, Austria 1998, Japan Sixth Technology Delphi 1997& 2000, Australia 1997, RAND Critical Technologies US 1998, New Zealand 1998, Ireland 1998Sweden 2000, UnitedPortugal 2000, Spain 1999 15 18BEST COPY AVAILABLE Turning now to statements from national S&T plans in PACs we can see a similar mix ofS&T led and issue led priorities (Box I). But there are a series of policy issues regardingthe translation of objectives in plans into effective S&T activities and outcomes. Box 1: S&T in PACs - where to focus?Experts suggest that there are two categories of S&T areas of research to be considered:key areas for PACs in general Information and communication technologies (1CTs), ageingpopulation, environment, basic science, knowledge development areas, policy researchcountry-specifictechnology areas focusing on the individual needs and local/regionalspecificities and differences in PACs in terms of cultural roots, environment and historicaldevelopment.Some of the key S&T areas by country include:InEstoniathreekeygovernment-approved areas user-friendlyinformationsociety,biomedicine, advanced materials. In each area a national programme will be developed.In Bulgaria high importance is accorded to S&T in high-technology areas, e.g. informationtechnologies, telecommunications, new materials, biotechnologies, pharmacy, precise chemistry,new sorts of plants and animal breeds, gene engineering, etc.In Cyprus S&T research priorities include water resource management; protection andsustainable development of land, coastal and aquatic environment; preservation of culturaltreasure; development of innovative educational system; restructuring public institutions; tourismmanagement; alternative energy sources.In Hungary there are five broad areas guiding S&T research quality of life, ICTs,environmental and material resources, agro-business and biotechnology, national heritage andcontemporary social challenges.In Slovenia funding priorities include ICTs, advanced materials, complexity and systems,knowledge, science and technologies for sustainability. A specific focus is the natural andcultural heritage.In Poland competence exits in basic research in genetic engineering and natural sciences.Research on natural resources is lacking in spite of the large existing coal industry.In Turkey the emphasis is on ICTs, agriculture, biotechnologies, education and human resourcesoriented technologies, technologies for sustainable development, and (in relation to productivityimprovement) automation technologies and tools for textile and food industry.In Malta country specific areas are: ICTs (e-government local services, services for people withspecial needs, e-commerce Financial services), distance learning, microelectronics, software andmultimediadevelopment;fishfarming,environmentalfarming,wastemanagement,biotechnology and health-related products, tourism and related services, land management andsustainable use of land, environmental protection (marine environment and resources), energymanagement, water technologies, cultural identity and linguistics, R&D needs of SMEs -exploitation of research results, cultural heritage and tourism).In Lithuania S&T areas to focus on include information technologies (for health, networking,tele-work), biotechnologies & genetics, nuclear research, mechatronics and microsystems.Specific prioritiesrelate to Lithuanian language (translation tools) and cultural heritage(digitalisation, multimedia form).In Latvia five key areas are approved by the government material sciences, biomedicine,information technology, forestry and wood sciences, lettonica (national cultural heritage andlanguage).Regarding global trends and European priorities, in particular the RTD Framework Programme, allPACs identify ICTs as research priority and as having a special place in all PACs as enablingtechnologies for all sectors of economy. Most countries focus on potential application to developmentof new products and services, new technologies for language translation and speech recognition, fordigitalisation and presentation in multimedia forms of cultural heritage. 1619BESTCOPYAVAILABLE Science-driven researchTo achieve excellence, it is increasingly necessary to play in the front ranks of the globalscience. Many PACs certainly have a potential to achieve excellence, drawing on traditionsof contribution to fundamental science and historically prestigious universities. Indeed,despite downscaling of research capacities and infrastructures in Central and EasternEuropean Countries (CEECs), contribution and participation in fundamental research seemto be rising fast. The opening up of PACs research systems, and the influx of foreignfunding, is leading to a considerably greater (re-)integration of PACs into the internationalscience base, especially for countries with scientific traditions going back to the middleages (e.g. Hungary, the Czech Republic). This is reflected at present in a rise of co-publishing (Figure 2) and common projects with EU15 scientists. Of course this is nothingnew also in countries with more open traditions, such as Cyprus and Malta, where aninternational orientation stems from the fact that a majority of tertiary level students leavetheir home countries to study abroad. This includes graduates of the Higher TechnicalInstitute in Cyprus the main tertiary vocational education provider, which sends 50% of itsgraduates abroad each year mainly to the US and the UK. Such flows almost certainly leadto strong international links amongst research groups. Figure 2: Publication activities of some PACs: papers co-authored with EU15 countries ma 111111111111111111111111110 liii 1989199019911992199319941995199619971998 Source: Meske (1999)Despite this potential there are issues facing the future of fundamental research.Is it possible to maintain and enhance high scientific output and in what areas?What investments are required in equipment and facilities to allow cutting-edgescience to continue?Fundamental scientific performance certainly appears as a priority in the National S&TPlans.' They are either acknowledged in a generic way (Estonia) or in terms of explicitbut broad general priorities (Czech Republic - several areas of natural sciences; Estonia,Latvia & othersnational cultural heritage and language). This is in line with a widerperception that fundamental research is vital across the whole spectrum of knowledge ' see Annex III 17BESTCORYAVAILABLE creation and investigation. But, science driven approaches require openness to diversity,high-risk and long-term ideas stemming bottom-up out of scientific communities. Inparticular, there are many areas in which the scale of investment in scientificinfrastructure calls for modes of co-ordinated approaches (international networking,large-scale projects). This calls for explicit and detailed prioritisation in order to makesure that the implications of entering into the long-term support for these fields of science(rather than others) are well understood. For example, big science facilities (particleaccelerators, synchrotrons, radio telescopes or shared Internet infrastructures for e-Science) may not be achievable by countries or institutions acting alone. It can also benecessary to prioritise efforts aimed at raising the effectiveness of networking inemergent areas of research to create viable levels of research interaction and support fornascent or widely dispersed research communities.Technology/market driven researchWhilst fundamental science has held up quite well in PACs over the past decade, appliedresearch in CEECs has faced a major downsizing. This has accompanied the collapse ofindustrial research activity and the privatisation of public enterprises. Only in Romaniaand Lithuania have significant applied research capacities survived, at least up till 19998.Inthe others, notably the Czech Republic, capacities are being revived progressively.In general, there is an urgent need to redress the balance in the R&D systems and toincrease or further adapt applied research to serve the needs of a technologicallyadvanced economy. This cannot be done in a generic way, but needs to single out somespecific priorities. As in fundamental science, advances are occurring at an acceleratingpace and even in the most advanced countries, making progress and keeping up to thestate-of-the-art is increasingly contingent on the concentration of resources on fewer andfewer priorities. For PACs, this prioritisation task also applies, but is complicated by themore basic \"catch-up\" need to (re-) establish critical competencies and capacities in thekey areas chosen, compensating for the ten-year applied research and technology slump.The policy and strategy statements and reports of ministries, S&T agencies, nationalresearch and industrial innovation strategic plans across all the PACs reveal a consistentpattern of research priorities. As we note above, there is frequent reference to high-techareas such as ICTs, materials, biotechnology combined with some nationally specificpriorities (e.g. natural resources, forestry or fisheries, linguistic factors). It is frequentlydifficult to appreciate how the broad S&T priorities are specified at a finer level of detail.It is also very difficult to discern from available information the existing levels of S&Tcompetencies and capabilities in the different countries, and the extent to which the levelof research in the different areas justifies investing or earmarking resources. Thisinformation is a vital precursor to any discussion on the significance of foresight prioritiesfor applied technology-oriented research in the PACs and on what the future prioritisationstrategy should be.An essential early step in this process is the benchmarking of the supply side of S&Tcompetencies. This is difficult given that it is composed of a complex array of expertiseand resources including:Individuals (eminent scientists, professors, practitioners, inventors, ...) See European Commission DG Research (1999) 1821 Research & development teams & groups (specialist expert teams whether inpublic or private institutions, laboratories)Institutions & organisations (this could be Universities, or faculties withinuniversities, public research organisations, branch-research organisations,private consultancies, companies etc.)Networks (of either individual scientists, or organisations) at local,regional, national and European/International levelsSuch benchmarking is very difficult and extremely politically sensitive, especially giventhe problems to arrive at reliable judgements. For example, excellence and competence isas much a product of factors such as social and cultural resources, organisational routinesand ways of doing things, as it is of individuals.In all cases, the significance and importance of assessing what constitutes existingcapacity, what capacity might be achievable and what capacity lies dormant. Thisassessment of capacity can be done against a number of different criteria and can indicatewhether the investment might pay off in terms of returns at the national level.How does it compare with world-class performers in the area? And whatwould be required to achieve comparable performance?Is domestic demand sufficient to support a high quality research capability?Could domestic research capacity eventually access international markets?Can the activity achieve sufficient critical mass in order to be sustainable?If not, can national efforts integrate into larger trans-national efforts?As an example, a lot of encouragement has been given to develop high-visibility andhigh-performing centres of excellence in several PACs (sometimes through the EU'sFifth Framework Programme). Estonia, for example has focused policy on the fosteringof centres for strategic competence at the Tartu University and Tallinn TechnicalUniversity in the fields of biotechnology, information technologies (IT), materials andenvironmental technology (e.g. the Centres of Material Science and Gene/Biotechnologyat Tartu and Tallinn). These can be seen as Achievable Capacity. Alternatively, already in1996, a review of industrially oriented research capacity identified 15 units possessing aunique position in Poland, 21 units whose activities could be taken over by other units,and 18 units whose existence could not be explained9. This is more in line with theassessing Existing Capacity.Further insight is gleaned from the results of a proposal-based evaluation of centres ofexcellence in 12 PACs (excluding Turkey) carried out in the context of the internationalco-operation part of the Fifth Framework Programme:). The 'call for proposals' inquestion specified that centres should bring together theoretical and applied research andcoverthenatural,socialandeconomicsciences,using,wherepossible,amultidisciplinary approach. Excellence was measured against a set of six S&T criteria,one social objective criterion, two economic development criteria, and six resources,partnership and management criteria. A total of 101 out of 185 proposals received passedthe S&T excellence threshold criteria, of which 34 were short-listed following evaluationover the complete criteria set (see Table 3 below). 9 European Commission DG Research (1999), p. 178.I\u00b0 see Rhode (2000) Table 3: PAC Centres of Excellence S&T AreastInstitute itcag22 L516.20igug, 1Institute of Genetic Engineering - Kostinbrod, BULGARIA X2Czech Technical University in Prague, Faculty of Electrical Engineering,Department of Cybernetics Prague, CZECH REPUBLICX 3Collegium Budapest, Institute for Advanced Study - Budapest, HUNGARY X4Hungarian Academy of Sciences, Institute of Experimental Medicine -Budapest, HUNGARYX 5Polish Academy of Sciences, High Pressure Research Centre - Warsaw,POLANDX 6Estonian Biocentre-Tadu,Estonia X7Institute of Solid State Physics, University of Latvia - Riga, LATVIA X8Institute of Experimental Endocrinology, Slovak Academy of SciencesBratislava, SLOVAKIAX 9Alfred Academy of Science -Budapest, HUNGARYX 10Institute of Biochemistry and Biophysics PAS - Warsaw, POLAND X11Wroclaw University of Technology, Institute of Production Engineering andAutomation - Wroclaw, POLANDX 12The Jan Zurzycki Institute of Molecular Biology Cracow, POLAND X13Institute of Theoretical and Applied Mechanics of the Czech Academy ofSciences - Prague, CZECH REPUBLICX 14Institute of Fundamental Technological Research, Polish Academy ofSciences, Centre of Mechanics and Information Technology - Warsaw,POLANDX 15University of Cyprus, Centre for Banking and Financial Research - Nicosia,CYPRUSX 16Central Laboratory for Parallel Processing, Bulgarian Academy of Sciences- Sofia, BULGARIAX 17Polish Academy of Sciences, DMsion of Food Science, Institute of AnimalReproduction and Food Research - Olsztyn, POLANDX 18Polish Academy of Sciences, Institute of Physics - Warsaw, POLAND X19Danube Delta National Institute for Research and Development - Tulcea,ROMANIAX 20Institute of Cellular Biology & Pathology \"Nicolae Simionescu\" - Bucharest,ROMANIAX 21Centre of Molecular and Macromolecular Studies of Polish Academy ofSciences - Lodz, POL4NDX 22Institute of Mathematics Romanian Academy -Bucharest, ROMANIAX 23\"Horia Hulubei\" Institute for Physics and Nuclear Engineering -Bucharest, ROMANIAX 24Polish Academy of Sciences, Institute of Mathematics Warsaw, POLAND X25Computer and Automation Research Institute - Budapest, HUNGARY X26Biological Research Centre, Hungarian Academy of Sciences - Szeged,HUNGARY X27UNESCO Associated Centre of Excellence for Research andTraining in Basic SciencesVilnius, LITHUANIA X28Institute of Experimental Medicine, Academy of Sciences of the CzechRepublic Prague, CZECH REPUBLICX 29Research Institutefor SolidState, Physics and Optics -Budapest,HUNGARYX 30Centre for Transportation Research - Zilina, SLOVAKIA X 202 3 31Institute of Oceanology - InstituteSoils, Water use and Env.

Also needed is explicit consideration of the future economic andsocial relevance of research. The risk of a growing mismatch between research activitiesand industrial and social needs has to be countered. This is seen in some of the nationalS&T plans where there are references to nationally specific factors such as culture,language, as well as long-term trends that affect national and regional development.Looking at the stated research priorities for PACs, they reflect the same dominance ofsocietal and socio-economic rationales and objectives as elsewhere, in particular the wayemerging themesidentified through EU Member State Foresight exercises areformulated. However,itisnot necessarily the case that the emerging prioritiesbenchmarked from national -level or EU15 Foresight exercises are appropriate or best forPACs, nor that they apply to an enlarged EU.\" Thus we can ask:Do these priorities correspond to the type of research and competencies reallyneeded? If not, why not and what then should the specific priorities be - in additionor alternatives?Do the EU level foresight priorities provide a useful starting point for the PACpriorities? How should they be adapted and why?Are there particular S&T themes determined by local conditions, specialisation,geographic specificities that are generally relevant to transition countries but notnecessarily to other European countries?Research activities need to be guided by plausible future visions and scenarios of socialand economic development as well as contributing to the construction of such visions.12A further need exists to build a good reference system with benchmarks, and indicators.Information systems on scientific improvements and technologies need also to be II Some national R&D plan priorities are very close indeed to the foresight priorities, e.g. Romania - complex systems forenvironmental management, micro & nanotechnologies, natural or created risk prevention, protection & rehabilitation, foodsecurity.12 The scenarios & strategies method applied recently by the EU-agencies Cedefop and ETF in the field of education and trainingmay be particularly useful and could be more widely adopted, because its merit is mainly to bridge gaps at the interface betweenresearch and policy or practice Cedefop: European Centre for the Development of Vocational Training, Thessaloniki/Greece,ETF: European Training Foundation, Turin/Italy. See: Sellin et al (2000) 212 4 introduced. For example, a recent study of innovation in six candidate countries (Cyprus,Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Poland and Slovenia) found a relative absence ofrobust data on innovation performance in these six candidate countries suggesting thatpolicy choices are being made on the basis of very partial and non-robust indicators.13National priorities in ERAIt is clear PACs need to follow a prioritisation strategy that closely couples to specificnational considerations (physical resource endowments, geographical location, buildingon traditional areas of competence, increasing the technological intensity & re-awakeningthe demand for R&D of indigenous businesses).But a paucity of resources drives PACs (as indeed also happens in some present MemberStates) towards aligning national technological priorities with those of the EU RTDFramework Programme in order to access funding. This of course has many benefits(better integration into EU-wide research system and networks, high-level technologicalco-operation and exchange, etc.) but a danger exists that priorities not reflected in theFramework programme are pushed aside. It is obvious that candidate countries need tofocus on important European and global necessities that are highly relevant andnecessary for their development, such as ICTs. However, they also need to find niches ofexcellence for possible national S&T specialisation closely linked to the industrialpatterns of specialisation and needs.One important component of a resolution to such problems is the construction of a clearview of way ahead (where we are, what we are capable of and where we want to go). Theon-going re-structuring of industry suggests that it is hardly feasible now to set upresearch priorities for the longer term. However, focusing at present at the short andmedium time dimensions, some procedures might be elaborated for the longer-termpriority setting process based on global drivers and national/ local issues and realcapacities. 1.2 Effective governance of science and technologyIntroductionThe deep structural changes that PACs have confronted in the past ten years posesignificant challenges to all institutional systems including S&T. These issues affect tworelated but conceptually different areas of S&T governance14:To achieve an effective and open management and support of a scientificinfrastructure and the design, content-specification, delivery, selection andevaluation of S&T programmes;And toimplement goodpracticeinrespecttothespecificationandimplementation of technical standards15.The efforts by PACs to achieve such transformations in S&T governance take placeagainst pressure to fall into step with EU practices, which stress the need for transparency& openness, participation & inclusion, accountability, effectiveness and coherence.16 13 European Commission DG Enterprise (2001)14 See Shepard (2000)15 Technical factors are for instance pollutant limits, pharmaceuticals licensing, vehicle safety standards, etc.16 COM (2001)428 final, White Paper on European Governance 2225 This is an area of high policy attention due to rising concerns that the public is politicallyapathetic and has lost confidence in the political ability to find solutions to majorproblems confronting our societies.This section concentrates on the governance of S&T priority setting and implementation.For the most part, the present PAC systems are driven by sectoral or ministerial agendasrather than achieving a comprehensive mapping of developments. There are howeveremergent examples of new practices in some countries based on Foresight. Suchapproaches are more crosscutting and longer term and may provide new avenues fordeveloping more effective and transparent S&T governance systems.The efficient governance of the S&T in PACs requires not only an efficient forward-looking policy building process. It is also important to consider how the policyobjectives will be paid for and practical aspects of turning action plans into financialmeasures. Part of the reason for aiming at better co-ordination of stakeholders is toreduce redundancies in research. The usage of new tools and mechanisms forefficient distribution of the limited financial resources for R&D and the evaluationof the results are the key for better investment in S&T.Issues of S&T governance in PACsSectoral approaches still dominate the preparing policy documents in the areas ofresearch, innovation, industrial development and small- and medium-sized enterprises(SMEs). As a result there is often a lack of integration between research agendas andeconomic policy, duplication of research and mismatch between policy plans andfinancial flows.Responsibility for innovation is typically split across a number of state bodies coveringindustrial and technology policy and/or research and education and/or SMEs. Only inEstonia, Latvia and Poland the governments have defined policies or strategiesaddressing innovation as a separate policy area. In Cyprus it is dealt with as part ofindustrial policy, in Slovenia under the heading of technological development, and in theCzech Republic in terms of both industrial and research policy.Table 4 gives an overview of the authorities involvedinthe design andimplementation of R&D and innovation policies in PACs. The mismatches in thepolicy of the different responsible bodies, and sometimes the conflicting incentivesfor enterprises and research units seriously affect implementation. One of theconsequences of low co-ordination between respective governmental departments isthat policy initiatives are not always directly supported by effective financialinstruments. While, the multiplicity of research branches at ministry level and thedifferent funding structures for SMEs, regional development and technologicaldevelopment\" make it very difficult to avoid duplication of measures. 17 see Annex III Table 4: S&T framework and relevant authorities'8Countrypolicy documents national authority legal measures support structuresBulgaria Ministry of Education and ScienceNational council on scientific and technologicpolicyHigher Education ActAct on Establishment of the National Centre forAgricultural ScienceNational Science Fund National Strategy for development of high technologyactivities (1999)Ministry of EconomyAgency on SMEsdraft Law High-Technology ActivitiesLaw on SMEsEncouragement Bank Cyprus1999-2003 Strategic Development Plan Planning Bureau Research Promotion FoundationNew industrial policy of the government for thedevelopment of high-technology industry in CyprusCzechRepublicNational R&D Policy (2000)National Programme of Oriented ResearchMinistry of Education, Youth and SportsResearch and development CouncilHigher Education Act Grant AgencyProgramme of the Support of innovative Firms inBusiness Innovative CentresMinistry of Industry and Trade Technology Centre at the Academy ofSciencesEstoniaKnowledge based Estonia (2001)Learning Estonia (2001)Ministry of EducationEstonian Research and Development CouncilOrganisation of Research and Development Act(1997)Estonian Science FoundationScience Competence CouncilRegional Agreement for Baltic HigherEducation, Archimedes FoundationEstonian National Innovation Programme (1998) Ministry of Economic Affairs Estonian Technology Agency HungaryScience and Technology Policy 2000National research and development programs (2000)Ministry of EducationScience and Technology Policy CouncilScience Advisory BoardBill on higher-education (1994)Bill on Hungarian Academy of Sciences (1994)Higher Education Development FundNational Scientific Research FundNational Technological DevelopmentFundMedium-term strategy for the development ofSMEsMinistry of Economic AffairsEnterprise Development Council Law on SMEsHungarian Development BankSME Target FundEconomy Development FundRegional Development FundLatviaNational concept on Research Development Ministry of Education and ScienceLatvian Council of ScienceLow on research activity (1992)Low on higher-education institutions (1995)law on Education (1998)Regional Agreement for Baltic HigherEducationConcept on the development of the National InnovationSystem (2001)National programme for the development of SMEs(1997)Ministry of Economy Latvian technological centreLatvian technology park I8see Annex III for details 24 LithuaniaProgramme on computer network and Internet Servicesfor Lithuanian science and higher education (2000)Ministry of Education and Science Law on Higher EducationLaw on Science and StudiesRegional Agreement for Baltic HigherEducationMedium-Term Economic Strategy (until 2005)Medium-Term Industrial Development Policy (2000)Business Innovation Programme (2000)Small and Medium-sized small and businessdevelopmentSME Fund MaltaNational Science and Technology Policy Document(1994)Ministry of EducationMalta Council for Science and TechnologyFoundation for Science and Technology PolandBasis for National S&T Policy (1993, add. 1996)Guidelines for innovation policy in Poland (1994, add.)Directions of National Innovation Policy till 2002(1999)State Committee for Scientific Research Act on the State Committee for ScientificResearchAct on Research andDevelopment Institutionsdraft Law on Higher EducationState Committee for Scientific Research Programme for support of development of regionalinstitutions involved in technology transferMinistry of Economy Agency for Techniques and Technology RomaniaNational Plan for Research, Development andInnovation for 19992002 (1999)Ministry of Education and ResearchNational Agency for science, technology andinnovation Slovakia Ministry of EducationOffice for strategy of society, science andtechnologyConceptional orientation of technological policy ofindustrial branches of the Slovakia up to 2003 (1999)Ministry of EconomyNational Agency for Development of SMEsState Aid Act Government support program Start 2000 SloveniaNational Research Programme (1995) Ministry of Education, Science and Sport Law on Research activities (1991)Higher Education Act (1999)Technology Policy of the Government of the Republicof Slovenia (1994)Ministry of Economic Affairs Act on Support of companies developing newtechnologiesLaw on promotion of technological developmentof Slovenia (1999)Slovene Development Corporation, SmallBusiness Development Center, SmallBusiness Development FundTurkeyTurkish Science and Technology Policy 1993-2003Turkish Science and Technology Policy Document2003-2023 (under preparation)The Scientific and Technical Research Councilof Turkey -

Indeed, many countries have set up advisory bodies (research councils)precisely to carry out the policy decisions and the co-ordination of research anddevelopment at governmental level.\u00b0 But, the necessary operational links betweenthe different actors in the innovation system are not yet developed enough to achieveefficiency. On the other hand, only a few councils (Cyprus, Czech Republic, Latvia& Turkey) also have functions related to co-ordination of the financial flows and thepolicy implementation and evaluation. The establishment of policy implementationinstitutions at some of these councils (in Cyprus, Malta, Turkey) is a step towardsimproving the overall performance of the R&D system.Foresight as a tool for balanced S&T policyThe institutional fragmentation is both cause and symptom of a problem that the majorstakeholders in innovation are not integrated in the determination of research andinnovation priorities. Governments have traditionally been the main supporters ofresearch and the public sector research agencies remain powerful, while the interests ofinnovative enterprises have not yet been formed.2\u00b0 A central challenge for governancetherefore is to balance the supply-side and demand-side interests in setting researchagendas, including service sectors and societal interests as well as manufacturing andagriculture. Generally, governments of PACs are aware of the importance of theinvolvement of industry in R&D and most governments have developed policies thatsupport industrial R&D. But industrialists claim that research priorities are definedwithout consultation and are targeted towards topics where funding schemes areavailable. Small to medium sized enterprises are also often left out and, although this is ageneral problem for all countries, the importance of SMEs in the domestic economy ofcandidate countries makes the situation more serious. The voice of societal actors seemseven weaker, and smaller attention is paid to democratic and human needs and to balancecompetitiveness against unemployment, inequality, sustainability and risk, ethics or theplace of women in science.An awareness is emerging of the need to increasing the number of voices that are heardin the setting of S&T priorities and for new patterns of communication and interaction informulating policy, especially at a time of fast technological change and sparse resources.One sign that this is happening has been the recent growth of interest in foresight studiesas a basis for strategy and policy planning activities of public bodies and as tools formanaging an open process of determining priorities, to obtain maximum benefit forsociety, sustainable development and competitiveness of the economy (Table 5).In Cyprus, for example, foresight might centre on the problems of reintegration of adivided society outlining the way to build an integrated society based on mutual respectand co-operation. This implies changes in the education system and economic activitiesto achieve a constructive co-operation of the Greek and Turkish communities. Anotherimportant issue for the foresight activities is developing a national economic strategybased on strengths and traditions, in the context of Cyprus' place regionally and inEurope. The development of Cyprus as a regional portal of educational services andresearch centre is another topic for a future prospective study.

Since Estonia is a small countrythose studies predominantly concern positioning in the international context and withrespect to neighbouring countries.In Bulgaria there is no formalised Foresight study taking place, but the Ministry ofRegional Development is orchestrating a panel of experts, undertaking a SWOT analysisand a sectoral study to feed in the National plan for economic development (2000-2006).This activity is like a mini-Foresight process, since it uses prospective techniques and it isorganisedin a participative manner with the active participation of the relevantstakeholders.Possibly the best practice in the PAC context is the Hungarian Foresight Programwhich has been the first foresight program in Central and Eastern Europe launched in1997. The main aim of the Program was to bring together business, the science base andgovernment to analyse the trends intechnological development; world marketopportunities; strengths and weaknesses of the Hungarian economy and R&D system,and on this basis of the Foresight outcomes to elaborate a national innovation strategy. Another goal was to join intellectual forces of Hungarian researchers, business people,and government officials to discuss on current and future competitive position ofHungary in a globalised market. In the Program strong emphasis is given on scenario-building at macro-level and panel levels, as well as regional scenarios related to thedevelopment of the Central and Eastern European region.Need for better investment in researchAs a result of the lack of co-ordination between agencies and instruments, almost allPACs show signs that funding mechanisms are not meeting targets or fail to provide thecorrect incentives for companies to innovate. For example, rules attached to loans forindustrial R&D may mean that only larger firms with low-risk projects can apply.Moreover, it has been hard for decision-makers in PACs to focus on measures to supportthe creation of innovative start-up firms at a time when many of the largest employerswere going bankrupt. The need to deal rapidly with a large number of urgent legislativeand policy changes, such as carrying out comprehensive health and social reforms hasmade it hard for PACs emphasise the apparent luxury of building a knowledge-basedsociety. Although the investments in education and research may give a higher rate ofreturn21 than public welfare spending or infrastructure development, the available fundsfor R&D are very limited and a serious decline of the R&D budgets in the transitionalperiod have been observed in all CEECs. The position now in most PACs, is that grossdomestic expenditure on R&D (GERD) is significantly below the EU15 average ofaround 2% (Figure 3). A cluster of PACs achieve roughly equivalent levels to some EUmember states at around but mostly below 1.5% (Slovenia, Czech Republic, Slovakia).Then there is a cluster from about 0.8% to 0.4% (Poland, Hungary, Romania, Estonia,Bulgaria, Latvia, Lithuania and Turkey) followed by Cyprus at 0.2%. 3 2.5 2 1.5 1 0.5 0Figure 3: GERD as % of GDP n 11,cie/0,0 Source:.Eurostat, National sources for Turkeycce6.9*sg. 101995 0 1997 0199111In addition, appraisals of the effectiveness of innovation instruments are scattered, onlyHungary undertakes systematic evaluations of programmes funded in favour of appliedR&D programmes involving experts of the EU. 2' OECD (1998 ) Financial mechanisms and toolsIn order to promote S&T, innovation and SMEs, a large number of funding institutions,both state-run and private, have been established in candidate countries (see Table 4).Similarity in the practice prevails in PACs for distribution of the limited financial resourcesusing as main instruments subsidies, thematic grants and grants for projects. A commonfeature is the use of competitions to award finance for new R&D projects relating tonational policy objectives and priorities. It is becoming less common that money is directlyearmarked to research units in the form of fixed institutional budgets. Even so fundingsystems are poorly configured due to the lack of active restructuring policies regarding theR&D sector, poor clarity of methods for establishing priorities and criteria for funding, aswell as the absence of monitoring and evaluation of the research results. At the moment thesituation is more a matter of islands of best practice and generalised good intentions (Box2). Box 2: Examples of good practice related to the funding of R&DIn Hungary22 the following main funds have been set up to allocate grants or favourable loans:Higher Education Development Fund - to finance the development of the infrastructure of highereducation;National Scientific Research Fund - to finance basic research;Central Technological Development Fund - to promote technological development;\"Szechenyi Plan\" funding scheme - a relatively new funding scheme, supporting exclusivelybusiness-academy collaborations.Grants or favourable loans are available for practically all Hungarian researchers or organisations(firms, university departments, other R&D units) awarded through three main sChemes:R&D infrastructure projects - a 'bottom-up' scheme introduced in 1991 with major goals: to,upgrade the R&D and educational infrastructure (e.g. to provide grants to purchase pCs and varioustools); to facilitate the dissemination of R&D results (e.g. grants to attend conferences abroad if theapplicant's paper is accepted, and contribution to organise conferences in Hungary);Applied R&D projectsanother 'bottom-up' scheme, also introduced in 1991. Project proposalsare evaluated by independent technical and financial experts in three stages and in most cases aninterest-free loan is provided;Target-oriented national projects - a 'top-down' scheme, introduced in 1992. Four major goalsare selected for support from public funds: disposal of nuclear waste, development of geographicinformation systems, food processing and packaging technologies and machinery and automotivetechnologies.In Slovenia23 the priorities of the S&T policy (2001-2002) are defined in the Budget Memorandumand the main instruments of the policy are:(co-)financing of basic and applied research projects / programmes;public research institutions (co-financing of fixed cost of public research institutions and researchinstitutions within both universities);international co-operation in the field of science and research (co-financing of bilateral andmultilateral research projects, international commitments, international promotion of Slovenianscience);Young Researchers Programme (financing of young researchers);(co-)financing of research infrastructure (research equipment, instrumental centres, scientificinformation and communications);financing of expert system (evaluations, reviews etc.). 22 Based on Havas (1999) and additional data provided by Lajos Nyiri and (Mint DOmOlki - Panel members23Boris Pukl, Panel member 293 2BEST COPY AVAILABLE Monitoring and evaluation of S&T performanceThe regular monitoring of the research, development and innovation (RDI) systemperformance and the inventory of available resources is a foundation to the determiningS&T objectives and to the proper functioning of the whole system. Monitoring systemsare essential to achieve and understand the performance of RDI systems and for adjustingpolicies. In many candidate countries there are not reliable data on input (funding) andoutputs (economic performance) of the RDI systems.Monitoring and evaluation of S&T in candidate countries is not systematically organisedin comparison to EU countries and actions are needed to strengthen this aspect. Somecountries are starting considering monitoring systems as important tools for better S&Tperformance (see Box 3).In general, however, candidate countries depend on external consultancy to monitor andevaluate their S&T programmes and outcomes. hi addition, monitoring is frequently doneon an ad hoc basis at project-level. There is the need to create an internal capacity in thesecountries in order to have continuously available monitoring and evaluation of the publicR&D. The lack of monitoring means that in is unknown how the BERD indicator isdeveloping. Evaluation systems are required for the development and continuousimprovement of policy and the adjustment of policy tools.There is the need to implement a system in all candidate countries that uses moresystematically indicators to assess the performance of R&D and models for qualityevaluation of research outcomes. Benchmarking should be organised consideringEuropean average level, but also other countries like United States, and non-Europeancountries.Box 3: A monitoring systeM to follow and evaluate the actions in the National Strategy for 1Technology Development and InnovationA, monitoring system to follow and evaluate the action in the National Strategy for Technology- ,Development and Innovation could haye the following objectives:40, To define benchmarks which will provide realistic targets for the implementation , of theStrategyTo develop a set of indicators against which progress on implementation of the Strategy will bemeasuredTo chooSe a method for coilecting information on the agreed indicatorsThe Implementation of the National Strategy for Technology Development and Innovation Ishould lead tO beneficial results for the country aS a whole in terms of \"improvement of the :national research and inniivation capacity and performance.

This could be supported by the professionalisation of S&Tmonitoring and evaluation in the form of innovation policy units. They would beresponsible to assess the performance of current instruments and structures promotinginnovation or technological development, using tools such as:evaluation and monitoring systems to measure the effects of R&D investments,to enable policy makers to monitor industrial R&D and their use of public R&Dunified set of indicatorstools/ instruments used in PACs for elaboration/ implementation of priorities,development of knowledge infrastructure, learning capabilitiesbenchmarking, best practice, impact assessment, transparency of criteria, auditBut the fundamental issue is the need for co-operation of the widest possible group ofstakeholders (within and among sectors and regions) in preparing long-term innovationstrategies and the introduction of various policy measures and instruments. A focus onnurturing foresight activities is a move in this direction. And, although the first steps tocarry out prospective studies (in Hungary, Poland, Czech Republic) have been taken inPACs, there is still a need for wide acceptance in PACs of the role of foresight tosystematise the debate at national level on future prospects and desires related to socio-economic and technological evolution in medium and long terms.Such developments are particularly promising in that they address actors outside theconfines of scientific interests and expert groups. In the most extended cases they availthemselves of a complete range of horizontal communication possibilities. For instance,there is increasing on-line access to local and national information systems in the area ofS&T, to the results of research projects and programmes, to science museums, to sciencefestivals and to citizens' juries. All such channels could contribute to the transparency ofthe research activities and facilitate the communications of all actors involved andimprove the performance of the whole RDI system.Such openness provides the basis for a much broader look at science, in particularfocusing on cultural identity and democratisation of science. The development of PACgovernance systems takes place at a time when there is a recognised need for a change ofimage of S&T and the perception of science in society has been also stressed, inparticular the popularisation of science between people and how it could help them. Suchapproaches should eventually allow a more balanced and legitimate system of prioritysetting.The present trends in PACs suggest that efforts are needed to confine public andprivate S&T ambitions to what is really achievable. The gap has to be closedbetween political rhetoric and action, effort and outcomes. Unfortunately there areoften big gaps between national S&T targets and the level of resources provided.These gaps arise as a result of a combination of too many competing calls onpolitical agendas, administrative shortfalls and genuine lack of resources, all ofwhich point to systemic and institutional problems of one sort or another. Properpolicy co-ordination and implementation, greater transparency of S&T governanceand more effective monitoring and evaluation can help to improve the efficiency of 313 4 actions. On the other hand, there is a need for more holistic approach on R&Damounts spent on R&D are not as important as the kind of research on the way.The measures already undertaken for financing and promoting research andinnovation outline the common perception in PACs of the future importance of S&Tin the society, for growth and employment. However, there are some doubts relatedto the efficiency of the financial instruments and mechanisms used and their realcontribution to S&T development. A challenge for PACs, therefore, is to establishan effective and transparent distribution mechanism of the limitedfinancialresources available for research, according to national interests and priorities. Betterinvestments in research require fair and open competition for funding based onrelevance and excellence using objective and transparent criteria.At the same time it is essential to consider how to preserve the fundamental researchtraditions while pushing competitive funding schemes. In PACs, where an activenational and regional S&T policy is absent, and the state support for research islimited, the excellence in science and technology will increasingly rely uponcompetitive application for funding by international sources (inside consortia or aspart of international projects). The participation in international programmes allowsprominent researchers to obtain the necessary technology and financial resources, aswell as to increase their scientific knowledge and experience. Also, a Europe-widedialogue with the private sector24, in particular multinationals that are investing inPACs, might help to build the industrial component of research in candidatecountries. 24Mint DOmOlki, Panel Member 32 2.1 Towards a new knowledge infrastructureIntroductionFor pre-accession countries the transition to a knowledge-based economy and society isessential for their full integration into the 'European' economic area and society. The needfor higher economic growth, competitiveness and sustainable development puts a specialemphasis on the knowledge infrastructure in these countries - the aim of this chapter is tooutline the tasks related to its future development. We concentrate on the following:system building and institutional interactionsknowledge and technology diffilsionpersonnel mobility as the main source of tacit knowledge dissemination.The knowledge-infrastructure analysis in the first section focuses on the main buildingblocks of the Research, Development and Innovation (RDI) system research units(research institutes, public laboratories), universities (and other educational and traininginstitutions), enterprises (branch and industrial R&D) and intermediaries (bridginginstitutions, technology transfer organisations, patent offices), and the links betweenthem. The building of a more effective and efficient knowledge infrastructure incandidate countries is seen in terms of the requirements for:a coherent R&D and innovation system;strengthened partnerships between research, universities and industry;new infrastructure and intermediaries to facilitate technology transfer;emergence of relevant knowledge intensive services; andincreased openness to international networking.In analysing recent knowledge infrastructure developments in candidate countries,this section seeks signs of emerging models of research in PACs and of futureknowledge institutions.The system of research and innovationIn the past, the R&D systems in CEECs were characterised by three types ofinstitutionsacademies of sciences, institutions for higher education, and industrialbranch research institutes. During the transition period, different countries followeddifferent restructuring strategies (Box 4), though with almost all branch institutesbeing heavily affected and a large number of them being closed. The process oftransformation has followed three phases25:dissolution and fragmentation of the old S&T systems;restructuring, consolidation of institutions, emergence of new organisations;building of a new innovation system through integration and networking. 25 Meske (2000) 3336 Box 4: Approaches for the restructuring of the R&D systemThe patterns of restructuring of the science base have been quite different from place to place26.Candidate countries focused at different stages of the transition on organisational, functional andfinancial aspects of the R&D system and often introduced temporary incompatible changes27. Afew cOuntries engaged in an active restructuring, such as Estonia and Latvia with attempts toease the process of change with legislative measures, co-funding, innovation policies, etc. SomeCEECs, such as the Czech Republic, allowed industrial research to suffer the shock of a rapidtransition to a private sector model. Probably the most comnion approach, such as in Poland,Romania, Lithuania and Bulgaria, was to let the research institutes struggle along with reducedpublic funding and state contracts but no active support to restructure.The Latvian approach28 in restructuring R&D is based on the integration of the national researchpotential into universities with the aim of modernising the universities and strengthening theirresearch capacity. Research centres of national significance have been established, selectedusing the following criteria:high international recognition;consistency with national research priorities;well developed international collaboration in research and training;advanced and innovative performance.In the Czech Republic, in comparison, no structural policy was carried out at a microeconomiclevel within the R&D system.29 The government had withdrawn financial support from themajority of industrial R&D institutes at an early stage in the transitiOn process and during theprivatisation they were treated as 'normal' production enterprises. This shock without therapyled to the conversion of the institutes R&D activities into production.and services. Business isby far the largest contributor and the largest recipient of research and development funding,employing more than the half of all researchers.In Poland during the transformation period a gradual restructuring policy was 'followed,changing the public funding principles and ranking of institutes. However, the R&D system ingeneral has retained the main features and structures of the previous system and a large numberof R&D institutes still receive subsidies.3\u00b0Due to the lack of an active restructuring policy in Lithuania, some industry-oriented researchinstitutes moved from basic to applied research and created companies in their area ofspecialisation. At present, it is considered that industrial R&D in Lithuania is substantial anddirected to innovation, based mainly on own R&D resources of companies, using humanresources of former research institutes31.National circumstances differ, but most of the candidate countries have completedthe first two phases with the third phase still lying ahead. Although the S&Tdevelopment in the Mediterranean countries has followed a different path, thesecountries are also focusing on the establishment of a coherent RDI system and theuse of the potential of technology and innovation for economic growth andsustainable development.Recent data giving an aggregate comparison between some PACs and current EUmembers paint a positive picture, suggesting that the PACs have the potential to sustainhigh-level research systems, at least on a par with several current EU Member States(Figure 4).32 The same report gives further figures on investment in technology creation 26 see Meske, (2000); Dyker et Enterprise (2001)\" European Trend chart of innovation, Country reports: Poland (2000), httn://trendchart.cordisiu3' European Commission DG Research (1999)32 The UNDP's technology achievement index aims to capture how well a country is creating and diffusing technology andbuilding a human skill basereflecting its capacity to participate in technological innovations of the network age. This index is acomposite of four dimensions including technology creation (patents granted to residents; receipts of royalties & license fees), 343 7BEST COPY AVAILABLE where data for the PACs are compared with three Member States (Italy, Greece andPortugal) and the average for high-income OECD members.33 This shows the relativelylow levels of R&D investments even if in some cases it surpasses some current EUMember States. However, while such data certainly do give grounds for hope, it wouldbe premature to assume that much of the work of reconstructing the knowledgeinfrastructure has been done.

As pointed out in the first chapter, science and research, and technologyand innovation are not considered in their integrity. Only in few countries like Romaniaand Turkey a separate public body has responsibilities for both, innovation and research.Furthermore, the fast changes during the last decade do not facilitate the integration of allactors of the RDI system. Therefore, a closer look is needed to outline the challengeswhich relate to:the interactions between research institutes and enterprisesthe links between universities and industrythe emergence of bridging organisations and new players. diffusion of recent innovations (internet hosts; high & medium tech, exports), diffusion of old innovations (telephones, electricityconsumption) and human skills (years of schooling; output level of skills & qualification, tertiary professional and scientificeducation enrolment and graduates' ratio). UNDP (2001)\" The relatively high number of scientists and engineers in R&D does not appear to be consistent with the acknowledgedcollapse of applied research, but then it may well be that many of these high numbers reflect scientists and engineers still inacademic positions in Universities and academies of science.34 European Commission DG Research (1999) 3538 90 80 70 60 . 50 40 30 20 10Research-industry interactionsBreaking with the state control of the past, R&D institutions in CEECs are considered tobe now self-governing and autonomous, open to international collaboration. However,the decline of financial support by the state and the inability to attract other fundingconfront most of them with growing problems of preserving their research capabilitiesand carrying out world-class research. The passive policy of some governments towardsrestructuring of the academic institutes has the transitory advantage of preserving somejobs. But, the stagnation of research capabilities might have much bigger long-termconsequences.Although widely discussed in policy documents, the need for enterprises to establishcloser co-operation with research units and to increase their research expenditure,practical results are still low. Business investment in research is generally lower than theEU1 5 (Figure 5). Some remarkable exceptions include Romania, Slovenia, CzechRepublic and Slovakia where industrial R&D expenditure is comparable to the level inEU members. But elsewhere, the industrial contribution seems very low. However, aquestion exists as to whether the statistical data really reflect the situation, and whetherthe companies, in particular SMEs, are motivated to report any costs made for researchrather than just as product costs35. The low quality of data for industrial research andinnovation makes it very difficult to assess the situation as regards the financing ofindustrial innovation and therefore to identify appropriate steps to improve the situation.The different pace of privatisation also needs to be taken into account and the level ofcontribution of state-owned companies to research. Figure 5: GERD financed by industry (in %) Source: Eurostat, OECD, National sources of Turkey11^ 4,001,J,17 se41,,304.09.,`\"ks4\"9 6 101995 01997 019981The history of central planning in CEECs and the reliance on public funding sourceshave inhibited the growth of business-research linkages, and this contributes to thedifficulties that public research institutes face today. In Poland, for example, industrialresearch has played only a minor role in the institutes of the Polish Academy of Sciences.These have focused mainly on scientific collaboration with other research institutes inbasic science. Specialised R&D units in Poland have relatively better interactions withindustry, mainly in technology and product development, but even here passivity rules36. 55 Mint DomOlki, Panel MemberJasinski (1997) 36 Branch research institutes had stronger and more differentiated interactions with industryin the past. But with the cutting of state support and drying up of industrial fundingduring the restructuring, they have had severe difficulties to retain professionalequipment and their best staff. Their inability to finance longer-term research and theirpresent focus on short-term services, as well as the lack of consultation with industry onchoosing industry relevant research topics, might further limit the establishment of closercollaboration.The insufficient industry-research links relate also to a lack of demand by industry for theservices that domestic research units can offer. Independent major companies frequentlydisappear after privatisation and become either subsidiaries of multinational corporationsor their specialised suppliers or service providers, which little exploit local researchexpertise. On the other hand, competition is driving domestic enterprises to applyadvanced research results. Despite the high costs of the services of private commercialfirms and foreign consultants, domestic companies in Hungary, for example, rely oncollaboration withforeignlaboratoriesforquality upgradingactivities,productdevelopment and testing37. There are some grounds for hope. The traditionalcollaboration with domestic partners may be re-established if they overcome theproblems of understanding the real industrial needs and improve the quality of theirservices. Companies appreciate the value of individual researchers and prefer to hire theirservices on part-time basis, rather than to establish co-operation agreements with R&Dinstitutes38. Some domestic enterprises continue to rely on their own research capacitiesin engineering, product development and design.University-industry linksDue to the role of the universities as educational and training centres preparing thefuture high-skilled workforce, the impact of transition has been not as acute as in theresearch units. The new framework for education in CEECs has facilitated theestablishment of private universities, many of them specialised in domains relevantto economic needs. Moreover, the development of more open and internationallyintegrated higher education has been initiated (see Chapter 3).Economic expansion has fostered the re-establishment of industry-university links,focused on training high-skilled specialists and managers. In most PACs theinteraction between industry and higher education establishments has been extendedfrom what was originally limited to sponsorship tocloser collaborationindeveloping joint courses and programmes, training materials, on-the-job-training ofstudents, as well as carrying out research. These types of initiatives are creating apositive feedback, in that industries are beginning to sponsor the education of futureemployees. Moreover, the on-going collaboration in setting-up laboratories andtechnology centres at universities islikely to continue and deepen industry-university interactions also in research (Box 5).Universities have developed as important centres for both, research and education.They seem to be a preferred partner for the industry for carrying out contractresearch. In particular, some technical universities (e.g. in Hungary, Bulgaria,Estonia) have long traditions in this area and are on the way to re-establish andwiden this type of activity. In Hungary different foreign companies (e.g. Ericsson, 37 Romijn (1998)38 Howell et al. (2000)\" 40 Nokia, Sony, Knorr-Bremse) are involved in joined activities in research labs at theBudapest Technical University in telecommunications, electronics and automotiveengineering. Box 5: University centre of researchIn Estonia the integration of research at university has significantly strengthened the researchcapacities and intellectual resources of the universities. The Tallinn Technical University (TTU) hascombined bottom-up and top-down approaches in extending its industry relations.For several years now TTU has carried out contract research on behalf of large infrastructurecompanies in the areas of electricity production and distribution and oil shale mining, as well aswith manufacturing companies in the fields of signal processing, electrical equipment and powerelectronics, automotive industry, etc. In the field of telecommunication, TTU has started long-termco-operation with the Estonian Mobile Telephone Company and Ericsson Eesti AS., launching atesting and training laboratory. The co-operation of TTU in chemical technologies with amanufacturer of rare earth metals (AS Silmet Grupp) includes mainly technical consultation andtechnical information exchange, but is expected to be extended to contract research in comingyears.In addition to contracts with local companies TTU performs contract research for foreigncompanies as well. Current contracts include large multinational concerns (like Nokia), but alsosmall companies (Fincitec in Finland) and ranges from sectors such as chemical technologies,material technologies to information technologies and telecommunications.Considering the important role of competence centres and innovation support structures forknowledge transfer, a Tallinn Technical University Innovation Centre Foundation was founded in1998 to connect R&D data of the TTU with technological needs of industrial enterprises.The range of activities of TTU will be extended with the establishment of a graduate school. Thiswill contribute to the concentration of the existing resources and the improvement of researchtraining.(Rein lattner, Panel member)Universities have formed their own centres for co-operation with industry. Theflexibility of university management and their self-governance facilitatetheestablishment of spin-off firms for commercialisation of research results. Theinvolvement of some universities39 in shared activities with the newly created spin-off firms -e.g. the participation of professors in business activities and theengagement of students as trainees and workers - is fostering research-industryrelations, as well as the further development of applied research in PACs.Building bridgesAt institutional level, one of the obvious challenges for building a coherent RDI systemrelates to the linking of R&D institutes, universities and industry. The teaching activitiesof researchers, both at universities and at research units, the involvement of professors inresearch projects, collaboration in scientific events and programmes are part of the newtype of co-operation pattern in the RDI system. However, these interactions are mainly atindividual level without establishing tighter institutional links (except where the researchinstitutions have been integrated into universities following an active R&D restructuringpolicy). \" e.g. Tartu University and Tallinn Technical University in Estonia, Warsaw Technical University 3841BEST COPY AVAILABLE The need for building bridges between research and industry has led during the pastfew years to the emergence of a range of new institutional structures (state or privatesupported bridging elements) in most pre-accession countries:infrastructure units (parks, incubators);organisations for innovation support of a 'consultant' character (innovationrelay centres, Euro-info centres, technological centres, specialised consultingcompanies, foundations).Set up by government bodies, researchers or non-governmental organisations(NG05), the new intermediaries represent an enormous concerted attempt toestablish new models of co-operation between business and research. The activitiesof the intermediaries cover a wide range of knowledge-intensive services provisionof information and advice, ICT support, organisation of training programmes,assistance for finding partners and joint projects, dissemination of advancedtechnologies, channelling innovative ideas & inventions and support intheprotection of intellectual property. However, the development of intermediaries isheavily dependent on existing financial resources. After the end of the initial publicor international funding, a number of them face the dilemma how to survive in themarket-driven environment. Box 6: Intermeddiary to support applied researchThe Technology Development Foundation of Turkey4\u00b0 has been established by the collaboration ofprivate and public sectors in 1991. The assets of the Foundation are donated by the founders andsome obtained through the Loan Agreement between Word Bank and, Turkey. In the managementof the Foundation senior representatives of the Treasury and Foreign Trade and the Scientific andTechnical Research Council of Turkey (TUBITAK) are involved. The aims of the Foundation are:to encourage Turkish industry to increase in real terms its investments in research anddevelopment and to carry out all activities in accordance with the requirements.to provide funds and expertise supportive of industrial technology projects to enhancetechnology and technological infrastructure.to identify technological research areas and carry out research and projects in such areas aloneor by contract to bridge the technology gap between Turkey and other nations andstrengthening Turkey's position in some global trade sectors.to strength the ties between Turkish industry and higher education institutions, TUBITAK andother public and private research organizations.(Dilek Cetindamar, Panel Member) A growing number of new players, e.g. foundations, industrial associations, chambers ofcommerce, NG0s, are supporting research and innovation in PACs (Box 6). Most ofthem have an active intermediary role between the institutions governing the RDIsystem, the small and large companies and the research units. Some are going alsofurtherproviding knowledge-intensive services and/or trying to solve applied researchproblems, and, in particular, focusing on the socio-economic demands for research.Through their efforts at networking, these actors are quickly able to build research teamson demand. The flexibility for building multidisciplinary teams, involving prominentresearchers, engineers, lawyers, entrepreneurs, etc. in a particular project, maximisestheir chances of success in the dynamic changing environment and in the competition forresearch and innovation funding. 40 see also http://www.ttav.ora.oleng/enajnain.html 394 2BEST COPY AVAILABLE The extension and building of further research capacities in many candidate countriesoccurs via the establishment of centres of excellence or centres of competence, in somecases at universities, in others at strong research institutes or newly established bodies.As discussed in the first chapter, international co-operation within the EU Fifthframework programme has fostered the emergence of a number of centres of excellencein all candidate countries. The European Research Area provides also for development ofcentres of excellence at national level and positioning them within a single Europeannetwork - fostering high-level research and more efficient deployment of the limitedhuman and financial resources for obtaining new technological solutions and scientificachievements. At national level, the emerging centres rely on existing and potentialcapacity. The establishment of a pool of R&D competence to respond to the needs ofresearch by industry, as well as the support of the scientific community, industry and thestate to these structures is facilitating their growth as attraction poles for research in therespective areas. Of particular importance is their strong international collaboration withresearchers in the same area for establishing pan-European excellence in research.Future models of researchConcerted actions of all stakeholders in PACs, e.g. policy makers, industrialists,researchers, professors, NGOs, are needed to build a coherent RDI system in whichthe institutional base is densely interconnected. In this period of structural changethere is a widely accepted need to create a favourable environment and fostereffective communication between the major actors inthe system. Bridgingorganisations are part of the solution, but they do not substitute the need for intra-organisationalrestructuring.Bridging functions are most likely to work ascomplementary functions to restructured enterprises, universities, R&D servicecompanies. The survival of bridging organisations will require them to develop asustainable business model, perhaps as SMEs, with their own specific in-housecapabilities, including knowledge transfer capabilities.41At this stage, when old and new structures exist in parallel, it is still uncertain whatmodel for the development of research candidate countries will follow. There arereal opportunities for PACs to leapfrog ahead towards the setting up of new types ofresearch interactions, more appropriate for the demands of the knowledge society. Ifwe consider the present trends, some important models for research could beassumed for candidate countries:1. Economic modernisation is driving new industry-university links focused onbuilding the future knowledgeable workforce. This provides an entry point foruniversity-based laboratories and technology centres engaged in industrial supportfor applied research. Universities also may attract industrial researchers as part-time professors. Personal links between supervisors and graduate researchers whothen go on to work in industry will also help. Finally, the good facilities in someuniversities, in particular high-speed Internet and modernised technology basis oflaboratories, are likely to support their claim as to be centres of research in thefuture. 41Dyker et al (1999) 404 3 2. Centres of excellence are emerging outside of the universities characterised bystrong research teams, young researchers, dynamic professors and close links toindustrialists. These centres of excellence provide a creative environment for basicresearch and generation of new ideas and innovation. Most of them have beenestablished within EU programmes for research and therefore are dependent oninternational funding and the question is to what extent they can be developedfurther as centres of national strategic value. Recognition of this possibility bylocal public and private stakeholders is especially important for this prospect topan out.3.International and regional networking is increasingly becoming an essentialmeans of staying abreast of research developments and acquiring expertise.Support for common projects with foreign partners can contribute to profilingareas of excellence and competence and could lead to the establishment ofregional multinational research centres with international teams actually based inPAC laboratories. 2.2 Technology transfer and innovationIntroductionKnowledge is a driving force of economic growth and societal development - butonly when itis successfully put into practical application. Thus innovation hasbecome an important policy theme for Europe from the Green Paper on Innovation42to the Lisbon summit of the European Council (March 2000), which set the goalEurope to become \"the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy.\"In the process of developing market economy and meeting the objectives of theaccession to the EU, innovation and technology transfer are likewise essential forindustrial competitiveness and market growth in PACs. To catch-up rapidly PACshave to establish frameworks conducive to innovation, support innovative firms andfoster a culture of entrepreneurship. While the previous section has focusedpredominantly on the institutions within the knowledge infrastructure and the linksbetween them, the aim of this section is to outline the main mechanisms fortechnology transfer and innovation in candidate countries.Knowledge and technology flowsThe process of economic transformation in CEECs had many consequences fordomestic enterprises. The opening of the market to competition, privatisation, thecollapse of the traditional export market in Eastern Europe and the disappearance ofstate support, have constituted a dramatic shift in the business environment. Theincreased competition after the liberalisation, along with the disintegration of thestate distribution and marketing network and the decline of customer demand, havecaused a number of domestic companies to lose their place in the market - manyhave gone bankrupt. The survival of companies has been highly dependent on thespeed of change in their productivity and competitiveness. The access to new 42COM(95)688 final technologies followed by fast acquisition and application has been the mostsuccessful strategy for enterprises.The main mechanisms for technology transfer in PACs are mostly indirect such as:inward transfer of 'hard' (product, process) or 'soft' (management) technology,mainly by foreign direct investment;integrationof localfirmsintotheinternationalproductionchainbysubcontracting, outsourced assembly processes, provision of distribution services,reverse engineering of products and/or customised production and design;co-operative industrial alliances with foreign partners and learning-by-trading.Direct technology transfer is limited to interchange of personnel (spin-offs from researchunits or researcher-led start-ups) and is rather small scale. What seem to be lacking areeffective stimulants to attract significant levels of corporate investment in R&D.Inward technology transferForeign direct investment (FDI) offers the prospect of significant supplements toweak domestic investments and is considered a key vehicle for technology transfer.The foreign ownership of many companies in PACs has allowed them easy access toforeign finance and markets, and to modern technology as well. Even where aminimal transfer of 'hard' technology (product, process) has been carried out, FDIhas led to transfer of 'soft' (management) technology. In both cases the transfer oftechnology has been facilitated by the availability of knowledgeable individuals toadapt it to the local circumstances. However, the dominating opinion in manycircles, that the availability of cheap highly skilled labour in PACs is attractingforeign investors, has been disputed in a recent EBRD study43. Actually, the mainattractions have been access to the host market and favourable regulatory and taxtreatment. For this reason, in 1997 more than 85% of EU FDI in the candidatecountries were concentrated in 4 countries Hungary, Czech Republic, Poland andTurkey. However, recent Eurostat data\" show that Hungary and the Czech Republicare characterised by relatively lower rates of growth of EU investments, while inRomania, Poland, Bulgaria and in the Baltic countries a significant expansion hasbeen noted.FDI had serious implications for the rest of the domestic enterprises withoutresources and skilled personnel their competitiveness has been very limited, leadingto a 'dual economy' in candidate countries. For the domestic manufacturers theimport of foreign machines and equipment has been the best strategy to keep theirmarket niche. Even if enterprises are able to maintain their market position and carryout innovation, high cost and time pressure has prompted them to prefer to buyturnkey technology rather than to develop domestic solutions45. However, due to theinsufficient resources in most cases, technology upgrading has been limited to theintroduction of some basic machinery to allow them to improve quality, meetenvironmental standards and produce a limited range of contracted products.The transfer of embodied technology from abroad and FDI alike make little use oflocal R&D capacity and capability (Box 7). Nevertheless, FDI has played an 45EBRD, Transition report 2000\" Eurostat (2000a)45Mueller et al. (2000) 4245 essential role in the upgrading of human and capital resources in CEECs. Foreigninvestors have created better employment opportunities and have contributed toupgrading the skills of the best-trained specialists and the overall improvement ofthe technological knowledge of the personnel. It is not surprising, therefore, that thelabour productivity of foreign-owned enterprises varied in 1998 from 150% (inEstonia) to almost 300% (in Hungary) of the productivity in domestic companies\". Box 7: FDI and local R&DAfter the investment by leading foreign companies (and the following change of ownership) in bigtelecommunications manufacturers in Hungary, Poland and the Czech Republic, local knowledge ,has been used in modernisation and in the localisation of imported technologies. To assist thetransfer, parent companies have provided technological assets such as R&D personal, know-how,licencesandpatents.Apart from advanced technology, thesubsidiarieshavereceivedcomplementary financial assets and to a lesser extent marketing skills support. The main tasks ofthe R&D units of the domestic company have been related to software development and adaptationof the equipment to the local netwoik. 41In the car and the textile industry foreign investors have established manufacturing plants and theR&D function has been shifted to their technology centres abroad. Previous R&D departments havebeen closed. The main emphasis of the foreign owners has been to upgrade and improve quality ofproduction and introduce new technologies rather than to focus on domestic R&D or designfunctions.\u00b0Finnish electronics firm Elcoteq, that assembles handsets for Nokia and Ericsson, has openedfactories in Estonia. However, no Estonian R&D have been used. Moreover, due to the shortages of ;local computer specialists, Scandinavian companies are using talented Estonians abroad instead ofusing the possibility for outsourcing some tasks\u00b0. Networking of enterprisesIn the past decade, communication technologies - especially the Internet - havefostered new business configurations and world-wide production chains. Productionprocessescontinueto become internationalisedwith themodularisationofproduction tasks between more and less advanced countries. These trends providenew opportunities for technology transfer in candidate countries and technologicalcatching-up, but often within a narrow range of production activities. Sub-contracting to foreign companies has become for many domestic manufacturers theonly feasible survival strategy, and is technologically less demanding than thedevelopment of their own products. After losing the large Soviet markets and facedwith the increasing competition of foreign firms, companies from CEECs in manysectors have been integrated into the product life-cycle through subcontracting oroutsourcing, assembly, distribution, reverse engineering or at best customisingproduct design (Table 6). 46 European Commission DG Enterprise (2001)47Sadowski (2000)\" Romijn (1998)\" European Trend chart Estonia (2000), http://trendchari.cordislu 434 6BEST COPYAVAILABLE Table 6: (2000)For SMEs in PACs, as in many countries, networking has become an effectivemeans of innovation inits own right. Interactions with other firms and theopportunities for knowledge sharing and exchange (via obtaining patents, licenses,or purchasing of equipment) have allowed companies to be more specialised and tofocus on their core competencies. For complementary knowledge and know-how,they increasingly rely on interaction with other companies.In the absence of FDI, the technology transfer and know-how crucial for thedevelopment of leading domestic computer manufacturers have been transferredthrough non-equity co-operation agreements with foreign partners. A process oflearning-by-trading and building strategic co-operative alliances is becoming themain channel for technology transfer for a number of hardware and softwarecompanies in CEECs. Although hardware companies have concentrated on the lessknowledge intensive computer assembly functions they have often been able toattain large market shares. Moreover, many domestic software companies haveexploited the local knowledge of customers as a competitive asset and are oftenahead of foreign companies in the local market that require local know-how such assoftware for company management, financial accounting or banking. 50Innovation perfomiance and demand by industryThe lack of data on the innovation performance of the enterprises in candidatecountries makes itdifficult to draw any general conclusions. Recent Eurostatstatistics for four countries51 show that large enterprises in PACs continue to havehigher expenditures for R&D and innovation than the SMEs, (consistent with theEU). Shares of innovative enterprises in Slovenia (33%), Poland (29%) andRomania (28%) are similar to Spain (29%), but very low in comparison to Germany(69%) or Ireland (73%)52. Generally, the share of research and engineering activitiesin CEECs is more than two times smaller than in the EU. Enterprises in Poland andRomania tend to invest in acquisition of machinery and equipment, while inSlovenia the emphasis is on in-house research. Polish companies also makesignificant investments in industrial design and production preparation, while inSlovenia second place goes to marketing strategies. All companies show very lowinvestment in training. 5\u00b0 see Kubielas et al.(2000)51 Eurostat (2000c)52 Radosevic (2001) 444 7 Limited financial resources and low revenues prevent domestic companies from fundingtheir own research or from accessing other R&D results. Turkish pharmaceuticalcompanies, for example, have low R&D capacities due to the small production volumesand the price regulation in the sector. Their R&D activities comprise mainly researchrelated to licenses or production problems. Any investment in long-term research indeveloping new biotechnology applications for pharmaceutical products, even thoughthey have a big potential, has been limited53.The Eurostat survey data suggest that demand for innovation has different groundsand is disproportionately spread over economic sectors in candidate countries. Themajority of innovative enterprises focus on product and process innovations at thesame time. While undertaking innovation, domestic companies in PACs aimprimarily at improving their competitiveness and increasing market share. Formeeting this target they focus often on product quality and diversification throughin-house research and using the services of testing and certification companies forquality assurance. To a less extend the reduction of labour costs, materials andenergy consumptioninfluences theinnovationactivities of enterprises. Therequirements for environmental protection are also inciting innovation, and theintroduction of new environmentally friendly technologies or other measures toreduce the pollution.The production of goods and services is becoming more knowledge-intensive and avariety of new services employ highly qualified labour. Economic growth and thedemand for knowledge-intensive services have influenced self-employment. A lot ofthe newly established firms in the service sector are engaged in engineering orconsulting. Although quantitatively small, these entrepreneurial firms are importantcatalysts of innovation and represent an important model of the human dimension oftechnology transfer. A large number of the entrepreneurial firms are spin-offs fromformer research units or universities, oriented towards the marketing of their ownproducts. Many researchers, mainly in the area of applied research, have foundedown companies and exploit the results of their R&D work.54Action lines for innovationCandidate countries differ in the policy prioritisation of innovation action lines, andin the practical measures undertaken (see Table A3 in Annex III). Cyprus, Lithuaniaand Hungary have introduced a wide range of practical measures covering allpriority areas of the Innovation Action Plan55, while Estonia, Slovenia, Poland andRomania, put higherpoliticalpriorities on education and awareness-raisingactivities. A third group of countries (Latvia, Slovakia and the Czech Republic)emphasises applied research and strengthening the ability of enterprises to absorbnew technologies. Latvia puts also high priority on fostering innovation culture ofenterprises and introducing measures for education and training.Generally, the main problems are related to the implementation of these measures andtheir real value for the enterprises. The lack of reliable data on innovation performance ofenterprises, means that policy decisions are more influenced by the EU negotiation \" BASA6A et al. (2000)54 Meske (2000)55 COM(96)589 final\"8 requirements than either the needs of domestic enterprises or national and regionaldevelopment priorities. As the assessment in the EBRD Transition report suggests, thelevel of the most advanced candidate countries is close to the level required fordevelopment of private enterprises without major obstacles. However, the process ofsetting-up of legal and administrative environments for innovation is still not finished inPACs. Although the governments have launched a range of initiatives to fosterinnovation and the importance of business networking has been recognised in manyPACs, only a few have introduced real practical measures to encourage foreign investorsto use domestic suppliers or have provided a favourable tax relief (see Box 8). Moreover,intellectual property rights (IPRs) are not considered as a key constraint on innovation inPACs and few activities have been carried out to establish 1PR support services inuniversities and to raise the awareness of innovative SMEs to protect know-how.56 Box 8: Fostering industrial research and innovationMost candidate countries have introduced some tax initiatives for general improvement of businessclimate and investment. Only Hungary and Poland from the first group of PACs\" had a special taxdeduction for industrial R&D investments. However, in Poland the tax relief for R&D wasdiscontinued in 2000 as part of the overall tax reform process. In Cyprus a proposal for a 10 yearstax holiday on profits derived from the production of new products is being discussed by thegovernment. In the Czech Republic tax iniciatives have been introduced for companies that planexpansion, foreseeing up to 10 years tax holiday on technology imports.Hungary and the Czech Republic appear as pioneers in introducing policy instruments for supportof the development of business networks and promoting of supply chains between large (foreignowned) firms and SMEs. In Hungary within the INTEGRATOR scheme, launched in 1999, avertical network of a large firm and its suppliers is entitled to a grant to reinforce the linkages to itsmembers. The objective of this policy scheme is to increase the capacity of domestic companies tobecome suppliers to multinationals for a longer term, as well as to foster domestic firms to upgradetheir technological and managerial abilities and practices.Similarly, a government subsidy for subcontracting relationships has been implemented in theCzech Republic. The established supply-chain network of VW/SKODA is considered to be asuccessful case. According to its obligation in the contract with the state to address domesticsuppliers, the company has developed a demanding scheme for improvement of their productquality, observation of delivery terms and costs reduction. The result was that a number of domesticfirms have gained the status of reliable component suppliers and have been able to extend theirproduction through contracts with other foreign manufacturers.(Source. European Commission DG Enterprise, 2001)Regional disparities and the scarcity of S&T factors in regional development plans alsocause major concern. The scope for local supply and demand for S&T and assessmentsof regional strengths and weaknesses in R&D are mostly unknown, while technologytransfer and innovation is to be encouraged. The R&D system mainly centres on capitalcities, with weak and slow regional innovation performance. Institutional decentralisationhas been attempted in some candidate countries. Hungary is considered the mostadvanced in this respect, but more diversity has been achieved in Poland, where someefforts have been made to set up regional institutions for technology transfer and anetwork of (regional) Woivodship Clubs'58. Similarly, in Bulgaria, the Agency for SMEsin collaboration with BARDA (Bulgarian Association of Regional Development Agents)has established an institutional framework of more than 20 Regional DevelopmentAgencies covering many administrative districts and operating at least one business/ agri- 56 European Commission DG Enterprise (2001)5' Cyprus, Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Poland, Slovenia58 European Commission DG Research (1999) 464BEST COPY AVAILABLE business centre or business incubator and Internet bureau. SMEs and regionaldevelopment are key debate issues also in Romania, in particular the introduction ofeffective measures to promote local initiatives, an active partnership between the localauthorities, business and research and their co-operation with other European countries inorder to promote technological innovation.The involvement of domestic enterprises ina number of activities within EUprogrammes59 has facilitated regional and bilateral co-operation in innovation andresearch (e.g. within wide European networks of Euro Info Centres, Innovation RelayCentres, Business and Innovation Centres, Centres of Excellence). For example, PHAREand INCO-Copernicus have provided support for product development, as well as foreignconsultancy assistance for restructuring, even though a survey of enterprises outlinessome specific problems60. In particular, foreign consultants are not always aware of thedomestic problems and this reflects on the results of the consultancy and trainingprovided.Therefore,involving more domestic consultantsmightincreasetheeffectiveness of EU support, with the benefit of fostering interactions between domesticindustry and research, and upgrading the qualification of human resources in PACs. 2.3 Scientific human resources and mobilityIntroductionAbundant and mobile human resources for research are now regarded as essential to ahigh performance research system in Europe and are the foremost important factor in theRDI system.61 This implies a need for a significant increase in the stock of researchersin Europe and above all in the CEECs62, where the numbers of active researchersdeclined significantly in the transition years. In some views this was a serious loss, inothers a necessary shaking out. The most important challenge now is to motivateyoung people to enter research as a career and then to make it attractive to stay inresearch.First, talented people will only enter research careers in adequate numbers if there aresufficient opportunities to train and an attractive environment in which to work as aresearcher (i.e. good research infrastructures, centres of excellence, the possibility forresearch autonomy, flexible and performance related career paths and good levels ofremuneration). Attracting young people is important because many researchers areleaving for other occupations (brain loss) and because the labour pool of researchers isageing. At the same time, the market economy and changing practices andtechnologies require new skills from the researchers (e.g. management and marketingskills, retraining with new techniques, broader scope) which calls for changes in thesystem of training. The fundamental requirements are investment in research facilitiesand merit based research careers.Second, the only sustainable solution to international brain drain (the downside ofmobility) is the creation of high quality research opportunities in the candidatecountries.63 Actually, the integration of the R&D and innovation system of PACs into 59 EU Fifth Framework Programme, Tempus, Socrates, Leonardo, Phare, etc.60Romijn (1998)61 COM (2000) 6 (18 January 2000), Towards a European research area62 European Commission DG Research (1999)63 See Casey et al. (2001) 4750 the European Research Area has probably been facilitated through the participation ofscientists in the community programmes and the national programmes for academicexchange of the EU members. This international exchange is widely seen as animportant precondition for increasing the qualification of professors, researchers andstudents,for development of European research standards in PACs and wideEuropean scientific integration.Preserving and building of new assetsIt is widely known that, the research capacity that existed under the former regime wentinto particularly rapid decline during the early 1990s. There was also a substantialoutflow of scientists from technological activity in virtually all of these countries, and thisdid not appear to stabilise until the mid 1990s (Figure 6). On closer inspection, however,the loss of R&D personnel mainly affected industrial research rather than highereducation (Figure 7)64. Indeed in some countries such as Czech Republic universityteaching staff actually rose by 16% during the time of the shakeouts in industrial research(1990-93). The overall staff cuts indicate a substantial shaking out of an industrialresearch system poorly adapted to modernisation and not internationally competitive. Figure 6: The decline of R&D personnel in the CEECs 120 100 80 60 40 20 CbC)Ns\u00b0CP0PolandXSlovak Rep0Czechoslovakia0HungaryLithuania Source: Adapted from Figures 7 and 8 in Meske (1998), updated6--Czech Rep0Romaniae Estonia Incontrovertibly, however, the result was an absolute reduction in scientific humanresources. First, there was a loss of qualified people out of the system. A number ofthe more mobile and talented researchers have been \"brain drained\"65. Manyresearchers have left the scientific labour force altogether and are now \"under-employing\" their skills in jobs which perhaps offer greater security and better pay, if 6\u00b0 The data in Figure 7 are not fully comparable because of changes and differences in the definitions used. However, the generalpattern is clear and is repeated in the other countries that are not included here, notably Poland.6 5 It is hard to estimate the size of the problem. For example, during the period of transition in the Czech Republic the period oftransformation, the number of university staff leaving for long-term stays abroad grew to a level of around 10% (with participa-tion in short-term stays up to six months is much higher). Although this is significant previous fears of a massive brain drain inthe Czech research sector did not materialise. 4851 not the same intellectual challenge i.e. 'brain loss'. Second, there was a loss of apotential training ground and employment potential for scientifically qualified staff -the new private firms tend to buy their technologies from the West rather than tolocate R&D in the PACs. A lack of economic stability as it affects demand for S&Tstaff will tend to encourage researchers to pursue their careers abroad.Presently, the main concern is focused on people leaving R&D for other economicsectors. However, for the whole society this brain-loss could be considered as apositive trend towards increasing the quality standards of the companies and theadministration and distribution of knowledge in other sectors. For example, apositive byproduct is that many researchers start their own technology-basedcompanies and hence contribute to growth of innovation activities of industry. Figure 7: The relative sector changes of scientists (CEEC) Source: Adapted from Figures 11, 12, 13 and 17 in Meske (1998)In terms of new inputs to the stocks of researchers, the poor conditions for state-of-the-art research (due to the outdated equipment) and the low level of salaries in theresearch sector discourage young people from choosing a career in R&D. Fewstudents choose to study scientific subjects. The young generation in the CzechRepublic, for example, is not interested enough in such fields as physics, chemistryand some technical sciences, while students have become interested to a greaterextent inhumanities and social sciences, which were suppressed under thecommunist regime66. The relatively low intake of young people contributes to ageneral ageing of the population of researchers.In response, significant policy attention is now being paid in a number of countriesto attracting young researchers, through targeted seminars, training and exchangeprogrammes. Moreover, the more directly vocational subjects (business, economics 66Illnerova (2001) engineering and other technical studies) do tend to be quite popular opening theopportunity for a more applied research orientation of the R&D system in the futureand thus improving the current situation.Also, the market economy sets new requirements for R&D management and hencedifferent R&D workforce skills are needed. New challenges for the human resourcesin R&D are to develop management and marketing skills necessary in thecompetition for funding, as well as for co-operation with industry and theinternational scientific community. Researchers need to develop a much broaderscope in order to be able to assess the societal and economic relevance of theirresearch and to conform to new technological trends and industry standards. Theyalso need more generic research skills and knowledge to be able to work on projectsacrosstraditionaldisciplinary boundaries,aswellas communicationskillsfacilitating their work in multidisciplinary teams.67Outdated equipment in research laboratories and universities is another bottleneck toworld-class research in CEECs. It has been very hard for most of the institutes toattract national and international funding for the renewal of equipment. At the sametime the unique and expensive scientific equipment provided through internationalfunding or within research programmes has been often inefficiently used.As noted above, a critical requirement inthe development of the knowledgeinfrastructure is the attraction of young people into research careers. One aspect is thetargeted replacement and updating of the research equipment so that it is possible forresearchers and university teachers to pursue a career in their home countries. Another isthe connection of the research-training system within the 'e-Science' infrastructures thatare emerging tolink up to researchers not just in Europe but globally. Also,establishment of bridges between doctoral training and research careers will be necessaryfor people to take the risk of embarking on the long process of becoming a qualifiedscientist. International collaborative projects will certainly improve the attractiveness ofsuch a route, but the attraction of a research career should be at home as well as abroad.Mobility of researchers in enlarged European UnionThe removal of obstacles to mobility is a priority that has been ratified in a series ofEuropean Council meetings (the European Council in Lisbon March 2000, ResearchCouncil June 2000) and the recent publication of Communication of the Commission\"a mobility strategy for the European Research Area.\" This Communication wasrecently launched in a conference in Brussels \"An Enlarged Europe for Researchers.\"The Communication makes the point that mobility is important because it:fosters collaborationfacilitates the transfer of scientific knowledgehelps raise scientific excellence of individual researchers and supports centres ofexcellencewidens access to top class training and facilitiesincreases the efficiency of research investments by pooling competencies,experience, the use of share facilities Costas Constantinou, Panel member 50 In the development of the policies in this area much attention has been given toremoving obstacles to mobility. Barriers identified by the recent High Level Groupinclude: insufficient funding, opportunities for fellowships; immigration controls;incompatibility between social security and tax systems; lack of internationalisation ofrecruitment procedures; low support for families of researchers; and little transparencyon implications of different intellectualproperty rightregimes.Interms ofadministrative barriers to mobility it should be noted that researchers from candidatecountries have advantages over other workers in that they will have early freemovement within the EU15 supported by agreements on social security, bilateral taxagreements and the portability of supplementary pensions.Women typically face greater barriers to mobility and high risks to their careers fromtaking periods abroad. The issue of return from an international experience perhaps atpost-doc level is also problematic in that very few national research career structuresare set-up to allow people to move easily from one country to another. A crucial aspectof these plans to stimulate mobility is the introduction of stringent quality controls onmobility schemes. This is essential to permit researchers to be sure that their periodabroad does not lead them into a dead-end street because the host research centre doesnot provide sufficient opportunities to publish, develop networks with the club of eliteworld class researchers or gain frontier experience. This will be important for youngresearchers from candidate countries.Meanwhile, the Communication also makes explicit mention of the need to avoidbrain drain from less developed regions and candidate countries. It proposes to do thisby furthering the distribution of research excellence in the different regions of Europeincluding the less-favoured regions and in the candidate countries. This is certainlybeing furthered by the participation of Candidate country research teams in EuropeanCommunity Framework Programme projects and by connection to the 2.5 Gbitresearch grid (GEANT and TERENA of the National Research Education NetworkAssociation). Such infrastructures increase access to European level research facilitiessuch as those in the EIRO forum 68In addition, there are plans to make provisions for the return and reintegration ofresearchers. Here again a precondition is that there should be high quality researchteams and opportunities to undertake cutting edge research in the home countryotherwise there would be nothing to attract back the most talented researchers.However, with the growth of the economies in most CEECs (except Bulgaria andSlovakia) there are expectations of decreasing emigration of researchers to thirdcountries69. In a pan-European prospective the mobility of researchers can beconsidered as a positive trend leading to the exchange of experience and new ideas,international and regional collaboration and innovation transfer. At the same time thepersonal appreciation of different cultures and traditions can contribute to the processof European integration. It is therefore worth thinking about increasing the flows ofresearchers also from the West to the East, in particular of students and youngresearchers. EIRO forum is composed of CERN (particle physics), ESRF (synchrotron radiation), ILL (neutron source), EFDA (fusion),ESA (space), ESO (astronomy and astrophysics) and EMI3L (microbiology)).69 European Commission DG Research (1999), p. 248 515 4 The opening up of the PACs academic systems, and the influx of foreign funding, isleading to a considerably greater integration of PACs into the international science base.This is indicated in the rise of co-publishing. Some countries (Hungary, Czech Republicand Bulgaria for example) are able to build on strong research traditions. Other countries,such as Romania had much less to build upon. Such international integration, of course,carries risks from potential brain drain and very great transformation pressures on existingstaff and resources.Transformation pressures relate in particular to the role of academic research and teachingasit divides between academies of sciences and universities. There is considerableuncertainty about the future architectural structure of the higher education/research nexus. 2.4 New environment for research and innovationThe innovation environment and the management of knowledge flows are of crucialimportance for candidate countries. However, if government measures are to lead toa higher level of locally based technology development and transfer activity, theymust address those factors which facilitate the emergence of a new research andinnovationenvironmentmacro-economicandregulatoryconditions,thecommunication infrastructure, the level of education and skills, the degree ofpersonnel mobility, labour relations and prevailing management practices.Scientific human resources are essential to a high performance knowledge systemand require particular attention. Individual researchers are at the centre of presenttrends for strengthening of research at universities or in centres of excellence, forbuilding flexible research teams and establishing regional and international patternsof research collaboration. Moreover, the availability of knowledgeable individualsfacilitates knowledge transfer and innovation and the fast acquisition and applicationof new technologies by enterprises. Generally,themobility of researcherscontributes to wide dissemination and use of knowledge and to the integration ofresearch into the economy and society. Therefore, it is necessary to focus onscientific human resources in order to preserve and upgrade the existing researchcapacities. The most important challenge, however, is to motivate young people toenter research as a career and to create an attractive environment to keep them inresearch, as well as to foster high quality research performance.The low level of technology transfer within PACs underlines the need for publicsupport to industry at national and regional level. Although during the process ofharmonisation of the national legislation with the 'acquis communautaire' a numberof measures have been taken, aimed at support of innovation activities and SMEs,their practical implementation has not brought the expected results (often due toinefficient application or lack of resources). Therefore, a challenge for all PACs is,on the basis of real data for innovation performance and industrial demands, toestablish a favourable environment for companies to invest in new technologies andproduct development. There is a need for coherent national policy in support ofinnovation and the introduction of various instruments for direct and indirectfinancial support, provision of venture capital and new tax initiatives (e.g. taxallowances, indirect and pay-roll taxation, etc.). 5255 In the process of national policy formulation by the government, regional developmentdimensions as well as particular sectors and branches should be included, to determinewhere to invest and where are the research and national comparative advantages neededin order to develop own competencies and identity. An important step is to identifyconcrete short, middle and long-term strategies that are tied into realistic and effectivefunding mechanisms.Although a range of new institutional structures are emerging in most of PACs (e.g.information centres, science and technology parks, and business incubators), there is stilla need to consider possible measures to provide a full range of innovation supportservices. Small and medium sized companies will need assistance in accessingtechnological knowledge and managerial expertise, as well as in financing their ownresearch and innovation.The effective framework for the protection of intellectual property rights, inparticular industrial property (e.g. trademarks, industrial design and inventions, etc.)might contribute also to business incentives to conduct domestic R&D activities andencourages the transfer of state-of-the-art technology into the economy and itsdiffusion inside the country. IPR protection, as well as the whole industrialenvironment, are important conditions for FDI and need to be seriously consideredby creating a framework for promotion of research and innovation in PACs.Looking at the demand-side, market-driven development of industry might be acrucial factor for the growth of innovation activities in candidate countries. In theprocess of privatisation, restructuring or pure survival in the market, companies arenot in the position to think about investing in research and development. But, in thelong run competition will drive enterprises to introduce new technologies, newproducts and services, to think about new work organisation and marketingstrategies. The large local companies might build in-house research teams or eveninvest in branch research units. Co-operation with universities for training andcontract research are the first steps towards wider integration of research andindustry in process of knowledge sharing and exchange.On the whole, governments need to play an integrating role in managing knowledgein the whole economy, making therefore the technology and innovation policy anintegral part of the overall economic policy. The corporate governance on one side,and the legal and regulatory framework on the other, financial support mechanisms,assistance for innovative SMEs, protection of IPRs and last, but not least, attractingpeople to stay in researchare important factors for the take-up of technologytransfer and innovation and for building a coherent knowledge system in candidatecountries. 5356 Chapter 3Learning Capabilities3.1 Training and skills mismatchIntroductionThe global trends towards knowledge economy are changing the workforce in terms ofsize and composition, as well as the knowledge and skills required for success. Thecompetitiveness of companies appears increasingly dependent on the ability to develop,recruit and retain a technologically sophisticated workforce. However, there are concernsthat the labour in PACs is not able to meet market demand for skilled and knowledgeableworkers and that this gap is growing. Therefore, the specific needs for a digital workforceneed to be addressed by the system of education and training focusing in particular oneconomic relevance and higher quality and the need for life-long learning. Vocational qualifications and the high tech economyA preliminary view of indicators such as literacy rates and vocational qualification levelsgives the impression that the relatively high educational levels provide a good basis forthis future development. In international comparisons in terms of 'skill stocks', theCEECs perform relatively well.7\u00b0 The proportion of the working age population withmore than just basic education in such PACs is comparable with the medium levelOECD countries such as Spain, Portugal, Greece, Korea or Mexico. However, whilstliteracy levels and basic vocational qualification levels are relatively high, the proportionof the workforce with non-vocational tertiary qualifications is lower than in the EU(Table 7).Table 7: Vocational qualifications of the workforce in Central Europe, 1997 Czech Rep.HungaryPolandSlovakiaSloveniaEUThird level education 81412131519Upper secondary 333234342838Vocational and below 595454535742Total 100100100100100100Note:From survey's taken during the second half of 1997 except for Poland and the EU, which was taken during 1996.One per cent of the EU sample gave no response.Source: Knell (1998) based on various national labour-force surveys and the 1996 EU labour market survey.But a recent EBRD survey71 casts doubt on the value of this stock of vocationalqualifications. The survey tests the opinion of foreign investors' on the quality of labourin transition economies and the main deficiencies of workers there (Table 8). Inparticular, workers in candidate countries generally lack flexibility of adaptation and needon average around 6 months to achieve the same level of productivity like in Western 7\u00b0 see World Bank, 1996, Available indicators only partially capture all the aspects of human resource formation. On-the-jobtraining, the tacit aspect of human skills, learning by doing, quality of education and institutional context of human learning arenot captured.71 EBRD, Transition report 2000 555 7 Europe. A similar critique can be mounted at lower levels of educational qualification. Inthat the apparently abundant supply of vocationally qualified workers is belied by thequality of the skills. \"It seems that the educational systems and the experience of workersin the period before transition did not prepare them adequately for the requirements of themarket economy.\"72 Both sectors of supply of qualified labour therefore are facingdemands for structural adaptation.This is one of the reasons for investors to remain hesitant about using the most modernproduction processes in Eastern Europe. Moreover, while IT specialists and financialstaff are at least available, there are difficulties in finding experienced managers. Table 8: Main deficiencies of staff in CEECs compared to home country (as % responses)technical skills IT skillsgeneral flexibility/adaptabilityUniversity graduates 13.1154.10Source: EBRD, 2000There is a significant mismatch between supply and demand of skills in different areas.This is generating either unemployed or underemployed specialists on the one hand and ashortage of specialists on the other. Reforming vocational training provisionThe problem seems to be one of both structure and content. The very high relativeshares of lower vocational enrolments in the PACs indicate a structural problem of earlyand rigid specialisation leading to insufficient capacity to adapt due to a lack oftransferable skills. Adaptations such as a later entry and higher level entry and theprovision of complementary business training have been important in improving some ofthese problems. More attention to transferable skills is also needed to stimulate dynamicand autonomous learning capabilities, higher emphasis on analytical ability, creativethinking and communication and co-operation skills. This is true also for some CEECssuch as Romania and non-CEECs such as Cyprus, where emphasis has been on rotememorisation in order to pass landmark examinations and competitions.73The requirements are also strong to meet new fundamental demands such as ICTeducation, entrepreneurial and business strategic skills and the retraining of governmentofficials. As regards the use of ICT there are many issues to tackle including access tobasic infrastructure, development and training of trainers appropriate pedagogic methodsand the lack of development of instructional content. Given the relative underresourcing of schools and colleges in most PACs on these counts, a stepwise approach tothis is necessary. An example is the Bulgarian national educational strategy for ICT inwhich effort is consolidated along certain lines (basic information literacy for all, 72 EBRD Transition Report 2000, p.I1373 For Romania see Korka (1999) and for Cyprus see Constantinou (1999)7\u00b0 See for the example of Hungaly in Mosoni-Fried (1999) 56 professional applications and ICT specialists) and areas of education (e.g. concentratingon 9-10th grade and entry level vocational schooling).75An underlying theme emerging from reports on the educational systems in PACs is that,whilst the higher educational system appears to be on a reform track (in terms ofexpansion of capacity and the graduate skills), the vocational system seems to driftingaway from the requirements of modernised industry in respect of both initial andcontinuing training (i.e. reskilling of existing technicians and skilled labour). Whileenrolments in more theoretical secondary and tertiary education are surging ahead,vocational schools are losing their appea1.76 For example, in Romania, vocational andapprenticeships have declined from nearly 29% of students in 1993 to 24% in 1998.77Similar data found in Hungary and Slovakia with declines in enrolments in vocationalsecondary schools from about 35% to 25% (1989 to 1996).78 These trends raise the issueof schooling that will retain a vocational component while at the same time avoid theearly specialisation that decreases flexibility\".This seems to be a deep-rooted problem running the spectrum from trainers, qualificationsystems, to attitudes and capacities of employees and teachers.8\u00b0 Given the scale of thecontinuing training requirement, it is of some concern that international comparisons in10 OECD countries placed participation rates in Poland in last position with only about15% of 25-64 year olds taking part in job related training in 1995.81As regards on-the-job training, with the exception of a few leading firms, it is difficult forskilled workers to acquire and maintain up-to-date technical skills because there isgenerally a lack of advanced applications of new technologies by local firms and becausethe foreign firms tend not to situate highly advanced plants in the PACs. The reasons forthis reluctance to invest in the state-of-the-art techniques in the PACs may reflectexperience (or a prejudice) that skilled workers in these countries are inflexible and sounable to deliver the necessary productivity levels. Productivity level's for such workersare thought to be 20-25% lower than in the investor's home countries. Whilst around40% of the investors responding to the EBRD survey claimed that inflexibility ofworkers is the main deficiency of workers relative to the parent company. These resultsare of course highly variable on a regional level, with the quality gaps being negativelyrelated to progress achieved in transition.82However, other issues remain. One issue is certainly the restricted levels of fimdingavailable to this sector. On the one side government loans might be financed throughincremental taxation on trainees once their incomes rise. Although institutional weaknessand the relatively high risk of unemployment may make such schemes unworkable.Government training vouchers were also suggested by the EBRD. However, suchschemes will probably only work if there are reforms in the mode of provision ofvocational training. Perhaps by creating social partnership or 'dual training' type 78 Bulgarian Ministry of Education and Science (1998)76 This may not be completely generalised for example in Slovenia it is claimed that \"In general vocational education is welldeveloped and connected to the employment needs of regions and fields\" Umek (1999) p.I 33. He further states (p.140) that mostly private Kaps et al. (1999), while Kwiatkoski (1999) characterises Polish teachers as \"numerous, underpaid,conservative and OECD, 1998, quoted in Kwiatkoski (1999)87 The adaptability issue was much more often cited as the largest obstacle to business development (40% of respondents)compared to Romania (27%), where other problems such as a lack of incentives to investment were paramount. 575 9BEST COPY AVAILABLE apprenticeship models along German lines might increase the industrial relevance andemployability of trainees. Also on the agenda are plans to broaden the range of skills('polyqualification') acquired to give trainees flexibility in the future, given high rates oftechnological and economic change. Such innovations in qualification systems of courseare usually underpinned by co-ordinated attempts to increase the recognition of thecertificates at a national or international level. Another issue is the failure of universitiesin most PACs to form the necessary partnerships to meet the needs for furtherprofessional training and lifelong learning.\u00b0The structural mismatches between labour market supply and demand cannot be tackledby the education and training system alone. On-the-job training and learning by doing arecrucial to resolving them as many, lower level vocational qualifications and practicalacquired skills become obsolete. This is one of the crucial obstacles to restructuring in theCEECs, which is especially worrying in view of signs that the traditional system ofenterprise-based training in Central and Eastern Europe is collapsing\". All in all, thispoints to the fact that training during the business process (on-the-job training andlearning by doing) is essential for massive restructuring to take place. Its focus should bethe creation of transferable skills. However, this is unlikely to be done by companieswhose incentives are to support development of more specialised skills. Obviously, this isa case of market failure where there is considerable scope for various types of jointpublic-private initiatives. 3.2 Towards world class higher education and trainingIntroductionEnhancing the attractiveness and competitiveness of higher education in Europe is one ofthe objectives of the commitment of the European ministers for building EuropeanHigher Education Area. The Bologna Process85 sets new requirements for highereducation also in candidate countries. The introduction of greater flexibility in learningand qualification processes could provide transferable skills and facilitate student accessto the labour market. The international recognition of the quality of teaching and researchin higher education is an important feature for the development of colleges anduniversities. At the same time it fosters international mobility and gives the citizens theopportunity of using their qualifications, competencies and skills throughout Europe. Theestablishment of a system of credits, the close co-operation for setting up of coherentquality assurance and accreditation/ certification mechanisms are cornerstones of aworld-class higher education system.Higher education trendsIn Central and Eastern Europe the Soviet division of labour between universities andvery specialised higher education schools (in charge of teaching) and academies (incharge of research) prevailed up to 1990. Many countries have by now re-integratedresearch into the universities and are re-defining the tasks of the academies and the universities, which are re-emerging as centres of higher learning andresearch.86During the transition period higher education institutes in PACs were affected by thedeep reforms. Higher education institutions established new relations with state organs,industry and Europe-wide co-operation. Today university autonomy, new democraticprinciples, the elimination of restrictions to academic freedom, and new academiccurricula in tune with the economic trends and changing student demands all characterisethe emerging higher education system.Whether the new systems are unitary87 or binary88 there is an increased recognition of theneeds of students and employers. Many new programmes have emerged that areprofessionally oriented and focus on the industrial needs for specific management(innovation management, quality management) and multidisciplinary skills. The growinguniversity-industry collaboration in developing curriculum, new programmes, PhDprojects influences further the economic relevance of the higher education in PACs andthe inflow of high-skilled specialists to industry and research. 100 90 80 70 eo 50 00 30 20 10Figure 8: People which do not have an upper secondary qualification (in % by age group) IiB labour force survey, 1997In terms of the future, rising enrolment rates indicates higher flows of qualified entrantsto the labour market. In the 18-24 age group Slovenia, Baltic countries and Bulgariashow participation rates in tertiary education that are similar to the average rate for theEU (23%). As elsewhere, increasing numbers of young people are studying beyondsecondary level. The percentage of the population leaving school without a qualificationat this level has been progressively decreasing and as a consequence the educational levelof the population is rising (Figure 8).89 The increasing student numbers observed in someCEECs is partly a result of the new private universities and partly due to high levels of 86 Haug et al. (2001)87 Unitary systems exist in the Czech Republic, Romania, Slovakia. They are characterised by higher education institutions/universities offering both general academic degrees and more professionally-oriented programmes.88 The binary systems are based on traditional university sector and distinct non-university institutions for higher education. Insome candidate countries they are still in the development phase, with the new laws on higher education adopted in the 1990sproviding for the possibility to set up non-university and private institutions. As for Malta, higher education is just changing froma unitary to a binary system., Haug et al. (2001)89 see Eurostat (2000b), pp. 3 59 youth unemployment causing many younger people to opt to stay on in education.9\u00b0 InHungary and Poland, for example, unemployment affects approximately one quarter ofthe youth labour force who have left school.91 So far, though, the student population inhigher education (2% of population) is still relatively small compared to the EU average(3.2%), especially in countries that have substantial reforms to achieve such as Polandand Hungary.92In terms of patterns of specialisation in higher education, there also appear to berelatively high proportions of student enrolment in the 'practical' disciplines of businessand engineering. Tertiary studies in science and engineering have average annual growthrates two to three times those of most of the EU. Whilst, the historic lack of attention tothe teaching of economic and business skills has created rapid growth in enrolments insocial and administrative sciences, at least twice and up to as much as six times thegrowth rates in EU countries. For example, in the Czech Republic (Table 9) studentshave already changed their perception of university education, viewing it not only as away of preparing for a vocational specialisation but mainly to benefit from a generallyconceived educational system and to acquire transferable skills (analytical thinking,learning foreign languages, computer literacy). Indeed many students seem to bechoosing studies that offer good earning potential. Thus a survey in Hungary found, thatof 96 per cent of recent engineering graduates, that were seeking extra training, twothirds would prefer training in economics.93Table 9: Czech Republic: number of accepted university students in the first year ofinitial study (master's or bachelor's degree) by type andForestry1,4316.2%1,3794.9%1,7685.3%2,1605.6% Pedagogy3,16913.8%4,40015.7%4,34313.0%5,16413.4%Others2,1549.4%3,09211.0%1,3944.2%2,0685.4%Total22,94428,10133,44438,590Sources: Statistical Yearbook (Universities) of the Institute for Information 'n Education, Prague 1990-97The recent expansion of participation in higher education, however, must raise questionsas to the quality of the provision. The lack of indicators here prevents a clear picture. But,rising output has not seen a corresponding increase in the numbers of teachers. Forexample the recent growth in private universities in some countries, whilst needed inorder to meet quantitative demand, may not be able to call upon sufficient top-levelexperts to provide the teaching.94 These problems may be quite substantial, especially 9\u00b0 Umek (1999) suggests that the very high 90% of secondary school graduates going on to higher education in Slovenia may berelated to a marked difference in job opportunities for two levels of educationEurostat (2000b), pp. 892 Comparisons are indicative because of the difficulty of comparing different educational systems, especially as to what isincluded with tertiary education, and given changes in the statistical collection procedures.\" Mosoni-Fried (1999)94 See the Czech Republic case: Filacek et al (1999) where six new universities have opened since 1990 606 2 given the underlying (and still untackled) mismatches between the role of the old systemof higher education and the demands it faces today95.In fact the academic staff is decreasing and ageing rapidly. In Lithuania, for example, it isexpected that in 10 years more than 2/3 of the professors will be over 50 years and 1/2 ofthem even over 60 years old96. Indeed, many young people are put off a university careerbecause it takes so long to establish themselves in the independent position of fullprofessors. The observed shift in the interests of young people towards legal andmanagement-oriented studies makes the issue for attracting them in university teachingand research more difficult.Efforts to overcome this problem in Estonia have reached some results, whereas therising average age of university staff has stopped. However, the slow increase in thenumber of doctoral degree holders is too low to permit the reproduction of the Estonianscience and higher education. In order to ensure continuity of academic education andscience, Estonia needs ca 80 new PhDs per year (following the corresponding ratio inFinland and Sweden, even 200). In 1991-1998, on average, 38 students includingexternal students have completed doctoral courses at Estonian universities and 5-10students abroad.97While solving the problem of ageing professors and attracting young people in researchand university carrier, which correspond to the present demands of the increased studentpopulation, PACs need to consider also the impact of the present demographic changeson the longer-term development of universities. A serious assessment of the demographictrends at national and regional level is needed to ensure sustainability of the highereducation system in the longer run.Another issue for universities is to develop cross-institute linkages to deliver courses. Infact, following recent growth higher education seems now to be in processes ofconsolidation, mergers or affiliation of smaller specialised institutions (Box 9). Box 9: Structural changes in higher educationIn Estonia the Tallinn Technical University and the University of Tartu have established nation-wideregional networks linking previous independent colleges and higher vocational schools to the university.These trends might have positive impact on fostering regional collaboration and increasing the imageand the educational level of smaller institutions. The existence of branches of higher-educationalestablishments and the exchange of teaching personnel might contribute also to the availability of bettereducational opportunities at regional level and overcoming the financial barriers to many young peoplerelated to the change of their place of residence.In the Czech Republic a strategy is being elaborated for the restructuring of the non-universityinstitutions, as they are seen as being too numerous (around 170) and too small (in 1998/99 only 13institutions had more than 400 students). The plan foresees that they will be merged, where possible,and will be expected to offer very diversified programmes ranging from one to three years in accordancewith labour market needs.(Sources OECD, 2000a, Haug et al, 2001)Concerns about quality of courses affect the value of the degrees obtained. Many PACsare moving towards a more flexible award structure consistent with Western models. 95 see Dyker et al. (1999)96 Makariunas, 'Enlargement Futures' Project Steering Group meeting, January 20019' Rein Kuttner, Panel Member 616 3BEST COPY AVAILABLE Some candidate countries will introduce an 'Anglo-American' degree structure withshorter first degrees and many post-graduate possibilities based on a two-tier system(Box 10). However, the degree titles vary considerably and often they do not bythemselves give an explicit indication of the type and character of a specific qualificationand there is still much work to do to make the course offerings more consistent. Box 10: University programmes in PACsInPoland,where the existing system still combines one-tier and two-tier programmes, the draft of the Inew higher education act concentrates on the two-tier model. In Estonia there is a Move to standardisethe duration of Bachelor programmes to three years and of Master programmes to two. In Slovaldaa Inew higher education law will provide for an institutional diversification into universities (offering all 1three levels of degrees in a large variety of subjects), specialised higher education institutions on 1university level, but with a more limited range of diseiplines, and professional higher educationinstitutions offering Bachelor programmes relevant to the labour market. Slovakia is planning tointroduce the 3-2-3 model as the standard structure. It shouki be noted, however, that some of the two-tier systems still contain one-tier Master programmes in specific fields, e.g.-in Bulgaria, Poland andSlovakia.(Source: Haug et al., 2001) Accreditation and transferability of skillsThe contemporary trends towards mobility of the labour force and the need oftransferable skills face candidate countries with the challenge of building flexible andinternationally consistent higher education and training. The new framework needs tocreate conditions for international compatibility and acceptance of the degrees andqualifications, as well to introduce greater flexibility in learning. The participation ofPACs on equal footing in the European Higher Education Area requires some efforts tomake their higher education more attractive for foreign students and to enhance itscompetitiveness. The international recognition of the quality of teaching in highereducation is an important feature for the development of colleges and universities andcould facilitate the academic exchange with universities in EU1 5 and other countries.The efforts of PACs to establish a system for quality assurance in higher education arefocused on the introduction of licensing procedures for teaching and accreditation/certification mechanism. Most of PACs have an accreditation agency, sometimes withquality assurance functions. Some of them (such as Lithuania) have an evaluation agencywith no accreditation functions. Countries without an agency yet include Poland andSlovenia.98 Through the process of accreditation could be periodically evaluated theeducational activities of institutions or specialised units of higher education, as well asstudy programmes. However, the independent judgement of the experts involved inthe accreditation is especially dependent on the educational standards to be compliedwith. This calls for the harmonisation of national educational standards of PACs withthe international ones in order to facilitate mutual acceptance of degrees andqualifications and to achieve international recognition of the education.The establishment of a credit transfer systems, compatible with the European credittransfer system (ECTS) is another challenge for PACs99. The participation ininternational academic exchange programmes, e.g. Socrates/Erasmus, requires astricter application of ECTS-principles. On the other hand, the adoption of a credit 98CRE Project (2001)99 At present, only Cyprus and Malta work with ECTS and ECTS-compatible systems. 626 4BEST COPY AVAILABLE system and the changes of the degree structure could be considered as importantfactors facilitating mobility and employability within the countries and in Europe,and are cornerstones on the way towards international integration of higher educationand training in PACs.Challenges for the future of higher education and training in PACs are thedevelopment of new modes of delivery including open-distance learning and greatlyexpanded use of information technology throughout the higher education system.Furthermore, there is a need for seeking of the problem of re-training currentprofessors and developing the next generation of faculty and researchers and forstrengthened doctoral programmes and international affiliationslw. 3.3 The right to education and the danger of 'dual society'IntroductionAn education system providing access for all citizens can play an important role forbuilding human capitaland for rebuilding the economy and improving itscompetitiveness in the long run. The high skills and learning capability acquiredduring the educational process have also a potential impact on strengtheningdemocracy and social cohesion and promoting the participation of all citizens in thedemocratic processes of building a knowledge society. Besides their economic andsocietal impact, the equitable education contributes to the higher quality of life of allcitizens improving his/her skills and thus the opportunities for a better life.Assessing the positive impact of higher education and training on the economy andsociety as a whole, all the implications of the educational gaps on personal life andbehaviour, there is an obvious need for provision of equal opportunities of everyindividual to acquire higher skills and knowledge. Therefore, high on the policyagenda of every government is the goal of improved access to high quality educationand the provision of skills promoting lifelongself-development andsocialparticipation.Present educational gapsDuring the communist time the children in CEECs had wide access to basiceducation, equal for all genders and societal groups. High literacy rates wereachieved in most countries. In the transition period, however, CEECs had to balancethe preservation of the public education achievements of the past with the need toreform the system and introduce new management, new educational curricula andmaterials. Educational systems faced the challenges of providing education neededfor the digital age at a time of massive economic and social changes.The economic decline during the transition caused a serious drop of the educationalbudgets. Most of CEECs were able to maintain the share of GDP available for basiceducation and thus the respective enrolment rates (Table 10). However, due to the largedeclines in economic output and government revenues, the state support for educationhas been seriously reduced in real terms. For example, in 1996 the real expenditures oneducation, compared to the 1990 level, have fallen in Hungary to 78%, in Slovakia I\u00ae OECD (2000a) 636 5 69%, Latvia55% and in Bulgaria25%.1\u00b01 The insufficient financial resources foreducation have led to lower wages of teachers, bad preservation of educationalinfrastructure and cancelling the provision of additional services in the educationalinstitutions (e.g. full-day supervision, meals, health care, etc.). With its low status andrelatively low pay, it is not surprising that recruitment is falling in the teaching professionso that it is not only ageing (in some cases) and has become highly-feminised.1\u00b02 Table 10: Basic school enrolment ratio (in %) 7/8 to 14/15 years old 19911992199319941995199619971998Bulgaria97.395.194.094.393.793.694.094.3Czech Republic98.799.299.199.599.499.299.197.6Estonia93.891.191.491.592.392.693.595.0Hungary99.299.299.199.199.199.299.299.2Latvia94.591.189.188.689.190.791.390.9Lithuania92.092.591.692.193.293.395.196.1Poland97.397.197.297.197.297.498.098.1Romania89.489.690.391.492.693.995.097.0Slovakia96.595.794.994.494.393.4na93.9Slovenia96.897.697.896.797.399.899.898.2Turkey'89.0388.6985.4883.0890.0790.3390.7482.21Source:EBRDTransition Report 2000(1) Statistical yearbook of Turkey 1999CEECs have introduced decentralisation of educational finance and responsibilities.The unequal distribution of financial resources to local authorities has widenedregional disparities in the provision of education and training'. Besides the fallingeducational quality and growing prices for learning materials, a number of schoolshave been closed in rural areas, requiring the children to travel every day to theclosest town. At the same time, due to high regional unemployment and fallingwages, families in small towns and rural areas have been not able to meet theincreased expenses for the education of their children. Thus, the kids in rural areas,where the educationisreally needed to break an intergenerational cycle ofunemployment and deprivation due to missing skills, have limited opportunities toobtain better education and skills and improve their life.The overall decline of education budgets on the one hand, and the emergence ofprivate educational institutions and additional paid classes, on the other, areencouraging neweliteeducationstreams.Inparticular,highereducationalperforming secondary schools are able to attract additional finance from privatecompanies and non-governmental organisations. This further widens the educationaldivide and theopportunitiesfor obtainingup-to-date educationusing neweducational tools and communication technologies. This elite stream probablyexplains the continuation of high mathematics and science scores in internationaltests. According to the results of international studies'', the children in 7th and 8thgrade in the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Bulgaria and Hungary have betterresults than in Germany, the U.S. and other OECD countries. These might be a resultnot only of the good educational traditions in these areas, but also of the presentemphasis on secondary education (Figure 9). Obviously, many candidate countries(Bulgaria, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Baltic countries, Slovenia, Malta) streamline 101 UNESCO (2000a)102 UNICEF (1998) p.29; see also Institute (2001)t04 UNESCO (2000a) 646 6 more funds in secondary education, while others (Poland, Romania, Slovakia,Turkey) focus on primary education. The large size of the countries from the secondgroup (except Slovakia), and the large number of population living in rural areas facethe governments with more complex problems in providing equal educationopportunities. In Turkey, the growing number of children accentuates the challenge. Figure 9: Public educational expenditures (as % of all levels) pre-primary and primary requires the polarisation in education, e.g. the widening gapbetween regions, small/large towns and rural areas, social groups, genders andnationalities. Candidate countries are presently faced with grave problems such asearly school leaving and youth employment, few upper-secondary graduates,decliningof vocationaltrainingenrolments'\". Some children havelimitedopportunities to continue their education due to the high costs for textbooks andlearning materials. On the other hand, the lower level of acquired knowledge in basicschool and the lack of means to pay for additional course results often in inability topass the entry exams for upper-secondary and vocational schools, as well as fortertiary education. Thus, the admission to higher-level education and obtaining betterskills is a function of the efficiency and quality of the previous educational level andmight impose serious barriers for further personal development.There is also great concern about children from disadvantaged groupsm6. Although anumber of measures have been declared, drop-out rates are very high amongstchildren from ethnic minorities, in particular Romany children, children of refugeesor those with physical and mental disability. Their integration and the provision ofequal opportunities for raising the literacy level of the population are important inorder to bridge the growing divide in the society.Meanwhile assessments of the adult literacy level in some candidate countries point outthat itis below European standards107. The dramatic changes following the wideintroduction of new technologies increase the requirements for life-long learning.However, the educational system in PACs is oriented to young people and to some extent 106 see European Training Foundation (2000)106 see UNDP(1998) 65 to students that have recently completed their primary or secondary education. Thetraining and re-training of adults is considered to be a task of their employees and partlyof the social system for unemployment support. Non-governmental organisations havestarted initiatives focused primarily in areas where the demand and potential for economicgain are greatest (business, law, foreign languages, etc.). However, the costs of attendingsuch programmes are often prohibitive.'\"Hopes for the future of the education and training in PACs give the approval of neweducational strategies and plans aimed at meeting the objectives of education for all,paying particular attention on children inruralareas,children with specialeducational needs and adult education'\u00b09. Box 11: Access to education in Baltic countriesAll three Baltic States have made strong commitments to civil liberties and to narrowing the gaps in 'access and opportunity for all people within their countries. They recognise that fulfilling thesecommitments is an essential condition for modern democracies, for accession to the European Union .and for full participation in the global economy. In the OECD education policy reviews, the teamsunderscored the need for further progress on:Narrowing the disparities in quality and educational opportunity between urban and rural areas(including the need for public administration reform to address the problems of small municipalitiesthat lack the capacity to sustain strong schools).Ensuring that special needs students are served, including addressing the health and economic needsof young children to ensure that they are ready to learn.Continuing to make progress on addressing the needs of language and ethnic minority populationsto ensure that they can be full participants in the civic and economic life of the countries.Countering the strong tendencies toward elite secondary schools and a focus on university entrancewith deliberate steps to ensure that all students not only the most academically gifted and thosewith social and economic advantages have access to quality education and the opportunity to gainessential knowledge and skills.(Source: OECD, 2000a) Vision for the future of educationThe education is a key feature for the future of candidate countries. However, faced withthe economic reforms and increasing social disparities their governments are missingresources to meet the educational challenges. If not addressed, the educational divide willconstitute a time bomb leading to 'dual society' in the future.The non-equal educational opportunities for minority groups and migrant workers and thediscrimination between regions and sexes might have dangerous consequences on thewhole society, decreasing the share of society with higher skills. The lower levels ofeducation have very high social returns related to economic growth, social cohesion,health, crime. Better-educated people have higher requirements on products they use, andtheir quality of life. Their contribution to the economic growth could be two-fold: as highskilled workers, and with their higher demands on delivery of a big variety of goods andservices, which stimulates on its own the innovation of industry. Better-educatedindividuals are more tolerant, less inclined to crime and violence, infringement of law andanother's property. Higher cultural achievements, peaceful life and environmentalprotection are also dependent on the overall educational level of the population. m OECD (2000a)109 see country reports on http://www2.unesco.org/wef/countryreports/home.html 666 8BEST COPY AVAILABLE The improvement of the quality of education and the access of all individuals areessential for candidate countries. The present dilemma of introduction of paideducation at all educational levels or further decreasing the quality of educationmight further contribute to splitting of the society. The regular monitoring andassessment of the education trends and achievements are important tools for earlywarning on possible problems and timely introduction of corresponding measures.Investments in education and training are essential for the well being of thepopulation, the strengthening of democracy and economic growth. There is a clearneed for higher spending of PACs in basic education of urban and rural populationwith reasonable average quality, and in provision of adults' qualification andtraining. Alongside, more flexibility of the educational system might facilitate thelearning among youth, who are working part-time or who disadvantaged incontinuing education because of the lower quality of the rural school. Highereducational achievements of children need also to be encouraged, e.g. throughspecial grants and scholarships mechanism for most talented children.Within the process of integration of candidate countries to the EU, an earlyrecognition of the dangerous implications of education decline might be an incentiveto find various tools to close the West/East divide, similar to the ones used in theclosure of the North/South divide between EU member states. At present EU15member states are afraid of receiving a large number of low-skilled migrant workersafter the accession. The contribution of the EU to the improvement of educationallevel in PACs might have two important stabilising effects to reduce the low-skilled population in candidate countries and to increase their attractiveness toforeign investors as good potential markets and places with skilled labour force. 67 Future StepsWhere next?A report such as this can only scratch the surface of the wide issues of technology,knowledge and learning in the candidate countries. We have tried to signal some of themain areas of challenge and opportunity, these include:Science and Technology governance: to move away from rhetoric to reality,ensuring balance of supply and demand, openness, participation and qualityBuilding of a coherent Knowledge system: based on wide integration andinteraction of education, research and innovation and their efficient utilisation inoverall catching-up process and building future excellenceMobility of researchers: turning mobility into an advantage for the integration ofcandidate countries research into a global science and economic systemHuman capital formation: to meet present and future needs, ensure sustainable(economic) development and build cohesive knowledge-based societyAs the title suggests this conclusion does not attempt to synthesise the results of our workbut to look forward to areas of future developments of our work and to draw out somelines to strengthen the prospective elements of our work.Cross-cutting issues to developGiven that the work of all Thematic panels of the 'Enlargement Futures' project in thisfirst phase has been largely in parallel, there are areas of work that cut across this paneland the others and which could provide a focus for the future. For example:Making a clear link in S&T priority setting between excellence of researchcapacity and relevance to economic and societal goals requires direct comparisonof industrial specialisation profiles and FDI from the Economic TransformationPanel's work.Concerns for environmentally sustainable development and conservation ofnatural resources are very important for defining research priorities, especially inissue driven research, given the high importance of agriculture and protection ofthe natural environment in some candidate countries.Health needs and social developments (demographic ageing, endemic illness)have implications for S&T priorities in certain candidate countries. Introducing asocietal prospective component to S&T agenda setting to take account of suchtrends is a very important part of assessing whether the research priorities arerelevant to domestic requirements.Economic transformation in the form of developments of the innovation capacitydepends upon a sectoral and regional level assessment of SME capacity forinnovation and need for venture capital.Strategies and policies on intellectual policy are another issue relating toeconomic transformation that could be further explored. For example, issues toexplore include the role of IPRs as an incentive to industrially relevant research orIPR issues in setting up university-industry spin-off and partnerships. 697 0 Policies on learning and skills and the development of knowledge society issueshave particular relevance for rural areas that face extreme problems of under-employment and unemployment.A generic problem, which affects panels' results, is the lack of comprehensive,reliable and consistent data on all PACs. Moreover, the different pathways thesecountries followed, the different economic situations, culture and traditions andeven the different size, present a big challenge of any common treatment andmake it very difficult to draw general conclusions or even group the countries.Science and society: a key issue to developAlthough this phase of the project is now approaching completion, it has become clearthat several key issues will have to be developed in further rounds of the project. Theseissues centre mainly around 'science and society' or more broadly the development of thesocietal component of a knowledge-based economy. As a preliminary mapping of theseissues we can identify some major axes of development that could orientate future work.These fall under the headings of societal values and ethical issues relating to thedevelopment of new technologies, for example:Accessopening the opportunities of the knowledge/ learning society to thewidest possible number of peopleEquality/ equityespecially concerning the role of women in researchGovernance issuesmoving towards greater transparency in priority settingfinding appropriate institutional modelsDemocracyraising participation and motivation of people to take part in S&Tdecisions and developmentEthical issues in the conduct of research and development and in the applicationand marketing of new technologiesAccess to the Knowledge society: although we have considered in some depth thedevelopment of the S&T base we so far have not adequately addressed the wider societalimplications of the emerging knowledge society/ information society. The on-goingsocio-economictransformation is based on 3 interrelated processes of increasinginformatisation, changing communication and interdependence structures, and changingthe processes of knowledge creation and utilisation. Research domains include what theongoing transformation is about and what areas of research will gain in importance as forimpacts on everyday life, systems of production and systems of opinion formation andnew technologies production.' I\u00b0 The recent efforts to extend the 'e-Europe' action plantowards candidate countries indicate a commitment to achieve a wider development ofthe Information Society Technologies.\" The main lines are: working towards a cheaper,faster, secure Internet; investment in people and skills (including young people) anddeveloping the use of Internet applications (e-commerce, e-govemment, e-health, etc.).\" 2Equality & equity: recently there have been significant efforts to evaluate the role andstatus of women in research.\"3 The general picture is that despite of women atundergraduate level there are very few women in the higher echelons of science andresearch, even in disciplines such as biology where women take a major share of the \"\u00b0 See Tuomi (2001)http://europa.eu.int/information_society/eeurope/news_library/documents/index_en.htm112 See Gourova et al (2001)'13 ETAN Expert Working Group on Women and Science (2000) Science policies in the EU: Promoting Excellence throughmainstreaming gender equality, CEC, Luxembourg. 707 1 doctorates. This represents a serious under usage of trained and talented people. Somecandidate countries figure in the very highest ranks of female participation up to graduatelevel (e.g. Bulgaria and Estonia). It is interesting to note that countries in which the statusand wages of academics tends to be lower can sometimes have relatively high levels ofwomen at full professor level (e.g. 17% in Portugal versus 14% in France, 8.5% in theUK and 6% in Germany). The ETAN\"4 Strata report suggests (using the example of thehigh rates of women professors in Portugal) that bright male scientists were brain-drainedor preferred better paid careers in industry. The only data offered for candidate countriesindicates that these effects might be echoed in candidate countries. For example Turkeyhas a very high rate of women professors (22%) and Poland shows very steep rises inappointments of women to professorial positions: 9.4% in 1977 rising to 22% in 1996.However, further data collection would be needed to confirm this hypothesis. If true thereis a basis, as in the Portuguese case, for targeted development of research infrastructures,group leader grants and fellowships to actually allow candidate countries to lead the waytowards gender equal science system.Governance: as we argued above the emergence of substantial foresight activities inseveral candidate countries indicates that a more open system of S&T priority settingseems to be on the way. However, governance structures remain fragmented (manyoverlapping departmental responsibilities and also gaps of coverage). There are alsoconcerns about the extent to which the different levels of governance actually connect.Transition and accession puts a double pressure on the development of governancesystems because the process of institution building is not yet complete at a national leveland yet is being overlaid by the requirements to establish further levels of governance forthe EU.Democracy: for the CEECs, science was in communist times often directed towards thesupport of the political regime. With transition, this role has changed to the more normalscientific ethic, i.e. a deliberately apolitical stance. However, attitudes and behaviours areoften slow to change. Thus particular efforts are needed to win back public trustconfidence in the Science and Technology institutions and 'expertise'. For manycandidate countries this lies on top of a more general need to find ways to involve thepublicintherapidly advancingscientificknowledge and the complexity andinterdependence of contemporary societies, economies and cultures (see CommissionWhite Paper on Governance-July 2001). Such actions call for participatory mechanismssuch as citizen juries and people's panels in technology foresight as well as jointmeetings to allow exchanges of views from different countries on topics of Europeanrelevance (e.g. biotechnology applications).Ethical concerns: \"To facilitate collective decisions it is necessary to first clarify whichconsiderations we consider most important\"\"5. Developments in applications of newtechnologies, particularly in the sphere of Bio and Info technologies raise fundamentalnew questions on what do we want of these technologies and what are the consequencesof our choices. Attention has been mainly focused on whether these technologies aregood business, other focus on whether their use is right or wrong -does it add somethinggood to our lives? Values, moral and ethics are at the foundation for public attitudes inparticular with regard to genetic engineering. I\" quoted above115 Pia Gjellerup (1999) 717 2 In contrast to the idea that ethics is a preserve solely of private preference the use ofbiotechnology and genetic engineering is actually a question of political decision andchoice. Moreover choices such as which genetic engineering techniques are acceptablecannot be made by each country in isolation. Behind the choices lie attitudes and values.Debate on ethical aspects of relevant emerging technologies cannot be conducted inisolation in each individual country: initiatives should be joint. Candidate countries findthemselves between pressures to operate very open research ethics regimes in order toattract multinational investment and on the other hand to help consolidate a Europeanposition on such issues.ProspectivesIn developing this report we were confronted with the fact that assessing the currentsituation in the candidate countries is itself rather difficult to assess due to the lack ofaccess to fully reliable and comprehensive data. If this report has any measure of successit will be in capturing current challenges for the future rather than in providing a fullprospective scoping of the 2010 time horizon.However, the panel activity did make an attempt to put together some views on what arethe major challenges and targets for pre-accession countries on the 2010 time scale.These tended to fall into two categories: where might we be and where might we try tobe in 2010.The 'where might we be' statements provide a possible starting point for theconstruction of scenarios. For example, there was considerable interest in differentstrategies on the development of S&T specialization profiles at regional and nationallevels. Three scenarios were offered:Full integration: all PACs are integrated into the global/EU S&T system andspecialised in areas where they could offer excellence or have competitiveadvantage.Regional co-operation: countries and/ or regions consolidate into co-operativeblocs in respect to S&T capacity, in some cases these blocs could transcendborders to create trans-national innovative regions or corridors.Uneven and multi-speed progress: big variations emerge with some PACs wellintegrated in the global/ EU research area and others struggling to find a profile.Here the implication is that a search for complementarities at both domestic andinternational level is likely to yield a more even and overall stronger basis for theenlarged ERA. In particular, to develop this further it would be necessary to have reliablemapping of existing areas of strength and an associated assessment of the relevance ofthese areas of strength in the context of national needs. This mapping would be linked tostrategies to establish solid centres of excellence (CoE) according EU criteria/ standardsand to ensure the sustainable development and survival of these centres (target 10 years).This would require systematic indicators on candidate country CoEs against othercountries and against EU15 standards including relevant drivers (i.e. not just scientificpublications and citations but linkages with industry and soft indicators such as societalrelevance and impact).The where 'might we try to be' are more normative scenarious: they concerned attemptsto set targets in order to focus development. Example included: 727 3 Setting verifiable S&T targets, such as achieving the average EU R&D spendinglevel by 2010.'E-everything' strategies: thatis by setting some targets for the levels ofdevelopment of e-services by 2010 in order to trying to leapfrog economicgrowth.Establish a flexible research career this would involve a multi-point plan withtargets to increase the career flexibility of researchers to be mobile betweenacademic/ public research & industrial/ private research; attractive wage andbenefits packages; better research infrastructure; incentives to young stars (fromhome or abroad) into candidate country research systems.Knowledge society targetsmaking life-long learning a reality: The panel arguedstrongly for targeted efforts to develop new models of schooling, vocationaleducation that allows flexibility and transferability of skills, the establishment oftransferable credit and compatible accreditation systems; continued education forteachers; new pedagogics that are learner-centred rather than didactic or contentdriven.These cases are simply examples stemming from the creativity of the panel. Thechallenge would be to set up targets that are realistic and verifiable so that progress canbe measured. Also, as with most performance driven plans, checks are needed to makesure that the targets are acceptable and legitimate and that they move developments in adesirable direction. Targets should be chosen as incentives to develop not for their ownsake. Finally, a solid indicator base would be needed to underpin these strategies, andevaluation of achievements. 737 4 BibliographyBASAOA, H. ve cETINDAMAR, D.

Gene Science and TechnologiesTransition to the post-sequencing genomics era will see the development and implementation ofnew therapies, diagnostic tools and improved health-management strategies. The growingknowledge on the function of human genes and the role of these genes in maintaining health,causing diseases and determining the ageing process will have a high impact on human health,health care system structure and organisation, and pharmaceutical sector development.Advances in plant and animal genetics will modift agriculture and husbandry techniques, withnew environmentally sound production processes.

Ill. Nanoscience, Nano & Precision technologiesNanoscience is a whole new emerging cross-disciplinary field drawing on physics, chemistry,medicine and biology, constituting in its own right a major new trend. It has a significantnano-scale'materials science and engineering' component covering techniques andinstrumentation for nanofabrication of ultrathin layers, manipulating material and buildingmolecular architectures and lateral structures down to atomic scale, but also nano-phasematerialswithnovel macroscopic properties. Interms of thearray of potentialnanotechnologies, important 'systems'-related challenges are also raised regarding integrationand interconnection different nano-scale features to form functional components. 4.Nano-scale fabrication and manipulation Atomic scale layers & lateral structures (writingtechniques, particle beams, self-organisation,..), ultra-precise surface figuring, analysis techniques ofvertical/horizontalstructures, boundary layers & surfaces; Extreme Ultraviolet Lithography(affordable 11 nm or 13 nm x-ray sources, x-ray optics) printing, e-beam, self-assembly techniques. 5.Novel Materials nanomaterial & molecular architectures with novel macroscopic properties; nano-porous cavities and tubes for filtering, adsorption and storage of hydrogen, membranes for fuel cells,catalysts,nanodispersions for coating and hardening, layers for LCDs, antireflex surfaces,photovoltaics etc. 6.Nanotechnologies & systems integration & interconnection of different nano-scale features to formfunctional components, nano-scale devices & systems; complex combinations of mechanical, optical,electrical or chemical characteristics, of organic, inorganic or biological molecular structures; potentialtechnologies in medicine, precision engineering, electronics, etc. - micro-invasive surgery & implants,artificial retinas, artificial antibodies, new lasers, millimetre wave componentsIV. Advanced MaterialsNew materials are are fundamental enablers of almost all other enabling technology areas(especially ICTs and biotechnologies) and provide the basis for innovations in systemtechnologies such as transport, energy, defence and aerospace. Particularly important trendsare:The moves from passive structural and active functional materials to multifunctionalmaterials and smart materials.The need for materials that lend themselves to sustainability requirements - longerservice life, reusability, biodegradability.New materials processing techniques such as molecular design, nano-level selfassembly, three dimensional printing.Radical changes in demands on materials in health care (e.g. biocompatibility,biomimetic materials for prosthetics), in construction, automobiles and aerospace (e.g.lighter and stronger materials for frames), in computing devices (VLSI, opticalprocessing, quantum computing). 7.Sustainable Materials - recovery, re-use & recycling of complex materials, new renewablebiological/ agricultural material feedstocks, fibres, lubricants, etc.; re-use of materials inrenewing the built environment 8.Functional Intelligent Materials new alloys, plastics, ceramics, composites, for health-careand industrial applications, more efficient and user-friendly with longer lifetimes, are moreresistent to corrosion and chemical effects; programmable responses to specific stimuli. E.g.coded biomaterials with specific responses to specific biological environments. 848 2 V. Complexity & Complex Systems Complex systems cover climate modelling, ecosystems under stress, interactions between socialand naturalsystems,financialmarkets,complex product and production systems,transportation, energy and water supply, town and regional planning, engineering and softwaredevelopment. Typical features include large number of components and interactions, the multi-level/ multi-actor character of the phenomena, dynamic and non-linear behaviour, the time-criticaliryofactions,inherentuncertaintyandunpredictabili0;oftheirfutureevolution/transformation, and a huge volume of information. Critical challenges include:to bridge the gap between fundamental research solutions and applied areas wherecomplex modelling is regarded as a key source of insight.Dealing with complexity arising out of an increasing interconnection between differentsystems. Examples include the much stronger coupling of the biological system to theeco-system via GMOs; the coupling of industry, energy and transport systems toclimate; or the coupling of IT to the human brain and psychological system.the development of managerial and organisational approaches in relation to complexproduct and production systems in defence, aerospace and other sectors - throughknowledge and soft technologies rather than modelling, chaos and complex software. 9.Better understanding of complexity: stability, control, reliability under changingcircumstances, improving confidence in systems modelling; sensitivity analysis 10.

Health Sciences and Technologies , The changing health demands of citizens are driven by rising expectations of standards of livingand longevity, the ageing of the population and the hopes generated by highly publiciseddevelopments in biology and genetics (the research implications of which are covered belowunder gene technologies). Apart from genetics, major breakthroughs are expected in other areassuch as tissue and organ engineering, surgery and the treatment of disease. In terms of healthsystems, rising costs and the logic of healthier lifestyles are leading to a switch in emphasis fromreactive care to preventative care in health-related policies, extending the boundary to the fieldsof nutrition and education. New organisational principles and management tools will need to bedeveloped to help maintain health systems working efficiently. Research should not only beaimed at developing new sophisticated treatments but also to achieve decreasing costs formethods to be widely appliedApplication of informatics and telematics in clinics is still in its infancy.Changes in working conditions, lifestyles and food production systems will lead to theemergence of new diseases, and re-emergence of old ones in more virulent form. 19.

Technologies for a Sustainable Economy Many sustainability and environmental issues require. Sustainable economy issues relating toproduction, distribution and consumption concerns also have many research implications forboth direct R&D action and enabling and cross-cutting technologies (materials, ICTs andcomplexity). Three main lines stand out:Sustainable production and consumption, which refers to the need to develop newsocio-technical systems within which innovation, growth and the satisfaction ofmaterial and immaterial needs go hand in hand with environmental sustainability.Management of natural resources and the environment in view of the impact of humandevelopment on natural systems. Management here refers to local (e.g. aquatic systemsat catchment scale) as well as global systems such as the carbon cycle.Managing risks and mitigating adverse effects of technological progress.

Social Sciences in Support of Building EuropeEurope is confronted with a number of challenges that originate decisively from the socio-political realm. An enlarged EU needs new requirements for an efficient European multi-levelgovernance structure and it needs to define its borders to the East and South, developing newconcepts for the relationships with neighbouring countries. Demographic change and migrationwill be key challenges for both European and national policy. External relations are developinginto an ever more important concern of the Union, in need of underpinning by research.Europe will be then confronted in the future with a higher degree of diversity within its borders,culturally, politically, and economically. The diversity of values may in the future becomplemented by growing intra-European mobility of people & the media.Changes in the regional balance and cohesion of Europe, especially as they are affected bytechnological developments in ICTs will create a significant requirement for supporting socio-economic research. Together they raise important questions about the creation of an effectiveinternal labour market in Europe.Both social sciences and humanities have the potential to provide insights and thus supportto policy in order to help build Europe, especially by working across disciplinaryboundaries. 32. Social science/humanities Implications of The EU Project governance, citizenship &participation; cohesion Values research; extremism and crime; multi-cultural environment inEurope; principles of political systems 87 89 Annex 11-2: S&T priorities in recent major prospective studiesCase 1: The Millennium ProjectThe Millennium Project is an on-going global participatory project of the AmericanCouncil for the United Nations University involving over 550 futurists, scholars, businessplanners, and policy makers worldwide from 50 countries. In the following, we list asmall sampling of some of the long-range S&T development issues which theMillennium Project has identified in the third year of its research.\" 615 global challenges were analysed with explicit S&T implications in six of them. Herewe just list some of the S&T prospects identified in relation to Challenge No. 14 Howcan scientific and technological breakthroughs be accelerated to improve the humancondition?The most significant characteristic of S&T developments identified is the extent to whichprogress is driven by cross disciplinary invention, research collaboration at a distance andrapid dissemination of information. These synergies have been accelerated by the globalconvergence of IT and communications technologies and continue to add NEWFRONTIERS of which the following five were highlighted:Nanotechnology, which is felt by many to hold the highest prospects for tomorrow'sbreakthroughs.Biotechnology, and particularly the aftermath of the mapping of human and plantgenomesPlanetary astronomy and space research, including search for other life forms andadvanced research in biology and physics necessary for human space flightCognitive science,including the development of a new psychology with insights intothe nature of memory, self-consciousness, education, propaganda, disease,.. ordecision science, bringing together understanding of how economics, risk-behaviour,and intuition combine to make decisions, andQuantum computingwhich is the development of computer technology based on theprinciples of quantum theory (i.e. that which explains the nature and behaviour ofenergy and matter on the quantum - atomic and subatomic - level). Development of aquantum computer would mark a leap forward in computing capability far greater thanthat from the abacus to a modem day supercomputer, with performance gains in thebillion-fold realm and beyond.Case2: Global Trends 2015The following list of future S&T related prospects was compiled from two differentsources' 17. They are given in the form of predictive statements or trends as is oftenthe case in scenario-based prospective studies. The statements are the views ofexperts, reflecting the techno-optimistic view that is typical of the scientificcommunity. The coverage is not comprehensive but the sampling provided reflectssome of the long-term 'scientific' frontiers suggested by the millennium project, plusa sampling of more issue-specific and technological trends. 116 1999 State of the Future: Challenges We Face at the Millennium, American Council for the United Nations (AC/UNU); J CGlenn and T J Gordon (2001) The Millennium Project: Challenges we face at the Millennium, Technological Forecasting andSocial Change 66, pp. 129-312117 CIA (US) (December 2000), Global Trends 2015: A Dialog about the Future with non-government expertsJoseph Coates et. al. (1997), 2025 Scenarios of US and Global Society Reshaped by Science and Technology, Oakhill Press 9088 The integration of existing disciplines (nanotechnology, materials science,biotechnology, information technology) to form new ones, will give rise to adramatic increase in innovation.The time between discovery and application of scientific advances will continueto shorten.Many new IT-enables devices and services will emerge, diffuse rapidly, anddecrease in cost in line with increase in demand. Miniaturisation will continue andthe widespread integration of ICT devices into all sorts of products will see theemergence of so-called ubiquitous computing or embedded intelligence. Thesystems integration competence needed to exploit this trend is strong in Europe.Local-to-globalinternetaccessholdstheprospect of universalwirelessconnectivi07 via hand-held devices and low-cost, low-altitude satellites.Chemicals produced in modern biotechnology based production plants (protein,polymer synthesis, bio-materials) will account for up to 20 % of all bulkchemicals in 2010.Medical applications of biotechnology will remain costly and available towealthy segments of society.Materials technology will give rise to widely available products that are smart,multifunctional, environmentally compatible, more customisable. These willbenefit manufacturing, logistics and personal lifestyles.Nanotechnology developments are likely to change the way almost everything -from vaccines, to car tyres to computers - is designed and made. The globaleconomy will continue to become more energy efficient (traditional industries andtransportation). The most dynamic growth areas in services and the knowledgefields are less energy intensive than the fields they replace.Fossil fuels will remain the dominant form of energy in spite of global warmingconcerns.Efficiency of solar cells will increase and genetic engineering will improve theprospects for the large-scale use of ethanol and hydrates.Localised environmental problems such as high concentrations of pollutants inair, waterways and land will be managed and are unlikely to constitute a majorconstraint on economic growth and improving health standards.As transport demands grow, congestion costs (presently 2 % GDP) will continueto rise.Case 3: Strategic FuturesThe Performance and Innovation Unit of the UK Government's Cabinet Office recentlypublished an analysis of 50 strategic futures studies completed in the last five years'''.The report identifies dozens of trends which are set to shape the global future and thatmight be expected to affect UK policy over the coming decades. It grouped themthematically into the following six areas:DemographicsEnvironmental ChangeEconomicsScience and Technology 118 Strategic Futures Thinking: meta-analysis of published material on Drivers and Trends by S Davis, B Bolland, K Fisk and MPurvis (DERA) for the Performance and Innovation Unit, Cabinet Office, UK (DERA/CDAJS/152 (see http://www.cabinet-office.gov.uk/innovation/2000/strategic/Strategic_mainpage.shtml) 918 9 National and International GovernancePerceptions, Beliefs, Values and AttitudesThe report points out that the S&T driver holds a place of particular importance as thetrends in this area will facilitate many trends and events in the other areas. It also pointsout that S&T along with demography are the most reliable drivers, as futuredevelopments can be often derived from current developments. Also, the fact thatspecific technological goals are being actively pursued makes some of the S&T trendsun ique.A list of eleven trends and five wild cards were highlighted:1. Growth of IT/communications technology (increased technological globalisation)and greater sophistication of computers.2. Access to technology: Increasing access to IT and communications technology orcreation of a 'knowledge gap' as information access is restricted to those who canafford it.3. Increasing reliance/use on IT/communications technology in business, medicine,industry and leisure.4. Increasing use of biotechnology (including genetic engineering), particularly inmedicine.5. Increasing use of artificial intelligence.6. Increasing use of nano-technology and miniaturised technologies.7. Greater reach the media.8. Increasingreliance IT/communications technology inwesternmilitary(especially the US).9. Greater use of 'asymmetric' military technologies in developing countries and byparamilitary groups.10.Use of vastly improved, more robust and renewable materials.11.Continuing US dominance in the field of technological innovation.The 'wild card' events listed were:1. Viruses become immune to all known treatments2. Self-aware machine intelligence3. Sweeping medical breakthrough is perfected4. Faster than light travel5. Foetal sex selection becomes the normCase 4Emerging Thematic PrioritiesThe final study we cite is a detailed expert-based secondary analysis of national foresightstudies with the specific aim of distilling out from all the material the main topics andissues where research activities could or should be developed or continued across Europe.First of all, we point out that in recent years in Europe, there has been a trend in researchpolicy away from a technology driven to a issue\"9 -based specification of objectives. Thisis revealed by the themes emphasised in recent national foresight studies, which are beingused to inform research policy. 19 Socio-economic issues and problems 929 0 The analysis of emerging S&T priorities from a European perspective based on nationalforesight studies resulted in the identification of ten priority areas12\u00b0 of S&T for Europe(see more details in Annex II-1):Table Al: Priority S&T areas for Europecross-cutting enabling areas of UT: demand-driven application areas of ScIT1.Information and communication technologies 7.Knowledge science and technologies2.Gene science and technologies 8.Health sciences and technologies3.Nanoscience, nano- and precision technologies 9.Technologies for sustainability4.Advanced materials 10.Social sciences in support of building Europe5.Complexity and complex systems6.Fundamental sciences The identification of these areas was linked to important or emerging trend breakspresenting new challenges and opportunities.Trend breaks can be bottom-up, emanating from basic research and associatedwith new enabling areas of S&T (biogenomics) or new multidisciplinary fields(nanotech).Trend breaks can also arise from paradigm shifts in practice (knowledge &servicesdominated manufacturing, preventativehealth-care,precautionaryresearch). These have much more to do with the ways in which S&T is appliedand used in social and economic contexts.Opportunities can present themselves in areas where leadership positions need to bemaintained or built up. Such S&T priorities are strongly related to the creation ofcomplementary competencies to maintain and develop technological leadership. Forexample, ubiquitous computing calls on a range of skills in hardware, software andcommunications fields and other fundamental enabling technology fields (e.g. complexity,advanced materials, nanotechnologies).Overall, we see that the most prominent and recurring themes through the otherstudies, are also reflected in the Foresight analysis as one would expect. However, aswe move on to consider the situation of S&T in the PACs, we must remember that thethemes and issues listed above refers to the S&T frontiers, which in the context of anycountry, not just the PACs, is only part of the picture regarding S&T activities. 120 IPTS Working Paper- Emerging Priority Research Themes for Europe, December 2000 http://priorities.jrc.es/ 939 1 Annex Ill:Science and Technology - framework and priorities in pre-accession countriesThe full annex with country background information could be found on Enlargement Futures web site of IPTS http://www.jrc.es/enlargement/Table A2: Selected indicators for R&D CountryR&Dexpend. inR&D per 1 000 000'patent applicationsresidents'patent applicationsnonresidents'GERD as % of GDP2 % of GERD financed by industry2 19981998(1981-95)(1987-97)1995199719951997199519971998199519971998Bulgaria65191164240174737040016953276000.60.520.59n.d.22.918.7Cyprus19564n.d.209n.d.n.d.n.d.n.d.0.18n.d.0.2383.6n.d.13.9CzechRepublic630237401285122262860119382299761.151.161.2763.162.864.6Estonia29491432962017161814751266260.630.600.6212.9n.d.19.6Hungary2852031511571099111777419770293310.750.740.6838.4n.d.38.4Latvia2444371165104921016316140268600.520.430.4520.523.821.0Lithuania55128471278202810612515882266730.480.570.5721.75.51.8Poland102284510108313582598240119491301370.750.720.7331.539.441.5Romania18452454138213871811170916856273460.680.580.5030.181.476.7Slovakia156164611922186627323417659279731.001.180.8660.475.665.8Slovenia22879851998225131828516267271621.711.421.48545.553.052.65Turkey82532092912062331506279850.3830.4930.5030.8341.8341.8EU-15141200861210 1.901.791.8652.953.963.7Finland3335264833675279925334061201921053762.292.722.8959.5462.9463.9Greece542109727747734525344697823900.810.820.90n.d.n.d.20.2Italy1082276056130313181625257463330888361.000.991.0241.7\u00b044.3443.9Portugal5821360759911829692586051065950.570.630.6519.5421.1\u00b021.2Japan1025556044385667490933506135148753896664872.772.893.0372.3\u00b073.4473.4US202172964800373236761274761258081079641108842.482.552.5860.4464.3\u00b066.7Source: 1 - World development indicators, 2 - Eurostat, 3 - State statistical Institute of Turkey 1999, 4 - OECD (1999), 5 - Statistical office of Slovenia, 2001 94 Table A3: Overview of innovation priorities and measures by Action Lines Rankin;of innova ion priorities JNumber of innovation policy measures121Priority areas and sub-areas FlGRITPTBUCVCZEEHULILVPOROSVSLFlGRITPTCVCZEEHULTLVPLROSKSLI.
