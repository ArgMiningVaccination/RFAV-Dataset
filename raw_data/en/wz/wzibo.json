Perspectives of Ayurveda in Integrative Cardiovascular Chinese Medicine for Patient Compliance, volume four in the Integrative Cardiovascular Chinese Medicine series, provides a systematic perspective of therapeutic priority by examining the homeostasis of the body, mind and spirit through Ayurveda philosophies and universal attributes, including five key elements. Holism, patient compliance and ethics in medicine are discussed, as are responsibility, awareness and guidance for compliance in cardiac patients. Finally, strategies of compliant patients outline and compare Ayurvedic and Chinese medicine for dietary laws and recovery techniques, utilizing both systems for personal benefit and what compliance means and looks like in clinical settings. This important reference will aid cardiovascular researchers in the study of integrative Chinese and Western medicine, while also providing a clear, structured base to guide clinical practice and encourage collaboration between practitioners.
