In mid -2020, a new approach for Covid -19 and other viruses called the Nanoparticle Treatment was proposed targeting only a relatively small number of patients who tested positive for the virus. Messenger mRNA and antigens of the virus having un known side effects were excluded. Only injections of biodegradable lipid nanoparticles (NPs) in saline are used with the antigen being the actual live Covid -19 virus in the tested positive patient that is inactivated by the UV radiation emitted from the NP s. The UV is produced by the simple QED theory based on the Planck law which denies atoms in NPs the heat capacity to conserve heat by an increase in temperature, and instead heat from the surroundings is conserved by creating EM radiation at a wavelength depending on the NP size, e.g., 80 nm lipid NPs emit UVC (254 nm) radiation. In the manner of an in vivo vaccine, the NP treatment uses UVC to inactivate the live Covid -19 virus in the patient to produce the inactivated virus that acts as the antigen to elicit immunity to current and future Covid -19 infections. By controlling the NP dose, the UVC is held to low levels of collateral DNA damage allowing recovery by DNA repair systems that evolved during the UV intense primitive Earth. Today, the Pfizer -BioNTe ch vaccine and others having over 90% efficacy are found to lose immunity prompting re - vaccinations. However, the NP treatment, especially in pill form to avoid injections, is suggested as sufficent and economic to be administered as many times necessary t o all Covid -19 patients on Earth tested positive to extend im munity as envisoned in mid -2020 . Keywords : nanoparticle . Introduction The tale Covid currently authoritatively named as serious intense respiratory disorder Covid 2 (SARS -CoV -2) is the causative specialist of the C OVID -19 sickness outbreaks . Wuhan (China) was the primary focal point of this pandemic, and now with more than 8.3 million announced diseases and more than 449,099 passings as of June 17, 2020, it is considered as the most noticeably terrible em ergency since World War II. The overall effect of this pandemic is startling, and it probably won't h ave arrived at the apex yet. Humanity is additionally confronting an emergency circumstance because of compuls ory isolates and loc kdowns. The world economy is as of now confronting a dependable gouge, and the circumstance will doubtlessly deteriorate if the vir al spread isn't controlled. Alpha, beta, gamma and delta are the four classes of the Covid (CoV) family, all highlighting a solitary abandoned positive - sense RNA genome. The layer wraps typifying the viral genome are beautified with glycoprotein spike transmembrane proteins. \"Covid\" is named for the club -molded protein spikes on their surface when seen under a transmission electron magnifying lens (TEM). The causative specialist behind the COVID -19 pandemic has a place with the beta class. The equivalent Covid class was answerable for the extreme intense respiratory disorder (SARS) and the Middle East r espira tory condition (MERS). Fever, dry hack, weakness, and trouble in breathing are among the underlying side effects of a SARS - CoV -2 contaminated patien t. This is the more infectious infection in its group and significantly influences the lower respiratory framework starting viral pneumonia.
