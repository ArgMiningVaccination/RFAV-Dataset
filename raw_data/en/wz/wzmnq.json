All of our graduates, in all fields, must fully understand the sustainability challenge and be prepared to create systems that meet people's health, security, and economic needs while living in harmony with our life support systems. Higher education, which represents 100% of society's educational footprint, must lead this transfor - mative change. Through the American College & University Presidents' Climate Commitment (ACUPCC), higher education has taken a huge, unprecedented first step: making education and action for sustainability a strategic priority at hundreds of institutions. Although we are still a long way from sustainability, higher education's leadership through the ACUPCC has brought us closer to our goal. It holds the potential of jumpstarting a healthy, just, and sustainable economy, capable of meeting the needs of people worldwide, now and in the future. Anthony D.

Today, 60,000 willow plants stand 8 feet tall and in the next year or two will be harvested and combusted in the university's biomass steam plant. By growing some of its own energy, Colgate hopes to en - courage local farmers to utilize out-of-production land to grow willow for local energy consumption. Photo courtesy of Colgate University Dear Colleagues, Higher education has a unique opportunity and responsibility to provide the knowledge and the graduates needed to lead to a thriving, civil, and sustain - able society. In 2007, realizing that society is not on a socially, economically, or environmentally sustainable path, a number of college and university presidents took a unique and unprecedented step to change course through the American College & University President's Climate Commitment (ACUPCC). In so doing, we believed we could make significant progress on immediate challenges includ - ing career preparation and work - force development, access and affordability of higher education, and innovation for renewed and sustainable economic prosperity. Let's imagine for a moment it's 2050, and through the ACUPCC we have played an instrumental role in creating a sustainable society. What might it look like? There are no research centers or majors focused on sustainability because sustainability principles are at the core of teaching, learn - ing, and knowledge creation in every discipline. All campuses are climate neu - tral and secure in the face of new climate patterns. Our smart, high- performance buildings generate more energy than they consume. Campus and community design makes biking and walking easy, safe, and enjoyable, and what ve - hicles are needed run on electricity and sustainable biofuels. Our supply chains are enhanc - ing the social and ecological capital upon which our society depends. Our institutions procure goods and services\u2014from food to furniture\u2014that are designed with a 'cradle-to-cradle' perspective, powered by clean renewable en - ergy, and do not contribute to us - ing resources faster than they can be regenerated. These processes support strong communities and enable people to live full, peaceful lives. Students are deeply involved in these efforts as a fundamental part of their educational experi - ence. These ways of meeting our needs are the norm throughout all sectors\u2014thanks in large part to higher education's leadership. Now, look back from this 2050 perspective to 2012 and ask: how did we get here? There are many possible paths, but some things are clear. We remained active and persis - tent in ensuring that meeting the American College & University Presidents' Climate Commitment was a strategic imperative for our institutions. Faculty, administra - tors, and leaders from across the network partnered to create new ways of teaching and learning so our graduates understand sustain - ability and are prepared for 21st century careers. Together, we ad - opted new ways of educating and operating \u2014we reduced costs and opened up funding opportunities to help improve the accessibility and affordability of higher educa - tion. We took a number of actions to engage all of higher education, communities, and the private sec - tor to ensure mutual success. While we are proud of our achievements to date, we must accelerate our efforts over the next five years if we are to realize our 2050 vision. The scientific in - formation on the scope and scale of society's challenge continues to accumulate. In November 2011, the International Energy Agency released an analysis finding that, without significant action in the next five years, we will 'lock in' carbon emissions that will make it impossible to avoid irrevers - ible, dangerous climate change. The next five years are critical in ensuring a safe, thriving society in 2050. As we celebrate the past five years and prepare to hasten our work over the next five, we invite you to participate in making this vision a reality. We cannot do it without the engagement of all of higher education. Sincerely, Envisioning 2050 A Letter from the Co-Chairs Timothy P. White Chair Judith A. Ramaley Co-Chair Mary S.

The ACUPCC, Second Nature, and College of the Atlantic coordinate the development of the ACUPCC Voluntary Carbon Offset Protocol. A working group comprised of individuals from across the ACUPCC network, experts in finance, energy, land use, and climate science produce the protocol to help signatories evaluate and invest in the carbon offset market. That fall, Charter Sig - natories submit their first greenhouse gas inventories, setting a baseline for their progress toward net-zero. The network now represents one-third of the total US student population. Signatories involve these students in completing their greenhouse gas inventories and creating their climate action plans\u2014preparing them with desirable techni - cal skills and invaluable experience in organizational change and leadership. 2009 Early signatories sub - mit their climate action plans, detailing a variety of approaches for pursing climate neutrality in their operations and strategies for ensuring sustainability- literate graduates. The ACUPCC Steer - ing Committee develops Leading Profound Change: A Resource for Presidents and Chancellors to serve as a guide in leading the transformational change toward climate neutrality. President Bill Clinton delivers the keynote at the 2009 Summit, reinforcing the importance of this work and the incredible oppor - tunities to save money and create jobs that it repre - sents. In November, the ACUPCC's success is rec - ognized with a Leadership Award from the US Green Building Council.2010 Throughout 2010, updated greenhouse gas inventories show that the network is already reducing emis - sions. At the 2010 Summit, former CIA Director James Woolsey emphasizes the many reasons\u2014including human rights, economic prosperity, and national se - curity\u2014why getting society off fossil fuels and elimi - nating greenhouse gas emissions is so critical. Second Nature initiates the Climate Leadership Awards, recognizing 32 ACUPCC institutions to date for their innovation and excellence. The ACUPCC becomes an academic partner of the R20 initiative in support of sub-national efforts to address climate change around the world Initiatives modeled after the ACUPCC gather steam in Scotland, Canada, Peru, and other countries. 2011-2012 More progress and tangible results are reported in 2011 and 2012 in terms of reports submitted, emis - sions reduced, courses offered, and money saved (see The Network's Progress & Promise, page 6 ). ACUPCC institutions complete hundreds of innovative ventures. A few examples: the integra - tion of sustainability into all education at Dickinson College and Pratt Insti - tute; large-scale energy projects like Ball State's geothermal system and Arizona State's solar array; the Institute for Sustain - able Solutions at Portland State University founded by a $25M private grant; and dynamic community part - nerships like the Tompkins County Climate Protec - tion Initiative with Cornell University, Ithaca College, and Tompkins Cortland Community College. As a result of its focus on engaging under- resourced and minority- serving institutions, the ACUPCC network includes 90 Historically Black, His - panic-Serving, and Tribal colleges and universities. One-hundred and fifty of the signatories are consid - ered under-resourced by the federal government. The ACUPCC celebrates the transformative power it has had on US higher education and society in 5 short years, and sets bold goals for the next five. In late 2006, twelve visionary college and university presidents initiated the American College & University Presidents' Climate Commitment (ACUPCC). They were motivated by their convic - tion that higher education had the capacity and responsibility to lead on climate and sustain - ability action for the sake of their students and society. These \"Founding Signatories\" (see page 38 ) worked with Sec - ond Nature, ecoAmerica, and the Association for the Advance - ment of Sustainability in Higher Education (AASHE) to develop the Commitment. In early 2007, they invited their peers across the nation to join this historic endeavor. By Earth Day 2008, it became a truly national initiative with signatories in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. The ACUPCC made higher education the first sector with a coherent critical mass pub - licly committed to pursuing the scientifically necessary target of climate neutrality \u2014net-zero greenhouse gas emissions from specified campus activities. Early on, some felt this initiative was just a symbolic gesture \u2014a sentiment that the actions and progress of the ACUPCC signatories have since quelled. In 2010, greenhouse gas inventories showed that, on balance, the network was already reducing emissions \u2014an incred - ible feat considering the growth momentum that most institu - tions face. Schools reported more progress and tangible re - sults in 2011 and 2012 in the form of emissions reduced, courses offered, and money saved ( for de - tails see The Network's Progress & Promise, page 6 ). These reports indicate that sustainability efforts are saving money and securing funds from new sources helping to improve access and affordabil - ity in higher education. The cumulative impact of this collective initiative is being realized, but the real progress has just begun. As the US economy contin - ues to climb out of the Great Recession, higher education faces challenges of account - ability, affordability, workforce preparation, and relevance. ACUPCC institutions are leading the way in promoting sustainable solutions to the ma - jor economic and social issues of our time. They are cultivating preparedness, opportunity, and innovation to connect sustain - ability education with the unfolding job market; to realize cost savings and attract new funding sources; to build part - nerships with the private sector; to become centers of innovative research and demonstration; and to support retention and gradua - tion rates. The time period for the nec - essary transition is rapidly clos - ing. The International Energy Agency recently concluded that we have just five years to make major changes to avoid locking in runaway climate change. The ACUPCC is up for the challenge. The network has set bold new goals for the next five years and is preparing new strategies to support the policies needed for success and to ensure graduates are educated to create a healthy, just, and sustainable society.

Looking Ahead: Policy Agenda For Higher Education Sustainability Leadership Cost savings from reducing energy use and shifting to clean energy are essential for improving access and affordability in higher education. The National Association of College and University Business Officers (NACUBO) and Second Nature are working with presidents and business officers to identify and enhance clean energy incentives and investments specific to the non-profit higher education sector . Because many policies are currently geared toward the business sector, this effort will aim to expand those and develop new policy ideas to include higher education institutions.Climate Action Plan Savings SAVINGS BETWEEN $10,000 - $100,000SAVINGS BETWEEN $100,000 - $1,000,000SAVINGS - $40,000,000SAVINGS BETWEEN $40,000,000 - $50,000,000 50 38 19 3 1 After two years of implementation, 71% of signatories affirmed that their Climate Action Plan has saved their institution money.

With - out preventing the worst aspects of climate disruption, we cannot hope to deal with the other social, health, and economic challenges that society is facing and will face in the future. Interim Target Reduction Goals 258 schools have set interim emissions reduction targets to ensure tangible, short-term progress while imple - menting plans in the context of the broader goal of climate neutrality. Greenhouse gas emissions accumulate in the atmosphere and can impact the climate for decades\u2014even centuries\u2014to come. Moreover, the adverse impact of today's emissions will not be fully felt for 30-50 years. This understanding underscores the urgency of reducing emissions as much as possible in the short term. The 2007 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report states: \"Mitigation efforts over the next two to three decades will have a large impact on opportunities to achieve lower stabilization levels,\" and notes that to stabilize atmospheric concentrations of CO2 at 350-400 parts per million (the level needed to avoid dangerous and irreversible climate disruption), emissions must peak and start declining by 2015. Reaching Climate Neutrality Emissions Reductions Achieved and Projected for ACUPCC Network In the first five years of the initiative, ACUPCC institutions reduced gross greenhouse gas emissions (total scopes 1, 2, and 3) by 10.2 million MtC02e. Although not all institutions submitted GHG inventories for 2007 and 2012, average gross emissions for the five Basic Carnegie Classification categories in those years were normalized to reflect the size of the ACUPCC network in 2012. Based on a comparison of current GHG emissions and the climate neutrality dates chosen by ACUPCC institutions, the network is projected to reach a reduction of over 50% of its gross emissions in the next fifteen years, and will have reduced 93% of baseline emissions by 2050.

Of the Associate Colleges with a January-May 2012 Progress Report, 68% offer degrees or certificates for green job training. By providing training in solar, wind, energy efficiency, sustainable food and land use, alternative fuels and transportation, green building, and general sustainability development, these programs are helping both first-time and returning students build livable careers. In delivering real preparation for the jobs and infrastructure of a transitioning economy, these institutions are not only advancing the needs of their communities and students\u2014they are playing a critical role in transforming higher education to meet the needs of a changing society.Community Engagement Engaging with the community to build sustainable and thriving regional economies is an important pursuit for higher education. Campuses create community partnerships to implement sustainable solutions beyond their institutional boundary, engaging students in valuable service learning experiences, and foster ongoing dialogue, research, and support to ensure the long-term resiliency of the regions in which they teach. Data on this page is based on Progress Reports submitted by 235 signatory institutions between January and May 2012.

Photo courtesy of Allegheny CollegeThe following are a few examples of concrete steps ACUPCC institutions are taking towards a sustain - able society\u2014in classrooms, research labs, campus operations, and local communities. These stories provide just a taste of what these campuses\u2014and hundreds more like them\u2014have accomplished as part of their holistic approaches to tackling the sustainability challenge. They are the result of a subtle transformation that is occurring within the sector as more and more leaders at all levels of our country's colleges and universities recognize that creating a sustainable society is essential and central to the mission of higher education. 14 Celebrating Five Years of Climate Leadership 15 www.presidentsclimatecommitment.orgHow does Houston Community College District (HCCD) engage the local community, including the private and public sectors, in advancing climate and sus - tainability education? Houston Community College District has a 40-year history of positively serving the local com - munity. During the course of this period, active relationship build - ing with our partners, including entities in both the public and private sectors, positioned HCCD to leverage long-standing ties for the benefit of our students and others, particularly those having a common interest in advancing sustainable practices. For example, HCCD engages the local community through an annual Chancellor's Energy Symposium. This event brings HCCD students and local high school students together with faculty, staff, and external entities such as the University of Houston, Rice University, Chevron Energy Solutions, and Waste Management, as well as federal and state policy makers to explore common interests which include promoting sustainable practices through education. This oppor - tunity also positions HCCD to identify existing and future needs of industry and manage our efforts to accommodate them (or those needs). It is a planned win-win for those who seek positive change through an education-based fo - rum that promotes sustainability. How does engaging with the public and private sectors help better prepare students for the 21st century economy? Connecting students with real-world challenges through public-private sector engagement is critically important in prepar - ing students for the 21st century's economy. The more we can do to model appropriate behaviors for our students and provide real-life examples of how to protect our resources, the more likely we are to have future workers and leaders who will respect and protect those resources. We recognize that con - textualizing learning is a much more effective way to embed understanding about climate neu - trality than just lecturing about it. What role has the ACUPCC played in advancing this discussion? The ACUPCC plays a critical role in advancing the sustain - ability and climate neutrality discussion. This focused organiza - tion includes some of the most credible and committed voices in the climate commitment charge. In part, to advance its mission, the ACUPCC engages thought- leaders in the field, policymakers, and other relevant stakeholders to ensure that value-added discus - sions continue on the subject of promoting sustainable practices. The organization also advances the sustainability discussion through mentoring opportunities, website information, network - ing opportunities, and summits. These opportunities, often offered via president-led committees, help increase participation in the education sector and dili - gently advance the sustainability discussion.HOUSTON, TX CHANCELLOR: Mary S.

The ACUPCC provides a framework and catalyst for delivering the curricular and co-curricular education needed to ensure that students from all disciplines are \"sustainability- literate\" and prepared to incorporate sustainability principles into every aspect of their personal and professional lives. Signatories are taking a variety of approaches to do this, including creating interdisciplinary centers, degree programs, graduation require - ments, and community-wide awareness campaigns. 16 Celebrating Five Years of Climate Leadership 17 www.presidentsclimatecommitment.org Built in the early 1970s as an all-electric facility, MWCC's decade-long transformation into a sustainable campus most recently incorporated two 1.65 MW wind turbines. Together, the turbines generate enough electricity to meet the annual demand on the 450,000-square-foot campus, including the Fitness & Wellness Center and Olympic-size indoor pool. Photos courtesy of Mount Wachusett Community College Mount Wachusett Community College (MWCC) ushered in a new era of sustainability in 2011 with the activation of two 1.65 MW wind turbines. Within the first year, the Vestas V82 turbines generated 5 million kWh\u2014100 percent of the college's annual energy demand\u2014while simulta - neously turning a profit. MWCC now operates as a near zero net energy campus and is near climate neutrality for op - erations as a result of the turbines, biomass heating, a 100kW photo - voltaic array, solar domestic hot water technologies, and progres - sive conservation measures. This represents a complete turnaround in a decade. Built as an all-electric facility in the early 1970s, the college's annual electricity bills were top - ping $750,000 by the late 1990s. Over the past decade, MWCC increased in size to 450,000 square feet and nearly tripled the number of computers on campus, yet through these innovative energy strategies and conservation measures, the annual electricity consumption has dropped from 9 million kWh per year to 5 million kWh. Solar and geothermal tech - nologies incorporated into a resi - dential rehabilitation center for wounded combat veterans, built on college grounds by a local nonprofit organization, add to the highly visible sustainability efforts on campus. Combined, these technologies provide an invalu - able learning tool for the public and students enrolled in the college's Natural Resources and Energy Management programs. Aptly located on Green Street, MWCC has incorporated sustain - ability into its core mission. An organic community garden, single stream recycling, composting, and refillable water stations are among the initiatives launched with the assistance of the student sustain - ability club, The Green Society. MWCC further reduced its car - bon footprint by adopting a four- day class schedule and increasing online course offerings. MWCC has received a number of awards for its energy initiatives, including top awards in 2011 from Second Nature, the US Environmental Protection Agency, and the Massachusetts Executive Office of Energy and Environmental Affairs. A charter signatory of the ACUPCC, Mount Wachusett is a true example of how an institu - tion can invest in clean energy, elevate awareness about the need for alternative energy solutions in the US, and ultimately address the global climate crisis.New Era of Sustainability at Mount Wachusett Community College By Daniel M.

The new and innovative program includes a renewable energy (RE) technology concen - tration, three RE certifications for electrical technicians, and four new RE courses: Survey of Renew - able Energy , Introduction to Solar- Thermal Technology , Introduction to Solar-Photovoltaic Technology , and Introduction to Small Wind Technology . The three introduc - tory courses are hands-on and offer third-party certifications including North American Board of Certified Energy Practitioners Entry Level certifications, and the Communication Industry Train - ing and Certification Academy (CITCA) certification for Wind Tower Safety and Tower Rescue . Professor Timothy J. Wilhelm, an Interstate Renewable Energy Council Institute for Sustainable Power Quality (ISPQ) Affiliated Master Trainer and CITCA Certi - fied Trainer, secured ISPQ ac - creditation for the Introduction to Solar-Photovoltaic course in 2011. Additional grants from the Illinois Clean Energy Community Foun - dation and the US Department of Education provided funding for lab materials for the hands-on courses as well as a 50 kW Endur - ance wind turbine. The project was among 33 highlighted by NSF, recognizing it for addressing \"the chicken- and-egg problem: 'Do we wait for anticipated, emerging jobs to become available before we train the needed technicians; or do we train the technicians we expect to need before the job demand exists?'\" By giving students the skills and education to step right into Renewable Energy Techni -cian jobs as they arise, while also training them for entry level posi - tions in a wide variety of Electri - cal Technology jobs, Professor Wilhelm's RE program addresses the conundrum head on. Professor Wilhelm has secured a transfer agreement with Illinois State University, and has shared the curriculum, equipment lists, PowerPoints, and videos with the community colleges in Illinois as well as with the rest of the country. A RE Curriculum Clinic was held in February 2010 and more than 40 participants from six states left with materials to start the courses at their schools. Colleges around the country, like California Technical College, are emulating the program.

When PSU signed on to the ACUPCC in 2007, students took an active role in developing a Climate Action Plan. And when it came time to begin implement - ing the plan's aggressive steps toward carbon neutrality on cam - pus, students came forward ready to get their hands dirty. The Climate Action Plan Implementation Team recruited a Winter 2011 Capstone class\u2014 PSU's signature cross-disciplinary and applied learning experience for every senior\u2014to focus its work on the goals of increasing waste diversion and decreasing materi - als consumption on campus. Working with their faculty adviser, the Communities and Resources Capstone students chose two blocks in the heart of PSU's 50-acre downtown campus. Comprised of a student recreation center, classrooms, offices, store - fronts, the city's busiest transit stops, and the PSU Urban Plaza, this target area would prove small enough to generate a measure - able near-term impact, yet large enough to produce meaningful and scalable information that could inform future climate ac - tion strategies. Students in the class broke into teams. One, focused on gov - ernance issues, was successful in establishing two ongoing working groups\u2014comprised of students, faculty, and staff from the blocks' buildings\u2014that now meet regu - larly to discuss strategies for waste reduction and diversion. Another surveyed over 300 building oc - cupants to gauge barriers and opportunities for more recycling and reduction, and inventoried existing recycling and composting available onsite. In the most conspicuous effort of the Capstone, students sorted, weighed, and exhibited three days' worth of waste\u2014over 150 pounds\u2014in the outdoor Urban Plaza. The display drew in more than 100 community members to discuss waste management on campus and its contributing role in achieving carbon neutrality. The students' synthesis report and recommendations for next steps have served as the basis for further work by the next cohort in the Communities and Resources Capstone, as well as the Climate Action Plan Implementation Team, which is now working with other classes across campus to support the University's pursuit of carbon neutrality. Through the University's Climate Action Plan, students gain valuable hands-on experi - ence in helping achieve its goals, preparing them with tools to ad - dress the pervasive challenges of global climate change as engaged citizens and workforce partici - pants after graduation.

Seaward (Sustainable Consumerism, NYU '12) Tell us about the leadership role given to students on New York University's Sustainability Task Force. Kayla: The Task Force engages members from all sectors of the NYU community, from students to senior university leadership. It is comprised of Working Groups distinguished by an area of exper - tise, and each group is co-chaired by a student. Not only are these students liaising with faculty and staff\u2014they're leading meetings and projects with vice provosts in attendance, constantly building a sustainability management skill set. In order to excel, students must understand the specific bar - riers to sustainability at NYU\u2014 navigating power structures, addressing challenges posed by our urban environment, and analyzing the campus culture. They must be acutely aware of which risks the university is will - ing to take, who the stakeholders are for each initiative, and where the bottlenecks and feedback loops exist on our decentralized university landscape.How has student involvement in the Green Grants program affected outcomes? David: Green Grants demo - cratically allow for students to directly contribute to NYU's sustainability initiatives. As project leaders they control and design their project and, working in concert with the Office of Sustainability, they get institutional support and ensure their projects complement other campus initiatives. Furthermore, many successful grantees become members of the Sustainability Task Force, making further use of their gained knowledge of institutional change and proj - ect execution. At such a large university known for its adminis - trative 'red tape', Green Grants are a mechanism through which students can implement their own sustainability initiatives that, if proven successful and beneficial, become institutionalized by the University on a much larger scale. For example, the Bike Share blossomed from two student-led Green Grants into one of NYU Sustainability's flagship pro - grams, supported and run by the university.Do you feel you have made a lasting impression on NYU's sustainability initiatives as well as your own future as a sus - tainable citizen and community member? David: I believe that Green Grants would have either ended or been on hiatus for a long time had I not performed both an op - erational analysis and a national comparison of similar programs. Doing so demonstrated the program's efficacy and helped me discern how I could get it running smoothly again. I have also placed heavy emphasis on requiring metrics to tangibly demonstrate projects' benefits, which can have rippling effects as we share our final reports and best practices with peer universities. Furthermore, in the commu - nity spirit essential to sustainabil - ity, working in the Green Grants program has demonstrated to me that non-expert participation in sustainability projects is neces - sary for sustainability literacy and behavioral change to saturate in our society.NEW YORK, NY PRESIDENT: John Sexton IMPLEMENTATION LIAISON: Jeremy A.

Mak - ing the most of scarce resources was commonplace. Harvesting only for necessity was customary and wise. When taking the Buf - falo, the sacred provider, nothing went to waste. Lessons from tribal history and tradition are not lost today. The students and staff of United Tribes Technical College (UTTC) have inherited a tradition of conserva - tion going back centuries. Relying on their traditional knowledge and experience, the leaders of North Dakota's tribes founded the college in 1969. It became one of the premier tribal colleges in the nation\u2014a place of education, support and empowerment for Native students and their families. The college campus is the site of a former military post that is, as you would expect, renovated and re-purposed for tribal higher education. Students from tribes across the nation attend, making UTTC an inter-tribal and cultur - ally diverse learning environment that blends forward thinking and tradition. In its off-reservation setting at Bismarck, North Dakota, UTTC is something of a model for prac - tices and innovations for tribal communities. The college initi - ated the first training program in the country for Native American energy auditors. Infused in the science curriculum are values that respect the goal of climate neutrality. The campus has an active and motivated \"Green Committee\" that raises awareness about global climate change, con - servation, and sustainability. The college has adopted conservation measures on campus including the use of geothermal heating and cooling technology in its most recently constructed buildings: Itancan Oyanke (Leadership Hall), a coed dormitory, and a science and technology center that has expanded the college's campus. UTTC strives to be faithful to its tribal traditions and wise in the understanding and use of energy resources. That's why College President David M. Gipp made the decision to have the college join the ACUPCC and continue to pursue sustainability, in all its forms and possibilities, on this tribal college campus.

How does it foster collaboration among art and design institutions? PALS stands for Partnership for Academic Leadership in Sustainability. This group of 33 member schools of AICAD (Association of Independent Colleges of Art and Design) is working to promote and support action at the institutional level. The group started in September 2010 with four objectives: to get to know each other, to share what each school was doing, to consid - er what needed to happen next, and to propose how sustainability would be key to the viability of our schools. We came to listen, but more importantly we came to work together. Over 3 days at our first summit, we created a presen - tation deck to share our strategy with each of our presidents. Our goal was to leverage the power of 30 to convince our leadership to create relevant and meaningful change. We meet monthly online to applaud success, discuss chal - lenges, and build the connective tissue of the cohort. How does the collaboration among these ACUPCC institu - tions strengthen each indi - vidual campus's approach to sustainability? At the PALS 2011 summit we created a Sustainability Initiatives Report to share what's going on at each school. It uses the 17 categories of the Sustainability Tracking, Assessment & Rating System (STARS) to sort data. We designed it for our presidents so they could compare and rate their schools' accomplishments against their peers, but we've found it valuable at all levels\u2014ev - eryone wants to know what other schools are doing. It's a great way to generate ideas and we now have some baseline standards to build on each year to chart prog - ress. Our monthly online meet - ings are now themed\u2014recent topics have included: Life Cycle Assessment, Sustainability in the Fine Arts, and Shared Studios between PALS Schools. These conversations are critical, espe - cially at schools where resources are scarce. We've had Chief Academic Officers and Deans participate alongside department heads and faculty. What is the value in encourag - ing collaborative curriculum development at different insti - tutions? Do you think this is an emerging trend? Collectively we are modeling the future of education. Raising tuition isn't a viable solution, and we are no longer each other's competition. By sharing and leveraging our resources we can share the cost of conducting pro - fessional workshops for our faculty or jointly run a design studio. We can divide expenditures by 30 and multiply value by 30. Longer term, we are preparing our faculty to teach across institutions by creating innovative models that will help us meet the academic standards we aspire to and take on some of the financial challenges facing us. How are students better pre - pared to meet the real design challenges in their fields? If we can get our students ac - cess to more knowledge resources, they win. For example, Ontario College of Art and Design has a great biomimicry studio , Pratt has an incubator that turns designers into social entrepreneurs, and the School of the Art Institute of Chicago is working with the city to use art to mitigate brown - fields . The shared studios we are planning for the near future will expand our students' knowl - edge while they create valuable contacts with peers from other schools. By the time graduation is upon them, they will leave with a smarter, more connected network.PALS: Working Together to Create a New Vision for Design Education An interview with Debera Johnson, Academic Director of Sustainability, Pratt Institute BROOKLYN, NY PRESIDENT: Thomas F.

The signing of the ACUPCC in 2007 became the catalyst for establishing a broad commitment to sustainability across all levels of the institution. Moving from a loose col - lection of individual initia - tives\u2014mostly led by students and faculty\u2014to an institutional com - mitment meant making sustain - ability part of the College's deep infrastructure, including curricu - lum, staffing, strategic planning, facilities, student life programs, and finances. This began with numerous individual actions that were situated within established College practices, based on the principle that sustainability must become a fundamental part of Allegheny's identity, rather than simply another program layered on top of an already-busy campus life. The first, and in many ways most significant, step was creating a full-time sustainability coordinator position, which was accomplished through a reor - ganization of the physical plant staff in anticipation of a pending retirement. The coordinator became the locus of formerly-disparate sus - tainability efforts by assisting with student-faculty research, working with facilities staff, collaborating on a multi-year energy reduc - tion program, assisting with the design of new buildings, engaging student leaders, recommending utility purchase arrangements, and authoring the Climate Action Plan. Other champions emerged in the faculty, physical plant, fi - nance office, and student govern - ment, and their work to integrate sustainability into established practices was recognized and rein - forced by the President and senior leadership, motivated in large part by the commitment to fulfilling the ACUPCC pledge. Multi-year planning and finan - cial forecasting were essential to achieving climate commitment goals, as projects that were too expensive in the short term were completed over time. A 10-year comprehensive maintenance plan was developed with an emphasis on energy projects, alongside oth - er priorities such as classrooms, residence halls, and accessibility. Integrating sustainability with long-term planning and budget - ing culminated in the inclu - sion of climate neutrality in the College's comprehensive strategic plan, made possible in large part by the fact that a Climate Action Plan was already in place. Many success stories emerged, including a 100% wind power purchase, organic landscaping program, student-led activities (including the annual Trashion Show and Energy Challenge, as well as the establishment of a student government sustain - ability coordinator), inclusion of LEED standards in construction and renovation, installation of three ground-source heating and cooling systems, and a biofuel partnership with the local city government. As the result of these projects, utilities expenses were more than $400,00 below budget in 2010-11, representing one of the key expense controls that enable the College to limit tuition increases and provide ac - cess for students. These initiatives were substantially facilitated by the fact that sustainability had already been incorporated into the College's core values and established planning, finance, and governance systems.Creating a Broad Sustainability Commitment at Allegheny College By David McInally, Executive Vice President and Treasurer and Kelly A.

As such, higher education is under pressure to increase access and improve affordability. The ACUPCC generates cost savings and new funding sources, help - ing schools reduce tuition costs and increase access, giving more people the opportunity to earn a degree. 24 Celebrating Five Years of Climate Leadership 25 www.presidentsclimatecommitment.orgElizabeth City State University (ECSU) was founded on March 3, 1891. With a current enroll - ment of 3,307, the university is excelling in its mission to provide outstanding instruction, research opportunities, and community outreach projects. As a leader in the rural set - ting of Elizabeth City, ECSU developed a plan to be an active community partner in the sustain - ability realm. To formally drive this plan, on March 9, 2010 the ECSU board of trustees adopted a sustainability policy. This policy established\u2014as a core value\u2014 ECSU's commitment to proac - tively and effectively manage its environmental resources. With the endorsement of the board of trustees, Chancellor Willie J. Gilchrist signed the ACUPCC. As a signatory, ECSU committed to documenting the university's goal of climate neutrality and to developing a comprehensive plan to achieve this goal. ECSU quickly formed a steering committee and appointed a sustainability director to oversee the efforts. The committee has since investigated financial re - sources and pursued partnerships to support the implementation of all policies and initiatives created. One such partnership was with the Environmental Defense Fund (EDF). During the summer of 2010, EDF placed an intern on ECSU's campus. The intern, whose goal was to identify mea - surable energy savings, identified savings of approximately $300,000 at an estimated cost to ECSU of $59,000 and a payback period of 1.8 years. Another positive outcome of this partnership was the development of a compre - hensive sustainability plan that incorporated university goals and community outreach. After a competitive bidding process, ECSU procured a con - tract with Honeywell Corporation to identify energy enhancements in selected buildings on cam - pus. These enhancements are guaranteed by Honeywell to save more than $5,000,000 over a 14-year period, and will be financed through a commercial loan. ECSU was also the recipi - ent of a planning grant from the United Negro College Fund's Institute for Capacity Building. This grant enabled the university to train staff to develop an inven - tory of campus greenhouse gases and an accompanying mitigation plan. ECSU's Center for Green Research and Evaluation received an Innovation Grant in the amount of $400,000 from the North Carolina Rural Center. This grant served 21 counties in ECSU's catchment area. Additional grants that were fund - ed by outside resources helped to improve energy efficiency in community residences, further demonstrating ECSU's commit - ment to the community. ECSU's vision for sustainabil - ity is vast, constantly evolving, and reflects the stalwart commitment of the board of trustees to the uni - versity, students, and community.

As an online, for-profit univer - sity system, why does advanc - ing sustainability education interest American Public University System (APUS)? We're interested in advanc - ing sustainability education because it is the right thing to do. Our interest in promoting such initiatives has less to do with our online, for-profit status than with our being a member of the larger community of colleges and universities that understand the unique role higher education can play in combatting climate change. How does APUS's online educa - tion model increase students' access to education while maintaining its affordability? Our mission statement speci - fies our commitment to access and affordability and we are proud that we have offered quality educational programs without increasing our undergraduate tuition for 11 consecutive years. Our 100% online platform allows us to grow our student body with - out many of the same physical limitations facing more traditional institutions. It also allows us to of - fer monthly semester starts to en - able working adults to begin their studies when it is most convenient for them. Because we do not have to build and maintain student facilities that traditional campuses have, we can keep tuition and out-of-pocket costs low. APUS has seen continuous and significant student growth and enrollment increases. In 2005, we ended the year with 11,600 students; today we are serv - ing more than 110,000, represent - ing an annual growth rate of 48%. Our online format is appealing to our current students\u2014and to a growing number of students across the country. The Sloan Consortium reported in its Going the Distance report that online enrollments accounted for more than 30% of total college enroll - ments in Fall 2010, increasing more than 10% since Fall 2009. We believe our growth in the past 12-18 months is based more on our affordability than the convenience accorded by online education. Online universities often ap - peal to non-traditional higher education students. Who are you reaching with your sustain - ability courses? Can you tell us more about APUS's student body? Some 68% of our student body is active duty military, veterans, or National Guard and Reserves. All of the military service branches are represented among our student body. The remain - ing students are civilians, many of them working in the public service sectors at the local, state, and federal levels. The average age for an APUS student is 31 years old. Ninety-five percent are attending school part-time and 94% are working full-time. They are studying in all 50 states and more than 100 countries, many of them deployed to various overseas duty posts with the military. More than half of our students are first-generation college students, and our minority population mirrors the diversity of the military. Describe how you have inte - grated climate change and sustainability education into your curriculum and course offerings. We are able to disseminate climate change and sustainability education in an environmentally friendly way to our students across the US and in more than 100 countries. As they take this infor - mation into their local communi - ties, the possibilities for action are endless. Four of the seven schools at APUS have sustainability courses as part of their programs. Faculty in all the schools as well as the students in our Environmental Science programs benefit greatly from faculty members who are also practitioners. The Program Director for the Environmental Sciences program, for example, is the Chief of Natural Resources for the National Park Service. She is also a 28-year Coast Guard Reservist. In that capacity she was on hand in the days following the 2010 Gulf Oil Spill. In fact, sev - eral of our faculty members and many of our students were de - ployed to that area. Our Program Director and others documented their work in the Gulf Oil Spill with blog postings, podcasts, and video interviews and made these materials available to all members of the university community.

We go far beyond traditional practices in sustainability and are leaders by innovating approaches toward sustainable outcomes. We have countless courses with sustainability woven into their curricula, and just launched a new Bachelor of Science degree. Our research in renewable en - ergy, sustainable water, arid lands agriculture, and adaptation to cli - mate change is world-renowned. We also embrace sustainability in how we operate our campus, as our recent AASHE STARS\u00ae gold rating attests. Most importantly, we have fostered a true spirit of sustainability among our students, which they express in many ways, but none more significant than when, in 2010 their support for a $24 per year sustainability fee was approved to create the UA Green Fund. Each year a ten-member student Green Fund Committee solicits and reviews dozens of sustainability project proposals from staff, faculty, and students. Our committee selection process engages our graduate and un - dergraduate student presidents, department heads and faculty, and the entire student body. With up to $400,000 to allocate per year, the committee has funded more than 35 projects in its first two years, including a new 75- seat sustainable consumerism course, a student-run composting program and campus community garden, energy dashboards for UA Residence Life's 'battle of the utilities,' statewide sustain - ability 'externships' with UA Cooperative Extension, and numerous on-campus energy- and water-conserving projects. The success of the Green Fund spurred my interest in a revolving fund for larger energy efficiency projects, leading UA to join the Billion Dollar Green Challenge's Founding Circle in 2011. We will continue to use our Green Fund process to imple - ment more projects that reduce our environmental footprint, educate our students, and reduce costs. Even more important, we will use the process to create col - laborative, hands-on projects that engage our students, faculty, and operational and campus plan - ning staff in the transformation of our campus as a living, learning laboratory for sustainability solu - tions. Coupled with our excellent academic programs, we believe this will provide our students with the skills and experience needed to lead the world toward a more sustainable future.The University of Arizona: Innovating Its Way to Sustainability By Eugene G.

Photos courtesy of UA Why was the decision made to make sustainability an integral part of the college's strategic plan? Montgomery County Community College has a long history of promoting and practic - ing responsible environmental behavior. As we gathered input from students, faculty, and staff to develop our 2005-2010 strategic plan, sustainability emerged as a core value. The resulting plan\u2014Great Expectations: Keeping the Promise of Student Access and Success\u2014identified \"investing in campus renewal and sustain - ability\" as one of our six strategic goals. This early commitment to sustainability fueled the College's interest and the Board of Trustees' endorsement in becoming a char - ter signatory of the ACUPCC. Our sustainability efforts are led by a team of faculty, students, administrators, sup - port staff, alumni, and commu - nity members that comprise the Presidents' Climate Commitment Advisory Council. This group developed our first-ever Climate Commitment Action Plan, outlin - ing short- and long-term strategies to reach carbon neutrality. How does this focus increase the value and accessibility of the education at your institu - tion\u2014for both current and future students? The College's Climate Commitment Action Plan is divided into key categories\u2014in - cluding transportation, opera - tions, curricular and co-curric - ular activities, and community outreach\u2014all of which impact student access and success. We recently introduced a new general education core curricu - lum that shapes students' experi - ences through 13 learning com - petencies, one of which is civic responsibility. This competency requires students to \"analyze society's environmental impact on the non-human world and future generations to better ensure sustainability.\" The integration of sustainability into the core ensures that every Montgomery County Community College graduate is able to think critically about his or her impact on the larger world. It also paved the way for our faculty to introduce new courses that examine sustainabil - ity from biological, economical, geological, and geographical perspectives. The College's commitment to sustainability also enabled us to focus on transportation emissions which, because we are a com - muter institution, are a significant portion of our carbon footprint. After analyzing commuter traffic trends, we instituted a shuttle between our campuses in Blue Bell and Pottstown, which are 30 miles apart. At 10 runs per day, 20 riders per run, the shuttle reduces commuter traffic by close to 3,700 miles daily when operating at capacity. We also partnered with Zimride to promote and encour - age carpooling among students, faculty, and staff. These initiatives not only help us reduce our car - bon footprint, but they enhance student access to courses and activities on our campuses. How has participating in the ACUPCC network opened up cost saving avenues and new funding sources that you might not otherwise have accessed? The resources available to us through the ACUPCC network encourage us to think creatively about our sustainability efforts. The planning tools, such as the Greenhouse Gas Emissions Inventory, have led to significant cost-saving initiatives. For ex - ample, through a partnership with Community Energy, the College now purchases 100% of its energy from wind power, offsetting 8,500 metric tons of carbon annually and saving $17,000 over two years. We also recently entered into a Guaranteed Energy Services Agreement with Siemens Industry, Inc., which will generate an estimated $6,383,434 in energy savings, or 19%, over the next 15 years.A Commitment to Student Access and Success An interview with Karen A.

We are proud to provide a positive example for our 11,500 students while leading by ex - ample for our surrounding com - munity and beyond. To this end, our administrative team elected to become a charter member of the ACUPCC. Our faculty and students join us in our efforts to reduce the University's carbon footprint and to enhance our eco- friendly practices through campus campaigns, as well as through our academic curriculum. Building upon faculty strengths, the College of Science and Health is instituting a dedicated bachelor's degree in environmental sustainability in fall 2012. The degree unites a number of our areas of tangible study and research, and includes courses in environmental science, biology, chemistry, mathemat - ics, law, political science, and economics. Graduates will be prepared with the interdisciplin - ary skills needed for careers in sustainability to meet the growing demands in academia, business, and government. William Paterson's campus- wide solar panel installation is a dramatic and visible sign of this institution's commitment to the environment. Our solar initia - tive, with phase one completed in 2010 and phase two beginning in spring 2012, ranks among the top ten largest installations at higher education institutions in the United States. Our conversion to smart buildings via upgraded energy management systems and our use of electric maintenance vehicles has vastly reduced our total energy consumption, as well as our energy costs. In the past decade, the size of the University's physical plant has increased by 16.5 percent, while the electric energy consumption was reduced by 30 percent and natural gas consumption by 50 percent. In addition to this significant reduc - tion in carbon gas emissions, the University has saved more than $17 million over the same time period through cost avoidance. Such cost savings have allowed us to continue to deliver high quality education while minimizing the expense to our students. The University continues to vigorously pursue energy effi - ciency initiatives and educational programs with the strong support of students, faculty, administra - tors, alumni, and community leaders.William Paterson University's Commitment to Sustainability By Kathleen M.

Those who visit marvel at the beauty of the campus and its relationship to nature. The university community has long been committed to preserv - ing and enhancing the qual - ity of the environment and its facilities. A green revolving fund, established in 2009, has elevated energy efficiency and sustainabil - ity as a campus priority from the president on down. The revolving fund was ap - proved by the board of trustees that granted authorization for a \"drawing account\" of up to $5 million for energy-conservation projects across campus. This account is essentially an internal loan of institutional reserves. Energy savings from the vari - ous projects will pay off the debt (plus modest interest) and reduce overall costs for the institution, improving financial strength and helping to keeping tuition costs as low as possible. Once paid back, the funds may be used again for approved energy-savings projects. The campus has plenty of places that will benefit from the money. As a quintessential 'baby boomer' campus, most of the buildings and infrastructure were built between the years of 1963-73. These facilities have now turned 40 years of age. The infrastructure is old and dated. Tremendous energy savings are available, but WSU has never had the up-front capital to make the investments needed to capture them. This program allows the university to do so at very favor - able financing terms. In all, WSU anticipates the revolving fund will facilitate $9 million of energy-oriented capital during the seven years of its authorization. The savings have already begun with the installation of 279 solar panels on four major buildings: the student union, campus gymnasium, residence halls and an academic building with more installations planned. The campus also is replacing all interior and exterior lighting with high-efficiency fluorescents. The initiative will take three to five years and is approximately 25 percent complete. Another major upgrade under - way is to the 1.5-mile network of underground steam tunnels that are getting repairs and insulation to prevent energy loss during the transport process. Since 2006, WSU has completed many energy ef - ficiency projects that save more than 2,505,000 kilowatt hours of electricity annually. That trans - lates into an annual reduction of 3,759,000 pounds of carbon dioxide. With the aid of the revolving fund, Weber State University is committed to a 40-percent reduc - tion in carbon dioxide emissions by 2027 with the goal of becoming carbon neutral by 2050.

Because the Climate Commitment is really about meeting many individual sub- goals, here is where the classic tools of institutional research, experimentation, and operational role modeling come into play. Call on faculty, staff, and students to help with the research. At Bethany College, campus engagement is critical to data collection about greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Working under faculty guidance, three stu - dents\u2014an environmental science major and two political science majors\u2014were instrumental in producing surveys and collecting data from the registrar, build - ings and grounds, the finance office, and other departments. The students fulfilled their senior project or professional internship requirements through the survey process, and established a model for sustainability of data collec - tion in the future. Experiment. The survey was the first comprehensive analysis of greenhouse gas emissions at Bethany. We learned a few things along the way. Data collection could be improved through better and timelier use of surveys, and some data are forthcoming as collection methods are reformed. More research remains, too, in - cluding in regard to possible uses for Bethany's 1,300 acres of forest. A forest inventory might provide the answer. Overall, we learned much throughout the course of this study that reveals opportuni - ties for further experimentation to reduce GHG emissions in all areas. Be a productive, visible role model. Bethany is a proud ACUPCC signatory. In fact, I've signed twice\u2014as president of Bethany and previously at Wesley College. The opportunity for all of us through the ACUPCC is to develop realistic models that lower the carbon footprint on our campuses, to recognize our unique challenges, and, im - portantly, to communicate our progress to inspire others. Because Bethany's single largest carbon source is our coal heating plant, any research-based solution must take into account ways of reduc - ing or offsetting those primary emissions\u2014an exciting prospect that may well prove to be inspir - ing to other campuses confronted with complex pollution problems.

Student competitions and projects are no exception. Georgia Tech and its Bicycle Infrastructure Improvement Committee earned the distinction of Partner of the Year from the Atlanta Bicycle Coalition for 2011 for the addition of bike racks and lanes, a partnership enabling the sale of refurbished bikes on cam - pus and the launch of viaCycle, a bike-sharing program partly funded by a Ford Fund Grant. Founded by students and young alumni, viaCycle secured more than $200,000 in grants, prizes and contracts before its launch; it also garnered more than 200 users in just two months. The student startup Sanivation earned $40,000 from Startup Chile to develop its solar-powered latrine that removes toxins from waste in underdeveloped coun - tries and remote areas, making the waste safe to use as fertil - izer. Sanivation, which includes students from Tech's Engineers Without Borders and the Georgia Tech Research Institute, was also a finalist in Tech's annual Ideas to SERVE competition that challenges students to solve social or environmental problems and awards $10,000 in prizes to multiple recipients. Tech's Business Plan, Ideas to SERVE, and Inventure Prize competitions attract hundreds of entries each year in the realm of sustainability. Georgia Tech earned first place in creativity, presentation, and coordination, and second place overall, in the international competition \"Building the Tower of Babylon: What on Earth is Sustainability?\" Architecture students created installations made from campus recyclables to reflect the tragedy of consump - tion behavior. Tech's Solar Jackets earned first place and $5,000 in a City of Atlanta case competition for a proposal to get 50,000 electric vehicles on Atlanta's roads in two years. The Engineers for a Sustainable World chapter earned more than $2,000 from its national organization and Sun- Edison to construct a solar- powered beverage cart for use at campus events. The annual graduate student research and innovation confer - ence added $15,000 in awards for research focused on forest bioeconomy.

Photo courtesy of Georgia Tech What is the mission of the School of Global Environmental Sustainability (SoGES)? The School of Global Environmental Sustainability is an umbrella organization encompassing all environmental education and research across the eight colleges at Colorado State University (CSU). Created in 2008, the School positions CSU to address the multiple economic, environmental, and societal challenges of global sus - tainability through broad-based research, curricular, and outreach initiatives. We champion the initiative needed to meet a gap in environ - mental education at the universi - ty\u2014to ensure that every student at CSU receives at least one course, program, or experience in the en - vironment\u2014given the emerging energy, atmospheric, ecological, agricultural, and societal issues of the future. Collaboration and in - novative thinking are themes that trickle down through our research programs to support dynamic forums for engagement with new ideas and disciplines.Do you see an opportunity for all research universities to have a similar school? Yes, and some of them already have similar opportuni - ties for their students and faculty. Sustainability education is no longer just about the traditional environmental curriculum. We are integrating opportunities and learning outcomes that cover the full spectrum of problem solving that will be needed now and in the future. We need to train our students to succeed in areas that are critical to our economy as well as important to the survival of our global ecosystems. From a research perspective, the School gets faculty out of their silos to merge disciplines in a way that wasn't done a decade ago. Having expertise from dif - ferent perspectives approach a problem as a cohesive unit is the most efficient way to create real- world solutions for these critical problems.How do you see an initiative like the ACUPCC being able to accelerate the reorientation of curriculum and research to ad - dress climate and sustainability issues? The ACUPCC is highlighting many of the initiatives occurring across campuses nationwide, which is helping to spur addition - al innovation and critical thinking about how universities behave as sustainable organizations. At CSU, for example, we take pride in a three-pronged approach of creating a sustainable campus environment, educating our students, and taking our cutting- edge research and commercial - izing it where appropriate so that those products can address some of the biggest environmental chal - lenges we face. Prieto Battery, for example, is one such CSU spinoff company that could commercial - ize a non-toxic battery technology up to 1,000 times more powerful and 10 times longer lasting and cheaper than traditional batteries. The development of this technol - ogy\u2014by chemistry Professor Amy Prieto\u2014could revolutionize the transportation, communication, and energy storage industries.Colorado State University a Pacesetter in Environmental Education An interview with Diana Wall, University Distinguished Professor and Founding Director of the School of Global Environmental Sustainability FORT COLLINS, CO PRESIDENT: Anthony A.

Shortly after that decision, as Luther personnel began brainstorming ways to make the ACUPCC pledge truly institu - tional, it became apparent that the only way to do so was to inte - grate the content into our (then forthcoming) five-year strategic plan. The college did just that and, in the years since, has made significant strides toward carbon neutrality. The strategic plan recom - mendation to \"reduce Luther's carbon footprint by 50 percent,\" for example, pushed the college to not only erect a 1.6 megawatt GE wind turbine expected to generate a third of the school's annual electricity but also develop plans to power its 100-student Baker Village residential complex with a solar photovoltaic array that, when complete, will be the largest in Iowa. While among the most impactful, these are far from the only innovative steps Luther has taken to reduce its carbon footprint since 2007. Ask any of our 2,500 students about the vast variety of locally produced foods at campus eateries\u201420 percent of all food served on campus is sourced locally\u2014or the myriad energy-conserving features in Sampson Hoffland Laboratories, among the first LEED gold-certi - fied buildings in the state. These green initiatives, as well as a host of others now woven into the fab - ric of campus life, are tied to the strategic plan recommendation to \"model stewardship and sustain - ability in all college operations\" in order to reduce Luther's envi - ronmental impact and mitigate its operational costs. Likewise, the strategic plan recommendation to \"make sus - tainability a part of every student's learning experience\" spurred the development of faculty workshops on integrating sustainability into the curriculum, student intern - ships promoting green practices in the surrounding community, and a \"peer-to-peer\" program fostering sustainability literacy on campus. These are just a few of the ways Luther provides its students with the skills and knowl - edge to lead society in a more sustainable direction. In 2011 Luther was one of eight institutions to earn an \"A\" on the Sustainable Endowments Institute's College Sustainability Report Card. Though honored by this recognition, we're not about to rest on our laurels. It's our goal to be a model of sustainabil - ity\u2014not a mirror of our culture's unsustainable practices. I'm heartened by the progress we're making, but we know we still have a ways to go.From a Commitment to a Strategic Plan\u2014 Luther College's Journey Toward Carbon Neutrality By Richard L.

In its quest to make Western North Carolina (WNC) a sustain - able place to work, live, and do business, the college partners with a multitude of public and non-governmental organizations, businesses, and individuals. These relationships elevate sustainable practices on campus and in the greater community. HCC's commitment to the ACUPCC as a charter signatory in 2007 brought greater focus to its leadership in sustainability. Recognizing the importance of reducing community wide carbon emissions, it partnered with the Haywood County Chamber of Commerce to certify local businesses for their sustainable practices. The ecological devel - opment of private land gained significance when the college joined forces with Haywood County, private developers, and Region A Southwestern NC Planning and Economic Development Commission to model low impact development. The college simultaneously cre - ated an associate degree in Low Impact Development. Partnering with the US Forest Service Wood Products Research Laboratory, the college constructed the local Habitat for Humanity's first green home. This led to building a Sustainable Research Demonstration House on campus to exemplify green construc - tion practices and technologies. Other examples include wetlands and native grass reclamation projects on campus and in the community, biofuel production using recycled oil from the local public schools, installation of solar panels on campus and in the community, and training workers from a community action agency to retrofit homes of low income residents to make them more energy efficient. The college is also a leader in Code Green, an initiative to instill sustainability in North Carolina's 58 community colleges and their communities. HCC hosts many opportuni - ties such as \"Renewable Energy Demo Days\" for the public to learn about renewable energies. Local renewable energy firms inform and demonstrate the latest and most environmentally sound products available in WNC. Plus, the college recently used a grant from Advanced Energy Corporation to install an electric vehicle recharging station on campus. HCC promotes and practices sustainability across the campus and within the community.In its quest to make Western North Carolina a sustainable place to work, live, and do business, the college partners with a multitude of public and non-governmental organi - zations, businesses, and individuals.

UC Irvine knew it could do better. By 2008, the campus recog - nized that while modern labo - ratories employed direct digital controls and variable volume air delivery and exhaust, these systems had merely replicated the functions of the pneumatic systems that had been in use for 70 years, albeit with more precise control. Moreover, gains in energy efficiency design standards had plateaued. Because of this, UC Irvine opted to challenge what were then considered indus - try best practices. This coincided with the University of California's decision to become an ACUPCC signatory and the attendant need for UC Irvine to make a sizable reduction in its carbon footprint. Laboratories, which accounted for two-thirds of the energy con - sumed within Irvine's academic core, became an obvious focus, and the campus launched what was to become its Smart Labs Initiative , a comprehensive energy-savings program that has proven instrumental in safely reducing energy consumption by 50 percent in both new and retrofitted laboratories. When the campus set out to cut its laboratory energy use in half\u2014double the performance required under California's Title 24 energy efficiency standards \u2014the outcome was uncertain. Facilities engineers knew, how - ever, that it would take more than a single technology to achieve the desired savings. They developed a comprehensive program that inte - grates state-of-the-art real-time air quality sensing, reduces exhaust stack airspeeds, reduces duct and plenum airspeeds and losses, sharply reduces lighting power- density, includes efficient heat exhaust for equipment, eliminates energy-robbing HVAC acoustic attenuators, and other factors. For its efforts, UC Irvine is now receiving nationwide rec - ognition as it shares its problem- solving expertise with other campus, private-industry, and government labs. Smart Labs are a centerpiece of UCI's participa - tion in President Obama's Better Buildings Challenge, aimed at making commercial buildings 20 percent more energy efficient by 2020 and accelerating government and private-sector investment in energy efficiency. UCI is on track to show a 20 percent decrease in electrical usage from 2010 to 2012 and expects to achieve 40 percent savings on the main campus by 2020\u2014twice the President's objective.

One example is lead. Photo courtesy of Michelle S. Kim / UC Irvine Communications As an academic medical center, Upstate Medical University faces unique sustainability challenges. We have four colleges, dozens of classrooms, 350 research labs and almost 800 hospital beds among our hospitals. In addition to 9,500 employ - ees, Upstate has 1,600 students on campus. A half-million patients and visitors come through our doors each year. We never close. As a 24/7 operation, our hospi - tals account for 75% of Upstate's energy usage and solid waste generation. Upstate embraces an aggres - sive, holistic approach to sustain - ability, always with patient care and safety as the priority. We have many sustainability successes, and these behind-the- scenes innovations are good business: they save money, reduce waste and save natural resources. Here's a \"Top Five\" list of clinical innovations at Upstate: Reprocessing 40,000 single-use devices a year \u2014 compres - sion sleeves, oximetry probes, titanium clamps, tourniquet cuffs, and more. Reducing the use of polyeth - ylene wrap by 23% (60,000 wraps) from sterile storage and removing 25,000 plastic con - tainers from the waste stream. Phasing out paper records, which will save 100 tons of pa - per annually and provide faster and more accurate patient records. Using mobile computer termi - nals that accompany patients from the Emergency Room, to Admitting, to the bedside. Working with a local vendor to recycle our printer cartridges and cell phones. This diverts four tons of waste and gener - ates $18,000 a year for our children's hospital. The investment in these and other sustainability efforts saves almost $600,000 a year and diverts 95 tons from the waste stream. As we commit to reducing our carbon footprint to near zero by 2050, we'll be considering initia - tives such as \"green\" roofs, bio - swales, zip cars and car-pooling. Our vision has a human touch, of course. We espe - cially look forward to the healing garden at the Upstate Cancer Center, opening in 2013. This holistic, patient-centered approach to sustainability\u2014and everything else we do at Upstate \u2014sets us apart. It's good business. And it's even better health care.An Innovative Sustainability Strategy That Puts Patients First By David R. Smith, President and John B.

It was the right thing to do. By acknowledg - ing and taking on these complex problems, we demonstrated mean - ingful leadership to our students. Sustainability advances the agenda of all universities: the betterment of the human condition.\" Jo Ann M. Gora \"We became active in the founda - tional discussions of the ACUPCC because we realized that the impact of working together with other col - leges and institutions would be far greater than actions by individual colleges, and because we valued the opportunity to learn from the actions of others.\" David Hales \"I view global climate change as a serious threat to human well-being and the natural world. I believe uni - versities should lead in addressing this threat by educating students, serving as examples of sustain - ability, and applying their scientific expertise to causes and solutions.\" Bernard Machen \"Cape Cod Community College had been committed to environmental stewardship long before I came to the College in 1998\u2014with both the curriculum and the facilities opera - tions. Signing on to the ACUPCC was an obvious next step\u2014reaching ever farther.\" Kathleen SchatzbergWhat are your hopes and goals for the ACUPCC over the next five years? \"My hope is that more and more colleges and universities will see real reductions in carbon dioxide emissions and that more and more graduates will step forward as envi - ronmental leaders.\" Loren J. Anderson \"The ACUPCC is doing a great job of improving the environmental impact of school campuses. My hopes are that ACUPCC creates an equally strong program for improving the integration of climate change issues into the curriculum of every school.\" Gifford Pinchot III \"My hope is that current members are making significant progress so that we demonstrate our commit - ment and the power of working collectively. I would like to see more colleges and universities under - stand and embrace our leadership role in sustainability and climate action. Working collectively I would like to see the ACUPCC and higher education have a positive impact on federal policy.\" Mary Spilde \"I have three hopes for the ACUPCC. First, that the organization will move college and university presidents to provide the leadership necessary to respond to climate change and insist on a national response to this challenge. Second, that measures of sustainability have been so completely integrated into capital outlay projects and organiza - tional operations that they are now ordinary, instead of extraordinary. Third, that in our zeal, we do not commit our institutions to activities that are not fiscally or scientifically sound and as a result tarnish the efforts for climate control.\" Darroch YoungHow do you maintain both your personal and institutional drive towards sustainability? \"What we do flows out of who we are. I believe in the necessity of building a sustainable future. That belief is foundational to my personal com - mitment. ASU has embraced sus - tainability as part of our collective value system, and we incorporate our values into everything we do as we fulfill our mission.\" Michael M. Crow \"Oberlin is proud to be one of the founding signatories of the ACUPCC, and proud that Nancy Dye, my pre - decessor, made addressing climate change a focal point of our campus and town. That spirit continues today in the pioneering Oberlin Proj - ect and in our work with the Clinton Climate Initiative.\" Marvin Krislov (current President of Oberlin College) \"I maintain my drive toward sus - tainability through daily personal practice as well as introducing new programs and maintaining them at the colleges where I serve. I am currently in Shanghai, China where I lead a new college including trans - formation to a 'green' campus.\" Douglas Treadway \"Our University's commitment to sustainability speaks to the heart of our work and responsibility: to teach our lessons well, especially through the compelling force of good insti - tutional example. This commitment translates our professed values into lived ones and urges our graduates always to try to do the same.\" Paul J. ZinggThe ACUPCC's Founding Signatories The ACUPCC originated from planning sessions among a group of college and university presidents, Second Nature, ecoAmerica, and AASHE in 2006. Twelve presidents became founding signatories and launched the ACUPCC in 2007 by inviting their peers to join the initiative. Loren J.

In celebration of the ACUPCC's fifth anniversary, Second Nature re-launched the Resources & Support section of the ACUPCC website in January 2012. The website offers multiple browsing options, including topic (Climate Action Planning, Financing, Leadership, and more) and type (publications, webinars, videos, case studies, and more). Workshops & Webinars presidentsclimatecommitment.org/resources/webinars (for archived webinars) ACUPCC workshops and webinars support signatory institutions in meeting the goals of the commitment. Hundreds of individuals have taken part in these events, and countless others have accessed webinar and workshop materials archived online. Topics have included Energy Performance Contracting, Crafting Your Climate Action Plan, Sourcing Local and Sustainable Food, Climate Lit - eracy, and much more. Publications presidentsclimatecommitment.org/resources/publications Working with experts from ACUPCC institutions and partner organizations, Second Nature has developed a series of practi - cal publications addressing many of the interrelated aspects of fulfilling the goals of the Commitment. In-depth reports covering key topics such as the academic component of the commitment, organizational leadership, carbon offsets, green building, financing mechanisms, and climate adaptation are available to signatories at no cost, as are executive briefing papers on climate science, public reporting, institutionalizing sustainability, and more. Partners & Allies presidentsclimatecommitment.org/resources/partners-allies Second Nature has leveraged relationships with dozens of organiza - tions to support ACUPCC signatories. Partners and allies include: American Association of Community Colleges, AASHE, the Ameri - can Meteorological Society, American Indian Higher Education Consortium, Bioneers, Clean Air-Cool Planet, the Clinton Climate Initiative, ecoAmerica, Hispanic Association of Colleges and Uni - versities, National Association of College and University Business Officers, National Wildlife Foundation Campus Ecology Program, the R20 Regions of Climate Action, the Sustainable Endowments Institute, the United Negro College Fund, the US Green Building Council, and many others. The ACUPCC website hosts hundreds of resources that support every aspect of a signatory's journey toward fulfilling its commitment. From traditional publications and articles, a video series featuring leaders in the network, to discounts offered by partner organizations, these resources are always free to ACUPCC institutions. The ACUPCC Reporting System rs.acupcc.org For collective initiatives like the ACUPCC, public reporting ensures that institutions are fulfilling their shared commitment to one another, provides a common reporting and support framework, and contributes to the collective learning of the network and general public. The ACUPCC Reporting System was launched in January 2008. Initially developed by AASHE, the system is an online repository for signatories' Implementation Profiles, Greenhouse Gas Emissions Inventories, and Climate Action Plans. In early 2011, Second Nature assumed the management of the system and developed the Climate Action Plan Progress Report. In January 2012, the first group of signatories submitted updates on their progress to the Reporting System, further demonstrating the cumulative impact of this collective network. ( For more on the Progress Reports, see The Network's Progress & Promise, page 6. ) Peer Support presidentsclimatecommitment.org/resources/peer-support Second Nature administers several peer networks that provide more personal support in fulfilling the commitment, including: The Implementation Liaison (IL) Support Committee presidentsclimatecommitment.org/il-support-committee This committee provides peer-to-peer support to individuals re - sponsible for implementing the ACUPCC at signatory institutions. It is comprised of campus sustainability experts who are available for peer-to-peer conversations to share their experiences and ideas, leveraging the ACUPCC network to accelerate collective learning on climate solutions. Presidential Fellows presidentsclimatecommitment.org/presidentialfellows The Second Nature Presidential Fellows serve as mentors and ambassadors to support the ACUPCC. They support signatory presidents by checking in on progress, helping to identify barriers and solutions, sharing experiences, providing advice, and making strategic connections. ( See sidebar for more. ) Select Committees presidentsclimatecommitment.org/select-committees As the need arises, Second Nature convenes select committees to address the challenges and timely topics that ACUPCC signatories encounter in their fulfillment of the commitment. Since 2007, these committees have included: ACUPCC Voluntary Carbon Offset Protocol Committee Education for Climate Neutrality and Sustainability Committee Transportation Task Force Higher Education Climate Change Adaptation Committee Financing Sustainability Committee Academic CommitteeResources & Support The Presidential Fellows Program The Second Nature Presidential Fellows Program is a team of retired college and university presidents who provide support, encourage - ment, and consultation for all aspects of ACUPCC implementation. The fellows offer their experience, networks, and knowledge in order to broaden and deepen the impact of campus and community sustainability efforts. They combine an understanding of change management with executive experience, as organized around their passion for sustainability leadership. The Presidential Fellows have connected with hundreds of their colleagues across the country at conferences, via phone and email, and during campus visits, playing a key role in helping signatories fulfill their commitment and growing the network. They work closely with the ACUPCC Steering Committee and enhance Second Nature's ability to support the network in a variety of ways\u2014from designing events and fundraising, to conceptualizing new initiatives and provid - ing thought leadership in the form of books, blog posts, plenary speeches, and executive consultations on eduction for sustainability. Mitchell Thomashow Judith A. Ramaley Diana Van Der PloegEach of the 677 signatories has a public profile on the ACUPCC online Reporting System. Institutions' reporting statuses, GHG inventories, Climate Action Plans, and Progress Reports are public and freely available.42 Celebrating Five Years of Climate Leadership 43 www.presidentsclimatecommitment.orgAs corporate supporters of the American College & University Presidents' Climate Commitment, we congratulate signatories on their remarkable progress. We believe it is important for colleges and universities to provide students, faculty, and staff with a comprehensive understanding of sustainability and to demon - strate ways of sustainable living for the rest of society. Our organizations and all of society need graduates with a thorough understanding of the health, social, economic and environmental facets of sustainability for societal success. We think it is important for students in all fields of study to have a comprehensive understanding of sustainability in order to be successful and competitive in the rapidly changing global economy. We encourage all colleges and universities to become active ACUPCC participants and to implement the Commitment as quickly and comprehensively as possible. We believe that a productive partnership between the private sector and higher education is critical in helping to make this a reality and are proud to be part of this important effort. 2011-12 Corporate Program Partners (as of May 2012)Corporate Program Partners (as of May 2012) \u00ae Ameresco American Meteorological Society ARAMARK Carbon Nation ConEdison Solutions Energy System Group GreenerU Haley & Aldrich Patagonia Sur Pepco Energy Services ProFlowers Schneider Electric Staples PLATINUM GOLD SILVER Book Drives Chevron Energy Solutions Dell EYP Fenton Communications First ClimateFPL Energy Glacial Energy Greenopolis Hannon & Armstrong Interface MacGray Campus SolutionsMohawk Fine Papers Motorola Foundation Perkins & Will Sasaki Sebesta Blomberg SodexoSteelcase Sustainability: The Journal of Record Vanasse Norcross & Judd LLP Webster Industries Windstreet EnergyCorporate Partners Have Included: For information on how you can support the ACUPCC, contact Second Nature at 617-722-0036, info@secondnature.org, or visit www.presidentsclimatecommitment.org/supporters.Thanks To Supporters We are grateful to the numerous foundations, nonprofits, corporations, schools, and individuals whose generous financial support has helped make the ACUPCC a success since 2007.
