Not quite! The Master Cleanse is very specific about each ingredient and its purpose. I personally was not so much a fan of the taste, though, so I created my own recipe inspired by the Master Cleanse. I swapped the maple syrup for honey and added in some spicy ground ginger. It's recommended to do the Master Cleanse over a period of 7-10 days. This lemonade is perfect for a full cleanse or just as a detox from a heavy day of eating. It's really up to you how you make this work as part of your diet. If you're doing a full cleanse, you can have 6-12 glasses of this lemonade per day. If you're more like me, feel free to enjoy this as a refreshing drink throughout the day. How to Store Store leftover detox lemonade in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. Reheat in the microwave to warm before enjoying. Serving Suggestions This lemonade cleanse is designed to be consumed during a period of fasting; however, I also enjoy it as part of a balanced diet. If you do choose to fast, you'll want to add solid foods back in slowly so as not to upset your stomach too much. As you begin to reintroduce solid foods to your diet at the end of the cleanse, start by adding liquids like orange juice or vegetable broth. After a day or two, you can resume eating [fruits](https://www.thecookierookie.com/eating-in-season-seasonal-produce-guide/), vegetables, and salads. I like to start with a simple [grilled peach salad](https://www.thecookierookie.com/mandarin-orange-salad/). Finally, you can begin to reintroduce healthy solid foods.
