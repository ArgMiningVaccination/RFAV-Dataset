As a pediatric hospitalist, I provide care for children with diverse clinical conditions and am passionate about improving our systems of care to optimize patients' and families' hospitalization experiences. In my role as a researcher, educator and leader, my interests include: (i) providing evidence-based, patient- and family-centered clinical care, (ii) completing and disseminating research that improves our understanding of pediatric health care outcomes, quality and efficiency, particularly among vulnerable and underserved populations, and (iii) educating, mentoring, and empowering future physicians and scholars to do this same. I have experience leading qualitative, quantitative and mixed methods research. My work applying advanced statistical methods to health systems data has been recognized as the Best of Research, Innovation and Vignettes by the Society of Hospital Medicine, while my work to improve hospital-to-home transitions for children has been recognized by both the American Academy of Pediatrics Section on Hospital Medicine Research Award and the Academic Pediatric Association's Young Investigator Award. To educate and empower future physicians, nurses and advocates for children, I am involved in several national organizations and programs to share my research expertise. I am Associate Editor of the Journal of Hospital Medicine, Executive Council member of Pediatric Research in Inpatient Settings (PRIS), and Regional Co-Chair of the Academic Pediatric Association. I mentor junior faculty, fellows and residents; the work of several of my resident mentees has been recognized as the \"best in research\" in their residency cohorts. In all of my work, I aim to improve the quality of care we provide to children, and the quality of education we provide to our trainees. I.
