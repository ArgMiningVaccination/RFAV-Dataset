While most people believe that chiropractic manipulation is treatment only for the back or spine, highly trained chiropractors can also apply specialized myofascial release therapies to the soft tissues and muscles, as well as provide skilled manipulative care for shoulders, elbows, hands, wrists, hips, ankles, and feet. [At Complementary Medicine Consultants, our highly trained chiropractor will utilize several methods of manipulative therapy and can accommodate your concerns and special needs. We are well aware that the solution to your condition may require the use of methods that do not require manipulation at all. Just because we specialize in chiropractic methods does not mean that we do not understand what our patients need most. That is why we offer a multi-specialty clinic with multiple treatment options from a team of professional health care providers. You will get specialized treatment designed for your healthcare needs!](https://complementarymedicineconsultants.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/chiropractic-in-lakewood-colorado-425.jpg) Quite simply, chiropractic medicine is mechanical therapy for mechanical problems.
