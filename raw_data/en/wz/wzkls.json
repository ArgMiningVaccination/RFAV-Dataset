J Burgess, Norwich - Does any medicine work? And does not 80% of illness become cured without any treatment. Matt , New York, USA - I was saddened to learn that homeopathy doesn't work. Our dog has suffered from car sickness since the day we brought her home from the RSPCA. Tablets from the vet made her groggy but didn't stop her emptying the contents of her stomach. A friend recommended a homeopathic remedy which we now give her before each journey, and no more sickness. Now how do I tell her that it doesn't work and it's obviously been all in her mind? Caroline Dearden, York - If 'water memory' is real then it should apply to all soluble chemicals, not just those with medicinal effects. All experimental sources of error such as the placebo effect can therefore be eliminated by studying a simple system where clear-cut effects are visible. I took a blue dye and diluted it 10-fold. Its absorbance of light also decreased 10-fold. Therefore, no memory of the dye molecules was impressed on the water. If homeopathy only works for medicines, then an alternative explanation than water memory needs to be found. Tim Vickers, Dundee, UK - Yes there is - the results of all the homeopathic medicine provings over the past 200 years are recorded in the volumes of books called Materia Medica. If you want the proof for yourself and you are feeling brave and perhaps foolish then do a proving. Buy a bottle of Belladona 30c and take a dose (one tablet) and wait an hour or so to see if you get a fever, if not repeat several times until you do so. A note of warning - stop as soon as you start to get any symptoms or strange sensations as Belladona is known to cause hot, pulsating headaches with a high fever. It is antidoted by string coffee and camphor. If these fail to relieve then visit a homeopath. Greg Meanwell, Totnes UK - Absolutely none. There is no evidence whatsoever that homeopathy works because it doesn't. It doesn't have a mechanism of action and if it did work, it would be quite easy to prove via double blind trials. If the concept of increased strength by dilution worked, all water in a lake or from the tap would have the magical powers of fish poop. It's foolish and illogical. No. It doesn't do anything except make people money. Ben Wood, Chicago USA - You could have saved a lot of time and energy by writing Is there any proof homeopathic medicine works. No! Mike, Birkenhead - First look at: TED website for video \"Ben Goldacre: What doctors don't know about the drugs they prescribe\" I have been having homeopathy medication since childhood. It has been particularly found to be effective in coughs and colds; healing of wounds; headaches; breathing problems; skin problems; many categories/types of pain sensations that allopathic medicine does NOT document to even the slightest degree. I have \"very sparingly\" had painkillers or other common allopathic medication in the last 35 years of my life which , like any other man, has not been totally free from illnesses or ailments from time to time. Homeopathy IS effective. It is not just a hoax. It is being administered and consumed by many. Our approach is generally wrong in understanding subtle medications, as we are incorrectly depending on \"measuring\" their effects by physical machines/methods, instead of making mass comparisons on how people switched to homeopathy when allopathy did not owe results- and how it has worked. It is well known that how medical councils around the world have been dismissing alternative medicine. It is just like trying to measure \"bliss\" (not just happiness). Bliss can be measured only by reduction/absence of \"non-bliss\" symptoms and not by conventional methods. Do not talk about physics, as its laws are ever-changing/in flux. Take nano technology for instance, take the emergence of even more smaller sub-atomic particles very recently discovered. Remember, the material world is all 99% space and pure energy, and our perception of \"matter\" or \"mass\" is just due to the limitations of resolution level of our senses. You can validate this by atomic physics texts and know that 99% or more of the volume occupied by a molecule or even an atom IS empty space !! Utk, Delhi India - I firstly would like to commend J. Burgess from Norwich on his very detailed and clear explanation. Well articulated. I've been given homeopathic medication that is supposed to be taken for 6 months, and it's 2 months now and I have yet to feel the difference. However, I have been told that the recovery process is slow with these medicines (which is why my dosage runs till 6 months!), mainly because of the diluted content. I think the medication I was given (white balls of sugar with a little the chemical medicine). Anyway - I will report closer to the date or when I start noticing improvements. Monica, India Australia - Homeopathy does work. those who say it doesn't can not think beyond molecules or atoms. Navin, Kanpur, India - It seems the main aggressors and skeptics in this argument are people from Commonwealth systems and the U.K., ah ever the arrogant and obnoxious British people are.
