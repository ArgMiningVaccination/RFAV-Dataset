Compassionate and wise listeners. They have many different approaches of healing. This is a Must visit. Be open and say all what you feel like saying and I am sure that you will end up feeling great and healed, just like how do I feel right now. - 10/29/2018 This was my first time here and Sonbol i have to say it, she is amazing, every word she said about the well being, about LIFE, about the body was so real and amazing, i learnt a lot with her, the cupping was great, i tought that it would hurt but it didn't I enjoyed so much, the acupunture was nice it did not hurt at all, if you haven't tried yet, i recommend it very much. Life is short enjoy it, and relax the body, you only have one. - 6/15/2020 Dr. Sonbol is a truly amazing, gifted healer. I've been to many other acupuncturists for the back pain I have from an old injury, but none have been able to relieve the pain except for Dr. Sonbol. My daily pain went away for a good 3 months after just one session. She takes plenty of time to understand the complete picture of your health, both physically and emotionally. Just scheduled another appointment and am so happy I found her! - 2/21/2019 I truly appreciate Dr. Sonbol's insight, intuition and expertise in her methods of treatment, and am grateful to be in her care on my journey to healing, health and wellness. I highly recommend her to anyone who desires to get to the root of any illness, you'll be in good hands! - 5/17/2016 Dr. Sonbol is a compassionate and joyous healer. There is no equivalent in Western medicine for what she does. From looking at my skin and feeling the energy in different points in my body, she was able to tell me in shocking detail what I have been thinking and feeling. (And my boyfriend went the same day and she told him completely different (and still accurate) things from what she told me.) Minutes into the treatment I started wishing all of my loved ones could see her. She finds the emotional roots to your issues and helps you heal from there using acupuncture, massage, dietary and herbal remedies, and sharing a world view that in the west we might think of as \"therapy\" or \"life coaching\" but is even more all-encompassing and profound. Her compassion and empathy go beyond a \"good bedside manner.\" I never felt at all rushed or judged and asked all the questions I needed. I was new to acupuncture and have always been a baby about needles but they are not a big deal and are totally worth giving yourself a chance to heal. You are draped with towels just like a massage at a spa. I truly recommend Dr. Sonbol if you feel stuck in heartbreak, fear, anger and/or are concerned about health issues. You don't have to settle for a limited perspective and you don't have to go it alone. - 6/26/2017 I started seeing Dr. Sonbol about two months ago. I see her regularly to maintain excellent health and recover from a minor health issue. Well, she is amazing and worth everything that I was told when I was referred to her. I will continue to see her on a regular basis to maintain optimal health. Prior to my initial visit I was unsure about acupuncture, but now I'm completely sold!! Much better than going to a western doctor and being offered medication to heal an issue, but causes other issues. Dr. Sonbol heals naturally from within. Thank you for your help and I look forward to the best years ahead. - 3/22/2018 I was in town from Chicago and had been suffering from systemic pain for about a year. I had been on a path of self healing and I believe that the flow of life led me right to Dr. Sonbol's door. She addressed emotional blockages and did some INCREDIBLE work on me. Open your heart to this woman and she will heal your body and spirit. I truly love her and am incredibly grateful that I found her - 2/6/2019 I visited Dr. Sonbol twice during a recent visit to LA. I've had several acupuncture treatments in the past, and Dr. Sonbol is exceptional. She is wise and compassionate, and very skilled as a healer. I'm grateful for all the time and careful attention she gave me. - 6/17/2015 Dr Sonbol is an incredible woman with a vast knowledge in herbal medicine from many different regions. She has been so helpful to me over the last 6 months and I will continue to keep seeing her as needed. I have dealt with a lot of extra mucus/phlegm in my body (damp) and she has educated me on foods to avoid and foods that will help me to get rid of the extra mucus lingering in my body. She has helped me with other issues along the way as well, body pains from exercise or past injuries, dealing with stress or anxiety, feminine issues and she really does have a sixth sense about what's going on in your body - inside and out. If you're looking for an acupuncturist in the Los Angeles area this is definitely the one to see. She is such a blessing in my life. It's so nice that she works out of two locations as well, one on the east side and one on the west side. She also has a masseuse at each location so after you finish your acupuncture treatment you get a relaxing massage. Again, I can't say enough good things about Dr. Sonbol. She is incredibly talented at what she does and her years of experience are obvious in her practice. - 9/17/2016 Dr. Sonbol is amazing. Since seeing her, my entire life has turned around. When I first saw her I was very depressed. She opened up chakras that were completely blocked, and I've reconnected with my mission. I know have a clear direction and I am back in school and following my dreams. She is so wise, you can't help but benefit from her work, which is very multifaceted and comprehensive. I highly recommend her.
