UC IRVINE - 1972-1973UCI ~972~73/GENERAl CATAlOGUE JNIVERSITY OF CAliFORNIA, IRVINE UC IRVINE - 1972-19732 \"It is obvious that the landscape of Orange County is changing rapidly. With increasing speed the old face of the land is taking on a new look. Within a lifetime the Orange County scene has changed from a quiet countryside to a bustling complex of communities. Only fifty years ago there was much that fused with the early days of Spain and Mexico. The music of the Spanish language was an overtone in daily conversation. The highways were dusty roads, cities were little more than villages, much of the land was undisturbed by cUltivation, the air was brilliant or was washed by clean, white fog. The mountains were not scarred by roads nor fire-breaks, and canyons were filled with wild grapes and alder trees growing along rocky streams that seemed to flow indefinitely. But now the language is a patter of American English, the roads are swathed in concrete, the roofs of cities almost touch each other, the mountains are cross-hatched with access roads, the canyons are paved streets, and rainfall is channeled into cement ditches. The old Paisano does not weep over the changing landscape, but nostalgia does give it a golden aura. \"Every day new Paisanos are coming to Orange County. In the old days before the American flag waved over California, people who migrated to the country for new opportunities and a good way of living were called Paisanos in contrast to the Militarios who came on indefinite tours of duty. The Paisano built his home, raised his family, and influenced the destiny of the land. As families grew and new generations changed the landscape, a deep understanding and love of country developed. With a knowledge of the past, a happiness in the present, and a confidence in the future, the Paisano found life a satisfying experience. For the new Paisano the days of the past are recorded, the present is illuminated, and the future will develop from aspira\u00ad tions and dreams.\" -Don Meadows, Orange County under Spain, Mexico and the United States (separately published from The Historical Volume & Reference Works by Dawson's Book Shop, Los Angeles, 1966), p. 25. Don Meadows is a prominent Orange County historian and author. Over the years he has amassed one of the finest private collections of historical mater\u00ad ials on Southern California and on Baja California in existence. This collec\u00ad tion contains over 3500 volumes, some of them rare and\u00b7 valuable titles from the 18th and 19th centuries, manuscripts, maps, newspapers and periodicals, photographs, and many thousands of pieces of printed ephemera -pamph\u00ad lets, brochures, programs, clippings - yesteryear's throwaways of every kind. The UCI Library recently purchased the Meadows Collection, considerably strengthening its position as a major resource for local and regional historical research. ' UCI came to Orange County ten years ago. Since that time it has made a significant impression on the character of the area, both physically and intei\u00ad lectually, and it will continue to play a major role in shaping the future of the County. As we plan for the future, it is fitting that we take the time to under\u00ad stand the roots of our community. To help in this understanding, we have illustrated this issue of the UCI General Catalogue with certain materials from UC IRVINE - 1972-19733 Don Meadows and his wife Frances in their library. Photo Mike Jones the Meadows Collection which specifically relate to the history of Orange County. We have made no attempt to be comprehensive or even chronologi\u00ad cal; rather, we have selected vignettes which we found particularly intriguing or which seemed to reflect the special character of this part of California. Two people have been invaluable in the preparation of this illustrative mater\u00ad ial: Roger Berry, UCI special collections librarian and curator of the Meadows Collection, and Don Meadows, to whom the catalogue is dedicated. We wish to thank them both for their enthusiastic assistance in this project.

UC IRVINE - 1972-19735 INTRODUCTION This catalogue contains general administrative and academic information as well as specific descriptions of schools and departments and the courses of\u00ad fered in each. The first section contains information about the University and the Irvine campus in particular. The second section, Academic Plan, contains specific details about the academic structure of UCI, obtaining a degree, choosing a major, academic advising, and miscellaneous pre-professional and educational programs. The next three sections cover Student Affairs and Admissions and Policies, and the Graduate Division. The major part of the catalogue contains information describing the various schools, departments within the schools, Interschool Curricula, University Studies, and Professional Education, as well as the programs of study and courses offered in each. Because this catalogue must be prepared well in advance of the year it covers, changes in some programs will inevitably occur. The quarterly \"Schedule of Courses\" is the final authority in regard to classes offered and instructors; this publication is available from the Registrar's Office shortly before enrollment begins each quarter. Course Listings: It is particularly important to note that some courses listed are not necessarily offered each year and a course has no prerequisites unless noted. Admission to UCI does not guarantee admission to any particular course. The letters F, W, or S after the course number and title indicate which quarter(s) the course will be offered: fall, winter, or spring. (Although this catalogue is not intended to include Summer Session courses, a few are listed which complement particular programs; these are indicated by the word \"summer.\") The \"(1)\" or \"(1-1-1)\" designation following the course title indicates the course credi.t toward the 45 courses (180 quarter units) needed to graduate. Each \"1\" represents one quarter course worth four quarter units. Courses that may be repeated for credit contain wording to that effect in the descript\u00ad ive writeup.

Pio Pico, last Mexican governor of California, sold the San Juan Capistrano Mission lands to his brother-in-law, Juan Forster, in 1845. While visiting Forster, Pico ate a peach which he found so exceptional that he planted the pit. It grew into this tree, which remained on the Mission grounds until 1930. Back: Acu, a Luiseiio Indian who was the bell-ringer at the Sanjuan Capistrano Mission. UC IRVINE - 1972-1973UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA 11 UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA The promise of a University of California is contained in the State's Consti\u00ad tution, drafted in Monterey in the gold rush year of 1849. In 1853 Congress bestowed upon the State 46,000 acres of public lands with the stipulation that proceeds of the sale of the land were to be used for a \"seminary of learn\u00ad ing.\" The Morrill Act of 1862 gave another grant of public lands to the State for the establishment of a college to teach agriculture and the mechanic arts. The College of California, incorporated in 1855 under the leadership of the Reverend Henry Durant, offered its buildings and lands to the State in 1867 on condition that a \"complete university\" be created to teach the humanities as well as agriculture, mining, and mechanics. The legislature accepted, and on March 23, 1868-Charter Day-Governor H.H. Haight signed the act that created the University of Californi_a. From its beginning in Berkeley, the University of California has grown to total nine campuses: Berkeley, Davis, Irvine, Los Angeles, Riverside, San Die\u00ad go, San Francisco, Santa Barbara, and Santa Cruz. The University also main\u00ad tains research stations, field stations, and Extension centers in more than 80 locations throughout California. Public services include medical and dental clinics, information services for agriculture, and a broad program of continu\u00ad ing education for adults in the arts, business, and the professions. The University of California leads all institutions in the world in the number of Nobel Laureates on its faculty. It also has more members of the National Academy of Sciences than any other University and more than 500 recipients of Guggenheim Fellowship Awards. Its library is ranked with the best in the nation in quality and in the size of its collections. Student enrollment has reached 110,000. Of this number, about 90% are residents of California, while the remainder come from other states of the nation and from about 100 foreign countries. University Administration The \"full powers of organization and government\" of the University ar~ en\u00ad trusted by the State Constitution to the twenty-four member Board of Re\u00ad gents. Sixteen members are appointed to sixteen-year terms by the Governor; eight are members ex officio. The Regents Designate are alumni who will succeed to an ex officio position on the Board of Regents upon assuming the office of President of the Alumni Association of the University of California. Most of the appointed Regents also serve as trustees, consultants, directors, or advisors to other educational or cultural institutions, or to business organiza\u00ad tions, and several of them hold UC degrees. All of the Regents are involved in public service or civic activities in addition to their service to the University of California. UC IRVINE - 1972-197312 UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA The President is the executive head of the total University, appointed by and responsible to The Regents, with full authority and responsibility over the administration of all affairs and operations. Each campus is administered by a Chancellor responsible for its operation. In determining the University's edu\u00ad cational and research policies, the President consults with the Chancellors and with the Academic Senate, which is composed of the faculty and certain ad\u00ad ministrative officers. The Academic Senate authorizes all courses of instruc\u00ad tion in the academic and professional schools and colleges. Processes for stu\u00ad dent participation in policy-making exist at several administrative levels. The University Office of Relations with Schools serves as a liaison between the University of California and the other educational systems of the state. It is the spokesman for the University insofar as its educational policies affect the high schools and junior colleges from whence its students come. The staff is also available as a resource to schools and education-oriented groups. A. H.

UC IRVINE - 1972-1973THE IRVINE CAMPUS 13 THE IRVINE CAMPUS The University of California, Irvine is located in Orange County, 40 miles south of Los Angeles and three miles inland from the Pacific Ocean. The surrounding hills and grazing lands give the campus a rural feeling, even though an estimated two million people live within a 20-mile radius. A total campus area of 1,510 acres is intended to allow for ample open space and is an integral part of the similarly planned City of Irvine. The buildings will radiate outward in concentric circles from a large central park; the inner circle is now al\u00ad most complete. UCI maintains the adjacent San Joaquin Freshwater Marsh, a 200-acre University-owned refuge for waterfowl and wildlife. Classes opened in October 1965 with 1,589 students, freshmen through post\u00ad doctoral. In the fall of 1971, 6,885 students were enrolled: 5,360 undergraduates, 915 graduates, and 610 students, interns, and residents in the College of Medicine. Enrollment is projected to an eventual student population of 27,500. The majority of students live off campus and commute daily, and most are depen\u00ad dent on cars for transportation. Student parking permits are valid for parking lots ).ocated on the perimeter of-the campus. Students with or without cars can benefit from the services provided by the computerized car pool system and the share-a\u00ad ride station. A continuing effort is being made to provide the campus with conven\u00ad ient bus service. A restaurant, cafeteria, snack bars, and vending machines provide food service on campus. The preliminary town center across from the gateway en\u00ad trance to campus consists of a single building which contains general services (a bank, malt shop, beer garden, market, travel bureau, post office, book store, and an interfaith center). Beaches abou~ three miles to the west are lined by communities and State Park recreation areas. Two mountain ranges and popular desert resort spas are within a two-hour drive. The climate is usually warm and dry; there is frequently a breeze from the ocean a,nd occasional\u00b7fog. University Relations For further information about the Irvine campus contact the University Relations Office, which is responsible for public information, publications, University and community relations, gifts\u00b7 and endowments, alumni relations, public ceremonies, campus tours, the Speakers Bureau, and liaison with support organizations: The Friends of UCI, Friends of the UCI Library, UCI Town and Gown, Big I Boosters, the UCI Foundation, Oceanology Associates, UCI Public Relations Council, UCI Industrial Associates, the UCI Alumni Association, the UCI Parents Organization, the Associated Alumni of the UCI-California College of Medicine, and the UCI Medical Faculty Wives. UC IRVINE - 1972-197314 THE IRVINE CAMPUS Activities and Recreation The Associated Students of the University of California, Irvine (ASUCI) was orga\u00ad nized by and for the Irvine campus student body to give focus to student participa\u00ad tion and activities. From the activities fee which the student body voted to levy against itself, the ASUCI organizes lectures, concerts, community projects, and many other activities administered by elected student representatives. Academic departments often bring guest lecturers of general interest to the cam\u00ad pus. The School of Fine Arts, which also administers the Committee for Arts and Lectures, frequently offers presentations in art, dance, concert, film, and theatre. \u00b7 Recreational facilities on campus include a gymnasium, swimming pool, tennis courts, handball courts, basketball courts, a baseball stadium, a track, and expansive playing fields. A comprehensive intramural sports program has been developed for students, faculty, and staff. Intercollegiate Athletics UCI competes in intercollegiate athletics as an independent institution in the col\u00ad lege division of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA). Irvine fields teams in 10 sports: baseball, basketball, crew, cross country, golf, sailing, swim\u00ad ming, tennis, track, and water polo. The water polo team won the NCAA champi\u00ad onship in 19 7 0 beating UCLA in the finals and last year finished seventh in the country. The UCI swimming team won NCAA titles in 1969, 1970 and 1971, and the tennis team won national titles the past two seasons. Basketball has competed in three regional playoffs and baseball has advanced to the Far West Regionals twice. Irvine's crew and sailing teams consistently rank high in intercollegiate com\u00ad petition on the West Coast, and the golf program has also been very successful. All\u00ad American honors have been awarded to over 40 UCI athletes. Athletics is under the administrative leadership of the Vice Chancellor -Student Affairs. INSTRUCTIONAL AND RESEARCH FACILITIES University Library The University Library is a rapidly growing and increasingly important resource for teaching and research with a collection of more than 500,000 volumes and a cur\u00ad rent subscription list of more than 7,000 journals and serials. The collection is housed in a functional building designed to bring students and books together. With the exception of materials housed in the Department of Special Collections and reserve books in heavy demand, all periodicals and books are on open shelves and are easily accessible to all readers. Reference books, numbering about 10,000 vol\u00ad umes, including bibliographies, encyclopedias, handbooks, dictionaries, and in\u00ad dexes, are arranged in an open shelf collection. There are librarians in the Reference Department to assist in finding information and in using the reference tools. Infor\u00ad mal instruction in the use of collections is available at any of the public service desks. A magnetic tape cassette player containing a twelve minute self-guided tour of the library may be borrowed at the Circulation Desk. Special facilities and staff are provided for the Government Publications Depart\u00ad ment, which contains a collection of over 135,000 documents issued by the federal government, state, local, and foreign governments, and international organizations. The library's Department of Special Collections houses a collection of rare books, local history materials, and the official university archives. UC IRVINE - 1972-1973TilE IRVINE CAMPUS 15 The Women's Christian Temperance Union, posing in front of a Baptist church in Orange. The library copying service, supplemented by coin-operated copying machines, makes it possible to obtain reproduction service at all times. Microtext materials and v~ious types of reading equipment are brought together in special facilities. Other special facilities include group study rooms, a piano room for reviewing musi\u00ad cal scores housed in the library's stacks, a map collection, and a room containing special facilities for blind and partially-sighted students. When the University is in session, the library is open 86 hours per week. Two branch libraries, the Physical Sciences Library and the Biological Sciences Library, are located in the Physical Sciences Building and in the Science Lecture Hall. More than 900 current periodical titles are held in each library. Hours of ser\u00ad vice are the same as the General Library, and copying service is furnished in both branches. In addition, a combined library for the Museum of Systematic Biology and the Center for Pathobiology is located in the Center for Pathobiology in Stein\u00ad haus Hall. A medical collection of over 60,000 volumes is available in Medical Surge Building II. Bus service to UCLA is offered Monday through Saturday for students who need material not held in the UCI Library. Interlibrary loan service is available to the faculty and graduate students. For a more comprehensive description of library services and procedures consult the Library Handbook, copies of which may be obtained at the Circulation Desk. Center for Pathobiology The Center for Pathobiology is an organized research unit established within the School of Biological Sciences to enhance the teaching programs and the research activities of its twenty-five participating research workers, including faculty mem\u00ad bers, undergraduate and graduate students, and postdoctoral scientists. The Center provides a focus for many activities in the School of Biological Sciences: notably, developmental biology, pathobiology, and environmental biology as it relates to pest control and pollution. Development of totally new strategies for controlling UC IRVINE - 1972-197316 THE IRVINE CAMPUS insect pests with insect growth regulators and by genetic techniques is one of its primary goals. Another major goal is the analysis of normal and pathological devel\u00ad opment of insects and other invertebrates by genetic and biochemical techniques. In its role as an informational and research unit, the Center maintains two compre\u00ad hensive and current reprint collections -an invertebrate pathology collection and an insect development and genetic collection -which are accessible to workers throughout the world. Center publications include bibliographies and research reports. Computing Center The Computer Facility provides concurrent interactive and batch computing service on two medium size, general purpose systems. The distinctive aspect of computing at UCI is the extent to which it is an integral part of the academic programs at both tlie undergraduate and graduate levels. Approximately 40% of the student body was involved with some form of instructional computing last year, the majority using an interactive terminal. Many programming languages and library programs, such as statistical routines, are available to users. Computing instruction is offered by the Department of Informa\u00ad tion and Computer Science, other academic departments, and University Extension. . ~ Information about computing services is available from the User Services Group, 360 Computer Science Bu,ilding. The Irvine Arboretum The Irvine Arboretum is administered by the School of Biological Sciences and in\u00ad cludes plans for a botanic garden which will encompass the entire campus. A num\u00ad ber of plant houses and other controlled environment facilities will be constructed; several are already in operation. Museum of Systematic Biology The Museum of Systematic Biology, administered by the School of Biological Sci\u00ad ences, is a teaching and research facility. It presently contains material on local populations of fishes, plants, insects, and mammals. Several important collections, notably the Sprague conchological collection, are housed in the Museum. Public Policy Research Organization The Public Policy Research Organization conducts policy-oriented research as a University-wide institution located on the Irvine campus. The basic objectives of \"PPRO\" are to initiate and conduct interdisciplinary re\u00ad search programs relevant to current and future public problems, to carry out such research projects for government agencies as will enhance its basic research pro\u00ad gram, and to participate in the development of training programs in the field of policy research and analysis. Current interests of PPRO include design of a survey of. community mental health centers; an an\u00b7alysis of demographic, economic, and educational trends in the UCI \u00b7 area; design of improved gaming and simulation capabilities for UC; compilation of\u00b7 an annotated bibiiography on the subject of women at work; operation of a syndi- . cated newspaper column presenting scientific inform.ation to children. Graduate assistantships will be available for qualified students in any school or department of UCI who desire experience in policy research and analysis.

Back: Program notes from a 1922 performance of the Orange County Symphony Orchestra. UC IRVINE - 1972-1973THE ACADEMIC PLAN 19 THE ACADEMIC PlAN Important to Irvine's overall academic concept is recognition that a university pro\u00ad vides an environment for learning which goes beyond the regular work of formal courses. Much depends upon a student's own initiative -on how fully he takes advantage of opportunities which come to him through suggestions for further study, through informal connections with faculty and other students, and through all the accidents of association to be found in academic life. A student's academic program will naturally include specific course work and a major emphasis of some kind, but no program at UCI is designed to create narrow technical competency. Emphasis is placed on a coherent program stressing individ\u00ad ual needs, including studies distributed among a number of fields which are often interdisciplinary in nature. A university education should provide the student with ways to generalize from it to the changing conditions he will find, or will create for himself, upon graduation. Above all, the student's collective university experience should give him a particular set of insights which will become the basis for his intellectual identity. ACADEMIC STRUCTURE Central to the academic structure are the five basic schools: Biological Sciences, Fine Arts, Humanities, Physical Sciences, and Social Sciences. Each school is head\u00ad ed by its own dean, and four of the five contain departments, each having its own chairman. All of the schools stress interdisciplinary work in one way or another. In order to provide for interdisciplinary programs in areas of study which overlap two or more of the major academic units, the \u00b7academic structure includes the Council for lnterschool Curricula. Comparative Culture (which involves American studies and ethnic studies), Social Ecology, and Information and Computer Science are units within the Council. These are regular degree programs. Like all other pro\u00ad grams on the campus, however, they accept students whose areas of concentration are in some other field. University Studies, an interdisciplinary program of courses for freshmen, operates independently of the schools and the Council for Interschool Curricula. Physical Education is also separate. Neither of these offers a degree. Professional schools on the campus include the School of Engineering, which offers undergraduate and graduate degree programs, the Graduate School of Administra\u00ad tion, and the College of Medicine. There is also a Program in Teacher Education. Graduate studies at Irvine are administered by the Graduate Division, but all gradu\u00ad ate programs and faculty operate within the regular departments. There is no separ\u00ad ate graduate faculty. Graduate study, therefore, takes place within the schools and UC IRVINE - 1972-197320 THE ACADEMIC PLAN is related to undergraduate work within the departments. Most research on the cam\u00ad pus is conducted at the departmental level and thus is also contained within the schools. The Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs has administrative responsibility for all programs in instruction and research. Matters of educational policy, including ap\u00ad proval of programs, courses, and grades, are the responsibility of the Irvine Division of the Academic Senate and its committees. The Irvine Division is part of the Aca\u00ad demic Senate of the University of California and includes all faculty members. For further information on the administration of the entire University of California system, see page 11.

Satisfactory completion of a college level course in United States History and one in United States Government. *The American History and Institutions examination, administered by the History Department and the School of Social Sciences, is given twice a year. Students should contact the History Department for further information about the dates, place, and subject matter of the examination. UC IRVINE - 1972-1973REQUIREMENTS FOR BACHELOR'S DEGREE 23 UCI Requirements 3. Breadth requirement* (the \"6-3-3 requirement\"). Rather than prescribing specif\u00ad ic courses or areas, the faculty simply states that a given portion of a student's course work should be in areas outside his major. This requirement may be met by taking course work in three schools (Schools of Biological Sciences, Fine Arts, Humanities, Physical Sciences, or Social Sciences) or, by petition, work in Interschool Curricula programs (Comparative Culture, Information and Comput\u00ad er Science, Social Ecology), in Engineering, or in undergraduate courses taught in the Graduate School of Administration, outside the school of the student's major, as follows: A student must take six courses in one school outside his major and three courses in each of two other schools outside his major. (Changes may be made in the UCI breadth requirements too late to be inCluded in the 1972-1973 catalogue. New students should consult their advisors to determine whether such changes will affect their academic programs.) 4. Credit for 45 courses (180 quarter units), earned by examination, by other. eval\u00ad uation, or course work. (A course normally offers four quarter units of credit.) 5. A grade average of at least C. 6. Credit for the last three quarters of work immediately preceding graduation earned in residence on the Irvine campus (i.e., a minimum of one year full-time attendance at UCI). An exception to this rule is allowed in the case of students enrolled in the Education Abroad Program, who may be allowed to complete nine of the last 22 courses, including the final three courses, in residence. Proficiency in English and Foreign Languages Beyond the general English requirement (\"Subject A,\" described on p. 22), there are no general course requirements in English composition for students at UCI. Although there are no general requirements in foreign languages for students at UCI, some departments do have requirements; see below. Students considering graduate education should bear in mind that the ability to read one or more foreign languages is a requirement of most graduate schools. SCHOOL AND DEPARTMENT At: REQUIREMENTS The following school and departmental requirements for the Bachelor's Degree are in addition to the University requirements listed above. Some schools do not have school requirements; in these cases, a student majoring in one of these schools sim\u00ad ply has to fulfill the University and the departmental requirements. The University, school, and departmental requirements may overlap. That is, courses taken to fulfill a school or departmental requirement (e.g., the physics course requirement in the School of Biological Sciences) may also help fulfill the University breadth require\u00ad ment. *The breadth requirement does not apply to students majoring in the School of Engineering. UC IRVINE - 1972-197324 REQUIREMENTS FOR BACHELOR'S DEGREE The student should have determined his area of concentration no later than the beginning of the junior year, having made certain that he has the background and the preparation necessary to accomplish junior and senior work in his major.

Scientific Breadth Requirement: A total of six additional 4-or 5-unit courses cho\u00ad sen from the offerings of the Departments of Mathematics and Physics and the School of Biological Sciences. (These may be taken on a Pass/Not Pass basis subject to the usual restrictions on Pass/Not Pass enrollment.) Mathematics- One year of calculus (Mathematics 2A-B-C or equivalent); 12 upper\u00ad division or graduate courses in mathematics including Mathematics 120A-B-C or equivalent and Mathematics 140A-B-C or equivalent; three additional courses in chemistry, mathematics, physics, or information and computer science; three years of high school study or one year of college study in French, German, or Russian (in extraordinary circumstances a student may satisfy this requirement by passing a special examination administered by the Department of Mathematics); an overall grade point average of 2.3 or higher in mathematics courses. The requirements for the Bachelor's Degree in Mathematics apply to freshmen en\u00ad tering UCI in 1970-1971 and thereafter. All other students are subject only to the requirements in force at UCI at the time in which they became freshmen; however, no students are required to take more than one year of a foreign language. \u00b7 Physics- Physics 5A-B-C-D-E with laboratory; six quarter courses numbered be\u00ad tween 110 and 149; two quarters of advanced laboratory (Physics 151-153); Mathematics 2A-B-C; Mathematics 3A-B-C particularly recommended; and three additional upper-division courses .chosen from the Schools of Physical Sciences, Biological Sciences, Engineering, or, the Department of Information and Computer Science.

All students who satisfy the above requirements will receive a degree in social science. If students elect to concentrate in a subfield, certification is normally based on the results of a Graduate Record Examination in a discipline. UC IRVINE - 1972-197328 REQUIREMENTS FOR BACHELOR'S DEGREE School of Engineering The UCI breadth requirement, described on page 23, does not apply. The basic undergraduate program in Engineering consists of the Engineering core (Engineering lOOA-B-C, lOlA-B-C, and 105A-B-C), six additional Engineering courses, six mathematics courses, eight courses in basic science, one course in com\u00ad puter science, nine breadth courses, three technical elective courses, and three free elective courses. The manner in which the student selects the unspecified courses determines the option or area of concentration. At the present there are five desig\u00ad nated: Electrical, Civil and Environmental, Mechanical, and General Engineering, and Environmental Management (multiple major). For details see page 263. Interschool Curricula Comparative Culture All majors (except for transfer students who may be granted waivers for courses where appropriate) must satisfactorily complete: (1) Comparative Culture lA-B, Man in Cultural Perspective, by the end of the sophomore year; (2) Comparative Culture 10, Introduction to Culture Study (at least two of several distinct culture surveys- African, American, Asian, Black, Chicano), by the end of the sophomore year; (3) 48 units of courses offered outside of Comparative Culture, upon advise\u00ad ment; (4) 24 units in language or equivalent courses; (5) 48 units in Comparative Culture courses, from any one of the following options: (a) Plan A focuses on ethnic/cultural studies and entails upper-division work in African, American, Asian, \u00b7Black, Chicano and/or Latin American cultures; (b) Plan B focuses on disciplinary or interdisciplinary methodologies such as upper-division courses in aesthetics, an\u00ad thropology, economics, history, literature, political science and/or sociology; (c) Plan C involves a contract -made at the\u00b7 end of the sophomore year -between the individual student and the Comparative Culture Major Committee. The contract will specify an individualized curriculum revolving around a particular theme, topic, or problem in cross-cultural and/or interdisciplinary culture study. All students entering the Program in the freshman year will take the Core Course, Comparative Culture lA-B, plus 12 units of lower-division work; and they would be well advised to fulfill the language requirement or equivalent during the first two \u00b7years of study. Information and Computer Science Mathematics 2A-B-C and two of the following one-year sequences in mathematics: 3, 140, 155, 120, 121, 130, 131, 170; Information and Computer Science 1, 2, 3, llOA-B, 120A-B, 130A-B, 190A-B-C. These requirements are under study and may be changed in the future. Students should consult the Departmental Information Bulletin, issued in fall 1972, for a complete listing of courses and subject content. Social Ecology Social Ecology lA-B-C;.Social Ecology 10; the appropriate prerequisites for the field study paths undertaken (these prerequisites are numbered Social Ecology 2 through 8); six quarter courses of Field Study (Social Ecology 197); and four upper-division courses in Social Ecology (those numbered 101 or above). UC IRVINE - 1972-1973PLANNING A PROGRAM 29 PLANNING A PROGRAM CHOOSING AN UNDERGRADUATE MAJOR The student is expected to choose a major (a field of concentration) by the begin\u00ad ning of his junior year. Most majors are departmental and are therefore located in one of the schools; some, such as Comparative Culture, exist outside of the basic schools. The various possible majors are described later in this catalogue. Most major requirements allow the student to take a considerable number of courses in fields other than that which he has chosen as a major. Programs appearing in this catalogue are subject to change, and no catalogue can give a complete idea of what a major may involve. ' In preparation for choosing a major the student should consult his advisor about the possibilities which may be open to him. Even though the advisor will not be thoroughly familiar with all fields, he can suggest ways to investigate other areas of study. Students should feel free to go to any department and ask to speak to an academic advisor in order to learn more about that field, its programs of study, its requirements for admission and graduation, and possible enrollment limitations. While some students are aware that they might like to major in one of several sub\u00ad jects, other students are only aware of those fields in which they do not wish to \u00b7major. The task of choosing \u00b7a major is therefore often one of refining these earlier impressio'ns in the light -of experience in courses, discussions with faculty and with other students, and the opening of new opportunities and possibilities. Students with absolutely no idea of the field in which they would like to major will have time.to take courses in various fields and determine their specific interests. It should be kept in mind that some major programs require specific preliminary study; that courses required for graduation or for a major which the student may later wish to elect must be considered; and that one must be cautious about exces\u00ad sive early concentration in a certain field, or else he may be prevented from moving to a major in a different field if he changes his mind. A student should not overlook any possible opportunities. The faculty advisor can be helpful in formulating an overall lower-division program which will keep the maximum number of possible majors open. If certain courses are not available, then substitutions must be found. It is the func\u00ad tion of an academic advisor to help the student plan his program on an individual basis in terms of the student's preferences. Students anticipating graduate or professional study in a certain field should exer\u00ad cise special care in constructing their undergraduate programs, and they should make their career goals known to their advisors; Such choices naturally do not have to be made during the first two years, and may or may not be made during the second two, but investigation of the possibilities of graduate or professional study will often be helpful to students. who have an idea of the direction in which they would like to go. UC IRVINE - 1972-197330 PLANNING A PROGRAM ACADEMIC ADVISING At the time of admission every undergraduate student at UCI is assigned for pur\u00ad poses of academic advising to the school or to the interschool curriculum which corresponds to the student's stated area of academic concentration (major). Stu\u00ad dents who have not declared an area of academic concentration at the time of ad\u00ad mission are also assigned for purposes of academic advising to one of the schools or interschool curricula; this assignment will continue until the student reaches a deci\u00ad sion concerning a major, at which time he will submit a petition for change of major and be transferred for advising purposes to the appropriate school or curricu\u00ad lum. Jurisdiction over all questions of academic regulations and academic standing rests with the dean or director of the school or curriculum to which a student is currently assigned for purposes of academic advising. Thus, all requests to add or drop courses, petitions seeking waiver or change of graduation or other require\u00ad ments, and petitions to change area of academic concentration must be processed through the office of that dean or director. Each school and interschool curriculum is responsible for maintaining a system which provides academic advising by faculty members. These systems differ among the several schools and curricula. In some instances all of the faculty in the school or curriculum serve as advisors; in other cases only certain of the faculty are desig\u00ad nated as advisors. In each instance, however, every student will have a faculty ad\u00ad visor. Responsibility for informing students of the identity of their advisors rests with the dean or director of the appropriate school or curriculum. This is normally done by letter, but if at any time a student is uncertain of the identity of his facul\u00ad ty advisor he may obtain that information from the office of the appropriate dean or director. In many schools or curricula a student may arrange to change advisors if he wishes by submitting a Student Petition to that effect. A change in area of concentration often involves a change in advisor. This will always be the case when the change of concentration is to a different school or curriculum. The new school or curriculum will assign a new advisor and inform the student. In some schools and curricula consultation between students and their advisors is mandatory. Students are responsible for knowing, the goveming regulations of the school or curriculum to which they are assigned for. purposes of academic advising. Irrespective of whether or not consultation between a student and his advisor is required, the student is responsible for initiating and maintaining periodic contact with his assigned advisor. An appropriate time for the initial contact is during the week prior to the beginning of the student's first classes at UCI, or earlier at the time. of registration if this is possible. Thereafter consultation between student and advisor at the time of registratiOn for each subsequent quarter is desirable. The ac\u00ad tual frequency of these meetings will be determined of course by the desires of the student, his advisor, and by the governing regulations. It is the obligation of the advisor to help the student plan an appropriate program of study and interpret the academic regulations of the campus, but the student is himself solely responsible for meeting the academic regulations and remaining in good academic standing. PRE-PROFESSIONAL EDUCATION Students planning to pursue graduate work should supplement their undergraduate program by anticipating language requirements at major graduate schools and by intensive work in areas outside the school of their major that are of special rele\u00ad vance to their intended graduate work. Such students should consult their advisors to ensure that they make a wise selection of courses within the school. UC IRVINE - 1972-1973PLANNING A PROGRAM 31 Pre-Dentistry, Medicine, Nursing, Veterinary Science A student who plans to enter a school of dentistry, medicine, nursing, veterinary science, etc. may receive his required pre-professional training at UCI. This training may be accomplished by (a) completing the major in Biological Sciences or (b) majoring in any school or department, but fulfilling concurrently the specific course requirements of the dental, medical, nursing, or veterinary school he expects to attend. A few schools request specific additional requirements (e.g., English, foreign language, physical chemistry, etc.). A student should, therefore, check early with the professional school he seeks to enter. Leaders in dental, medical, and veterinary education recommend that students pre\u00ad paring to seek admission to dental or medical schools plan to obtain a Bachelor's Degree. Rather than require their students to have taken specific premedical courses, many dental and medical schools now prefer that their students come to them having the type of basic training in the biological sciences (with prerequisites in physical sciences, social sciences, and humanities) offered at Irvine. Business and Public Administration Undergraduate degree programs in business and public administration are not of\u00ad fered at UCI. Students preparing for a career in business or government usually would major in the humanities or social sciences. Students particularly interested in business administration are usually advised to concentrate on work in economics. Students interested in public administration are usually advised to emphasize eco\u00ad nomics and political science. Students wishing to,prepare for the program of study in the Graduate School of Administration at UCI should choose electives to meet the general admission requirements of that program (see,p. 273). The Graduate School of Administration, in conjunction with other schools on this campus, offers a special five-year program (commonly referred to as a \"3-2 program\") leading to both a Bachelor's Degree in the appropriate school and a Master's Degree in Admin\u00ad istration. Application for admission to the program is made in the spring of the junior year. Teacher Education Students planning to become teachers can qualify at UCI for the Standard Teaching Credentials with a specialization in elementary teaching, secondary teaching, or junior college teaching. All credentials require three quarters of work beyond the Bachelor's Degree. In their undergraduate work at Irvine, students can major in any of the departments of the various schools; for their electives they should choose courses that will satis\u00ad fy the requirements for teacher certification. Students should consult with their advisors or with the Office of Teacher Education to determine these requirements. For further details on preparation for teaching, see page 279. SUPPLEMENTARY EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS Education Abroad Program The Education Abroad Program offers opportunities to undergraduate and graduate students of the University of California to study for credit in universities overseas, and serves also as a source of information on all types of educational exchange experiences. UC IRVINE - 1972-197332 PLANNING A PROGRAM Study centers have been established in France, Germany, Ghana, Hong Kong, Israel Italy, Japan, Lebanon, Mexico, Kenya (Nairobi), Norway, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom and Ireland. Participants generally spend from nine to eleven months abroad, including a special orientation program, six or seven weeks of in\u00ad tensive language preparation, a full academic year in the university of their choice, and some vacation travel. For information about eligibility, deadlines, financial aid, or for further material concerning particular centers abroad, consult Helen Stanley, Trailer 409, telephone (714) 833-6343. Summer Sessions Two summer sessions will be held on the Irvine campus. Session I will run from June 18.toJuly 25, 1973. Session II will be from July 26 to August 31, 1973. Stu\u00ad dents may enroll in either or in both sessions. Those who enroll in both take an academic program equivalent to a regular quarter, thus accelerating their progress toward a degree. A wide variety of courses from the regular sessions is planned, supplemented by experimental offerings available only during the summer. Admission is open to all university students, high school graduates, and to qualified applicants over 21 years of age. Admission to Summer Session does not constitute admission to a regular session of the University; therefore, official transcripts of educational records are not required. Fees for Summer Session are the same for out-of-state students as for California students. Information regarding Summer Session may be obtained from the Summer Session Office in the Computer Science Building, telephone (714) 833-5493. Catalogues and application forms will be available in February. University Extension University Extension programs are designed to provide educational opportunity to adults for professional upgrading, personal growth through cultural programs, and more effective participation in civic affairs. In the broader social view, it is the assigned task of University Extension to provide the mechanism by which the re\u00ad sources of the University can be applied to the more rapid solution of statewide and urban problems. A variety of methods are used to implement these aims: classes, lecture series, dis\u00ad cussion groups, correspondence courses, conferences, institutes, and short courses. Extension programs in Orange County are offered on the UCI campus, at Buena Park High School, and at other locations. For detailed information, write or tele\u00ad phone the Extension Office of UCI in Room 1325, Crawford Hall, telephone (714) 833-5414. . UC IRVINE - 1972-1973STUDENT AFFAIRS UC IRVINE - 1972-1973The Senior Class mourn the loss of a banner 'Which was carelessly left hang\u00ad ing on an electric wire Saturday e'b- I entng. The Class of '06 is supposed to know something about it. Front: This shotputter appeared in the 1904 edition of the Santa Ana High School yearbook, The Ariel . Back: A flyer evidently distributed by the 1905 class of Santa Ana High School. UC IRVINE - 1972-1973STUDENT AFFAIRS STUDENT AFFAIRS 35 The Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs has responsibility for a full range ~f activi\u00ad ties designed to serve the student. The various offices described below are primarily student centered and accept the challenge of making their services more responsive to student concerns, and, when necessary, of extending them to fit expanding stu\u00ad dent values. We also feel that a program in student affairs must serve an educational purpose. It is the obligation of any university to assume that students have a legitimate voice in the policies of their campus, and that students must not only speak out on issues, but also have an active role in every aspect of the campus with which they are in\u00ad volved. However, this cannot be handled by measures which are expedient or im\u00ad provised only as issues arise. It is our responsibility to draw students into the decision-making process in such a way that students may also implement their deci\u00ad sions and be held accountable for them. This involves more than the traditional device of giving students representation on a smattering of non-controversial com\u00ad mittees and advisory teams, but in finding a full and practical way by which stu\u00ad dents can assume part of the responsibility for running their campus. Through assuming a student advocate role, the student affairs staff hopes to foster a level of trust and mutual engagement leading to student participation in all areas. Bi-weekly meetings of the Vice Chancellor's staff are open to students. DEAN OF STUDENTS The services and agencies listed below are coordinated by the Dean's office. Any difficulties students might encounter that do not fall under the specific listings can be referred to this office for clarification. Student Services Five special areas are handled in the Student Services Office: students who are physically disabled, international students and scholars, orientation, questions con\u00ad cerning veteran benefits, and Career Planning and Placement.

Students or their counselors are encouraged to \u00b7contact the Student Services Office. International students and scholars will find the Student Services Office helpful in . obtaining documentation for visas, extensions, work permits, etc. Assistance is also provided for locating off-campus housing, host family programs, and personal counseling. UCI students who receive benefits from the Veterans Administration or other Fed\u00ad eral agencies for veterans affairs, or have questions concerning eligibility, should seek assistance in the Student Services Office. Certification of attendance at UCI can be obtained here for V.A. purposes. UC IRVINE - 1972-197336 STUDENT AFFAIRS An additional function of the Student Services Office is the coordination of orien\u00ad tation programs for students new to UCI. We consider orientation to be an integral part of each student's educational experience. Orientation is not only a beginning, but it is also a process that continues, both formally and informally, throughout the student's collegiate career. The orientation programs include: Housing Open House - a one-day seminar in the spring on housing in the Irvine area; UCI-CCM (California College of Medicine) Orientation- a program in late June for students entering medical school; the Stu\u00ad dent Parent Orientation Program (SPOP) - a live-in weekend program for new stu\u00ad dents and their parents to introduce them to UCI prior to the beginning of classes; Transfer Student Program -the last weekend in August is devoted to the special needs of transfer students with emphasis on academic advising; Uni-Prep - a 12-day live-in program concentrating on the exploration of self through personal and voca\u00ad tional testing; speed reading and study skills, and general discussion on higher edu\u00ad cation; Fall \"0\" Week- the week before classes begin affords new students a chance to explore their academic program, identify campus resources, and meet one another; Winter and Spring Orientation -one-day informal orientation programs for the fewer number of students entering during mid-year. Career Planning and Placement Students in all majors and at all levels, freshmen through graduate students, are invited to seek assistance in career planning and job search through Career Planning and Placement.

The four forms of financial aid available at UCI are scholarships, UC IRVINE - 1972-1973STUDENT AFFAIRS 37 grants, loans, and employment. UCI uses only the College Scholarship Service in\u00ad struments for estimating fi11ancial need. Scholarships Regents' \u00b7scholarships, one of the highest honors conferred upon UC students, are awarded on the basis of academic excellence and exceptional promise, without ref\u00ad erence to need. Students are eligible upon graduation from high school or upon completion of the sophomore year of college. Medical students are eligible during any year of their study in medical school. The appointments run for four years for students entering from high school or two years for students appointed after their sophomore year. Regents' Scholars receive a $100 honorarium the first year of their appointment and a stipend each year to cover the difference between their resources and the yearly standard cost of' education. President's and University scholarships are offered to entering and continuing stu\u00ad dents who show evidence of high scholastic attainment and financial need. These awards are renewable by submitting an application for consideration each year. \u00b7 There are other special scholarships available to students who qualify. While a stu\u00ad dent may not apply for a specific scholarship, careful consideration will be given to applicants with special qualifications. Applications for scholarships should be filed at the Office of Financial Aids between November 1 and january 15. Students who are not continuing students at UCI should also include official high school and col\u00ad lege transcripts. Grants The University of California Grants Program is established to provide grants-in-aid for undergraduate, graduate, and medical students with exceptional financial need. Federal Educational Opportunity Grants are available for undergraduate students only. The basic purpose of this program is to assist students whose exceptional fi\u00ad nancial need would prevent their attending college. Grants range from $200 to $1,000 per year but in every case must be less than one-half of a financial aids pack\u00ad age, which may consist of a loan, a State Scholarship or other approved scholarship, or a grant.

Loans from these funds are of a short-term nature to cover emergency needs and do not bear interest. The Federal College Work-Study Program is designed to assist students from low\u00ad income families who cannot meet their college expenses. Students who qualify for work-study are provided with employment during the school year and vacation periods. Recipients must be U.S. citizens or permanent residents.

Educational Opportunities -Special Services, Recruiting, Counseling Programs The purpose of these programs is to assist culturally and economically disadvan\u00ad taged as well as physically .handicapped students in enrolling and succeeding in aca- UC IRVINE - 1972-197342 STUDENT AFFAIRS demic studies. The difficulties these students encounter in seeking a college educa\u00ad tion may range from inadequate public school preparation to a lack of money to support their education. The EOP-Program is designed to assist students in over\u00ad coming these and other problems by providing special admissions consideration, financial aid, academic support through advising, tutoring, and a Communication Skills Center as well as supportive counseling assistance on a continuing personal basis. There is also special financial, academic, counseling, and social assistance for students from different minority or ethnic group backgrounds. Eligibility Students with disadvantaged or physically handicapped backgrounds ate encour\u00ad aged to apply. Particularly encouraged to apply are those minority group, low\u00ad income and physically handicapped persons who may not meet admissions require\u00ad ments but who can offer evidence supporting their ability to achieve at the Univer\u00ad sity level. In those cases where entering the University at this time would not seem appropriate, the Admissions Committee may recommend to the student a program of study in a junior college or elsewhere, hoping that he or she may qualify for ac\u00ad ceptance at UCI as soon as possible. Financial Assistance Being able to afford to go to college need no longer be the determini~g factor in deciding whether or not to attend. Students admitted to UCI under the EOP-Pro\u00ad gram are considered for financial assistance on the basis of need. Funds can be pro\u00ad vided to cover room and board, registration fees, books and supplies, and living expenses when a student or his family is unable to meet these expenses. Financial aid is comprised of a combination or \"package\" of grant, loan, and summer or part\u00ad time employment based on the individual need of the student applicant. Individual financial aid and counseling is provided each student through the Financial Aids Office. Academic Support To help insure the academic success of EOP students, tutoring and advising are available at the University through the Special Services Office. Students are encour\u00ad aged to seek counseling, academic advising, and gro\u00b7up and individual tutoring in academic subjects. Reading, writing and listening skills, techniques of studying, note-taking, and exam preparation can be improved through taking part in the Com\u00ad munication Skills Center on campus. Admissions Prospective EOP students must complete the usual admission forms and proce\u00ad dures. Applications may be obtained from the Admissions Office. In addition to submitting an application for admission and requesting that transcripts of records from all prior schools be sent to UCI, the EOP applicant must (1) write a short autobiographical essay, focusing on his academic potential and academic goals, and (2) have at least three people write recommendations (these may be teachers, coun\u00ad selors, persons in the community, or employers). Inquiries regarding the EOP-Program should be directed to Office of Admissions, University of California, Irvine; Irvine, California 92664; (714) 833-6704. UC IRVINE - 1972-1973STUDENT AFFAIRS 43 Central Campus Calendar All campus and non-campus organizations should contact this office for assistance in scheduling all events that take place on campus.

Recreation UCI students are invited to participate in the Recreation and Intramural Program offered by the Physical Education Department. Intramural sports competition for men and women is designed for those who enjoy friendly competition with other UCI students on an organized basis.

INNOVATION IN STUDENT LIFE Innovation in Student Life (ISL) provi~es an informal center for the exchange of ideas, the gathering of fact and opinion, and the initiation of dialogue among stu\u00ad dents, faculty, and community. It engages participants in cooperative endeavors and provides a forum for students who want immediate, relevant application of subject matter to their own lives. To avoid the dissipation of creative energy which often occurs when innovation is \"scheduled\" into a system, ISL focuses upon a group of programs rather than care\u00ad fully constructed objectives. The two basic goals are (1) stimulating and supporting a wide variety of on-and off-campus activities designed to have novel educational and communication-enhancing effects upon the university community while also being satisfying and fulfilling for the individual; and (2) opening to scrutiny those aspects of university-community life that appear to be dehumanizing and stultifying in their impact on people. Basically, ISL is administered through open \"town meetings\" on Monday evenings from 5:30 to 7:00. Other functions of the ISL director- co-curricular learning, counselor-at-large, the or\u00ad ganizational medium of ISL and its membership. The Innovation in Student Life Office is located in Trailer 902 (next to Student Center 2). Ombudsman The ISL Director's ombudsman function consists of the resolution of individual or group grievances, but it also includes the preventive measures of personal counseling and group interaction. While his work involves neither administrative authority nor r_esponsibility, he has full freedom of access and inquiry and may take appropriate action. Complainants are assured confidentiality. UC IRVINE - 1972-197344 STUDENT AFFAIRS STUDENT HEALTH SERVICES Among the services available to all regularly enrolled students on the UCI campus is a Health Service, under the direction of a Physician Director. The Student Health Service facilities include an outpatient clinic and dispensary, staffed by physicians and nurses, and supported by x-ray and clinical laboratory. General medical clinics are held 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. every day during the week. Specialty clinics are held at , various regular intervals, by appointment. An inpatient infirmary provides care for students who need bed care. In addition to the above facilities, an insurance program provides for most emer\u00ad gency care, surgery, and hospitalization when such care is required and not available at the Student Health Service. Each enrolled student at UCI will have a basic health and accident insurance plan in force. Clinical counseling and help for emotional problems are available through the Men\u00ad tal Health Division of the Student Health Service. Psychiatrists and psychologists provide a full spectrum of services to students. The Student Health Service encourages preventive medicine. It supplements but does not supplant the family physician. Full and mutual cooperation between the Student Health Service and the family physician is encouraged. Optional additional insurance for students during vacation is available at the Stu\u00ad dent Health Service. COUNSELING SERVICES Counseling represents an opportunity for a person to clarify his needs and goals through dialogue with another person. The Counseling Center (544 Engineering Building) serves as a focus for counseling services on the campus, but students should be aware that many people in the Uni\u00ad versity are willing to make themselves available if a student requests help. The Counseling Center includes a staff of counselors who are prepared to assist students in making personal, educational, and vocational decisions. In addition to providing opportunities for a student to share his concerns in a pri\u00ad vate setting on a one-to-one_ basis, the Center also sponsors group activities for stu\u00ad dents who wish to explore their values and feelings in collaboration with others. The Counseling Center emphasizes the confidentiality of the counseling relationship by maintaining no personal records on students who visit the Center. STUDENT CONDUCT AND DISCIPLINE In order to make the administration of campus activities coherent and consistent, the University will provide the student with a handbook setting forth the standards of conduct expected of UCI students. This booklet, University of California Policies Relating to Students and Student Organizations, Use of University Facilities, and Non-Discrimination, gives the rules concerning conduct and related matters, as established by the policies of The Regents and President of the University, as well as campus regulations. A student enrolling in the University is expected to assume an obligation to conduct himself in a manner compatible with the University's func\u00ad tion as an educational institution. The booklet is a reinforcement of that assumption. UC IRVINE - 1972-1973ADMISSIONS AND POLICIES UC IRVINE - 1972-1973Both illustrations are from public relations folders for the City of Orange, one published in 1913 and the other in 1914. UC IRVINE - 1972-1973UNDERGRADUATE ADMISSIONS 47 UNDERGRADUATE ADMISSIONS The University's undergraduate admission requirements, which are the same on all campuses, are based on two principles: The best predictor of success in the Univer\u00ad sity is high scholarship in previous work, and the study of certain subjects in high school gives a student good preparation for University work. Applying for Admission To apply for admission to the University as an undergraduate, request an applica\u00ad tion form from any campus Admissions Office. Submit your completed application and the related materials to the Admissions Office on the campus where you wish to enroll on or after the appropriate date below: Fall quarter 1973 Winter quarter 1974 Spring quarter 1974 November 1, 1972 July 1, 1973 October 1, 1973 Applications will not be released prior to the above dates; however, they may be requested in advance. All campuses observe these dates for the beginning of applica\u00ad tion filing and will accept for consideration all applications filed during the first month of the filing period. After the first month the closing deadline will vary from campus to campus. Once enrollment quotas have been \u00b7filled, additional applications cannot be accepted and will be redirected to another University campus where en\u00ad rollments are still open. Through its redirection program, the University has been able in the past to assure that each qualified applicant is offered admission to one of the University campuses. Application Fee There is a nonrefundable fee of $20 for filing an application for admission. Make your check or money order payable to The Regents of the University of California and attach it to your application form. Duplicate Applications Only one application for the University of California is permissible, and it entitles you to attend the campus of your choice if there is space available. Fees \u00b7submitted with duplicate applications will not be refunded. Change of Campus If, after you have applied for admission, your plans change and you prefer to attend a different campus of the University, you should write to the Director of Admis\u00ad sions, 570 University Hall, Berkeley, California 94720. In your letter indicate the new campus you wish to attend, and give your reasons for the change. Your appli\u00ad cation will be transferred to that campus if enrollment is open, but you will receive a new admissions priority assignment based on the date on which you made your request for the change. UC IRVINE - 1972-197348 UNDERGRADUATE ADMISSIONS Transcripts Every applicant is responsible for requesting that the high school from which he graduated and each college he has attended send official transcripts of his work promptly to the Office of Admissions where his application is filed. If you are applying for admission as a freshman, ask your high school to submit a preliminary transcript showing your work through the junior year. The transcript also should list the courses you are now taking and those you plan to take. You must also arrange for a final transcript that includes your courses and grades for the senior year and a statement of graduation. If you have completed any college courses before or at the time of graduation, a transcript of your record from the last college attended is required. If you are applying for admission in advanced standing, have your graduating high school send a transcript of your record immediately to the Office of Admissions, which will also need a transcript from each college you have attended. A prelimi\u00ad nary transcript from your present college should list the courses you are now taking and those you plan to take before transfer; If you attend any other schools or colleges after your application to the University has been filed, your work there is considered to be part of your record and must be reported to the Office of Admissions. The transcripts and other documents that you submit as part of your application become the property of the University; they cannot be returned to you or for\u00ad warded in any form to another college or university. Notification of Admission Candidates for the fall quarter will be notified whether their application has been retained for consideration by their first choice campus, or redirected, by February 15. Most candidates will receive notice of their admissibility by April 15. (There are similar notification periods for other quarters.) Delays will occur if required records have not been received by the Office of Admissions. Since each application is con\u00ad sidered individually, the length of time before notification is subject to some varia\u00ad tion depending upon the unique circumstances of each applicant. If offered admission by the University, you will be asked to sign and return a State\u00ad ment of Intention to Register, accompanied by a nonrefundable fee of $50. This amount will be applied toward payment of the University Registration Fee, pro\u00ad vided you register in the quarter to which you have been admitted. Admission to the University is not an assurance of financial aid nor does it guar\u00ad antee assignment to University housing. Separate applications are required of appli\u00ad cants desiring financial aid or University housing. Re-Application An application for admission is effective only-for the quarter for which it is submit\u00ad ted. If you are not eligible for admission, or if you are admitted and do not register, you must file a new application and the required fee if you wish to be admitted to another quarter. The new application will be considered in light of the admission requirements in effect and the space available on the campus. UC IRVINE - 1972-1973UNDERGRADUATE ADMISSIONS 49 ADMISSION TO FRESHMAN STANDING The University defines a \"freshman applicant\" as a student who has not attended a collegiate institution for more than one quarter or one semester after high school graduation, irrespective of the total advanced standing units earned. Summer ses\u00ad sions are excluded in the above determination. Advanced standing credit will be granted for an acceptable college course taken while still in high schoot if completed after the tenth grade and if reported on a valid transcript issued by the college or junior college which conducted the course.

Requirements for California Residents To be eligible for admission to .the University as a freshman you must meet the Subject Requirement,. the Scholarship Requirement, arid the Examination Require- ment, which are described below. \u00b7 Subject (\"a through f'') Requirement You must complete certain high school subjects with at least a grade of C in each semester of each course. If you are a graduate of a California high school, these courses must appear on a list that your high school principal has certified meet the course descriptions below and that he has placed on file with the Director of Admissions. If you are a graduate of an out-of-state high school, the Office of Admissions wiii determine if your courses are equivalent. a. History, 1 year: One year of United States history, or one-half year of United States history and one-half year of civks or American government. b. English, 3 years: Composition, literature, oral expression. c. Mathematics, 2 years: Elementary algebra, geometry, intermediate and advanced algebra, trigonometry, calculus, elementary function, matrix algebra, probabil\u00ad ity, statistics, or courses combining these subjects. Nonacademic courses such as arithmetic and business mathematics may not be used. d. Laboratory Science, 1 year: One laboratory science, taken in the tenth, eleventh, or twelfth grade. e. Foreign Language, 2 years: Any one foreign language with a written literature may be used. f. Advanced Course, 1 or 2 years, sa!isfied by one of the following: Mathematics: A total of one year of advanced mathematics -intermediate alge\u00ad bra, trigonometry, or other comparable mathematics courses. UC IRVINE - 1972-1973\u00b7 50 UNDERGRADUATE ADMISSIONS Foreign Language: Either an additional year in the same language used for \"e\" above or two years of a second foreign language. Science: A year course in any laboratory science completed subsequent to the laboratory science used for \"d\" above. Elective Courses: The subjects listed above will account for ten to eleven of the fifteen high school credits required for admission to the University. A year course in high school is equivalent to one credit. The remaining credits provide an excellent opportunity for you to broaden your preparation for University work by taking elective courses in areas other than those in which you have concentrated. Scholarship Requirement Not only must you earn at least a C in each of the courses required for admission, you must also earn an overall average of B in those on the list which you take after the ninth grade. ' In determining the required B average, the University will use a semester grade of A in one course to balance a semester grade of C in another. Grades you received in courses taken in the ninth grade or earlier are not used in determining your scholar\u00ad ship average. The grades that appear on your official high school transcript, includ\u00ad ing those earned in accelerated and advanced courses, are the grades the University will use in evaluating your record. Grades are counted on a semester basis unless a school gives only year grades. You may repeat up to a total of two semester courses in which you received a grade of D or lower in order to meet the subject and scholarship requirements. The grades you earn in repeated courses, however, will not be counted higher than C in deter\u00ad mining your scholarship average;.)f the courses you repeat were taken before the ninth grade, they will be treated as if you were taking them for the first time. Examination Requirement All freshman applicants must submit scores from the College Entrance Examination . Board tests listed below. If you are applying for admission to the fall quarter, you should take the tests no later than January of your senior year. The following tests are required: 1. Scholastic Aptitude Test (The verbal and mathematics scores you submit from this test must be from the same sitting.) 2. Three Achievement Tests, which must include (a) English Composition, (b) one from among the social studies or one from among the foreign languages, and (c) one from mathematics or one from among the sciences. If you are a California resident and your scholarship average in the required high school subjects is from 3.0 to 3.09 inclusive, you must earn a total score of 2,500 or higher in these five tests. If your scholarship average is 3.10 or above, these test scores will not be used to determine your eligibility. However, scores must be sub\u00ad mitted by all applicants to assist in counseling, guidance, and placement, and when possible, to satisfy the Subject A requirement. Subject A Requirement The University requires every undergraduate student to demonstrate an appropriate level of ability in English composition. This requirement is known as Subject A and may be satisfied by: UC IRVINE - 1972-1973UNDERGRADUATE ADMISSIONS 51 1. Achieving a grade of 5, 4, or 3 in the Advanced Placement Examination in Eng\u00ad lish given by the College Entrance Examination Board (CEEB), orby 2-Achieving a score of 550 or higher in the CEEB Achievement Test in English Composition, or by 3. Completing an acceptable college-level course of four quarter units or three semester units in English composition with a grade of C or better. If you have not established your Subject A standing in one of the above ways, you should report to the campus office of Subject A at the time of registration to take a CEEB placement test. \" If you do not meet the requirement in one of these ways, you must enroll in a non- credit course in Subject A during your first quarter at the University. A fee of $45 is charged for the course. Admission by Examination Alone If you do not meet the scholarship and subject requirements for admission, you may be able to qualify for admission as a freshman by examination alone. To do so, you must take the same CEEB tests discussed previously but must earn higher scores. The required total score on the Scholastic Aptitude Test is 1,1 00. You must earn at least 500 on each Achievement Test with a total Achievement Test score of at least 1,650, or at least 1, 725 if a nonresident. Examination Arrangements Make arrangements to take the required tests with the Educational Testing Service, P.O. Box 1025, Berkeley, California 94701, or P.O. Box 592, Princeton, New Jer\u00ad sey 08540. (Test fees should be paid to the Educational Testing Service, not the University.) Your test scores will be regarded as official only if they are reported directly to the Admissions Office by the Educational Testing Service. Also, your final notification of admission cannot be released until your scores from the CEEB tests have been received by the Admissions Office. The test dates are: October 14, 1972 (SAT in California/Texas only); November 4, 1972 (SAT only); December 2, 1972;January 13, 1973; February 6, 1973 (Greek Ach. only); March 3, 1973; April 7, 1973 (SAT only); May 5, 1973 (Achievement only);July 14, 1973. ADMISSION IN ADVANCED STANDING The University defines an \"advanced standing applicant\" as a high school graduate who has been a registered student in another college or university or in college-level exten\u00a7.ion classes other than a summer session immediately following high school graduation. An advanced standing applicant may not disregard his college record and apply for admission as a freshman. If you are a nonresident applicant, you must meet the requirements listed below in addition to those described at the end of this section. Advanced Standing Admission Requirements The requirements for admission in advanced standing vary according to your high school record. If you have completed less than twelve quarter or semester units of transferable college credit since high school graduation, you must also satisfy the examination requirement for freshman applicants. The transcript you submit from the last college you attended must show, as a mini- UC IRVINE - 1972-197352 UNDERGRADUATE ADMISSIONS mum, that you were in good standing and that you had earned a grade-point aver\u00ad age* oL2.0 or better. If your grade-point average fell below 2.0 at any one college you attended, you may have to meet additional requirements in order to qualify for admission. As an advanced standing applicant you must also meet one of the following conditions: 1. If you were eligible for admission to the University as a freshman, you may be admitted in advanced standing any time after you have established an overall grade-point average of 2.0 or better in another college or university. 2. If you were not eligible for admission as a freshman only because you had not studied one or more of the required high school subjects, you may be admitted after you have: a. Established an overall grade-point average of 2.0 or better in another college or university, b. Completed, with a grade of C or better, appropriate college courses in the high school subjects i:hat you lacked, and c. Completed twelve or more quarter or semester units of transferable college credit since high school graduation or have successfully passed the CEEB tests required of freshman applicants. There is an exception to this requirement. Up to two units of credit in the re\u00ad quired high school subjects will be excused if you have earned a grade-point aver\u00ad age of 2.4 or better in 84 quarter units (56 semester units) of college credit in courses accepted by the University for transfer. Any deficiency over two units in the required high school subjects must be made up by completing appropriate college courses with a grade of C or better. 3. If you were ineligible for admission to the University as a freshman because of low scholarship or a combination of low scholarship and a lack of required sub\u00ad jects (see p. 49), you may be admitted after you have: a. Earned a grade-point average of 2.4 or better in at least 84 quarter units (56 semester units) of college credit in courses accepted by the University for trans\u00ad fer, and b. Satisfied the high school subject requirement by completing appropriate col\u00ad lege courses with a grade of Cor better. The exception described at the end of 2 above also applies in this case. *Your grade-point average is determined by dividing the total number of acceptable units you have attempted into the number of grade points you earned on those units. You may repeat courses that you completed with a grade lower than C up to a maximum of 16 quarter units without penalty. The scholarship standard is expressed by a system of grade points and grade-point averages earned in courses accepted by the University for advanced standing credit. Grade points are assigned as follows: for eachunit of A, 4 points; B, 3 points; C, 2 points; D, 1 point; I and F, m points. UC IRVINE - 1972-1973UNDERGRADUATE ADMISSIONS 53 Nonresident Advanced Standing Applicant In addition to meeting the regular requirements for admission in advanced standing, a nonresident applicant must also have a grade-point average of 2.8 or higher in the college courses he has taken that are accepted by the University for transfer credit . .A. nonresident applicant who graduated from high school with less than a 3.4 aver\u00ad age in the subject~ required for admission must have completed at least 84 quarter units (56 semester units) of transferable college work. PREPARING FOR THE UNIVERSITY Certain specific high school subjects are required for admission to the University, whether you are applying as a freshman or in advanced standing. In addition, other preparatory subjects are strongly recommended for many University programs in order to give students the needed background in their chosen fields of study. The lack of a recommended high school subject may delay a student's graduation from the University. You will find details about these recommendations in Prerequisites and Recom\u00ad mended Subjects, a University publication sent each year to high school and college counselors. Advanced Placement The Advanced Placement Examinations of the College Entrance Examination Board are taken, usually during the senior year, in conjunction with courses taken in: high school. You will receive ten quarter units of University credit for each examination (except Latin examinations which earn five quarter units each) in which you earn a score of 5, 4, or 3. These credits will apply toward the total required for graduation from the University. - Credit from Another College The University gives unit credit to transfer students for courses they have com\u00ad pleted in other accredited colleges or universities. To be accepted for credit, the courses must be consistent with those offered by the Uhiversity. If an applicant has taken extension courses at another college or university, the Office of Admissions will determine if the courses are acceptable for University credit. The application of credit earned in extension courses toward the require\u00ad ments for a University degree will be determined by the faculty of the school or college in which the applicant plans to enroll. ADMISSION TO LIMITED STATUS Limited students are those with a Bachelor's degree who are admitted to the Uni\u00ad versity for the purpose of completing a specified program of courses required for admission to graduate status. See Graduate Division, p. 73. ADMISSION OF FOREIGN STUDENTS The credentials of an applicant for admission from another country in either under\u00ad graduate or graduate status are evaluated in accordance with the general regulations governing admission. The completed application, official certificates, and detailed transcripts of record should be submitted to the Office of Admissions several months in advance of the opening of the quarter in which the applicant hopes to gain admittance. Please write the foreign student evaluator, Office of Admissions, for complete details. UC IRVINE - 1972-197354 UNDERGRADUATE ADMISSIONS PLANNING FOR TRANSFER TO UCI The University is committed to serve as fully as possible the educational needs of students who transfer from other California collegiate institutions. The principles covering transferability of unit credit and course credit are explained below and, unless otherwise indicated, are much the same whether transfer is from a two-year or a four-year institution. Information regarding eligibility for transfer may be found above in the section on Admission to Advanced Standing. Unit Credit for Work Taken Elsewhere The. University of California grants unit credit for courses completed in other ac\u00ad credited colleges and universities when such courses-are consistent with the func\u00ad tions of the University as set forth in the Master Plan for Higher Education in Cali\u00ad fornia. Equivalent advanced standing credit from institutions on the semester calen\u00ad dar may be determined at a ratio of one semester unit to one-and-one-half quarter units. (180 quarter units, equivalent to 45 UCI quarter courses, are needed to grad\u00ad uate from UCI.) California Community Qunior) Colleges Students often find it advantageous to complete the first two years of a University of California undergraduate program at one of the California Community Colleges, which are an integral part of the state's system of higher education. If a high school graduate cannot be accommodated on his campus of first choice, he may choose to attend a junior college and transfer to his preferred University campus at a later time. A student may earn any or all of the first 105 quarter units (70 semester units) toward a University degree in a community college. No further unit credit may be transferred from a community college, although subject credit for courses taken will still be granted. Students anticipating transfer to UCI are urged to consult with their junior college counselors as to the acceptability of course work in the University. In addition, they should familiarize themselves with the course numbering scheme of the junior college catalogue, since the course numbers usually reflect the transferability of courses. Students transferring from a community college in continuation of regular attendance, and making normal progress toward a degree, may elect to meet as graduation requirements either those in effect at the time of entering the commu\u00ad nity college or those in effect at the time of graduation or transfer. Four-Year Institutions Unit credit is granted for courses consistent with the University of California's func\u00ad tions and which have been completed in colleges or, universities accredited by the appropriate agencies. University of California Extension Course numbers prefixed by XB, XD, XI, XL, XR, XSB, and XSC are granted credit toward the Bachelor's Degree on the same basis as courses taken in residence at any accredited collegiate institution. Decisions regarding the acceptability of extension courses taken in institutions other than the University of California rest with the Office of Admissions. Decisions regarding the applicability of such courses toward specific degrees and majors rest with the respective faculties. College Level Examination Program Ten quarter units are granted for each area examination passed with a score of 500 UC IRVINE - 1972-1973UNDERGRADUATE ADMISSIONS 55 or better. Five quarter units are granted for each subject examination covering work appropriate to the University's degrees passed with a score of 500 or better. Course Credit for Work Taken Elsewhere The policies aboye refer only to the unit transferability of courses and are uniform\u00ad ly implemented on all campuses of the University. Thus, courses which are deter\u00ad mined by the University of California to be transferable are assured only of being granted elective course credit. The application of transfer work to specific course and major requirements is determined on each campus. The Irvine campus makes every effort to eliminate all barriers to orderly progress from California community colleges into its own programs. To this end, most com~ munity colleges have entered into articulation agreements with UCI so that the specific application of their courses to UCI's University, school, and departmental major requirements may be readily communicated to prospective transfer students. The University of California bulletin Prerequisites and Recommended Subjects should also be consulted for planning the lower-division course of study for all pro\u00ad grams offered on the campuses of the University of California. Course Requirements Course requirements at UCI are in four categories: University of California, UCI, school, and departmental. Courses not specifically applicable to these are consid\u00ad ered to be electives. See page 22 for a complete description of these requirements. University of California Requirements Subject A. Among the means of meeting this requirement is the completion of an acceptable four-quarter-unit or three-semester-unit transfer course in English com\u00ad position with a grade of C or better. The American History and Institutions Requirement. This requirement may be met by completing in high school one year of U.S. History or one semester of U.S. His\u00ad tory and one semester of Civics with a grade of at least C, or upon certification by another California collegiate institution. UCI Requirements 6-3-3 Breadth Requirement. The 6-3-3 requirement may be satisfied by any courses appropriate to the UCI schools and may be met at any time during the undergradu\u00ad ate years. Transfer students should not feel that these must necessarily be com\u00ad pleted in the lower division. Students who transfer from a four-year institution and who have completed the general breadth requirements of that college will be considered to have met the total 6-3-3 breadth requirement of UCI. Students who transfer from a junior college and who have met the general breadth requirements of any campus of the Univer\u00ad >ity of California prior to transfer will also be regarded as having met the 6-3-3 breadth requirement. Students from colleges on the semester calendar may fulfill the 6-3-3 requirement by clusters of four courses and two courses, respectively (4-2-2). Students who, upon transfer, have not completed whatever breadth require\u00ad ments may have been in progress for another campus of the University of Califor\u00ad rtia, may elect to complete at UCI either that program or the 6-3-3 UCI breadth :iistribution. Virtually all courses in the Schools of Biological Sciences, Fine Arts, Humanities, Physical Sciences, and Social Sciences at UCI are applicable to the 6-3-3 breadth UC IRVINE - 1972-197356 UNDERGRADUATE ADMISSIONS requirement. The courses and descriptions listed elsewhere in this catalogue may be used by prospective transfer students as a guide for selecting courses of similar con\u00ad tent and purpose in their own institutions. However, it is strongly advised that they consult with their_ counselors to verify the transferability of such courses and their applicability to the 6-3-3 breadth requirement. No student who has taken a course which is accepted for credit by the Director of Admissions and University Registrar and which has been determined by a junior college as acceptable toward completion of the 6-3-3 distribution shall incur any loss of credit in satisfaction of the requirement. School Requirements Since school requirements (seep. 23) occasionally cross school lines (e.g., physical science requirements for all majors in the School of Biological Sciences), courses taken to fulfill a school requirement may at the same time be applicable toward the University breadth requirement. Also, courses taken to fulfill a departmental major requirement may, at the same time, fulfill a school requirement or the University breadth requirement (seep. 23). Although course equivalencies for the 6-3-3 breadth requirement are liberally inter\u00ad preted for purposes of transfer, courses to be applied toward school and departmen\u00ad tal major requirements must be more precisely equated with UCI courses in unit value and in content. Generally speaking, it is advisable for students to satisfy as fully as possible the requirements of their intended UCI school prior to transfer. Departmental Major Requirements Courses to be applied toward departmental major requirements must be more pre--\u00ad cisely equated with UCI courses in content and purpose than is the case with courses applicable to the 6-3-3 breadth requirement (seep. 23 and departmental sections). Prospective transfer students should consult with their counselors as to the applicability of courses toward UCI departmental requirements. Prospective transfer students should address specific inquiries about their program to the respective schools or departments at UCI. Community colleges wishing to clarify the status of transfer courses should consult with the Office of Relations with Schools at Irvine or at the University campus closest to them. ADDITIONAL POLICIES RELATING TO ADMISSIONS Rules Governing Residence New and returning students are required to fill out a Statement of Legal Residence, a form that is issued at the time of registration. Their status is determined by the Attorney in Residence Matters deputy who is located in the Registrar's Office. In\u00ad quiries from prospective students regarding residence requirements for tuition pur\u00ad poses can be made by writing to the Attorney in Residence Matters, 590 University Hall, University of California, Berkeley, California 94720. No other University per\u00ad sonnel are authorized to supply information relative to residence classification. Exemption from payment of the nonresident tuition fee is available to the unmar\u00ad ried minor (any person under 18) whose natural or adoptive parent is in the active military service of the United States and is stationed in California on the opening day of the quarter for which he registers, or is stationed outside the United States immediately after having been stationed on active duty in California. This waiver is also available to the spouse of a member of the military service of the United States with an active duty station as described above. UC IRVINE - 1972-1973UNDERGRADUATE ADMISSIONS 57 Those classified incorrectly as residents are subject to reclassification as nonresi\u00ad dents. If incorrect classification results from false or concealed facts, the student is subject to University discipline and is required to pay all back fees he would have been charged as a nonresident. Resident students who become nonresidents must immediately notify the Attorney in Residence Matters or his deputy. A change in classification with respect to a previous quarter is not possible. Medical and Physical Examinations All new students are required to have a completed medical_ examination performed by their own physician within 90 days of enrollment. In addition, each student must present a certificate verifying successful vaccination against smallpox within three years prior to registration and a report of a tuberculosis skin test and recent tetanus immunization. In a few specialized curricula, students may be required to have additional examination and supplemental immunization which will be per\u00ad formed by the Student Health Service. Students returning to the University after an absence of two or more quarters are required to have a health clearance by the Student Health Service before their en\u00ad rollment is completed. Students absent from the campus as participants in the Uni\u00ad versity's Education Abroad Program must comply with this requirement upon their return to the campus. ************************************************* Why put off the care of your teeth-your best friends?

Additional information concerning registration and academic policies applying only to graduate students is given under the Graduate Division section. REGISTRATION AND ENROLLMENT Only after a student is officially admitted may he register for classes. To receive academic credit every student must complete the following procedure: Consult academic advisor and secure approval for enrollment in classes if re\u00ad quired; file completed class enrollment and information cards with the Regis- trar's Office; pay fees at the Cashier's Office (including all outstanding debts). The Schedule of Courses is provided by the Registrar's Office with registration materials approximately six weeks before the beginning of each quarter. A quarter\u00ad ly calendar of registration and enrollment deadlines and the latest registration infor mation are included in each issue. See page 65 for information on course load limits. Class Verification and Identification Card After payment of fees and enrollment in classes each student receives a Class Verifi\u00ad cation and Identification Card which is evidence that he is a registered student at UCI and which entitles him to library privileges, student health card, and other University privileges. In addition, the card provides identification for Associated Student functions. If the validated card is lost, a duplicate may be obtained from the Registrar's Office upon application and payment of $3 to the Cashier's Office. Late Registration and Enrollment Students who do not register (pay fees) and enroll in classes within the deadline limits, including those who are allowed to apply late, are required to pay a late reg\u00ad istration and enrollment fee ($25). These fines are assessed to help pay for the addi\u00ad tional expense associated with processing late transactions and may not be waived. All fees are due and payable in advance and must be paid in full before official en\u00ad rollment in classes will be completed. Students are therefore urged to registe.r (pay fees) and enroll within the published deadline dates. Students with financial need should make advance arrangements with the Financial Aids Office to have funds available when their fees are due. Change of Class Enrollment After an official Preferred Program card has been filed with the Registrar's Office, a student may add or drop courses or change sections of a course by executing a Change in Course Enrollment available from his academic dean's office. During the first two weeks after the beginning of a quarter, the student may enroll in additional courses. To do so, the student must obtain a change of course enroll- UC IRVINE - 1972-1973REGISTRATION PROCEDURES 59 ment card from his dean's office and have it signed by his instructor. The student then returns the card to his dean's office. After the second week, no courses may be added or changed without the approval of the dean of the student's school. To drop a course during the first six weeks of the quarter, it is necessary to obtain the instructor's signature and to file the change of course enrollment card with the dean's office. To drop a course after the sixth week, the dean's approval is needed, and will be given only to students not failing the course and not subject to academ\u00ad ic disqualification. There is a $3 fee for adding or dropping a course after the sec\u00ad ond week. Every student enrolled in a laboratory course in which equipment is issued is re\u00ad sponsible for the equipment when dropping a course and will not be permitted to drop until the equipment is accounted for. Each student is responsible for his official enrollment and must be officially en\u00ad rolled in each class for which he expects credit, and he must officially drop classes he has ceased attending. The student cannot simply discontinue his attendance in a class; he must file a change in course enrollment card, or he will receive an \"F\" grade in the class. \u00b7 BAR FROM REGISTRATION A student may be barred from registering for classes for the following reasons: Failure to respond to official notices; failure to settle financial obligation when\u00b7 due or to make satisfactory arrangements with the Business Office; failure to complete the physical examination; failure to present certification 'of degrees/ status on leaving previous institution{s); failure to comply with admission conditions. Each student who becomes subject to a \"bar-from-registration action\" is given ad\u00ad vance notice and ample time to deal with the situation. However, if the student fails to respond, action will be taken without further notice, and he is entitled to no further services of the University except assistance toward reinstatement. STUDENT RECORDS Records are held in strict confidence and released only upon a student's specific written r~quest except that public information such as the following is released (unless the student requests the information be withheld): periods of enrollment, degrees awarded, and addresses. It is extremely important for each student to keep the Registrar's Office currently informed as changes occur to assure that accurate and complete records are main\u00ad tained for his benefit. To facilitate this updating, a Personal Data Sheet is included in each term's registration packet which allows students to examine and update their personal data. Furthermore, after the drop and add period each quarter, every student is provided with a record of his current term enrollment to insure the accu\u00ad racy of his official enrollment. Students are urged to officially report to the Regis\u00ad trar's Office all changes in personal data and enrollment data. Transcript of Records A fee is charged for each transcript of a student's record. Applications for a tran\u00ad script of record should be submitted to the Registrar's Office several days in ad\u00ad vance of the time needed. Transcripts will be released only upon signed request of the student; an application for a transcript must bear the student's signature. UC IRVINE - 1972-197360 REGISTRATION PROCEDURES SPECIAL PROCEDURES Readmission: undergraduates only We strongly urge students to consider the policy below in formulating plans for leaving or returning to UCI. Every effort will be made to readmit UCI students who were in good academic standing at the time of dropping out and who have filed readmission applications. Readmission is not automatic. A student must file a readmission application at least eight weeks prior to the quarter in which he wants readmission. However, a student who withdraws during a current quarter and wishes to apply for readmission to the next consecutive quarter may submit his application to the Registrar's Office not later than two weeks before the next quarter begins. If a student has been dismissed from the University or if he has left the University while on probation or subject to dismissal, he must apply for readmission in the manner prescribed above. His application, however, will be forwarded to the dean of the school which he hopes to enter. If the dean decides that the student is seri\u00ad ous about his academic life, and/or that the student has displayed capability at an\u00ad other academic institution, the student will most likely be allowed readmission to the University. Transcripts for work taken at other institutions must be submitted as part of the application. A nonrefundable fee of $20 is charged for each application for readmis\u00b7 sion.' Remittance by bank draft or money order, payable to The Regents of the University of California, must be attached to the application. Intercampus Transfer: undergraduates only An undergraduate student in good standing can transfer from the UCI campus to other campuses of the University of California. To do so, the student should first check with the Registrar to see which of the campuses are accepting transfers and which majors are being encouraged by each campus. The student then obtains an Intercampus Transfer Application form from the Registrar's Office and files the form with his home campus registrar by the deadline prescribed for the quarter in which the student wishes to transfer. The deadlines are March 1 for fall quarter, September 1 for the winter quarter, and December 1 for the spring quarter. A stu\u00ad dent may apply for only one campus in any given quarter. A fee of $20.00 is re\u00ad quired for all Intercampus Transfer Applications filed with the Registrar's Office. Withdrawal from the University A student withdrawing from the University during the quarter must file notice of withdiawal and turn in his identification card to the Registrar's Office before leav\u00ad ing the campus. In cases of ilhiess or emergency, notice of withdrawal should be made as soon as the student decides not to continue. (A schedule of reimburse\u00ad ments is found on p. 68 under \"Fees and Expenses.\") If necessary, a student may mail his notice of withdrawal and his identification card to the Registrar's Office. A student must file a notice of withdrawal. If he fails to do so, the student will receive failing grades in all courses and severely jeopardize his standing at the Uni\u00ad versity. If a student has completed a quarter and does not plan to return the follow\u00ad ing quarter, a withdrawal form is not necessary. UC IRVINE - 1972-1973ACADEMIC POLICIES 61 ACADEMIC POLICIES GRADING The grades a student receives are in direct relation to the caliber of his class work and are given in accordance with the following standards of the Academic Senate: A Excellent (4.0 grade points per unit) B Good (3.0 grade points per unit) C Average (2.0 grade points per unit) D Lowest passing grade (1.0 grade point per unit) F Not passing (no grade points) Incomplete P Pass (equal to grade Cor better) NP Not Pass S Satisfactory (graduate students only, equal to grade B or better) U Unsatisfactory (graduate students only) J Restricted to certain sequential courses, as approved by the Committee on Educational Policy, in which the finalquarter grade of a multiquarter se\u00ad quence course is assigned to the previous quarter(s) of the sequence. At the end of each quarter, the student is given a copy of his permanent record. On the copy, the student will find grades for all the quarters he has taken at UCI, a computation of his grade point average at the University of California, and a list of the University requirements he has completed (Subject A, American History and Institutions, etc.). ' It should be noted that final grades as reported by professors-at UCI are permanent and final. A professor may not change a final grade except to correct a clerical error. Incomplete Grades \"I\" or incomplete grades are granted by a professor to a student according to the conditions stated in Regulation 7 80 of the Regulations of the Academic Senate. Generally the \"I\" grade may be given when the student's work is of passing quality, but is incomplete because of circumstances beyond the. student's control, and when he has been excused in advance from completing the quarter's work. There is no time limit for making up an incomplete grade. To remove an \"I\" grade, the student should not re-enroll in the course but should have his instructor submit a change of grade form to the Registrar's Office. 'y UC IRVINE - 1972-197362 ACADEMIC POLICIES Effective fall quarter 1968, the incomplete grade is not computed in the student's quarterly grade point average. The incomplete grade is looked upon as simply a course which the student attempted and could not complete. There is an exception to the rule. University of California regulations require that an undergraduate stu\u00ad dent have a 2.0 grade point average for all units attempted at the University and an accumulation of 180 units or 45 courses. Incompletes, therefore, must be counted when computing the grade point average of a senior preparing to graduate. At such a computation, all incomplete grades must be counted as \"F.\" If the student's over\u00b7 all average is at least a 2.0 including the incomplete grades computed as F's, then the student may graduate. If the incomplete grades computed as F's decrease the student's average below a 2.0, then he may not graduate until he has made up enough incomplete grades to bring his average up to a 2.0. \u00b7 J Grades J is a continuing grade which is restricted to sequential courses which extend over two or more quarters, indicating that the final grade for the individual quarters will not be assigned until the last quarter of the sequence is completed. The grade for the final quarter is then assigned for all of the previous quarters of the sequence. No credit is given until the student has completed the entire sequence. J grades are restricted to certain sequential courses approved by the Committee on Educational Policy. UC IRVINE - 1972-1973ACADEMIC POLICIES 63 Pass/Not Pass At UCI, a Pass/Not Pass option is offered to undergraduate and graduate students. The purpose of the Pass/Not Pass option is to encourage students to enroll in courses outside their major fields. Under the Pass/Not Pass system, the student can receive either a Passing grade or a Not Passing grade and his cumulative grade point average will not suffer. If a student receives a \"Pass\" in a class, he receives course credit for the class. If he receives a \"Not Pass,\" he receives no credit for the class. Below are listed six regulations conceming the use of the Pass/Not Pass option. 1. On the average, only one course per quarter may be taken with the Pass/Not Pass option. The student may not exceed 12 classes taken on a Pass/Not Pass basis, and the number of these classes may not exceed the number of quarters the stu\u00ad dent has attended UCI. 2. A student who earns a grade of \"C\" or better will have a Pass/Not Pass grade recorded as \"Pass.\" Units thus eamed shall be counted in satisfaction of degree requirements. If the student eams a, grade of \"D\" or \"F,\" his grade shall be re\u00ad corded as a \"Not Pass,\" and he will receive no credit for the course. In both cases, the student's grade will not be computed into the grade point average. 3. Courses taken under the Pass/Not Pass option count toward the 180 quarter units or 45 cour_ses required for graduation and toward meeting the general Uni\u00ad versity breadth requirement. However, such courses may not be used to satisfy specific course requirements of the school or department, unless authorized by the dean of the student's school. 4. Changes to or from the Pass/Not Pass option must be made during the enroll\u00ad ment period. No changes can be made after the first two weeks of arquarter without the dean's approval. 5. No student on academic probation may enroll in a course on the Pass/Not Pass option. 6. Graduate students may not use Pass/Not Pass courses to apply toward any de- gree requirements. Satisfactory /Unsatisfactory: graduates only Individual study or other individual graduate work undertaken by a graduate stu\u00ad dent may be evaluated by means of the grades S (Satisfactory) or U (Unsatisfac\u00ad tory). No credit will be allowed for work graded Unsatisfactory. A Satisfactory grade is considered to be a \"B\" grade or higher. NR (Not Reported) Grades An \"NR\" (Not Reported) grade means that the student was on a grading sheet for a certain class and that no grade was tumed in. There are many reasons for receiving an \"NR.\" The student should clear up all \"NR\" markings immediately by con\u00ad tacting his instructor since all \"NR\" grades tum to \"F\" grades after one quarter on the student's record. Removal of Deficient Grades Undergraduates may repeat courses only when grades of D, F, or NP were received. Degree credit for courses so repeated will be given only once but the grade assigned at each enrollment shall be permanently recorded. In computing the grade point average of an undergradu-ate with repeat courses, in which he received a D, F, or NP, UC IRVINE - 1972-197364 ACADEMIC POLICIES only the most recently received grades and grade points shall be used for the first 16 units repeated. In case of further repetitions, the grade point average shall be .based on all grades assigned and on total units attempted. Grade Points and Grade-Point Average Grade points are assigned on a four point basis: A, 4 points per unit; B, 3 points per unit; C, 2 points per unit; D, 1 point per unit; F and I, zero points. Each undergrad\u00ad uate course counts 2-4 units, and graduate courses range from 1 to 12 units each (see departmental course descriptions). Grade-point average is computed by divid\u00ad ing the total number of grade points earned by the total unit value of courses at\u00ad tempted. P, NP, S, U, NR, and I grades are excluded in computing grade-point average. CREDIT BY EXAMINATION An enrolled student in good standing may obtain credit for courses by taking spe\u00ad cial examinations at stated intervals. Lists of courses offered for Credit by Examina\u00ad tion\u00b7 are available from the dean of each school. Some courses are offered for Credit by Examination only on a Pass/Not Pass basis; others are offered on a letter grade basis. A student may take the examination for a particular course only one time. After receiving the grade, the student may accept it or reject it. For example, if here\u00ad ceives an \"F\" on the examination, he may choose not to receive credit or a grade. If the student does choose to accept the results of the examination, grades and grade points will be entered on the student's permanent record in the same manner as regular courses of instruction. A student wishing to take a course by examination must obtain a petition from his dean's office or the Registrar's Office and have it signed by the dean of the school offering the course. INDEPENDENTSTUDY:UNDERGRADUATESONLY Another class option is available primarily to upper-division students at UCI. The option, independent study, allows the student to plan with his instructor a course having a clear relationship to the student's academic program. The plan for the course will include a reading list, a group of assignments, examinations, papers, or similar evidence of intellectual achievement on which academic credit will be based. A description of the course and of its requirements must be approved by the in\u00ad structor responsible for it and by the department chairman or dean. Independent study credit for undergraduates is limited to five UI_l,its per quarter. FINAL EXAMINATIONS Final examinations are obligatory in all undergraduate courses except laboratory courses, or their equivalent, as individually determined by the Committee on Edu\u00ad cational Policy. Each such examination shall be cond_ycted in writing, whenever practicable, and must be completed by all participants within the announced time shown in the Schedule of Courses for the quarter in question. These examinations may not exceed three hours duration. In laboratory courses, the department con\u00ad cerned may at its option require a final examination subject to prior announcement in the Schedule of Courses for the term. Final grade reports from professors are due in the Registrar's Office within 48 hours after the final examination. UC IRVINE - 1972-1973ACADEMIC'POLICIES 65 UNDERGRADUATE SCHOLARSillP REQUIREMENTS Course Load Limits An undergraduate student may take as few as three courses or as many as five courses per quarter. It should be noted that a student cannot complete the 180 units necessary for graduation by taking three classes every quarter. If a student wishes to take more than five or less than three courses per quarter, he must have his schedule approved by the dean of his school. A change in course en\u00ad rollment card can be obtained from the dean's office and must be signed by the student's dean. Lineal progress toward completion of the 180 units required for graduation would imply that a student should complete 45 units during each of his four years. How\u00ad ever, UCI regulations allow for the possibility of somewhat slower progress on the freshman leveL The Selective Service Office considers three academic courses (12 units) the mini\u00ad mum for a full-time student. Good Standing For good standing and for graduation, an undergraduate must earn at least twice as many grade points as the value of course work attempted or, in simpler terms, a 2.0 average. In addition, the student must complete a sufficient number of units to make progress toward graduation within twelve quarters. If a student does not maintain a 2.0 grade point average and earn a specific number of units while at the University of California; he falls under one of the following categories. Probation An undergraduate student is normally subject to academic probation if at the end of any quarter his grade point average for that quarter, or his cumulative grade point average, is less than a 2.'0. Additionally, if he does not maintain normal prog\u00ad ress (at least 36 units by the end of freshman year, 80 by the end of sophomore year, 128 by the end of junior year and 180 by the end of senior year) he is subject to academic probation. A student will be allowed to continue on probation only if his record indicates that he is likely to achieve the required scholastic standing with\u00ad in a reasonable time. Subject to Disqualifica~ion A student whose grade point average falls below a 1.5 for any quarter, or who after one quarter on probation has net achieved-a cumulative grade point average of 2.0, is subject to disqualification. Additionally, a student who earns fewer than 25 units by the end of his freshman year, fewer than 73 by the end of his sophomore year, and fewer than 125 by the end of his junior year is subject to disqualification. Probation is not a necessary step before disqualification. If a student becomes sub\u00ad ject to disqualification, his grades and records will be carefully reviewed by a facul\u00ad ty committee which will consider the student's total performance and decide whether the student shall remain at the University. In order to transfer from one campus to another in the University of California, a student who has been dismissed or who is on academic probation must obtain the approval of the appropriate faculty or its designated agent into whose jurisdiction he seeks to transfer. UC IRVINE - 1972-197366 ACADEMIC POLICIES CONCURRENT ENROLLMENT \u00b7 Concurrent enrollment in regular sessions at another institution or in University Extension while enrolled on the Irvine campus is permitted only when approved in advance by the dean of the student's school.

The full fee is required of all students regardless of the number of courses taken. This fee, which must be paid at the time of registration, covers certain expenses of students for use of athletic and gymnasium facilities and equipment, for certain laboratory fees, and for such con\u00ad sultation, medical advice and hospital care, or dispensary treatment as can be pro\u00ad vided by the Student Health Service. No part of this fee is remitted to students who may not desire to make use of all or any of these privileges. The $50 advance deposit on the registration fee (Statement of Intention to Register fee), required of new undergraduates, is applied to the full fee when the student registers. Contin\u00ad uing students are required to pay all outstanding fines and other debts, in full, at the time they pay their registration fee for an upcoming term.

Appropriate graduate degrees at the Master's and Doctor's levels, both those emphasizing the creative arts and creative scholarship and those empha\u00ad sizing technical proficiency, are offered. See page 21 for a listing of degrees offered. The graduate student will be given full opportunity to further his development in a chosen discipline by course and seminar work and by research and other creative work; to achieve excellence in such resources as English, foreign languages, mathe\u00ad matics, bibliography, and computer techniques; to develop some knowledge of the history of his broad area of interest; and to acquire some understanding of higher education in this country and some guided experience in teaching. Requirements for good standing and for the award of a higher degree are those. of the University of California as a whole, supplemented by specific requirements of the Graduate Division, the school, and the department of specialization. See school or department writeups for their specific requirements. The Master's Degree The M.A. or M.S. is normally attained by one of two routes: Plan I, a thesis; or Plan II, a comprehensive examination. Both require a minimum of one year of residence on the campus, a certain number of courses maintained at a B average, and an appropriate demonstration of achievement. Plan I includes course work, of which a certain amount must be at the graduate level, a thesis, and, usually, general exami\u00ad nation in the particular field of study. Under Plan II, further course work replaces the thesis, and an examination covering a broader range of subject matter is admini\u00ad stered. Opportunities for special preparation in teaching, as well as guided experi\u00ad ence in actual teaching, will be offered by most departments. Other Master's Degrees, awarded for professional competence and often requiring more extended work, are also offered. School and departmental statements should be examined for details. The Doctor of Philosophy This degree is awarded on the basis of evidence that the recipient possesses knowl\u00ad edge of a broad field of learning and expert mastery of a particular sector of it. It is not a reward for diligence but an indication of critical judgment, synthetic under\u00ad standing, and imaginative creativity. The dissertation is expected to demonstrate such abilities. Other Doctor's Degrees, marking professional attainment, and with ~ correspondingly different emphasis, are also being offered. The M.D. is offered \u00b7 through the College of Medicine. The candidate for the doctorate is expected to be in full-time residence on the campus for two years. Three to five years of full-time academic work beyond the Bachelor's Degree is normally required to complete the degree. During the first year or two of graduate work, the student is normally guided by a departmental advisor. When judged ready by the department, often aided by preparatory examinations, UC IRVINE - 1972-197372 GRADUATE DIVISION the student is encouraged to qualify for candidacy for the Doctor's Degree. At this , time, a committee is appointed by the Dean of the Graduate Division, and it hence\u00ad forth supervises his graduate program. GRADUATE ADMISSIONS Admission to the Graduate Division is by the Dean of the Graduate Division on the advice of the department. A Bachelor's Degree, or the equivalent, with adequate coverage and academic excellence, is a prerequisite. Students are invited to consult the department of interest for details on necessary background; deficiencies can sometimes be overcome by taking further specified undergraduate work. \u00b7 Requirements Students seeking admission to graduate status at the University of California must hold a bachelor's degree or its equivalent from an institution of acceptable standing. The program of preparation should be substantially equivalent, both in the distri\u00ad bution of academic subject matter and in scholarship achievement, to the require- . ments for a comparable degree at the University of California. The Dean of the Graduate Division and the school or department of specialization evaluate appll<:;a\u00ad tions and formal preparation for the graduate field of study with specific refe.r_~I_Ice to the previous college record, letters of recommendation, and the results of the Graduate Record Examination or like indicators of achievement in graduate work. Normally, only stude11ts working toward a higher degree can be admitted. Excep\u00ad tions are students working toward California Teaching Credentials. When to Apply- Application forms for admission to graduate status are available upon request from the Office of Graduate Admissions, University of California, Irvine, California 92664. For applicants residing in the United States, applications must be on file no later than july 1 for the fall quarter, November 1 for the winter quarter, and jan\u00ad uary 1 for the spring quarter. Although these are official deadlines, applications\u00b7 , normally should be submitted well in advance of these dates, particularly in the case of students desiring financial assistance. The application deadline for financial aid is February 1. How to Apply The Graduate Division requires two complete sets of official records covering all work attempted, together with official evidence of degrees conferred, from all insti\u00ad tutions of college level attended, including any campus of the University of Cali\u00ad fornia, regardless of length of attendance. To be official, records must bear the Registrar's signature and the seal of the issuing institution, and should be sent directly from the issuing institution. A summary of credit transferred and recorded on the transcript record issued by the institution granting the degree will not suf\u00ad fice, except in the case of graduates of the University of California. Undergraduates at UCI may have two copies of their complete undergraduate record sent to gradu\u00ad ate admissions. In the absence of official records and official evidence of graduation or degree, registration cannot be permitted. One set of transcripts of record and all other credentials are retained permanently in the files of the Graduate Division for applicants accepted for admission, and they may not be withdrawn and used by students for any purpose. The second set is forwarded to the appropriate depart\u00ad ment, retained there, and may be used by the student in conferring with depart\u00ad mental advisors. Individual departments may have special requirements for admis\u00ad sion to graduate status. UC IRVINE - 1972-1973GRADUATE DIVISION 73 The application must be accompanied by a $20 application fee in the form of a check, draft, or money order for the exact amount and made payable to The Regents of the University of California. In order to process applications in time for the scheduled registration days, it is necessary that complete and official transcripts be received before the above deadlines. Applications received after these deadlines will be considered only if time and circumstances permit and may be deferred for consideration for the following quarter. In any case, the applicant may be liable for an additional late registration fee. In cases where students have work in progress by the deadline dates given above, final transcripts covering such work must be re\u00b7 ceived before registration can be permitted. Applications of such students will be considered on an individual basis and special late registration dates may be assigned. Notification A formal notice of admission or rejection is sent to each applicant as soon as pos\u00b7 sible after his application and complete records are received. All applicants, there\u00b7 fore, are advised to await official notification of admission from the Graduate Division before making definite plans or arrangements for attending the University. Readmission A student who is absent for one quarter or more must file an Application for Read\u00b7 mission which may be obtained from the Office of Graduate Admissions. A fee of $20.00 must accompany the application. This application is subject to the approval of the student's major department and the Dean of the Graduate Division. Admission for Foreign Students Foreign students are held to the same regulations affecting admission and candidacy as are students from the United States. As it normally takes much longer to obtain credentials and process foreign applications, foreign students are urged to apply at least six months prior to the deadline dates. Every foreign student from a non\u00ad English speaking country must take the TOEFL (Testing of English as a Foreign Language) Examination. Further information on this requirement and other pro\u00ad visions for foreign students may be obtained on request from the Office of Grad\u00ad uate Admissions. Limited Status Under certain conditions students holding a Bachelor's Degree are permitted to register in Limited Status in order to pursue various educational objectives. Al\u00ad though Limited Status is an undergraduate classification, only those applicants who have applied to the Graduate Division and were subsequently recommended for Limited Status may register in this category. Such students may enroll in graduate courses only by special arrangement and under no circumstances will credit earned in Limited Status be counted toward a graduate degree. Furthermore, a student who has been refused admission to the Graduate Division on the basis of a low scholastic record cannot use his record in Limited Status to improve his grade-point average and thereby qualify for graduate status. Intercampus Exchange Program for Graduate Students A graduate student registered on any campus of the University who wishes to take advantage of educational opportunities available only at another campus of the University may, with the approval of his advisor and the Dean of the Graduate Divi\u00ad sion of his home campus and with approval of the Dean of the Graduate Division on the campus visited, become an intercampus Exchange Graduate Student for one UC IRVINE - 1972-197374 GRADUATE DIVISION Encampment of the Malvern Hill Post, Grand Army of the Republic, of Anaheim, at Anaheim Landing in 1887. or more quarters. This program will also include those students who take courses on more than one campus of the University in the same quarter. Application forms for the Intercampus Exchange Program for Graduate Students may be obtained from the Office of the Dean of the Graduate Division on the stu\u00ad dent's home campus. REGISTRATION For general registration requirements, see pages 58-60. The following requirements apply to graduate students only. Every graduate student in good standing, unless granted a formal leave of absence or honorable dismissal by the Dean of the Graduate Division, will be required to register with the Registrar of his campus each quarter until the completion of all requirements for the degree or credential for which he is working. Failure to regis\u00ad ter or to obtain formal permission to leave the University will constitute presump\u00ad tive evidence that a student has withdrawn from the Graduate Division. No grad\u00ad uate student should fail to register for any quarter without first obtaining the leave appropriate to his situation. In case of doubt, the student should seek advice from the Graduate Division. The regulations pertaining to candidates for higher degrees are as follows: 1. If the student plans to be in residence on the campus, he must register as a regu\u00ad lar student. 2. Even if the student plans to be away from the campus during the quarter, but in UC IRVINE - 1972-1973GRADUATE DIVISION 75 correspondence with his department and in an instructional relationship with his advisors, he must register as a regular student. 3. If the student plans to be away from the campus for a specific period of time, and to have no connection with the University during that specific period, he must apply for a leave of absence. 4. Candidates for the Master's Degree or Doctorate who have completed all degree requirements including the residence requirements, and who are taking no fur\u00ad ther work in resident courses or in research may, if they are engaged in writing the thesis or dissertation or in preparing for the final examination, register for thesis or examination only. ACADEMIC POLICIES Continuous Registration A candidate for a higher degree is required to register each quarter until all degree requirements are fulfilled (including the thesis or dissertation and final examina\u00ad tion). Unless granted an official leave of absence, a graduate student who does not officially register for a quarter will be considered to have withdrawn from the Uni\u00ad versity. If a student leaves the University within a term, he must obtain official approval to withdraw or he will receive nonpassing grades for all courses for which he is enrolled. Academic Residence A graduate student is considered to be in academic residence in order to satisfy the minimum residence requirement for any higher degree or certificate issued by the University, if he is registered for and completes a minimum of one course (four quarter units or the equivalent) in graduate or upper-division work during any regu\u00ad lar University term. Waiver of residence requirements will be at the discretion of the Dean.of the Graduate Division. Leave of Absence A leave of absence may be granted only if a student has completed a minimum of one quarter with at least a B average. Leaves are normally granted for not more than one year and must be approved by the academic department and the Graduate Division. Students who are on leave may not make use of University facilities and may not place demands upon the faculty. Forms are available in the Graduate Divi\u00ad sion. Standard of Scholarship All graduate students are expected to maintain at least a B average in all courses applicable to advanced degrees. Transfer of Credit Under certain conditions up to one-fifth of the minimum course requirement for the Master's Degree may be allowed for work taken in graduate status at another institution of high standing. (This does not apply to another branch of the Univer\u00ad sity of California.) Please refer to your departmental requirements for the particular minimum course requirement in your area. Summer Session Credit from the Summer Session may be obtained by students who have been ad\u00ad mitted to the Graduate Division. UC IRVINE - 1972-197376 GRADUATE DIVISION FINANCIAL-AIDS FOR GRADUATE STUDENTS In order to be eligible for any graduate fellowship, assistantship, or traineeship, the applicant must have demonstrated superior scholastic ability and must have been approved for admission as a graduate student on the Irvine campus of the Univer\u00ad sity, or must be a currently enrolled graduate student at UCI. The acceptance of a graduate fellowship or scholarship presumes that the recipient will devote himself to a. full-time study and research program. Any exceptions must be approved by the Dean of the Graduate Division in advance. It is strongly recommended that all applicants for scholarships, fellowships, and traineeships take the Graduate Record Examination. Applications for national competition fellowship programs must be submitted directly to the agency involved on their own application forms. Applica\u00ad tion for fellowship awards administered by UCI (as listed in a detailed brochure, available on request) should be submitted on the Application for Graduate Support form. Applications for loans, work-study, or University Grants-in-Aid can be ob\u00ad tained from the Office of Financial Aids. -The Application for Graduate Support should be made concurrently, approxi\u00ad mately 9 to 12 months prior to the effective date of admission and/or support. Deadline for submission is February 1 for awards commencing the following fall. Please note that most scholarship awards are made for the academic year, while most federal fellowships are tenable for a full year, should the recipient and this institution determine that this is beneficial for his proposed program of study. The University of California, Irvine, does not send out notification of non-service awards until April 1 (preceding the fall quarter). These awards must be firmly accepted or declined, in writing, by April 15. Teaching and Research Assistantships In addition to fellowships and traineeships, there are Teaching and Research Assist\u00ad antships available in most departments with stipends for half-time employment of a Teaching Assistant (an academic year appointment) of approximately $3,400 and of a Research Assistant (if an 11-month appointment) of approximately $3,600. Applicants for these appointments should contact the chairman of the department in which appointment is sought. Nonacademic Employment Students interested in nonacademic employment should contact the Office of Financial Aids, 1441 Library-Administration Building, UC Irvine. Graduate Loans The National Defense Student Loan Program provides loans for graduate students pursuing a full-time program of study. Prospective as well as enrolled students may apply through the Office of Financial Aids, 1441 Library-Administration Building. University Grant-in-Aid Program The University Grant-in-Aid Program is a program of assistance for students with a demonstrable financial need. Information and application forms can be obtained from the Office of Financial Aids, 1441 Library-Administration Building. A detailed list of availablt; fellowships and scholarships will be included in your application packet or you\u00b7 may obtain this information by writing to Graduate Admissions.

It is important to the future welfare of mankind that educated men and women appreciate the contributions of the biological sciences to man's intellectual development, material progress, and ethical and aesthetic senses. In keeping with the responsibilities of the University, the School encourages vigorous faculty and student research programs. It strongly believes that excellence in research is essential for effective, enthusiastic, and up-to-date teaching. The undergraduate program of the School serves both as a preprofessional major for students planning careers in the biological and biomedical sciences and as a liberal arts major for an increasing number of students who seek a scientific education. The program is designed to provide a broad academic base suitable for many ca\u00ad reers. Graduates have found their way into a number of professions including bio\u00ad logical and biomedical research, teaching, medicine and its allied health fields, and law. It is a rigorous and rewarding program which requires a serious commitment from the student. It can also help him discover his capabilities. The School offers majors and nonmajors the opportunity to study man and his environment, the control of development, the nature of learning and memory, the mechanism of gene action, and other central problems of contemporary science. The undergraduate program presents the biological sciences as an integrated area of study. It includes a central Core program, which develops the-major concepts of biology, and satellite courses which allow for specialization. This program provides the essential background for subsequent graduate specialization. Introductory courses for nonmajors are designed to make -the biological sciences meaningful and interesting and to inform intelligent citizens of biological phenomena that affect their daily lives. Graduate courses are offered in all the departments. Special research resources administered by the School of Biological Sciences include the following: Museum of Systematic Biology, a teaching and research facility which presently contains material on local populations of fishes, plants, insects, and mammals; Center for Pathobiology, an information unit devoted to the study of abnormal and normal development and the application of the results of such studies to pest control and pollution; The Irvine Arboretum, a botanic garden facility plan\u00ad ned to keep records of all material planted on the campus as well as to be used for experimental and teaching purposes; and The San joaquin Freshwater Marsh Re\u00ad serve, supporting an undisturbed marsh biota. The School, through the Marine Biol\u00ad ogy Coordinating Committee, is developing marine research and teaching facilities. In addition, a marine biological laboratory has been constructed on Santa Catalina UC IRVINE - 1972-197380 BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES Island as a joint universities' project under the administrative direction of the Allan Hancock Foundation of the University of Sol.!thern California. See page 14 for fur\u00b7 ther information on instructional and research facilities. The School of Biological Sciences welcomes student participation in all of its activ\u00ad ities. An exciting and integral part of the School is the Dean's Council, an auton\u00ad omous student group which prov:ides additional liaison between administration, faculty, and students. Some of its activities include interaction of students and fac\u00ad ulty in academic and social functions, evaluation of faculty and courses, initiation and implementation of new courses, motivation programs for high school minority students, conservation awareness programs, and other related areas. Full informa\u00ad tion on the Council, of which all biological sciences students are members, is avail\u00ad able in the Biological Sciences Office of Student Affairs in Room 335, Steinhaus Hall. Students intending to major or go to graduate school in the School of Biological Sciences should obtain a copy of A Guide to the Biological Sciences from the Stu\u00ad dent Affairs Office of the School. Advisors and Advising Systems The Biological Sciences Student Affairs Office coordinates the advising program which is divided into two areas: program checking and career planning. The former is handled in the Student Affairs Office and the latter by individual faculty mem\u00ad bers. An advisor is assigned to each student when he enters the School. Advisors are happy to discuss programs, goals, ambitions, and problems with their advisees. If a student's interests change, or if he wishes to change his advisor for any reason, he should not be hesitant about making this step. It can be arranged by making are- quest in the Biological Sciences Student Affairs Office. \u00b7 Students must have their advisors' signatures on approval cards by the first week of classes or the computer will automatically cancel all of their classes. Research Enrichment Program The REP is open to highly qualified freshmen and sophomores who are planning a career in either health or life science research. The program offers the students spe\u00ad cial seminars, training in general biological laboratory techniques, and the oppor\u00ad tunity to conduct original research and discuss their research with their peers and research advisors. It is expected that every student will broaden his scientific experi\u00ad ence by attending either a research institute during one summer or another UC campus for one quarter. Admission into the program will be based on the quality of a written essay, overall academic record, and an interview. Degrees Offered in the School Biological Sciences .............................. B.S., M.A.T., M.S., Ph.D. with opportunities to specialize in Developmental and Cell Biology, Molecular Biology and Biochemistry, Population and Environmental Biology, and Psycho\u00ad biology Of the graduating seniors, approximately 1% will be awarded summa cum laude, 3% magna cum laude, and 8% cum laude. Those students who graduate with an overall grade point average of 3.5 or better while carrying three or more graded courses per quarter for a minimum of six quarters will have their names inscribed on a perma\u00ad nent plaque in Steinhaus Hall. UC IRVINE - 1972-1973BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES.81 In addition to the above honors, the School offers courses numbered 199 to stu\u00ad dents in their junior or senior years. These 199 courses provide the interested stu\u00ad dent with a singular opportunity to conduct original research. Each student will submit a paper describing his research early in May of his senior year. At that time he will also present a 1 0-minute talk with a 5-minute question-and-answer period before an audience of the Honors Committee, his sponsor, all interested faculty, and the other students conducting research that year. On the basis of these and other criteria, the Honors Committee will select certain individuals to receive Hon\u00ad ors in the Biological Sciences Seals on their diplomas . . An annual Edward A. Steinhaus Award is given each spring to an outstanding gradu\u00ad ate teaching assistant to be chosen by a committee composed of undergraduate students, faculty members, representatives from the administration, and Mrs. Steinhaus. Requirements for the Bachelor of Science Degree University Requirements: See page 22. School Requirements: Biological Sciences Core Curriculum {101A-B-C-D-E-F-G, I 02A-B-C-D-E-F); minimum of three satellite courses; Chemistry Humanities 1A-B-C; Mathematics 2A-B-C; Physics 3A-B-C or 5A-B-C. \\ Planning a Program of Study Biological sciences courses are built upon a base of the physical sciences. Majors, therefore, should take Chemistry 1A-B-C, Mathematics 2A-B-C, and Physics 3A-B-C concurrently with their biology and preferably during their freshman and sophomore years. Breadth requirements are: six courses in a school or program outside of the biolog\u00ad ical sciences major (this is more than covered by the 12 required courses in chemis\u00ad try, mathematics, and physics in the School of Physical Sciences); three courses in any of the following areas, and three courses in a second area: Administration, Comparative Culture, Engineering, Fine Arts, Humanities, Information and Com\u00ad puter Science, Social Ecology, and Social Sciences. In realization of the tremendous impact biology is having upon matters of public policy and society in general and the importance of society's reaction to the dis\u00ad coveries being made in the biological sciences, biological sciences students are en\u00ad couraged to study the social sciences, humanities, and fine arts. In addition, the abilitys.to read literature of science in French, German, Russia:e, or Spanish is desirable. Premedical students and other students desiring to enter the health sciences should have their programs \u00b7checked in the Biological Sciences Student Affairs Office, Room 335, Steinhaus Hall. They should also check deadlines for taking the Medical College Aptitude Test or other required tests, which should be taken in the spring of the junior year. It is possible for a student to graduate with a double major by fulfilling the require\u00ad ments of any two schools. A double major in Biological Sciences and in Chemistry is recommended for those planning a graduate career in Molecular Biology and Bio\u00ad chemistry. For students interested in Biology and Engineering, it is possible to take a course of study which will give a major in both subjects. This program is intended UC IRVINE - 1972-197382 BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES for students interested in a career in Environmental Management. Details are given under the School of Engineering, page 261. Consult with the Biological Sciences Student Affairs Office for advice on planning a program. Sample Programs All courses in boldface are required of majors; others are highly recommended.

Premedical, predental, and other paramedical students should choose electives in psychology, possibly a foreign language, quantitative analysis, physical chemistry, or other specific courses recommended by graduate and medical schools. Students planning a career in elementary or secondary teaching may choose electives among education courses in their junior and senior years. See Planning a Program of Study for School of Biological Sciences breadth requirements. UC IRVINE - 1972-1973BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES 83 GRADUATE PROGRAMS Departments of the School of Biological Sciences offer programs in a wide variety of fields ranging across the spectrum of the biological sciences. The organization of the departments within the School encourages an interdisciplinary approach to scientific problems. Graduate programs are administered by departments for the School of Biological Sciences. Applications for admission for graduate study are evaluated both by the Graduate Division and by the department to which the student has applied on the basis of letters of recommendation, Graduate Record Examination scores, grades, and other qualifications of the applicant. \u00b7 Programs leading to the degrees of Master of Science (M.S.) and Doctor of Philos\u00b7 ophy (Ph.D.) in the Biological Sciences are offered in all the departments. Students are expected to maintain a \"B\" average at all times, attain the Master's Degree in two years, and attain the Ph.D. in four years. A Master's Degree, however, is not a prerequisite for the Ph.D. degree. While most training takes place within one of the four departments, full facilities and curricular offerings are available to all graduate students in all departments of the biological sciences. Interdisciplinary study and research are encouraged. Each new student is assigned a faculty member as his temporary advisor. During the first part of the initial year of .graduate work, the graduate advisor or a small com\u00b7 mittee in consultation with the student plans an academic program. Faculty ad\u00ad visors are changed if the specific interests of the student change. Students are en\u00ad couraged to consult with other faculty members with regard to their research and academic interests. In addition to their own research and the seminars and colloquia required by the individual departments, all graduate students receive guided teaching experience. During their graduate training all students will serve some time as teacher appren\u00ad tices under the direction of advanced teaching assistants and faculty. Advanced graduate students may work closely with faculty in the planning and execution of the teaching program. The amount and exact nature of the teaching experience varies with the department. Financial assistance is considered an important aspect of graduate training, relieving the need to seek outside employment and permitting maximum concentration of effort toward graduate study. Support is available through teaching and research assistantships, fellowships, and traineeships. Graduate education is a highly personal and individual matter. Graduate students are encouraged to pursue their own individual interests and creative abilities. Master of Arts in Teaching of Biology This new program is primarily for biology teachers or those working for their cre\u00ad dential. It aims to provide them with a program of modern, relevant coursework and curricular research which will enable them to teach up-to-date, advanced high school and junior college courses. The program will be structured so that the work\u00ad ing teacher can take courses in evenings, weekends, and summers and could com\u00ad plete the requirements in two summer sessions and one academic year. UC IRVINE - 1972-197384 BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES Master of Science in the Biological Sciences Plan 1: Thesis Plan -The student completes seven upper-division or graduate courses including a minimum of five nonresearch courses. The student then presents a thesis based upon research done while in the School. Plan II: Comprehensive Examination Plan-The student completes a minimum of nine upper-division and graduate courses. At least five must be graduate courses (numbered 200-299) in the student's field of specialization. This program is termi\u00ad nated with a comprehensive final examination. Doctor of Philosophy in the Biological Sciences Students planning a Ph.D. degree are normally encouraged to bypass the M.S. de\u00ad gree. For specific graduate programs, contact the graduate advisors of the various departments. First Level of Competence -The student attains this Level by completing orill or written examinations at the discretion of the department. Second Level of Competence -This Level is attained by passing an examination dealing with the student's particular interests. A committee for the purpose of ad\u00ad ministering this examination is appointed by the Dean of the Graduate Division. Once this examination is completed, the student is advanced to candidacy for the degree and is considered to have formally begun his dissertation research. The stu\u00ad dent submits a dissertation on this research and defends it at an oral examination during the final year of graduate study. SCHOOL OF BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES FACULTY Howard A.

UC IRVINE - 1972-1973100 BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES/PSYCHOBIOLOGY DEPARTMENT OF PSYCHOBIOlOGY Psychobiology is concerned with the biological bases_of behavior. The focus of study in psychobiology is upon the role of behavior in adaptation and the mech\u00ad anisms by which this is accomplished. Emphasis is given to problems of the neural, endocrine, biochemical, genetic, and experimental determinants of arousal and attention, sensation and perception, learning, memory, motivation, emotion, and instinctive behavior. A broad comparative approach is taken to these problems. The primary emphasis of the graduate training program in Psychobiology is on re\u00ad search training. Graduate study in Psychobiology requires strong backgrounds in the physical and biological sciences as well as mathematics, computer sciences, and experimental psychology.

UC IRVINE - 1972-1973106 FINE ARTS SCHOOL OF FINE ARTS Clayton Garrison Dean The primary activity of the School of Fine Arts is creating and performing works of art in an atmosphere in which the creative process is central. We are committed to the creative act: to making and performing. A program based on such a commit\u00ad ment requires a faculty experienced in the creative process. The faculty in the School of Fine Arts is comprised primarily of permanent artists-in-residence. Studio courses ip all areas are taught by eminent professionals who have earned their living professionally and who continue to maintain professional assignments and commitments. In addition to the permanent artist-in-residence faculty, visiting artists have and will always comprise about one-third of the staff, providing a constant inflow of ideas and personalities. A variety of artists challenges the student's sensibilities and en\u00ad courages him to think and to create freshly and freely. This ideology focused oli the creative process, the professional and scholar\u00ad performer faculty, and the individual's commitment and courage provides, we feel, an ideal condition for the serious student in the arts who wants to be painting, sculpturing, dancing, acting, singing, directing, choreographing, writing, or playing an instrument six to ten hours a day during the most sensitive and formative years of his life. Our central concern is the development of a creative talent in an atmos\u00ad phere saturated with creativity. Departmental majors are offered in Art, Dance, Drama, and Music. Departmental requirements include extensive studio and workshop experiences, essential theoretical and historical backgrounds, and exercises in criticism. The requirements for all majors in the fine arts are designed to provide opportunities for the student\u00ad artist to work creatively at his medium for at least four hours a day from the fresh\u00ad man year through graduation. Introductory courses in film writing and film making are also available in the Drama Department. In addition to producing student concerts, musicals, and dramatic performances, the School of Fine Arts in collaboration with UCI's Committee for Arts and Lec\u00ad tures presents a varied offering of cultural events each year, including distinguished lecturers, world-renowned concert artists, outstanding dance and drama groups, jazz and folk performers, a film series, and a gallery program. - The School of Fine Arts is organized as a School with areas of instruction and production, not with formal departments. The faculty generally meets as a whole one or two times a year. The faculty in each of the major areas of instruction (art, dance, drama, music) nominates five students to the Dean's Student Advisory Council. The Dean selects two undergraduates and one graduate student from each area. These twelve students comprise the Dean's Student Advisory Council for a term of one year. The Council meets about six times a year. TQ,js council reviews matters concerning appointments and promotions, curriculum, appropriations; UC IRVINE - 1972-1973FINE ARTS 107 policy on graduate admissions, productions and concerts, and community relations. There is no difference between undergraduate and graduate participation. The students act as an ad hoc review committee on all permanent appointments and on all recommendations for merit increases and promotions. Students in the School of Fine Arts are involved at a less formal level as participants, organizers, and co\u00ad ordinators throughout the year in the various productional units, including the University Chorus, University Orchestra, University Theatre, Student Exhibitions, Graduate Art Gallery, Dance Concerts, Friday One O'Clock Concerts, Dance Work\u00ad shop, Drama Workshop, Music Workshop, and Film Production. All new students are assigned, or they may choose their own, faculty advisors and are encouraged to meet with them during new student orientation week and period\u00ad ically throughout the year to plan programs of study and to discuss educational and career objectives. In addition, students are invited to make use of the counseling services in the School of Fine Arts office for assistance with programs, require\u00ad ments, or any academic matter.

School Requirements: None (see under departments). GRADUATE PROGRAM The School of Fine Arts offers programs leading to the degree of Master of Fine Arts with programs in Art, Dance, Drama, and Music. The primary activity of the School of Fine Arts is performance -the creative act. Research activities are con\u00ad cerned with illuminating performance and inspiring the studio experience. The in\u00ad tellectual activity of theoretical, literary, and historical courses complements the practical work in studio workshops and performance. The aim of the program is, thus, to produce literate artists who are responsive to intellectual stimuli, who are capable of integrating knowledge into creative acts, and who are disciplined to the point of freedom. It is the strong belief of the School that intellectual integrity and professional excellence cannot exist without each other. Admission to the Program Although the campus deadline for applications to be filed for the fall quarter is July 1, the quota of graduate students admitted to the School of Fine Arts is usually filled by March 1. Students are, therefore, advised to make application and to ar\u00ad range for submission of portfolios, auditions, compositions, dossiers, and interviews by February 1. Students are not admitted to the program during the winter or spring quarters; no program is offered during the summer session. Students applying for scholarships and fellowships should do so through the Graduate Division not UC IRVINE - 1972-1973108 FINE ARTS/ART later than February 1 for the following year. The School of Fine Arts has a modest number of Teaching Assistantships available in all areas, and all candidates are automatically reviewed for Teaching Assistantship positions; the School informs successful candidates by May 1 for the following academic year. Upon admission to the program the student will be assigned an advisor in his specific area. He should discuss with this advisor the scope of his undergraduate preparation to determine any areas which may need strengthening if the student is to derive full benefit from graduate study. The advisor should also be consulted by the student upon the best temporal arrangement of his program, and upon the nature of his qualifying and final projects. ART The program in art provides basic studio experiences in the fundamental knowledge and techniques of drawing, painting, sculpture, design, ceramics, and graphic arts, and a comprehensive study of the history and criticism of art. The curriculum con\u00ad stantly relates studio practice to the development of the visual arts and current critical theory. It aims to develop a sense of visual awareness by as wide a range of the study of art as possible. The program is designed for students preparing to con\u00ad tinue professionally as artists, as critics, as historians, as curators in museums, and as teachers, as well as for students who, while not planning to make the study of art their vocation, have a serious interest in the theory, practice, and history of the visual arts. The distinguishing characteristics of the program leading to the Bachelor of Arts degree lie in the interrelated approach to studio practice, history, and criticism. The student majoring in art experiences the creative aspects of art by learning to think with the materials and techniques of his medium. He experiences, furthermore, the historical continuum of art as a research source and cultural achievement. And finally he engages in critical exercise which is essential to achieving the vital balance between the perceptual and conceptual in the creative process. The aim of the pro\u00ad gram in the visual arts is to enable the student to apply himself to any visual situa\u00ad tion (studio, historical, critical) rather than to apply prelearned techniques or a rigid intellectual pattern.

The classical academic approach to ballet adheres to those principles developed from UC IRVINE - 1972-1973112 FINE ARTS/DANCE Noverre through Petipa and Cecchetti, modified to accommodate our current , understanding of those laws of physics and of the human anatomy applicable to the study of dance. The workshops in contemporary dance explore and extend the various approaches to modern dance and jazz, concentrating on physiological and rhythmic problems encountered in contemporary choreography. Studies in pre\u00b7 classic dance forms and their musical structures provide additional workshop ex\u00ad periences as well as significant research materials for choreographic problems. Theoretical and historical courses complement the practical work in workshops, choreography, and performance. The program is designed for students preparing to continue professionally as dancers, as choreographers, and as teachers, as well as for students who, while not planning to make the study of dance their vocation, have a serious interest in the theory, practice, and history of dance. The traditional technique of classical ballet constitutes a craft and style that serves not only as a physiological center for the logical training of the body, but also as a basic language of movement for the choreographer. Workshop experiences build progressively on the basic techniques of ballet and extend through the contem\u00ad porary idioms of jazz, modern, and freestyle. The aim is to develop kinetic re\u00ad sources, precision, flexibility, and freedom in an eloquently coordinated and in\u00ad telligently responsive body.

Each major in drama experiences exacting and rigorous training in the mutually interrelated areas of the theatre: performance, design, literature, history, and criticism. The curriculum constantly relates studio practice, technical resources, and productional techniques to the development of dramatic literature and current critical theory. The student specializes during the last two years of study in acting, directing, scene design, costume design, or criticism. Majors in drama are expected to undertake extensive studies in art, dance, and music. The continuous production of plays, musicals, operettas, and operas constitutes the major activity of the department. Students are treated as members of a theatrical organization, and they acquire experiences in all phases of theatrical production in a professionally disciplined atmosphere. Dramatic production centers on an exhaus\u00ad tive analysis of the script and on the challenge of communicating the complexities of the plan to an audience in a unified and meaningful production. UC IRVINE - 1972-1973' 116 FINE ARTS/DRAMA The program is designed for students preparing to continue professionally as actors, directors, designers, critics, and teachers, as well as for students who, while not planning to make the study of theatre their vocation, have a serious interest in the literature, theory, and practice of drama.

The program provides intensive UC IRVINE - 1972-1973120 FINE ARTS/MUSIC training in three mutually dependent areas as related components of a total musical experience: performance and musicianship, the theory of music, and the history of music. A knowledge of all three of these areas is indispensable and minimal for a successful career in music. Entering majors are expected to have competence in the practice of music -in reading and performing. Basic to the program for the graduating major is an effec\u00ad tive command of the piano: the performance at sight of moderately difficult works. Students may demonstrate this skill by examination. Performance requirements include a senior recital, instrumental or vocal, and partic\u00ad ipation in the chorl.ls, orchestra, or in chamber music during each of the student's four years. - ' Beyond the specific goals outlined above and the requirements. listed below, the student in music, through cooperative programs undertaken in conjunction with th\u20ac other parts, achieves an awareness of the relationship of music to those other arts and of the various roles of music in society, both past and present. Entrance Requirements At the commencement of the student's freshman year he will be given an entrance examination to determine whether he meets the requirements of the department as stated below. After two years, the faculty will meet as a jury to determine whether the student is making sufficient progress to quality him as an upper-division music major. All transfer students must take placement examinations. Voice Majors Recommend at least two years private study and/or participation in choral or orchestral ensemble and facility at the keyboard. Background in Italian, French, and German art songs is recommended. Piano Majors The requirements for an entering piano major are that the candidate should have mastered a Haydn or Mozart sonata, a two-part invention of Bach, and all the majm and minor scales and arpeggios. Woodwinds Sustained tone production, precise intonation over a dynamic range from pianis\u00ad simo to fortissimo, control of breath, tongue, and double and triple tongue attacks over the entire range of the instrument, all major and minor scales and arpeggios legato and staccato commensurate with the range and technique of the instrument, are required. The student should be able to play and read a repertoire of a difficult, comparable to the earlier symphonies of Haydn, Mozart, Beethoven, and Schubert, and should demonstrate knowledge of the sonata literature for his particular instrument. Brass Essentially the same requirements as for woodwinds. Percussion Mastery of rudimentary drum techniques and a knowledge.of the piano comparable to grade three is required. Strings Clear tone production, precise intonation with and without vibrato, controlled vibrato, slurred, detache, loure, staccato, and UC IRVINE - 1972-1973FINE ARTS/MUSIC 121 :dge of all major and minor scales and arpeggios are highly desirable.

Montgomery Acting Dean Undergraduate Study: Associate Dean, Theodore Brunner Graduate Study: Robert L. Montgomery UNDERGRADUATE PROGRAMS The School offers undergraduate majors in classics, classical civilization, compara\u00ad tive literature, English, French, German, hist~ry, humanities, linguistics, philos\u00ad ophy, Russian, and Spanish. It offers elementary courses in Chinese, Hebrew, Italian, and elementary and upper-division courses in Portuguese. Students with degrees in the various majors offered by the School proceed to grad\u00ad uate study in numerous fields including business, law, education, and medicine, as well as directly into a great variety of professions. A corps of lower-division advisors is designed to meet the special needs of freshmen and sophomores. The advisors are particularly interested in undergraduate educa\u00ad tion and especially knowledgeable about University regulations, requirements in and outside the School, course content, options to major, and other matters that may present difficulties. Students in the School do not elect majors until the last quarter of the sophomore year, at which time each student is assigned an advisor in the major chosen. Until that time the lower-division advisor is prepared to help the student keep options to major open as long as possible, plan a coherent program of humanistic study, and reach an eventual decision about the major. Each major in the School sets certain requirements. Generally each major offers a year's course which is both an introduction to the discipline and a prerequisite to the major itself. Students who plan wisely with their advisors will construct pro\u00ad grams that include a good number of such courses. Undergraduate students in the School of Humanities participate in the affairs of the School in a number of ways: by serving on committees of various departments, by sitting with the faculty in its meetings, and by serving on the student undergraduate advisory committee, which directly advises the Dean. Requirements for a Bachelor of Arts Degree University Requirements: See page 22. School Requirements Humanities lA-B-C, taken in the freshman year (students who must take Subject A will take Humanities lA-B-C in the sophomore year); Two years of work in a single acceptable foreign language (through 2C) or equiva- lent competence; \" Quarterly consultation with an assigned lower-division advisor and his written approval for the program of study decided upon. UC IRVINE - 1972-1973126 HUMANITIES GRADUATE PROGRAMS The School offers a wide program of graduate degrees. Although the Master's degree is offered in most departments, the programs emphasize the Ph.D. and give preference in admission to those students who intend to take that degree. An exception is the two-year Master of Fine Arts in creative writing. Ph.D. degrees are planned in Classics and German. In addition to the seminars offered by the various departments, the School sponsors a number of interdisciplinary seminars annually. These courses are taught jointly by faculty members from various departments. Further, several departments offer a few students the opportunity to do part of their work for the Ph.D. in a related discipline. \u00b7 A limited number of students are accepted annually to study for the secondary and primary teaching credential. This program is a cooperative effort by the School and the Office of Teacher Education (see p. 279). Graduate students in the School of Humanities participate in the affairs of the School in a number of ways: by serving on committees of the various departments, by sitting with the faculty in its meetings, and by serving on the student graduate advisory committee, which directly advises the Dean.

UNDERGRADUATE MAJOR IN HUMANITIES The major in Humanities ac\u00b7commodates students who want to organize their under\u00ad graduate education around some special interest in a topic, a field, or a problem which is interdisciplinary in scope. At the end of his sophomore year the student, in consultation with the Humanities Major Committee, will devise an individually tai\u00ad lored set of \"course requirements\" not all of which need be offered in the Humani\u00ad ties School. The Committee will assign him an advisor on the basis of the student's own preference. At the end of his senior year the student will prepare under the advisor's supervision a long paper in the area of his special major. Inquiries by third-quarter sophomores should be addressed to Guy Sircello, Associate Professor of Philosophy, Chairman of Humanities Major Committee. UC IRVINE - 1972-1973HUMANITIES 127 UNDERGRADUATE COURSES IN HUMANITIES Humanities IA-B-C The Humanities Core Course (2-2-2) A two-credit year-long sequence required of all Humanities majors and open only to those who have passed the Subject A requirement. Majors who have satisfied the Subject Are\u00ad quirement at entrance are required to take the course in their freshman year; majors who have not satisfied the Subject A requirement at entrance are required to take the\u00b7 course as sophomores, only after completing Subject A. From year to year different problems of mutual concern to the various humanistic disci\u00ad plines are taken up, with emphasis placed on the careful reading of certain major texts which bear on these problems and on the development of the ability to think clearly and write well about the issues they raise. A writing program is an integral part of the course. Humanities 2 ( 1) A course offered on the general subject of the nature of humanistic disciplines. Humanities 101A-B-C (1-1-1), may be repeated when subject changes. The undergraduate humanities colloquia. Offered in various subjects of an interdisciplinary nature, generally for juniors. In 197 2-7 3 it will include: Images and Manifestations of Socialism. An historical and critical survey of Marxian perspectives on capitalism and socialism. Fall quarter: an introduction to classical Marxisin. Winter quarter: an examination of the Soviet and Chinese experiments and their historical implications for socialism in other parts of the world. Spring quarter: an inquiry into the prospects for varieties of capitalism and socialism in the United States and the West, the USSR and Eastern Europe, and the third world. Open to upper-division students with permission of the instructor. (Same as Comparative Culture 1161\\-B-C.) Humanities 197 (varying credit) Individually arranged field study. Humanities 198 (varying credit) Directed group study on special topics. Humanities 199 (varying credit) Directed research for senior Humanities majors. GRADUATE COURSES IN HUMANITIES Graduate courses in Humanities are under the direction of the School's Associate Dean for Graduate Study. These courses are designed for all graduate students in the School of Humanities, with the exception that students in philosophy may not count Humanities 230 as part of their degree program. Humanities 200, 210, 220, and 230 introduce study in four disciplinary areas, either to students planning a degree in history or one of the literature departments or to those seeking familiarity with disciplines other than their own. Some students may offer an interdisciplinary modification of their degrees with permission of the departments or programs concerned. Such students will take half or more of their courses in a major field, with the remainder in other fields and in Humanities. At least one of the courses outside the major field will be in the Hu manities series 200-230 and another will be a course listed as Humanities 291. Those interested in an interdisciplinary degree should contact the Associate Dean for Graduate Study or the Graduate Advisor in their major department. Humanities 200 The Nature and Theory of History ( 1) An introduction to,various approaches to historical inquiry. The course deals with specula\u00ad tive and critical history, as well an analytical history. (Same as History 200A.) UC IRVINE - 1972-1973128 -HUMANITIES/CLASSICS Humanities 210 Topics and _Methods in Linguistics ( 1) A study of linguistic theories and methods of language description, linguistic structure, lan\u00ad guage change, typology of grammars, theories of meaning. For the student unfamiliar with the basic principles of linguistics. (Formerly offered under Humanities 291.) Humanities 220 Literary Theory ( 1) An introduction to the role of criticism and aesthetics in literary study for beginning grad\u00ad uate students. Readings from Continental, English, and American theorists. (Same as Criti\u00b7 cism 220A.) Humanities 230 Philosophical Analysis ( 1) An introduction to the fundamentals of philosophical analysis through the application of techniques to selected problems in the various \"fields\" of philosophy: ethics, philosophy of science, political philosophy, aesthetics, philosophy of religion. Humanities 291 (1) Under this number the School offers a group of seminars and colloquia in interdisciplinary topics or in topics in a particular discipline that are designed for study by students in other disciplines. DEPARTMENT OF CLASSICS UNDERGRADUATE PROGRAMS The Department of Classics aims to provide for the undergraduate student an ex\u00ad posure to the origins and heritage of western civilization. The Department is com\u00ad mitted to a twofold purpose: (1) to transmit the culture, ideals, and attitudes of classical civilization through the Greek and Roman languages and literatures and (2) through courses in classical literature in translation, civilization, mythology, and religion to help students appreciate the vast and pervasive influence of Greece and Rome on our own civilization. The Department offers both a major in Classics with either an emphasis in Greek or Latin, and a major in Classical Civilization. Students are encouraged to consult with the Classics faculty regarding the appropriate choice of major and design of program. For the Classics major, the basis for studying the Classics must be competency in one or both of the classical languages. The Classics program is designed to provide the student with this competency as rapidly as possible, so that by the end of the lrrst year he has already been introduced to some of the major classical authors in the original. From then on, the student is concerned with analyzing, interpreting, and appreciating the literatures of ancient Greece and Rome and will devote himself to the theories and techniques of literary and textual criticism. In addition, he will obtain a rich background in such ancillary disciplines as ancient history, archaeol\u00ad ogy, classical art, drama, philosophy, and religion. The major in Classical Civilization was designed for those students who have no plans to pursue graduate studies in the classical languages, yet wish to obtain an undergraduate degree based on a sound exposure to the classical world. The nucleus of this major is eight courses taken within the department, including a minimum of one year of either classical language. The student is also required to take three courses in fields closely related to the field of Classics (one course each in ancient history, ancient philosophy, and ancient art). Beyond the required courses, the student is encouraged to take other suggested courses in history, drama, compara\u00ad tive literature, and art. UC IRVINE - 1972-1973HUMANITIES/CLASSICS 129 The student planning to major in Classics or Classical Civilization should obtain a \u00b7 copy of the pamphlet \"The Classics\" and/or \"Major in Classical Civilization\" from the department office. Students entering UCI with previous Greek or Latin training will be given advanced standing as follows: In general, one year of high school work is equated with one quarter of UCI work. Thus, students with one, two, three, and four years of high school Latin will enroll in Latin 1B, 1C, 2A, and 2B respectively. Exceptions to this ruling can be made but must have the appro':al of the Department Chairman. Stu\u00ad dents with high school training in the classical languages are encouraged to consult with the Classics staff before enrolling in Classics courses. The Department adheres to the policy of giving its students an opportunity to par\u00ad ticipate fully in the departmental decision-making process. Two student representa\u00ad tives, elected from and by the undergraduate majors, participate in all departmental faculty and committee meetings. They are responsible for maintaining close liaison with their constituency, for representing the students' interest in curriculum and personnel matters, and for the evaluation of both the academic program and the academic staff. Requirements for the Bachelor's Degree University Requirements: See page 22. School Requirements: See _page 125. Departmental Requirements Two separate majors: .Classics (with an emphasis in either Greek or Latin) and Clas\u00ad sical Civilization. Classics (Greek emphasis): Greek 2A-B-C; three literature courses on the Greek 100 level; Greek 110; Latin 1A-B-C; Latin 2A-B-C. Classics (Latin emphasis): Latin 2A-B-C; three literature courses on the Latin 100 level; Latin 110; Greek 1A-B-C; Greek 2A-B-C. Classical Civilization: Latin (or Greek) 1A-B-C; Classics 151, 152, 153; two courses from Classics 141, 160, 170; one ancient history course; one ancient philosophy course; one ancient art course. Planning a Program of Study The Department believes in close consultation with students on academic advising, program planning, and discussion of goals and direction. Students planning to major in Classics or Classical Civilization are strongly urged to consult with the depart\u00ad mental faculty at the earliest possible moment, in order to familiarize themselves with the nature of the various programs. GRADUATE PROGRAM The Classics Ph.D. program is based upon the belief that close and constant individual attention to a student offers greater and more extensive educational opportunities than classroom. instruction. Under the program, a number of graduate students equal to the number of faculty members of professorial rank are admitted, each of whom is assigned to a single faculty member. This faculty member acts as the student's \"preceptor\" for the four years of the graduate program. The preceptor is responsible for the development and progress of his student in three areas: comprehensive knowledge of the disci\u00ad pline, research competence, and teaching ability. Through frequent conference, he UC IRVINE - 1972-1973i3o fiuMANITIEsjcL:A.ssics\u00b7 maintains constant control over the student's progress, provides assistance in the solving of problems, and responds to the student's needs as they arise. In addition he involves his student with other faculty members in the Department for varying periods of time; dependent upon the nature of particular research problems and the areas of specialization of the faculty. Students admitted to the program are expected to work directly toward the degree Doctor of Philosophy in Classics. Although the program provides for the Master of Arts in Classics, this degree is awarded only on a terminal basis to a student unable to meet the demands of the program. Generally, the student is expected to com\u00ad plete the Ph.D. program in four years; completion of the doctoral dissertation will be a prerequisite for leaving residence. There are no formal course requirements for the Ph.D. in Classics. However, the Department offers a single seminar, Classics 220, designed to accommodate varying themes and projects which involve all graduate students enrolled in the program as well as faculty outside of the Department, guest lecturers, and visiting professors temporarily affiliated with the Department. Upon entering the program, each student is provided with a reading list of both primary and secondary materials. While this reading list requires of each student thorough familiarity with Classical literature, history, art, philosophy, and science, it is designed on an individual basis to provide for particular interests and predis\u00ad positions in approaching the field of Classics. Under constant guidance from the preceptor, the student is expected to assimilate the prescribed materials on this reading list within a period of three years. At the end of each year in residence, the student is required to pass a written examination designed to evaluate both his progress with the reading list and his development in his particular areas of interest and specialization. By the beginning of the second year, he is expected to pass reading examinations in two modern for\u00ad eign languages (ordinarily, French and German). At the end of the third year in residence, the student is expected to pass oral qualifying examinations which cover comprehensively the entire field of Classics, but which also take into account the student's individual interests. Beyond the annual examinations, the students enrolled in the program are evalu\u00ad ated monthly, based on progress dossiers containing copies of the student's written work, reports by the preceptor as well as the seminar instructor, and statements by temporary faculty supervisors. The entire Classics faculty acting as an evaluation committee makes appropriate comment and recommendation. For purposes of maintaining official university records, grades are recorded for the student's perfor\u00ad mance in the seminars in which he enrolls. A doctoral dissertation is required of all Ph.D. candidates. Normally, the student writes the dissertation under close supervision of his preceptor, although the entire Department of Classics faculty constitutes the dissertation committee responsible for accepting or rejecting the dissertation. Upon completion of the dissertation, the student is required to submit to an oral dissertation defense. CLASSICS FACULTY Lewis A.

DEPARTMENT OF ENGLISH AND COMPARATIVE liTERATURE The Department of English and Comparative Literature is concerned with the nature and value of literature, possible approaches to literary works, and the rela\u00ad tion of literary criticism to the intellectual issues of the day. Fundamentally it is concerned with the humanistic problem of value. Thus its main literary concern is critical and theoretical. Though not alone in the task, the Department recognizes a continuing obligation to help all students to write the English language with clarity and grace. UC IRVINE - 1972-1973HUMANITIES/ENGLISH & COMPARATIVE LITERATURE.133 Students are given the opportunity to participate in departmental affairs through two elected student committees, one of undergraduates, one of graduates, which are concemed primarily with matters of personnel and curriculum. The committees meet periodically with faculty committees of the Department, and. the recommen\u00ad dations of student committees become matters of record which accompany any recommendations emanating from the Department. Each quarter, all students taking classes within the Department have the opportunity to evaluate the partic\u00ad ular course and teacher. UNDERGRADUATE PROGRAMS The Department offers to the undergraduate essentially three areas of study: 1. The Program in Literary Criticism, where the emphasis is upon formal study of the variety of critical approaches and the reading and criticism principally of English and American literature. 2. The Program in Writing, which offers an emphasis on formal work in the writ\u00ad ing of poetry, prose fiction, and/or drama, parallel readings, and a substantial ex\u00ad perience in criticism. The aim of the program is to encourage the creative literary powers of the student and to introduce him to the discipline of imaginative writing. The Department also offers work in non-fiction and advanced work in expository writing. 3. The Program in Comparative Literature, which, though administratively a part of the Department, is basically interdisciplinary in its orientation, drawing on fac\u00ad ulty and other resources from the fields of the various modem and classical litera\u00ad tures and drama. The consciousness of the modem educated man is the product of centuries of cultural heritage, including not only works of literature in his own tongue but world literature from Homer to Gide and Thomas Mann. At UCI, Com\u00ad parative Literature is regarded simply as the study of literature from the intema\u00ad tional point of view, rather than in the national framework made necessary by the traditional university. The student who completes a degree in Comparative Litera\u00ad ture will thus have a competent grasp of the whole history of literature in its broad outlines and will be able to deal competently with literary texts, whatever their period or national origins, for his own pleasure or for professional use. Since the Department believes that a student of literature should recognize the importance of understanding theoretical problems in literature, of developing a broad acquaintance with literary texts, and of experiencing the problems of literary creation at first hand, the Department invites the student to take work in all three of its Programs, with an emphasis in one of the first two\u00b7(toward a Bachelor's De\u00ad gree in English) or a major in the third (toward a Bachelor's Degree in Comparative Literature). By not stipulating a variety of prerequisites the Department also invites students from all schools of the University to take advantage of its offerings. An acceptable level of ability in English composition is the only prerequisite for many of the in\u00ad troductory undergraduate English courses. Many of the courses will vary in specific content from year to year, depending on the plans of individual teachers, since the department recognizes that no course can possibly treat all the major authors and works relevant to a given period or topic. The student intending to major in English or Comparative Literature should obtain a copy of Undergraduate Study in English and Comparative Literature from the Departmental Office. UC IRVINE - 1972-1973134.HUMANITIES/ENGJ,.ISH& COMPARATIVE LITERATURE Requirements for the Bachelor's Degree University Requirements: See page 22. School Requirements: See page 125. Departmental Requirements English: English 28A-B-C; CR 100A-B; CL 100; E 102 or CL 102 twice; four courses above 102, at least two of which must be 1 03's; competence in a foreign language equivalent to six quarters of work-at Irvine plus one course in a foreign language where texts are read in the original language. Normally students electing a writing emphasis will take not quite as many of the period and genre courses but a total of more courses in English than the usual major. Passing performance in the Senior Comprehensive Examination in English (see below). Comparative Literature: Sufficient competence in a foreign language, either modem or classical, to be able to deal with any standard literary or critical text in that lan\u00ad guage. with facility. If the student intends to continue with graduate work, it is highly recommended that he begin the study of a second foreign language before graduation. A three-quarter lower-division sequence: CL 50A~B-C or English 28A-B-C. About twelve literature or allied courses in addition, of which ten must be upper division: normally these will include CR 100A-B, CL 100, either CL 102 or CL 103; suitable upper-division course work in the literature of a foreign language; appro\u00ad priate study in English and American literature; and further study in literature or allied fields as recommended by the advisor. Passing performance in the Bachelor's Examination in Comparative Literature (see below). Planning a Program of Study The student should plan, with his faculty advisor, a coherent program of courses, including independent study courses, undergraduate seminars, and workshops in writing (for students choosing a writing emphasis). If the student intends to continue with graduate work, it is highly recommended that he begin the study of a second foreign language before graduation. The Senior Comprehensive Examination in English The purpose of this examination, as of any other, is to give students a chance to show how much and how well they have learned. This examination will, generally speaking, be designed so that a student may reveal any or all of the following: his ability to close intelligently, on the spot, with any given piece of literature; his knowledge of the general outlines of English and American literary history, in\u00ad cluding the more significant facts and dates; his understanding of the terms appro\u00ad priate to literary discussion; and his knowledge of the works on the;: reading list. The examination will ordinarily require four hours and will be given on two non-succes\u00ad sive days. Every student should plan to take the examination in the quarter before the quarter in which he intends to graduate -normally the winter quarter of his senior year. No student may take the examination more than three times, and no student who fails to pass after three attempts may receive a degree in English. Copies of past examinations may be obtained in the Office of the Department of English and Comparative Literature. UC IRVINE - 1972-1973HUMANITIES/ENGLISH & COMPARATIVE LITERATURE '135 The Bachelor's Examination in Comparative Literature The Bachelor's Examination is given during the student's senior year to test his knowledge of literature, critical theory, and literary history\u00b7 and to investigate his competence in practical criticism as well as his ability to write clearly, succinctly, and convincingly on literary matters. Primarily, the student will be asked questions on works from the Comparative Literature Reading List and about the ways in\u00b7 which these works relate to each other. The material describing the Senior Comprehensive Examination in English is also applicable (see above). The main difference between the two examinations lies in the reading lists on which the examinations are based. GRADUATE PROGRAMS The Department's three principal areas of work on the undergraduate level-criti\u00ad cism, comparative literature, and the art of writing -are reflected in the graduate programs: the M.A. and the Ph.D. in English with specific attention to criticism, the M.A. and the Ph.D. in Comparative Literature, and the M.F.A. in Writing. The De\u00ad partment encourages applications only from students who plan to pursue the Ph.D. in English or in Comparative Literature or who want to embark on the M.F.A. in Writing. A committee of the Department, with the consent of the Graduate Dean, admits students to these programs. Each program has a Director appointed by the Chairman of the Department, and a deliberate effort is made to maintain close ad\u00ad ministrative and intellectual ties between the programs. \u00b7 The Department assumes that there must be a vital relationship between professor and candidate; specific requirements for graduate degrees will be reached by con\u00ad sultation among ~embers of the faculty and the candidate himself. The first-year graduate student or the candidate for the Master of Fine Arts in Writing plans a program with his advisor; the candidate for the Ph.D. plans with his advisor and a two-man committee. Candidates for literary degrees are encouraged to study philosophy, history, foreign languages and literatures, and the fine arts. Applicants for graduate degrees in English and Comparative Literature must submit scores for the Graduate Record Examination (GRE) and the Advanced Test, Litera\u00ad ture (ATL). Part-time graduate work is discouraged; only in exceptional circumstances will students be permitted to undertake programs of less than six full courses during the academic year. The normal expectation, however, is enrollment in three courses each quarter. A full course load for teaching assistants is six' quarter courses during tbe academic year. The Department recognizes that virtually all of its graduate students will become teachers, and it believes that graduate departments should be training college teachers as well as scholars -indeed, that teaching and most literary scholarship complement one another. Thus the Department has initiated a program by which all its Ph.D. candidates, in English as well as in Comparative Literature, may i;.lln supervised training as teachers in the arts of writing and of criticism at various undergraduate levels as part of the formal seminar work required for the degree. M.F.A. candidates also have the opportunity of participating in this program. All those interested in graduate study in the Department should obtain the bro\u00ad chure on graduate programs from the Departmental Office. UC IRVINE - 1972-1973136 HUMANITIES/ENGLISH & COMPARATIVE LITERATURE English Master of Arts in English Each candidate for the M.A. will be assigned to a graduate advisor who will super\u00b7 vise his program. The M.A. plan of study includes (1) the completion of course work, as advised, for three quarters or the equivalent; (2) demonstrated proficiency in reading a designated foreign language; {3) the passing of a written examination upon a designated reading list. Exceptional students may be exempted from taking the examination by petitioning the Graduate Committee, which will review the student's performance and qualifications in arriving at its decision. All M.A. candi\u00ad dates will be required to know fundamental facts about the history of the English \u00b7 language. The candidate must take all of his formal work in courses, seminars, or conferences limited to graduate students. Master of Fine Arts in English The Master of Fine Arts (M.F.A.) in English is a degree awarded for creative writing in poetry, the short story, the novel, or drama. The M.F.A. degree is normally conferred upon the completion of a two-year resi\u00ad dence. During each of his quarters in the program the candidate will be enrolled in a creative writing workshop which will constitute two-thirds of his course load for that quarter. If he intends to teach after receiving his degree, the candidate should plan the rest of his program in such a way as to insure that he will be qualified to teach courses in literature. In addition to his course work, the candidate will complete a book-length thesis of creative writing. He will also be required to pass a written examination on a reading list of literary works in the genre of his own writing. Doctor of Philosophy in English The program for the Ph.D. in English normally includes about two years of full\u00ad time enrollment beyond the B.A., three courses of which may be in the graduate teaching program; proficiency in the reading of two acceptable foreign languages; the dissertation; and satisfactory performance on designated examinations. The languages acceptable depend upon the nature of the student's program as determined by his advisors. Reading competence in one of these languages must be established in the first quarter of residence, and competence in the second well before the general examinations. Satisfactory work in courses in which literary translation is actually practiced must fulfill at least one of the language require\u00ad ments. The necessity of competence in languages such as Old English is determined\u00b7 by the advisory committee in lhe light of the student's total program. All candi\u00ad dates for the Ph.D. will be required to know fundamental facts about the history of the English language and basic linguistic theory. Upon completion of course work the student normally presents himself for general examinations on literary theory and criticism; on some particular literary form, genre, style, theme, or structure; a historical period; a group of authors; and a specific topic. The first four of these examinations are written, the fifth oral. The student has the opportunity to present his own choices for the examination, but the choices must enable him to demonstrate breadth of knowl11dge and literary understanding ~nd therefore must be approved by:,his advisory committee. Certain alternatives to this series of examinations may be allowed in special cases. UC IRVINE - 1972-1973HUMANITIES/ENGLISH\u00b7& COMPARATIVE LITERATURE 137 When the student satisfactorily completes the general examination, he is admitted to candidacy for the degree. As soon after completion of the general examination as is practicable, the student presents to his advisory committee for its approval an . essay leading into his dissertation. Submission and acceptance of the dissertation complete the work for the Ph.D. All work for the Ph.D. degree must be in courses, seminars, or conferences limited to graduate students. Comparative Literature There are at least four avenues by which the UCI student may approach gradu~te work in Comparative Literature; students with Bachelor's Degrees from other insti\u00ad tutions should have equivalent training: a) The undergraduate major in Comparative Literature described above. b) A normal English major in criticism, provided a sufficient background in at least one foreign language is gained. A beginning on a second foreign language is highly recommended. c) A normal major in drama, with same provisos as b). d) A normal major in a foreign language, provided a sufficient general background in world literature is gained. Make-up work will be required before graduate studies can begin if one of these avenues has not been taken. At the graduate level, the study of Comparative Literature becomes more special\u00ad ized, with the student engaged in the highly technical area of his personal research and in dealing with such problems as the development of genres, interrelations between literatures, the theory and practice of translation, and other literary ques\u00ad tions transcending national boundaries. For the graduate student in Comparative Literature a professional competence in foreign languages is essential. French and German are usually required for all doc\u00ad toral candidates, since these languages along with English are the accepted tools of international literary scholarship. A classical language may prove indispensable for work in many traditional fields of literary study, and the scholar's own specialty may require him to master other languages. The underlying assumption in the whole plan of language requirements is that, after the tool languages have been mastered, the pro-fes-sio-nilf scholar's own interests should determine the specific kinds and degree of language skill he acquires. At the graduate level, the nucleus of the foreign language requirement is the course CL 220, Problems in Translation, in which, after a suitable theoretical preparation, the student plans and carries out a high-quality translation of a literary text. This translation, along with an introduction or other scholarly apparatus explaining and defending the technical decisions involved in the task, is then submitted as a paper for course credit. Master of Arts in Comparative Literature The student entering this Master of Arts program should complete course work for the equivalent of three quarters. This course work should include CL 220 (Prob\u00ad lems in Translation) with a project in either Rrench or German and appropriate graduate-level work in English, foreign languages, drama, comparative literature, and other areas as counseled by the advisor. Soon after beginning graduate work the student, with the adviceand approval of his advisor, will decide on a Field of UC IRVINE - 1972-1973138 HUMANITIES/ENGLISH & COMPARATIVE LITERATURE Specialty which he wishes to emphasize in his progress toward the M.A. degree. (Normally this choice will be a kind of general or preliminary step toward the selec\u00ad tion of an Area of Specialty for the Ph.D.). Graduate study in Comparative Literature requires an exceptional facility in foreign languages, and the student should not attempt a Master's Degree without a thorough knowledge of one foreign language and literature and a considerable knowledge of a second language. Normally the greatest part of the student's work will involve the study of literary texts in the original languages. At the end of his course work, normally about nine courses at the graduate level, the student will be examined in the following categories: the elected Field of Specialty; a general knowledge of world literature, including English and American, somewhat more extended than expected of the undergraduate student; and a knowledge of literary theory and techniques of literary study on a level appropriate for the graduate scholar. Exceptional students may be exempted from taking the examination by petitioning the Graduate Committee, which will review the stu\u00ad dent's performance and qualifications in arriving at its decision. Doctor of Philosophy in Comparative Literature The doctoral program is designed to prepare the student for a professional career as a scholar and critic of literature. Details of the doctoral program in Comparative Literature may be obtained from the Director. Normally the degree requires two years of course work (usually a minimum of three courses per quarter). Of these courses, the only required course is CL 220 (Problems in Translation), which is taken twice, with projects in acceptable languages. The rest of the student's work , will be in seminars or other graduate-level courses in Comparative Literature, English, the various foreign language departments, or Drama. In general an exceptional command of foreign languages is required, normally in\u00ad volving a professional competence in two or more foreign languages, either modern or classical. The doctoral student is encouraged to design and carry out a personal plan of study (the \"Area of Specialty\") in his particular field of interest. The requirements for the doctorate also include an area of competence in literary theory and practical criticism. Upon completion of his course work, the student will be examined in the following areas of knowledge: (1) mastery of a limited topic in literary theory or history of criticism, along with general knowledge of major critical texts in the history of liter\u00ad ature; (2) Area of Specialty as described above; and (3) a general knowledge of the western European literary tradition, including English and American, commen\u00ad surate with doctoral competence in the field. Following this examination, and upon recommendation of a Candidacy Committee appointed by the Graduate Council, the student is formally admitted to candidacy. The study toward the degree of Doctor of Philosophy will culminate in the writing of a suitable dissertation, normally on a comparative subject, although subjects lying within a single literature or dealing with general literary and aesthetic prob\u00ad lems not confined to any specific literatures may also be acceptable. Studies of the relation between literature and the other arts are also particularly encouraged.

Except for teaching assistants, however, no student will enroll in this course during his first year of graduate study. (Students enroll\u00ad ing with an M.A. from another institution may plan to take 399 twice their first year.) Graduate teachers are assigned by the Graduate Committee to teach half-sections of lower\u00ad division courses or to serve as interns in upper-division courses. M.F.A. candidates in their second year of study may apply to the Graduate Committee to participate in E 399. DEPARTMENT OF FRENCH AND ITALIAN The basic program brings the student to participate in the creative process of lan\u00ad guage, to conceptualize in French or Italian as he learns to understand, speak, read, and write. All classes are taught entirely in the foreign language, and a multiple approach stresses the interdependence of the four basic skills and makes them mutually reinforcing. The language laboratory is used to complement classroom activity. Representatives chosen by the undergraduate French majors and by the graduate students serve on departmental committees. These representatives also participate in department meetings and are responsible for student evaluation procedures. UNDERGRADUATE PROGRAM IN FRENCH At the intermediate lower-division level, texts of contemporary literary and social interest provide the focus for advanced conversation, reading, and composition. After the second year, courses in speaking (conversation and phonetics) and writing enable the student to attain a greater degree of proficiency, preparing him for fur\u00ad ther study in French literature and linguistics and in French Civilization and Culture. UC IRVINE - 1972-1973HUMANITIES/FRENCH & ITALIAN 143 In the lower-division courses in literature, complete texts are studied by genre: poetry in the fall; theatre m the winter; the novel in the spring. The student learns to analyze and interpret different types of creative literature and is introduced to various critical techniques. At the upper-division level, literature courses may emphasize a single author, a generation, or a genre within an historical period. The content of these courses changes yearly according to the interests of both faculty and students. Senior seminars are offered periodically to discuss literary problems which cannot be dealt with in depth in the regular offerings; among these are Mrican Literature in French, Structuralism. Upper-division courses in Civilization and Culture explore aspects of French his\u00ad tory, intellectual thought, and the arts. Courses are offered with an historical emphasis (The World of the Renaissance in France; The Age of Louis XIV) and with a comparative orientation (Poetry and Painting; Fantastic Art and Literature; Movie and Novel). Upper-division courses in linguistics introduce students to aspects of the structure of the French language and to the application of linguistic techniques to problems of literary analysis. Students are placed in elementary and intermediate courses according to their years of previous study and their grades; no placement examination is given. One year of / high school is equated with one 'quarter of work at UCI. A student may not go back more than one quarter and receive credit. Students are encouraged to participate in programs of study abroad during the junior year. Requirements for the Bachelor's Degree in French University Requirements: See page 22. School Requirements: See page 125. Departmental Requirements French 10A-B, 12A-B-C, and a) seven upper-division courses of which at least five must be in literature, or b) seven upper-division courses of which at least four must be in Civilization and Culture. UNDERGRADUATE PROGRAM IN ITALIAN Third and fourth-year offerings provide an introduction to Italian literature and culture. This material also serves as a basis for training in composition, conversa\u00ad tion, phonetics. Tutorial and seminar courses are available for advanced students. Students are en\u00ad couraged to pursue their interests through a major in Humanities which combines Italian literature, culture, history, art, music. GRADUATE PROGRAMS IN FRENCH The Department stresses understanding far more than encyclopedic knowledge, experimentation with various critical approaches rather than the perpetuation of a tradition, creativity rather than conformity. Master of Arts in French The Master of Arts degree is considered to be a step towards the Ph.D. degree; the Master's examination functions as a qualifying exam for the doctoral program. Most UC IRVINE - 1972-1973144 HUMANITIES/FRENCH & ITALIAN candidates take a minimum of eleven graduate courses, with at least six in iitera\u00ad ture, one in linguistics, and one in writing and style. Particularly well-prepared students may receive special permission to take a minimum of nine courses and to write a short thesis, for which two course credits are given. Individual programs are arranged in consultation with the graduate advisors. Proficiency in a foreign lan\u00ad guage other than the major language is required (proficiency is defined as the equivalent of the level attained at the end of course 2C). All M.A. candidates are required to pass a written and oral examination. The stu\u00ad dent writes essays where he demonstrates his ability to discuss literary texts - which may or may not have been part of the class program -and to establish rela\u00ad tionships between literary works of different periods, genres, or authors. - Doctor of Philosophy in French Upon the student's successful completion of the qualifying exams for the doctoral program, or his admission to the program with a Master's Degree from an accredited institution, a Gui~nce Committee is appointed to advise the candidate in his choice of courses and to help him prepare for his comprehensive examinations and his dissertation. The examination committee is composed of five members, one of whom is in another department, in fields closely related to the student's interest and projected area of specialization; one member of the committee will be expected to direct the dissertation. Language Requirements: A reading knowledge of two foreign languages relevant to the student's area of specialization and subject to the approval of the Department. Course Requirements: A minimum of 18 graduate courses or seminars in French beyond the KA. including a course in literary criticism; two graduate courses in French linguistics, one diachronic and the other synchronic, depending on courses taken for the M.A.; and a minimum of three graduate courses outside the Depart\u00ad ment in areas related to the field of specialization. Teaching: Since the overwhelming majority of Ph.D. candidates plan to teach, this Department recognizes its responsibility to train them as teachers. Therefore, as far as it is possible, all candidates without previous teaching experience are required to participate in a program of supervised teaching for at least one year. Comprehensive Examination -Written and Oral: The written part of the Compre\u00ad hensive consists of a series of open-book examinations involving clearly defined problems of a critical or historical nature. The student may be given from one to three days to answer any part of the examination. The oral part of the Compre\u00ad hensive assesses the student's knowledge of French literature and his understanding of a given literary movement. The student will be examined on (a) five of the fol\u00ad lowing six periods of French literature: Medieval; century; 18th century; 19th century; 20th century; or four of these periods plus the development of a single literary genre through all periods of French literature; (b) a given literary movement (e.g., romanticism, baroque, etc.) in a non-French literature. Dissertation: The~dissertation topic chosen by the candidate will normally, but not necessarily, fall within one of the major fields covered by the qualifying examina\u00ad tion. The dissertation must be defended in an oral examination and approved by the Doctoral Committee before the candidate is recommended for the degree. Three faculty members proposed by the Department and appointed by the Grad\u00ad uate Council constitute the Doctoral Committee which directs the preparation and UC IRVINE - 1972-1973HUMANITIES/FRENCH & ITALIAN 145 completion of the doctoral thesis. The Doctoral Committee supervises a final.exam\u00ad ination, the focus of which is the content. of the doctoral thesis. The Doctoral Committee certifies that a completed thesis is satisfactory through the signatures of the individual Committee members on the title page of the accep~ed thesis.

The study of a language closely related to but sufficiently dif\u00ad ferent from English, such as German, and the study of the social development of German-speaking peoples provide a view of our world which will transcend paro\u00ad chialism. Accordingly, the Department offers a program for majors based on courses in which the emphasis will be .on the study of German language and litera\u00ad ture in their social and political setting. All courses in the Department are taught in German to an extent compatible with the aim of the course. In the basic courses the student will develop an under\u00ad standing of the nature of the language, based on linguistic principles, while learning the necessary skills. Use will be made of the language laboratory. At the end of the first year, students will have attained mastery of the basic structure of the language. At the intermediate and advanced levels the student's ability to read and write German will be gradually developed. A third-year course of two quarters will stress composition as opposed to translation. It will be preceded by a course in phonetics which will aim to perfect the pronunciation as well as to introduce historical and dialectical variants. The introductory course in literature, also in the third year, will UC IRVINE - 1972-1973148 HUMANITIES/GERMAN familiarize the student with German terminology used in the interpretation of.liter\" ature. It is assumed that the student is familiar with basic concepts of literature in English. Students are encouraged to participate in programs of study abroad during the summer and the junior year in Gottingen. Students entering UCI with previous German training will be given advanced stand\u00ad ing as follows. In general, one year of high school work is equated with one quarter of UCI work. Thus students with one, two, three, and four years of high school German will enroll in German IB, IC, 2A, and 2B respectively. Exceptions to this placement procedure must have the approval of the director of first-and second\u00ad year German instruction. Requirements for the Bachelor's Degree University Requirements: See page 22. School Requirements: See page 125. Departmental Requirements German IOOA-B-C, 101, 102A-B; six courses from German 110-199. GRADUATE PROGRAM Master of Arts in German Before entering the program, a candidate is expected to have the equivalent of our undergraduate major. The minimum course requirement for the M.A. degree is three quarters of residency in which the student is engaged full-time in his studies and maintains good academic standing. At an appropriate time during this residency the candidate must present himself for the departmental Methods Examination. The Methods E;amination requires: (I) Familiarity with basic concepts of lin\u00ad guistics and German philology and ability to use them in the analysis of texts. This requirement may be met by successful completion of German 201 (Introduction to Middle High German). (2) An essay on a text chosen from a variety of selections (two-three hours). (3) An oral examination based on the written exam and a selec\u00ad tion of literary works made by the student himself. In this presentation the student is expected to show his grasp of literary methodology and aesthetic evaluation. Proficiency in a foreign language (defined as the equivalent of the level attained at the end of 2C) other than German is further required for the M.A. degree. GERMAN FACULTY William].

Introductory Courses, primarily designed for first-year graduate students, are oriented predomi\u00ad nantly to the study of critical methods. Topical Courses, not limited to strictly literary subjects, will treat such topics in the cultural history of German-speaking areas as the interrelationship of literature and society in the Weimar Republic and the rise of aestheticism during the age of Goethe. No attempt will be made in these courses to cover exhaustively a particular period in German literary or cultural his\u00ad tory. Instead, they will afford in~depth studies of a subject within a period or across period lines. Seminar Courses will be preserved specifically for the pres.entation of new views on a given subject. The same freedom of specific content as explained in the description of Topical Courses applies here. This structuring of graduate courses is to serve as the basis of a proposed Ph.D. program organized on the principle of interdisciplinary studies and the treatment of literature both as an aesthetic phe\u00ad nomenon and a cultural force. For this reason the Department of German and Russian strongly encourages graduate students to enroll in courses given by the English and Comparative Literature Department, the History Department, the Phil\u00ad osophy Department, and other foreign language departments in the School of Humanities. In addition to the following courses, graduate students in German might find these Humanities courses of special interest: Humanities 200 (Historical Theory and Analysis), Humanities 210 (Topics and Methods in Linguistics), Humanities 220 (Literary Theory), and Humanities 230 (Philosophical Analysis). Introductory Courses 201 History of the German Language ( 1) 204 Survey of Germanic Languages ( 1) 205 Introduction to Middle High German ( 1) 210A Methods of Literary Study: Tools of Scholarship; Interpretation of Poetry (1) 210B Methods of Literary Study: Interpretation of Narrative Prose and Drama (1) 21 OC Methods of Literary Study: Literary Theory and the History of Criticism ( 1) Topical Courses May be repeated, provided course content changes.

The first goal can be attained in three related ways: a) Helping the student to acquire a reasonable competence in one fairly broad field of history -focusing upon the more significant events, movements, and institu\u00ad tions, including the role of individuals, forces, and factors, and the whys and wherefores. b) Showing, by way of problems and methods, how historians have worked and are working, including some knowledge of the relationships of History to its sister dis\u00ad ciplines which inevitably affect the whole nature of History. c) Imparting a first hand acquaintance with the evidence and stressing mastery of at least one period or aspect of a student's primary field of interest, so that, as a con\u00ad comitant, he may acquire some appreciation of the pleasure and excitement of intellectual inquiry. Our other goal, a liberal education, is intended to open the mind, and to stretch it, not merely to stock it with knowledge. A liberal education should train the student to think -seeking objectivity and intellectual independence; detecting false arguments and bad evidence; constructing a coherent case; seeing more than one side of an issue and deciding which is better or best; making words perform their task with clarity and precision; distinguishing between the important and the un\u00ad important, the relevant and the irrelevant. These are among the more important values which the study of History should help to develop. Like the lower-division core course, upper-division courses in History are open to students majoring in other fields, though in more advanced courses consent of the instructor may be required. Students who have questions concerning History courses or the History major are encouraged to call upon the departmental office or their advisors for assistance. The History Department seeks to work closely with its students. Three student representatives, one undergraduate, one graduate, and one teaching assistant (elected by their respective constituencies), sit regularly with the faculty at its department meetings and serve on major departmental committees. Students also play an important role in the evaluation of teaching by the faculty and the teaching assistants. UC IRVINE - 1972-1973. 152 HUMANITIES/HISTORY A Summary Statement of the Undergraduate Major Twelve courses: the three-quarter lower-division sequence; six upper-division two-quarter Senior Seminar; one Historiography course. Note: at least three upper-division courses must be related to the area in which the student will select his Senior Seminar. Students who have graduate work in view are urged to have a reading knowledge of a modern European language by their senior year and to seek to use it in the seminar. Requirements for the Bachelor's Degree University Requirements: See page 22. School Requirements: See page 125 .. Departmental Requirements History 29A-B-C or, for upper-division transfer students, a year-long survey in history; seven additional upper-division courses, including one in Historiography; History 190A-B {Senior Seminar). GRADUATE PROGRAM At Irvine we are supplementing the traditional concerns of graduate work in History with several new kinds of emphasis, including those upon: mastering the historiographical and philosophical bases of the subject; exploring the comparative and topical approaches to analysis; exploiting the techniques and insights developed by neighboring disciplines; and developing the ability to teach effectively on the university level. The objective of the program is to provide future historians with the skills, con\u00ad cepts, and perspectives they will need to understand and explain the significance of the past in a world that is changing more and more rapidly. It is our conviction that historians must combine their long-continuing interest in narrative studies with a greater concern for precision in method, relevant generalization, and effective com\u00ad munication if they are to succeed in playing a constructive role. Master of Arts in History 1. Requirements for Admission An applicant for admission to the Master of Arts Program in History should have a Bachelor's Degree with the equivalent of an undergraduate major in History. None\u00ad theless, the Department also welcomes students who have previously specialized in other subject areas and who show promise of sustained and self-disciplined work in History. Note: Admission to the M.A. program does not automatically certify acceptance for later work on the doctoral level. Admission to the Ph.D. program is a separate decision made on the basis of performance during the M.A. year. Typically, a minimum undergraduate grade point average of 3.0 {B) is required for admission, with evidence of better work in History. In addition, all applicants are asked to submit three letters of recommendation, aptitude and achievement scores from the Graduate Record Examination, and examples of written work in History from their undergraduate classes. Students living in Southern California must ar\u00ad range to come to Irvine for an interview with the Chairman of the Department or the Coordinator of Graduate Advising. UC IRVINE - 1972-1973HUMANITIES/IDSTORY 153 2. Language Requirements Except in the\u00b7 cases outlined below, a reading knowledge of one useful foreign language is required for the Master of Arts degree. The student must demonstrate his language proficiency either by passing a departmental examination or by achiev\u00ad ing a score of at least 500 on the appropriate ETS (Educational Testing Service) examination. He may not enroll in a seminar in European History until he has met the language requirement. An individual in American or British History, with his advisor's permission, may choose to substitute a coherent sequence of courses in communications science, statistics, or comparable studies for his Master's language. If he wishes to count . courses which he has taken elsewhere in fulf\"Illment of this requirement, he may be asked to pass special examinations in the subjects specified. 3. Program of Study After consulting with the Coordinator of Graduate Advising, the student will work out his program with an assigned departmental advisor. If he is intending to proceed to the Ph.D., he should begin at this time to delineate his later studies in order that he may fit his work for the M.A. more usefully into his total program. It is desir\u00ad able, usually, for such a student to select a field for the M.A. which is closely re\u00ad lated by area, period, or topic to his probable major field for the Ph.D. At the present time the Department offers work in three areas for students in the Master's year: America (United States) since 1600, Britain since 1500, and Europe since 1700. Nine courses are required for the degree: two in historiography (History 200A-B); two in a research seminar (taken in sequence, as a unit); three in a colloquium (taken in sequence, as a unit); and two in electives (from such courses as History 280, History 285, or History 299). The student will be expected to take his seminar and colloquium within the same general field, i.e., within American, British, or European History. In most cases he will have completed his seminar and his\u00ad toriography as well as two-thirds of his colloquium requirement by the end of his second quarter as a graduate student. 4. Time Limits The Department encourages M.A. students to elect a full-time program, or three courses per quarter. Part-time students and teaching assistants may have a maxi\u00ad mum of six academic quarters to satisfy their requirements, but they are urged to proceed as rapidly as possible. . Doctor of Philosophy in History 1. Requirements for Admission To apply for admission to the doctoral program, the student should have completed the M.A. in History at Irvine or equivalent work at another institution. Whenever possible, however, it would be advisable for the potential doctoral student to begin his graduate work on this campus, since the doctoral student who has taken~is M.A. elsewhere will be expected during his first year to enroll in a program identical to that of the incoming M.A. students. Applicants who have not previously done so must take the Graduate Record Examination in both the Aptitude and Advanced History sections. The results of this test, together with the student's record, letters, and interview where possible, will be used in deciding for or against his application for admission. UC IRVINE - 1972-1973154 HUMANITIES/HISTORY 2. Language Requirements All students, except as specified below, must demonstrate a reading knowledge of one useful foreign language no later than the end of the first year in the program. Normally, the student will count his Master's language in fulfillment of this stipula\u00ad tion, but his proficiency can also be established by his passing a departmental test or by achieving a score of at least 500 on the appropriate ETS examination. (Note: Scores from examinations taken more than two years prior to admission to the doctoral program will not be accepted as satisfying this requirement.) Students in American or British history who have opted for a language substitute in completing the UCI Master's Degree will be allowed to submit this work in fulfillment of \"further 'special skill' requirements\" (see paragraph 3, below) and will not be sub\u00ad ject to the one-year time limit for achieving a foreign language competence. 3. Further \"Special Skill\" Requirements These depend upon the field of emphasis which the student selects: a. An individual with a major field in United States or British History may either demonstrate a reading knowledge of a second useful foreign language (by achieving an ETS score of 500 or by passing a language test designed by his advisor),or, with his advisor's permission, complete, as a doctoral student, a coherent sequence of courses in an area of study (e.g., communications science, computer work, statistics, linguistic analysis) that will provide tools useful in mastering his major field. These courses would be taken in addition to those described in paragraph 4, below, and should not lie within the student's major, minor, or outside fields. Any student who wishes to count courses which he has taken previous to his UCI graduate work in fulfillment of this requirement may be asked to pass a special examination on the methods in question. b. An individual with a major field in a non-American or non-British area must demonstrate a reading knowledge of a second useful foreign language. He can do this either by achieving an ETS score of 500 or by passing a language test arranged by his advisor. 4. Program of Study After consulting with the Coordinator of Graduate Advising, the student will be assigned a departmental advisor who will be responsible for approving his fields of study, helping him to select consulting faculty, and, after the student has passed his qualifying examinations, recommending the director of his dissertation. The student will prepare himself for qualifying examinations in four fields: a major a related minor, a second minor -all in History -and one aspect of a discipline outside of History which is related to his major field. a. The major and minor fields will be either defined topically or chosen from among the historical periods regularly offered (various combinations of themes and periods may be worked out). In devising topical fields (e.g., history of democratic institutions, war in the modern world, comparative industrialization, comparative reform movements), a student must obtain the consent of both his advisor and the Coordinator of Graduate Advising. In planning such a program, the student should -make certain that instructors are available and that an adequate concern for his-r torical continuity is built into the design. b. Four historical periods are currently offered as major fields by the Department: Europe since 1815; Great Britain, 1485-1714; Great Britain since 1714; and America since 1840. UC IRVINE - 1972-1973HUMANITIES/HISTORY 155 c. Comparable periods will be offered as minor fields in Ancient, Medieval, and early Modern European History, as well as in Colonial American and Latin American History. Course requirements for doctoral students include the following: a. One two-quarter sequence in Historiography (normally taken during the first and second quarters of the first doctoral year). Students with a Master's degree from UCI are exempted from this requirement. b. One two-quarter seminar in the major field (normally taken during the first and second quarters of the first doctoral year). Students with a Master's degree from UCI are exempted from this requirement. c. Two three-quarter (i.e., year-long) colloquium sequences, the first of which will encompass the student's major field and the second of which will encompass one of his minor fields. Normally, the first would be taken during the first doctoral year and the second during the second doctoral year. Students with an M.A. from UCI are exempted from the first of these two sequences. The remainder of the student's program during each quarter of his residence will consist of those colloquia, seminars, and courses in Special Topics (History 280), Special Methods (History 285), or Directed Reading (History 299) with which he chooses to prepare himself for his examinations and with which he can attain the normal academic load of three courses per quarter. (For a teaching assistant or other student who is devoting at least half-time to teaching, five courses per academic year is the normal load.) It should be noted that the University residence requirement for the Ph.D. is six quarters and that this is usually fulfilled during the first two years that a student is in the program. University regulations stipulate that a student must be registered during fall, winter, and spring quarters unless he has petitioned for and been granted a leave of absence. 5. Teaching Requirements All doctoral students are expected to do at least some teaching under the direction of the regular faculty, either as teaching assistants or as temporary associates. All teaching assistants working in the History Core Course (29A-B-C) must enroll for the Practicum in Teaching (329A-B-C). Associateships can be arranged for by the student's advisor and will typically involve a limited experience in lecturing, discussion-group leadership, preparation of examinations, and the planning of a course. Upon the student's completion of this work, the advisor will prepare a state\u00ad ment of evaluation which wiii be entered in the student's dossier. Teaching assist\u00ad ants will be evaluated both by the professors and the undergraduates of the courses in which they teach, and the evaluations will be placed among their departmental records. 6., The Qualifying Examinations and Dissertation After completing the appropriate courses and other preparatory work (normally seven to eight quarters after beginning the M.A. at Irvine or six to seven quarters after joining the Ph.D. program from the outside), the student will present himself for written examinations in his major and minor fields and, following this, for a qualifying oral examination covering his entire program (with previously deter\u00ad mined emphases) except for the omission of his second minor. After passing the written and oral examinations, the student will be advanced to candidacy for the Ph.D. and will work upon his dissertation. The research and writing involved in this UC IRVINE - 1972-1973156 HUMANITIESflllSTORY effort can be expected to require from one to two years. There will be a final oral examination on the dissertation before it is accepted by the Department: HISTORY FACULTY Kendall Bailes, Ph.D. Columbia University, Assistant Professor of History Kenneth P.

UC IRVINE - 1972-1973HUMANITIES/LANGUAGE LAB, LINGUISTICS I6I LANGUAGE LABORATORY The Language Laboratory offers courses in a number of modem languages on a self\u00ad instructional basis. These courses are typically numbered KIA, KIB, and KIC, offered in three one-quarter sequences. The bulk of the work is done in the Lan\u00ad guage Laboratory with prerecorded dialogues, grammar drills, and cultural units, accompanied by student textbooks and workbooks. Each student is expected to attend the Language Laboratory a minimum of one hour daily. The students, work\u00ad ing at their own pace, are then examined on a regular weekly basis in one or more live contact hours with UCI faculty proficient in the given language. Even though these are basically self-instructional courses, students can receive full credit and will be given recorded grades by the testing teams on the termination of each quarter's work. The courses offered by the Language Laboratory are: ESL (English as a Second Language) KIA, KIB, KIC; Portuguese KIA, KIB, KlC; Spanish KIA, KIB, KIC. These are typically run in the normal sequence of fall, winter, and spring. However, students are allowed to pace themselves either more rapidly or more slowly as their time and talents permit. PROGRAM IN LINGUISTICS Linguistics is a field of study with potential relationships with several disciplines concerned with language. Because of these various possibilities in emphasis and be\u00ad cause linguistic studies are on the edge of territory as yet unexplored and therefore without precedent, the linguistic group in the School of Humanities has formulated programs which are highly flexible. Students are encouraged to enroll in linguistic courses with varying perspectives and counsel with faculty across schools and departments. The student obtaining a B.A. in linguistics is expected to have some awareness of linguistic work beyond his own specialization. \u00b7 The requirements of the program are desfgned to provide guiqelines sufficient to give direction; each student's program will be an individual development between the student and his discipline. Although the program is suggested for those students who are primarily interested in the emphasis of language in their linguistic studies, if a student has an innovative idea for a course of study that would not follow this general plan, he may propose his plan to his advisors and petition for a change in .th<: requirements. It is iJ.Ssumed that this would occur after finishing the core courses (Linguistics 50, IOI, I02, I03). Requirements for the Bachelor's Degree University Requirements: See page 22. School Requirements: See page I25. UC IRVINE - 1972-1973162 HUMANITIES/ LINGUISTICS Program Requirements 1. Linguistics 50, 101, 102, 103; 2.

Each discipline inevitably poses problems concerning the nature of the standards appropriate to it and the place of its subject matter within the total framework of human knowledge. If we are to understand science or art or literature, or such human practices as morality and religion, we are bound to address ourselves to philosophical issues relating to their nature, the uses of reason appropriate to them, and the contributions they make to our understanding and appreciation of ourselves and the world in which we live. UNDERGRADUATE PROGRAM Instruction in philosophy relies essentially upon discussion in which students are \u00b7': active participants. Wherever possible, therefore, classes are severely limited in size,. in order to permit sustained dialogues between student and instructor. \u00b7.:. Some of the courses offered are of general interest to all students. Others are de\u00ad signed to explore issues that arise in selected and special disciplines. Among these \u00b7 are courses in the philosophy of science and of art. The staff should be consulted for advice about courses best suited to the specialized needs of particular students. The program of course offerings is also designed for those majors in philosophy whose intention may be either to enter some professional school upon graduation (e.g., law) or to engage in graduate work in philosophy. Requirements for the Bachelor's Degree University Requirements: See page 22. School Requirements: See page 125. Departmental Requirements Philosophy 50, 120A-B-C. Two of the following: Philosophy 100A-B, 110A-B, 115A-B. Two additional quarter courses from Philosophy 101-199. UC IRVINE - 1972-1973HUMANITIES/PillLOSOPHY 165 GRADUATE PROGRAMS Students are encouraged to seek the counsel of any and all members of the Depart\u00ad ment whose recommendations the student would deem helpful. It is hoped that there will be a close intellectual relationship between graduate student and pro\u00ad fessor in order to provide the student with optimum conditions for philosophical development and to expedite his progress toward advanced degrees. In addition, the Department sponsors a series of colloquia each year. Participation in these colloquia is an important part of the graduate student's training. Master of Arts in Philosophy There is no list of course requirements for the M.A. degree. Th_e M.A. program in Philosophy minimally takes one year. The student may elect to follow either of the following routes to the degree: write a thesis on a subject to be chosen on consulta\u00ad tion with his advisor and defend his thesis in an oral examination, or satisfy the Logic and History of Philosophy requirements for the Ph.D. (see below). Application for admission to candidacy for the M.A. degree is not automatic, but requires formal application to the Dean of the Graduate Division via the Philosophy Department Office. Application must be made with the recommendation of the Philosophy Department and should take place at the beginning of the quarter in which the student is expected to complete the requirements listed above. Doctor of Philosophy in Philosophy There is no set number of courses required for the Ph.D., thus allowing course work to be tailored to the individual student's needs and interests. However, as a pre\u00ad requisite for the Ph.D. degree, every student is required to have some experience in teaching and will enroll in three sections of Philosophy 399 (University Teacher Training) as the means of satisfying this requirement. The Ph.D. program is designed to take four years for the normally qualified student. In exceptional cases it may be possible to obtain the degree within three years. A Master's Degree is not a prerequisite for the Ph.D. The requirements for the Ph.D. degree are as follows: Tools of research, to be satisfied by demonstrating proficiency in a single appropri\u00ad ate foreign language* or by passing with a grade of B or better five to six courses at the graduate level in a discipline or disciplines outside of the Philosophy Depart\u00ad ment. Approval for the latter alternative will be granted by the Department only if, in its judgment, the courses form an integrated unit in light of the student's re\u00ad search interest. Logic, to be satisfied by passing Philosophy 152 with a grade of B or better or by passing an examination on equivalent material upon petition. (The Department must grant the petition; it is required in order to allow the Department sufficient time to prepare the examination.) *The foreign language examinations are administered by the Department of Philosophy. They are two hours in length and consist of translating, with the aid of a dictionary, passages from two books. Students wishing information as to courses to prepare them for these examinations and dates when these examinations will be given should consult the Philosophy Department Office, Room 500 of the Humanities Office Building (833-6526). UC IRVINE - 1972-1973166 HUMANITIES/PHILOSOPHY History of Philosophy, to be covered by written examinations in the following areas: Ancient Philosophy; Medieval Philosophy; Modem Philosophy (Rationalism\u00b7 and Empiricism); Kant and Nineteenth-Century Philosophy (including Mill and Peirce). These examinations will take three hours each and will be offered at the beginning of every quarter. A student may attempt as many at a time as he wishes. Each examination will consist of three questions with no options drawn from a list of 12 questions. **The lists of 12 questions will be made available to the. student upon entering graduate school, and he must pass all four examinations by the beginning of\u00b7the seventh quarter of graduate work. Except for this provision, there is no limit on the number of times a student may elect to attempt any of these examinations. - Portfolio of three papers representing the student's best work,in three separate areas of Philosophy (e.g., Ethics, Philosophy of Language, and Epistemology). These papers need not have been written expressly for this purpose but may have been originally submitted for course work. Admission to candidacy and the writing of a thesis. Upon successful completion of the above requirements, the student will apply for admission to candidacy for the Ph.D. degree by lUling out the appropriate forms and returning them to the Philoso\u00ad phy Department office. A Candidacy Committee including one or two members from an academic area outside of Philosophy is then appointed by the Graduate Council. This Committee administers an oral examination to determine whether the student is qualified to begin work designed to lead to the completion of a thesis. Upon passing this oral examination, the student becomes a candidate for the Ph.D. degree and will be assigned to the Doctoral Committee by the Graduate Council. The Doctoral Committee then supervises the student's further course work and research, as well as the actual writing of the doctoral thesis. The defense of the thesis. At a suitable point during the development of the thesis, the Doctoral Committee administers an oral examination, the focus of which is the content of the thesis itself. If at all possible, this examination will be given while the student is still in residence. PHILOSOPHY FACULTY Nelson C.

PROGRAM IN RUSSIAN RUSSIAN UNDERGRADUATE PROGRAM Russian is a language ~poken by 220 million people in the Soviet Union and ranks with English and Chinese as one of the three major world languages. Russian is a UC IRVINE - 1972-1973HUMANITIES/RUSSIAN 171 language of the Indo-European family and is thus related to English, French, and German. Russian is difficult, but not in the way so many potential students en\u00ad visage. It is an infinitely rich language, as is English, and adapts itself well to a variety of styles and genres from lyric love poetry to the seeming harshness and brashness of the futurists. For the first two years the Program in Russian emphasizes a reading knowledge of literary Russian. In the latter part of the second year, and thereafter, the speaking and writing skills are emphasized. At the end of his senior year, the student can expect to have attained a rather high level of proficiency in all language skills - reading, writing, speaking, and understanding. By then he will have read a number of selected literary texts -including a fair portion of the significant masterworks - in the original. He will also have familiarized himself with some of the historical background of the language and with its relation to other Slavic and European languages. And he will have achieved a reasonable degree of familiarity with the major cultural and social trends in Russian history. In addition to the regular Russian major with emphasis on language and literature, the Program in Russian offers a modified major with emphasis on linguistics. Requirements for the Bachelor's Degree University Requirements: See page 22. School Requirements: See page 125. Departmental Requirements The Russian major consists of the following 12 courses: Russian 1 OA-B; 11; 101A-B; 101C; 151A-B-C; 160A-B; 170. In addition, it is strongly recommended that the student take or audit Linguistics 50, and Russian 150A-B-C, 180, 181, and 20A-B. The Russian major with emphasis on linguistics consists of the following 12 courses: lOA-B; 11; 101A-B-C; two courses from 151A-B-C and 160A-B; Linguistics 101, 102, 103, 151.

May be repeated. 200 Selected Topics in Russian Linguistics UC IRVINE - 1972-1973HUMANITIES/SPANISH & PORTUGUESE 173 DEPARTMENT OF SPANISH AND PORTUGUESE The main objectives of the program in Spanish and Portuguese are: to develop com\u00ad petence in the ability to understand, speak, read, and write Spanish and Portuguese; to provide through the knowledge of these two languages an understanding and ap\u00ad preciation of their literature and culture. Students are placed in Spanish courses according to their years of previous study and their grades. In general, one year of high school work is equated with one quar\u00ad ter of UCI work. All courses in Spanish and Portuguese, unless specifically stated, are taught in the foreign language. First-year courses meet in the classroom four times a week and in the language laboratory twice a week. By the end of the first year, students attain mastery of the basic structure of the language and ability to converse on everyday topics as well as to read and write on' an elementary plane. Self-instructional courses in both Spanish and Portuguese are also available. In the second year, emphasis is put on gradually raising the level of the student's ability to read and write. A third-year course of two quarters stresses composition as opposed to translation. Further, a C(.>urse in phonetics perfects pronunciation, introduces theoretical considerations, and presents historical and dialectal variants. The introductory courses in literature, also in the third year, emphasize the analysis and appreciation of complete literary works by genre rather than the study of many short selections of innumerable authors in an anthology. The courses in Hispanic civilization combine a panoramic over-view with a close look at a specific country or topic. Although no major in Portuguese is offered, advanced literature courses are available. Students are encouraged to participate in programs of study abroad during the summer and the junior year. Elected representatives of the undergraduate majors, the graduate students, and the teaching assistants participate with full voting rights in Department meetings. Requirements for the Bachelor's Degree University Requirements: See page 22. School Requirements: See page 125. Departmental Requirements Spanish 10A-B, 11, 12A-B-C, llOA, B, or C; Linguistics 50. In addition, each student chooses one of the following three emphases: Literature: Four upper-division courses in literature with a minimum of one in Spanish-American Literature and one in Spanish Literature. Culture: Two courses in Latin-American Literature; Spanish llOA-B-C. Linguistics: Linguistics 101, 102, 103; one course in the philosophy of language (Philosophy 135 ). UC IRVINE - 1972-1973174 HUMANITIES/SPANISH & PORTUGUESE GRADUATE PROGRAMS Master of Arts in Spanish The candidate is expected to have the equivalent of our undergraduate major. He takes a minimum of 11 courses, eight of which must be graduate courses. Two of the 11 courses must be in linguistics. A maximum of two courses may be trans\u00ad ferred from another university but a maximum of five from another University of California campus. Proficiency (defined as the equivalent of the level attained at the end of course 2C) in a foreign language other than the major language is required. The comprehensive examination, in part written, in part oral, will be based both on a reading list and the courses taken by the student and will also test the student's - ability to express himself correctly in Spanish.' No thesis is required. Students should have a knowledge of the fundamentals of Latin (equivalent to the level at\u00ad tained at the end of Latin 1B) as a prerequisite for the courses in the history of the Spanish language. Ph.D. in Spanish The Department of Spanish and Portuguese offers a Ph.D. degree with a major in either Spanish or Spanish-American Literature. The program attempts to integrate period and genre studies with work in literary theory, linguistics, and socio\u00ad historical studies. A number of courses outside of the department are required. We thereby hope to aid in the formation of a Ph.D. candidate who is not a narrow specialist, but a scholar acquainted with the various fields that relate to his discipline. We are concerned also with the practical aspects of helping our graduates to become good teachers. The minor field can be Spanish literature, Spanish-American literature, or Spanish linguistics. Language Requirements A reading knowledge of Portuguese and two other languages relevant to the stu\u00ad dent's area of specialization and subject to the approval of the Department; the fundamentals of Latin (the equivalent of UCI courses lA-B) are a prerequisite for the courses in diachronic linguistics. Course Requirements A minimum of 24 courses for the Ph.D. as follows: Two graduate courses in linguistics, diachronic and synchronic (the students who select linguistics as a minor will substitute two courses in either Spanish or Spanish\u00b7 American Literature); a course in Theory of Language; a course in Literary Theory (genre studies, etc.); a course in Methods of Literary Criticism; a course on the sociohistorical context of the period of the student's specialization; a course in Bra\u00ad zilian or Portuguese Literature (preferably related to the student's specialization); three courses outside of the department in non-Iberic literatures (preferably related to the student's major with regard to period and genre), or, if the minor is Spanish linguistics, three courses in general linguistics and/or non-Iberic literatures; fourteen courses in Hispanic literature, with a minimum of four in the minor area, the rest chosen by the student in accord with his major. (Students with a minor in linguis\u00ad tics will take twelve courses in Hispanic literature, with a minimum of two in the field [Spanish or Spanish-American) not chosen as a major. Each Ph.D. candidate should take one course in each genre within his area.) UC IRVINE - 1972-1973HUMANITIES/SPANISH & PORTUGUESE 175 Candidates who have the M.A. degree from another University will be interviewed by two professors representing peninsular and Spanish-American literature, in order to evaluate their past studies in terms of our doctoral program; it is recommended that the student's graduate advisor should be the person likely to direct his doctoral dissertation, and that the choice of dissertation and director be made as early as possible; each Ph.D. candidate will act as an assistant to a professor in an upper\u00ad division course in his area of specialization, attending the class regularly and partici\u00ad pating in the teaching (it will count as one of the required graduate courses). Teaching Since the overwhelming majority of Ph.D. candidates plan to teach, this Depart\u00ad ment recognizes its responsibility to train them as teachers. Therefore, all candi\u00ad dates for the Ph.D. without previous teaching experience are required to teach under supervision at UCI one course in each of three quarters. Comprehensive Examination The student is admitted to candidacy if he passes by a majority vote an oral exam\u00ad ination administered by a Candidacy Committee appointed by the Graduate Council. The Candidacy Committee is composed of five members, of whom four will be from the Department. The oral examination will be preceded by a written examination as follows: The examination will consist of four parts according to the area of specialization. (Spanish Literature or Spanish-American Literature). Spanish Literature: Major: an historical literary period, including all of the genres and the socio-historical context; a genre in all the periods, and the student will demonstrate knowledge of literary theory and methods of literary criticism; the other genres and chronological periods. \u00b7 Minor area: Spanish-American Literature (all genres of the period which corre\u00ad sponds to the major period) or Spanish Linguistics. Spanish-American Literature: Major: a literary genre in all the periods, and the stu\u00ad dent will demonstrate a knowledge of literary theory and methods of literary criti\u00ad cism; an historical literary period, including all of the genres and the sociohistorical context; the rest of the genres and periods.\u00b7 Minor area: a period of Spanish Literature (all genres) or Spanish Linguistics. NOTE: the student whose major area is medieval literature will choose as his minor area a period of Spanish-American Literature or Linguistics. Dissertation A dissertation topic will be chosen by the candidate which will normally, but not necessarily, fall within one of the major fields covered by the qualifying examina\u00ad tion: Three faculty members appointed by the Graduate Council constitute the Doctoral Committee which supervises the preparation and completion of the doctoral thesis. The Doctoral Committee supervises a final examination, the focus of which is the content of the doctoral thesis. Ordinarily, this examination will not be given after completion of the thesis, but rather at an appropriate point during its development. UC IRVINE - 1972-1973176 HUMANITIES/SPANISH & PORTUGUESE Such final examinations will normally be given while the graduate student is in residence. The Doctoral Committee certifies that a completed thesis is satisfactory through the signatures of the individual Committee members on the title page of the accepted thesis.

UC IRVINE - 1972-1973PHYSICAL SCIENCES 179 SCHOOl OF PHYSICAl SCIENCES Frederick Reines Dean The School of Physical Sciences offers both preprofessional training and general education in the Departments of Chemistry, Mathematics, and Physics. The faculty, active in research and graduate education, is at the same time vitally concerned with UJ)dergraduate teaching. Curricula of the School are designed to meet the needs of a wide variety of students ranging from those with little technical background who seek insight into the activities and accomplishments of physical sciences to those seeking a comprehensive understanding that will prepare them for creative research in physical science. Over the course of the past century and a half, physics, chemistry, and mathematics have evolved into interdependent but separate intellectual disciplines. This develop\u00ad ment is reflected in the departmental structure of the School of Physical Sciences. In the same period, these fundamental disciplines have moved into domains of ab\u00b7 straction unimagined by early scientists. This trend to abstraction with its concomi\u00b7 tant increase in understanding of the physical universe provides the major challenge to the student of the physical sciences. Mathematics, physics, and chemistry, while providing the foundation of the technology that dominates contemporary civiliza\u00ad tion, underlie to an ever-increasing extent the new developments in the biological and social sciences. In recognition of the contribution students can make to the academic affairs of the School, a variety of responsibilities on School and Departmental committees are given to undergraduate and graduate students. Degrees Offered in the School Chemistry . Mathematics Physics B.A., M.A., Ph.D. B.A., M.A., Ph.D. B.A., M.A., Ph.D. Criteria used by the School of Physical Sciences in selecting candidates for honors at graduation are as follows: Approximately 1% will be awarded summa cum laude, and 8% cum laude. UNDERGRADUATE PROGRAMS Each department offers courses that are of value to nonmajors and majors in the sciences. The programs for majors are designed to meet the needs of students planning careers in other fields and of students planning graduate work that con\u00ad tinues their major interest. In the belief that understanding and satisfaction follow more from depth than from breadth, the School offers no general survey course. However, each department offers a selection of general education courses having few or no prerequisites. See the departmental listings for descriptions of these courses, e.g., Chemistry 20.22, Mathematics 15-16, and Physics 11-19. UC IRVINE - 1972-1973180 PHYSICAL SCIENCES/CHEMISTRY Planning a Program of Study Every undergraduate student who has chosen to major in Physical Sciences is as\u00ad signed a faculty advisor with whom the student should consult in formulating a suitable program of study. (Should the student at any time be uncertain of the identity of his advisor, he may obtain this information in the office of the Dean or the appropriate Department Chairman.) In consultation with his advisor the student should plan a course of study leading to a major in one of the departments of the School. In carrying out this major, he may often concentrate very heavily in a sec\u00ad ond department within the School or in some other School. Occasionally students choose to pursue a double major. Permission to do so may be sought by a petition submitted to the office of the Dean of Physical Sciences. All initial courses of study for majors include mathematics through calculus, and calculus is a prerequisite for much of the upper-division work in each major. A stu\u00ad dent interested in any of the physical sciences should continue his mathematical training beyond these prerequisite courses. Furthermore, the student interested in either physics or chemistry will usually include work in both of these-subjects in his undergraduate career. Although English is becoming increasingly the international language of science, much important scientific literature is still printed in foreign languages, and scien\u00ad tists need to communicate in person with foreign colleagues. Comprehension of at least one of the languages, French, German, or Russian, is an integral requirement of the preparation for majors in mathematics. Precise and clear expression in written English will be expected in course work in the School. Students found deficient by the School may be required to enroii in English 28A-B-C. Students in the physical sciences are urged to acquire a working knowledge of com\u00ad puter programming at an early stage of their university careers. This can be done by taking Information and Computer Science 1. Requirements for the Bachelor's Degree University Requirements: See page 22. School Requirements: None (se.e departmental requirements). GRADUATE PROGRAMS A program of course work and research leading to the M.A. and Ph.D. degrees is offered in each of the three departments of the School. The individual programs are described in the following announcements of each department. \u00b7\u00b7 'o DEPARTMENT OF CHEMISTRY UNDERGRADUATE PROGRAM The major in Chemistry is elected by students planning careers in the chemical sci\u00ad ences and frequently also by those whose interests lie in biology, medicine, earth sciences, secondary education, business, and law. The curriculum of the Depart-\u00b7' UC IRVINE - 1972-1973PHYSICAL SCIENCES/CHEMISTRY 181 ment is designed to satisfy the diverse needs of these students and others who may have occasion to study chemistry. The year course in General Chemistry is prerequi\u00ad site to all study in the Department at more advanced levels and serves also as a thorough introduction to the varied aspects of modem chemistry for students who do not wish to pursue their studies beyond the introductory level. The Organic Chemistry course is required for Chemistry majors and for students of the life sci\u00ad ences. Certain more advanced courses required of Chemistry majors may also be of particular interest to the latter groups, among others. \u00b7 The undergraduate program of the Chemistry Department emphasizes close contact with research. Chemistry majors are urged to engage in research under the direction of a staff member. Much of the important chemical literature is being and has been printed in foreign languages, principally German, Russian, and French. Reading competence in one or more of these languages is desirable and many graduate schools require the demon\u00ad stration of such competence as a prerequisite for an advanced degree. Chemistry majors are encouraged to acquire this competence. A chemistry major who seeks a secondary teaching credential in chemistry is urged to consult with his advisor and with the Office of Teacher Education early in his undergraduate career. Chemistry majors who plan subsequent study in medical, dental, or other professional schools should request information concerning admis\u00ad sion requirements directly from the schools which they seek to enter. Those intend\u00ad ing to pursue graduate studies in chemistry should discuss their plans with their academic advisors. Requirements for the Bachelor's Degree University Requirements: See page 22. School Requirements: None. Departmental Requirements Basic Requirements: One year of calculus (Mathematics 2A-B-C or equivalent), one year of physics with laboratory for which calculus is a prerequisite (Physics 5A-B-C with laboratory or equivalent -Physics 3A-B-C with laboratory will be allowed for Chemistry-Biology double majors), one year of general chemistry with laboratory (Chemistry 1 and IL, or 11 and IlL, or equivalent), one year of organic chemistry and laboratory (Chemistry 51 and 51L or equivalent), one year of physical chemis\u00ad try (Chemistry 131A-B-C or equivalent), one quarter of quantitative analysis (Chemistry 150 or equivalent). Electives: Five courses chosen from the elective list below. These must include at least two chemistry courses (Chemistry 180 may be counted no more than once) and at least one of the laboratory courses in the following laboratory course group: Chemistry 151, Chemistry 152, Biological Sciences 125, Physics 150, Physics 151, Physics 152, Physics 153. Elective List: All chemistry courses numbered 151-263, Bio. Sci. 101 F (Biochemis\u00ad try), Bio. Sci. 101G (Molecular Biology), Bio. Sci. 123 (Biophysical Chemistry), Bio. Sci. 125 (Biochemical Methodology), Bio. Sci. 126A-B (Biochemistry), Bio. Sci. 128 (Molecular Genetics), Physics 111A-B (Classical Mechanics), Physics 112A-B (Electromagnetic Theory), Physics 115 (Statistical Physics), Physics 116 (Thermo\u00ad dynamics), Physics 130 (Quantum Mechanics), Physics 131 (Atomic Physics), Physics 132 (Nuclear Physics), Physics 133 (Solid State Physics), Physics 141 UC IRVINE - 1972-1973182 PHYSICAL SCIENCES/CHEMISTRY (Modern Optics), Physics 150 (Electronics), Physics 151 (Advanced Lab), Physics 15.2 (Advanced Lab), Physics 153 (Advanced Lab). Scientific Breadth Requirement: A total of six additional four-or five-unit courses chosen from the offerings of the Departments of Mathematics and Physics and the School of Biological Sciences. (These may be take\u00b7n on a\u00b7Pass/Not Pass basis subject to the usual restrictions on Pass/Not Pass enrollment.) Planning a Program of Study The departmental requirements leave the student a great deal of latitude in his choice of courses- the student can choose to purs~e interests ranging from bio\u00ad chemistry on the one hand to chemical physics on the other. Many of the basic re- . quirements above coincide with those of the School of Biological Sciences, and a double major in Chemistry-Biology does not require much extra course work. -Students should consult with their advisors on courses of study. A chemistry major would usually be expected to take Chemistry 1 and 1L, Mathematics 2, ICS 1, and Physics 5A-B, plus one elective course per quarter during his freshman year. In the sophomore year the chemistry major would usually take Chemistry 51 and 51L, Mathematics 3, Physics 5C-D-E, plus an elective course per quarter. For the junior year Chemistry 131, Chemistry 150, Chemistry 152, and Chemistry 151, plus two elective courses per quarter would be advisable. In the senior year the student would be advised to take Chemistry 215 plus a number of electives. The foregoing program lists explicitly those chemistry courses which most graduate schools would \u00b7 require their entering students to have taken. It should be noted that the more bio\u00ad logically oriented student may elect not to take Physics 5D-E and Mathematics 3, \u00b7! while the more physically oriented student may choose to take more courses taught in the mathematics and physics departments. Courses listed as electives may be used as needed to satisfy University and Departmental requirements. It should be recog\u00ad nized that courses such as Biological Sciences courses which count toward Depart\u00ad mental requirements may be used simultaneously to satisfy University requirements if a student so desired. There is no language requirement, but chemistry majors are urged to obtain reading competence in a forc;ign language through course work .. GRADUATE PROGRAMS. The Department offers programs leading to both the M.A. and the Ph.D. degrees in Chemistry. These programs are identical for the student during his first year of graduate work. The M.A. degree is granted in recognition of a broad knowledge of the facts and theories of modem chemistry, together with skill and competence in laboratory techniques; the Ph.D. degree is granted in recognition of the demon\u00ad strated ability to carry out independent research in chemistry. Both programs rely on specific examinations of various kinds: area examinations over the general content of chemical knowledge, cumulative examinations over more recent specific developments in chemistry, and an oral candidacy examination in defense of original research propositions. Only the area examinations are re\u00ad quired for candidates for the M.A. degree, but all three are required for the Ph.D. degree. A comprehensive program of graduate courses is also available and is an integral part of the graduate program. The specific program most suitable for a particular graduate student will be recommended to him by the Department, taking cogni\u00ad zance of his performance on the initial area examinations. UC IRVINE - 1972-1973PHYSICAL SCIENCES/CHEMISTRY 183 ~aster of Arts \u00b7in Chemistry fhe requirements for the M.A. degree can be met through either one of two plans, ts described below. For either plan, a minimum of three quarters in residence is \u00b7equired. Plan I (Thesis Plan) requires completion of an original thesis. Plan II :course Examination Plan) requires the completion of ten graduate courses in :hemistry ~than average grade of B or better. (Chemistry 290 and 291 may not be :ounted toward the total of ten courses, and Chemistry 280 may be counted only mce.) Both plans require successful completion of the-area examinations. fhe procedures for passing the area examinations are described in more detail in the :ection on the Ph.D. degree. The thesis required for the M.A. degree summarizes the \u00b7esults of original research performed by the student under the supervision of a 'acuity member. No oral examination is required in defense of the dissertation sub- nitted for the M.A. degree. \u00b7 \u00b7 )octor of Philosophy in Chemistry rhe principal requirements for the Ph.D. Degree in Chemistry are six quarters in esidence, admission to candidacy, and successful completion and defense of a dis\u00ad ertation reporting results of original research. .. Residence. As many as three of the six quarters in residence may be waived for tudents who have had graduate work at another institution. :. Admission to candidacy. Students must pass area examinations in each of hese three general fields of chemistry: physical chemistry, organic chemistry, and r1organic and nuclear chemistry. These examinations presume thorough preparation r1 the various areas at the level of undergraduate instruction. Area examinations are iven in September, February, and May and must be successfully completed by the nd of the third examination period after initial enrollment. A series of cumulative xaminations given each month and more closely oriented toward current chemical esearch is also taken. Students shall begin taking the cumulative examinations in he month following successful completion of the area examinations, and all subse\u00ad :uent examinations must be taken until the requirement is satisfied. Successful ompletion of four examinations within a maximum of 12 attempts satisfies this equirement. moral examination on original research propositions and on the student's thesis esearch topic is given within two quarters following completion of the cumulative xaminations. Successful completion of the oral examination leads to recommenda\u00ad lon for admission to candidacy. In the event of a failure on the oral examination, ne re-examination is permitted within three months of the first. tuderits must achieve admission to candidacy before the beginning of their ninth uarter of residence unless exceptional conditions justify an extension of time . . . CoUr-se Requirements. The student is required to pass, with an average grade of :or better, the graduate courses specified for him by the Department. These ourses will be chosen with his particular interests in mind and will ordinarily in\u00ad tude six to eight one-quarter graduate courses. No minimum number is specified, owever, and excellent performance in the area examinations will result in a smaller umber of specified courses for the student . . Foreign Language Requirements. The dissertation committee may require the ~udent to demonstrate proficiency in one modern foreign language with a signifi- UC IRVINE - 1972-1973184 PHYSICAL SCIENCES/CHEMISTRY cant chemical literature, if the committee deems such proficiency requisite to pur\u00ad suit of the student's dissertation research_ The dissertation committee will establish the method of demonstrating foreign language proficiency. 5. Dissertation. A dissertation summarizing the results of original research per\u00ad formed by the student under the supervision of a faculty member in the Depart\u00ad ment is required for the Ph.D. degree. The criterion for acceptance by the Depart\u00ad ment of a dissertation is that its contents be suitable for publication in a scientific journal.

DEPARTMENT OF MATHEMATICS The curriculum in mathematics -from lower-division to graduate courses -is aug\u00b7 mented by opportunities for supervised individual study and research, seminars, colloquia, and the mathematics programs at nearby branches of the University of California. It is designed to be compatible with curricular structures at other colle\u00ad giate institutions in California so as to enable students transferring to UCI to con\u00ad tinue their programs of mathematics study. UC IRVINE - 1972-1973PHYSICAL SCIENCES/MATHEMATICS 189 UNDERGRADUATE PROGRAM Undergraduate mathematics courses are of several kinds: (a) courses preparatory to 1dvanced work in mathematics, the exact sciences, and engineering; (b) courses for ;tudents of the social sciences; (c) courses for liberal arts students and.those plan\u00ad lling to enter the teaching field. Requirements for the Bachelor's Degree University Requirements: See page 22. School Requirements: None. Departmental Requirements fhe following requirements apply to freshmen entering UCI in 1970-71 and there\u00ad !.fter. All other students are subject only to the requirements in force at UCI at the time in which they became freshmen; however, no students are required to take more than one year of a foreign language. ::>ne year of calculus (Mathematics 2A-B-C or equivalent); 12 upper-division or grad\u00ad late courses in mathematics including Mathematics 120A-B-C or equivalent and .Wathematics 140A-B-C or equivalent; three additional courses in chemistry, mathe\u00ad matics, physics, or information and computer science; three years of high school ;tudy or one year of college study in French, German, or Russian (in extraordinary :ircumstances a student may satisfy this requirement by passing a special exarnina\u00ad :ion administered by the Department of Mathematics); an overall grade point aver\u00ad !.ge of 2. 3 or higher in mathematics courses. GRADUATE PROGRAMS 3raduate courses are designed to meet the needs of students doing graduate work in mathematics and in such disciplines as require graduate-level mathematics for their ;tudy. Among the fields covered are analysis, algebra, functional analysis, geometry md topology, probability and statistics, ordinary and partial differential equations, md mathematical logic. n addition-to formal courses, there are-seminars for advanced study tow;:~.rd the 'h.D. in various fields of mathematics. Topics-will vary from year to year. Each ;eminar is conducted by a staff member specializing in the subject studied. Enroll\u00ad nent will b,e subject to the approval of the instructor in charge. \\-laster of Arts in Mathematics rhe Master's Degree programs serve a dual purpose: for some they serve aster\u00ad ninal programs of mathematical education; for others they serve as programs eading to study and research aimed at the Doctor of Philosophy degree. However, a :andidate lacking a Master's Degree may, upon successful completion of a proper >rogram of study and research, receive the Doctor of Philosophy degree. rhe Master's Degree is offered under Plans I and II. There are no specific course \u00b7equirements for the Master's Degree. On the other hand, demonstrated compe\u00ad :ence and knowledge of algebra and analysis are required for this degree. Examina\u00ad :ions, written or oral, will be given to determine the relevant preparation of candi\u00ad lates. For Master's candidates, the ability to read the literature of mathematics in me of the foreign languages, French, German, or Russian, is required. 'Ian I for the Master's Degree requires the equivalent of the successful completion >fat least eight courses (at least five at the graduate level), the writing of an accept- UC IRVINE - 1972-1973190 PHYSICAL SCIENCES/MATHEMATICS able research dissertation, and. the passing of examinations (written or oral) de\u00ad signed to test the competence of the candidate in the fields of algebra and analysis. Plan II for the Master's Degree requires the equivalent of the successful completion of at least 12 courses (at least eight at the graduate level) and the passing of exami\u00ad nations (written or oral) designed to test the competence of the candidate in the fields of algebra and analysis. The residence requirement for the Master's Degree consists of full-time registration for three quarters just prior to the granting of the degree. It is possible for a candi\u00ad date to take leaves of absence between pairs of these three quarters by making for\u00ad mal arrangements with the Graduate Division. Doctor of Philosophy in Mathematics The Doctor of Philosophy degree requires successful completion of a program of courses, seminars, and individual study that prepares a candidate for a career in mathematical teaching and research. He is expected to have breadth of knowledge in that he is required to demonstrate advanced knowledge and competence in alge\u00ad bra and analysis. He is expected to have depth of knowledge in that he is required to be profoundly familiar with a well-defined subject in mathematics, e.g., Banadi algebras, group theory, operator theory, probability theory, topology, categorical algebra. There are two general requirements for the Ph.D.: the passing of written and/or ora examinations, and the writing and defense of a dissertation embodying creative research that makes a new and valuable contribution to the field of concentration. \"'Each candidate must demonstrate the ability to read the literature of mathematics in two of the languages, French, German, or Russian. The examinations for predoctoral students are divided into two sets: those used in determining preparation of the students for admission to candidacy for the Doctor of Philosophy degree; those used to determine successful completion of all require\u00ad ments for the same degree. The first set (administered by the Department of Mathematics) may consist of both oral and written examinations. The second set is prescribed and administered by th4 Graduate Division operating through a committee. This committee, consisting of .scholars in the field of concentration and scholars in other ftelds, decides on admis\u00ad sion of students to candidacy and then guides and supervises candidates through their research, study, and writing for the Doctor of Philosophy degree. Doctoral candidates must be enrolled as full-time students for the six quarters pre\u00ad ceding the granting of their degrees. MATHEMATICS FACULTY Ray A.

At the present time undergraduate physics majors and physics graduate students participate in the academic affairs of the Physics Department by serving as full members of the student-faculty teaching evaluation committee and the computer users advisory committee. Undergraduate students also serve on the department's _ undergraduate curriculum committee. UNDERGRADUATE PROGRAM Courses in the Physics Department are designed to meet the needs of many kinds of students, from those students without facility in mathematics whose main interests lie in the humanities or the arts to those students with professional goals in science and engineering. The three lower-division sequences in physics are distinguished by their intended audience, their mathematical prerequisites, and the extent to which UC IRVINE - 1972-1973PHYSICAL SCIENCES/PHYSICS 197 they offer preparation for more advanced courses. These aspects of the beginning courses are summarized in the following table. Intended Audience Mathematical Prerequisites Preparation for Advanced Courses Physics 3 Premedical students, biological sciences majors Algebra and trigo\u00ad nometry; concurrent enrollment in Math 2 (Calculus) recommended Physics 5C with permission Physics 5 Physics 10\u00b720 Physics, chemistry, Nonscience majors and engineering majors Calculus (Mathematics None 2A); knowledge of computer programming is recommended All upper-division None courses in physics Requirements for the Bachelor's Degree University Requirements: See page 22. School Requirements: None. Departmental Requirements Physics 5A-B-C-D-E with laboratory; six quarcer courses numbered between llO and 149; two quarters of advanced laboratory (Physics 151-153); Mathematics 2A-B-C; Mathematics 3A-B-C or 140A-B-C; three courses from recommended; and 3 additional upper-division courses chosen from the Schools of Physical Sciences, Biological Sciences, Engineering, or the Department of Information and Computer Science. Alternative requirements will be developed for students with special interests. Planning a Program of Study Physics 3 is a one-year course suitable for pre-medical students, students majoring in biological sciences, and nonscience majors. It surveys most of the important branches of physics with strong orientation toward modern physics. Laboratory work accompanies the course. Nonscience majors with some mathematical skill may wish to consider Physics 3 as an alternative to Physics 10-20. A student who decides to major in Physics after completing Physics 3 with a grade of A or B may, with the consent of the Department, enroll in Physics 5C. The pre\u00ad medical physics requirement may be met with Physics 3 or with Physics 5A-B-C. Physics 5 is an intensive five-quarter course for physics, chemistry, engineering, and other students interested in a careful quantitative approach to the subject. Labora\u00ad tory work accompanies the course. Students expecting to enroll in the entire five\u00ad quarter sequence of Physics 5 should enroll in Mathematics 3A concurrent with Physics 5C. Students planning to enroll in only three quarters of Physics 5 need not enroll irt Mathematics 3A. The recommended knowledge of computer programming may be gained by enrolling in Information and Computer Science 1, usually in the fall quarter of the freshman year. Biological sciences majors with facility in calculus should .consider Physics 5 as an alternative to Physics 3. UC IRVINE - 1972-1973198 PHYSICAL SCIENCES/PHYSICS Physics courses numbered between 10 and 20 are one-quarter general education courses intended for nonscience majors. The content and format of these courses will vary from year to year. In general, these courses will not include regular labora\u00ad tory work. ' Courses numbered above 110 are for physics majors and other qualified students. This series of courses in the upper-division curriculum is sufficiently broad to pro\u00ad vide programs both for the physics major who does not intend to pursue the study of physics beyond the Bachelor's Degree level and for the physics major preparing for a professional career in physics. The physics major with a career goal in medi\u00ad cine, law, teaching, or business, for example, should emphasize the Physics 130 series, which covers most of the important phenomena of physics. The physics major preparing for graduate work in physics should include most of the Physics 111 series in his program. Any major who is so inclined can take more than the minimum two quarters of advanced laboratory work. Able students may begin the Physics 111 series in their sophomore year. Courses numbered between 110 and 130 emphasize the mathematical and theoreti\u00ad cal structures that have unified our understanding of nature. Those numbered be\u00ad tween 131 and 149 emphasize particular domains of the structure of matter. Labo\u00ad ratory work is assigned to separate courses, 151-153. The programs of transfer students will be decided after individual consultation. Since many graduate physics departments require a reading knowledge of one for\u00ad eign language, physics majors planning graduate work should, if possible, study some Russian, German, or French. Introductory courses in biology and chemistry are also recommended options. Every physics major should avoid overspecialization and wisely use his undergraduate years to explore some areas remote from physics. Sample Programs A typical course program for physics majors considering the possibility of graduate \u00b7 study in physics or astronomy is shown below. Three of the electives in the senior year may be physics graduate courses. A student with a weak background may want to postpone Physics 130 and Physics 131 until the senior year.

As a guide to preparing a more suitable program, the department makes the following suggestions. The course program of physics majors considering the possibility of graduate school in engineering should contain at least the following courses: Physics 111A-B, 112A-B and three to six engineering courses. The course program of physics majors considering graduate work in chemistry, biol\u00ad ogy, or various interdisciplinary areas should contain: Physics 111A, 112A-B, 115, 130, 131; Chemistry 51A-B-C; and Biology 101A-B-C. The course program of physics majors considering a teaching career in the public schools or the community colleges should contain at least: Physics 111A, 112A-B, 130, 131; Education 171 and either 170, 172, or 175; and additional preparation in some area'of science or mathematics. Courses from the Physics 10-20 sequence may be appropriate. The course program of physics majors considering graduate work in the history of science should contain: Physics 111A-B, 112A-B, and 130, 131; History 29A-B-C; 184, 185. Courses from the Physics 10-20 sequence may be appropriate. GRADUATE PROGRAMS The Department offers the M.A. and the Ph.D. degrees in physics, the first in recog\u00ad nition of demonstrated knowledge of the basic facts and theories of physics, the second primarily in recognition of demonstrated capacity for independent research. All new graduate students take an entrance examination shortly before the begin\u00ad ning of the fall quarter. This examination is not \"pass\" or \"not pass.\" It serves only to help the student and his advisor decide on the best program of study. Complementing the formal courses, the Department offers regular colloquia and informal seminars. The graduate student is a member of an intellectual community and is expected to participate fully in these Department activities. In addition to the regular research seminars in solid state, high energy, and plasma physics, a teaching seminar meets once each week for the purpose of exploring techniques of instruction and improving graduate student teaching performances. This seminar introduces teaching assistants to the instructional program of this and related departments and gives students an opportunity by means of video-tape to observe and criticize their own teaching methods. About 60 students of physics will be enrolled in 19 7 2-7 3. Active programs of re\u00ad search are underway in high-energy physics, solid state physics, low temperature physics, plasma physics, mathematical physics, and astrophysics. Sources of support available to graduate students include teaching assistantships, research assistantships, fellowships, and traineeships. For students admitted with financial aid, continuing support in later years is normal. Students planning to pursue graduate work in physics should obtain a copy of the booklet Physics from the Physics Department. UC IRVINE - 1972-1973200 PHYSICAL SCIENCES/PHYSICS r Master of Arts in Physics The requirements for the M.A. degree are: (I) three quarters of residence; and (2) mastery of graduate course material, which may be demonstrated either (2a) by passing, with an average grade of B or better, a minimum of nine graduate courses numbered between 200 and 259 and a written comprehensive examination, or (2b) by passing the Ph.D. qualifying examination. Under special circumstances, are\u00ad search project and thesis may be accepted in lieu of proficiency in some of the grad\u00ad uate course material. There is no foreign language requirement for the M.A. degree. A typical program in preparation for the written examination for the M.A. degree would consist of twelve courses: 211 (Class. Mech.) 218A-B-C sequences, or under\u00ad graduate upper-division courses. Doctor of Philosophy in Physics The principal requirements for the Ph.D. degree are six quarters of residence, pas\u00ad sage of a written and an oral examination, and successful completion and defense of a dissertation reporting results of original research. In addition, the Ph.D. candidate must complete moderate graduate course requirements. There is no foreign lan\u00ad guage requirement for the Ph.D. degree. 1. Residence. Up to three of the six required quarters of residence may be waived for students who have had graduate work at another institution. 2. Course Requirements. The student is required to exhibit mastery of the basic sequences, Mathematical Physics, Classical Mechanics and Electromagnetic Theory, Quantum Mechanics, Relativistic Quantum Mechanics, and Statistical Mechanics. In addition, nine graduate-level quarter courses, other than the basic sequences, and numbered less than 259, are required. These courses must be passed with an average grade of B or better. 3. Qualifying Examination. For advancement to Ph.D. candidacy, a student must pass a qualifying examination consisting of a written part and two oral parts. The written part covers a broad range of fundamentals of physics at the advanced under\u00ad graduate and graduate levels. The first part of the oral exam will be administered shortly after the written examination. All members of the first oral committee will be faculty from the Physics Department. The second part of the oral examination will be taken approximately one year after successful completion of the written exam and the first oral. The committee that administers the second oral examina\u00ad tion will contain one or two faculty members from outside the Physics Department. The second oral will cover principally material related to the broad and general features of the student's thesis area. The written portion of the qualifying examina\u00ad tion will generally be given once each year, in September, just prior to the start of classes. The examination may be taken by some students after one year of graduate study. A second attempt will be permitted if the first is not successful. A third at\u00ad tempt will be permitted only in extraordinary circumstances. 4. Dissertation. A dissertation summarizing the results of original research per\u00ad formed by the student under the supervision of a faculty member in the Depart\u00ad ment will be required for the Ph.D. degree. The criterion for the acceptability of a dissertation by the Department is that it be suitable for publication in a scientific UC IRVINE - 1972-1973PHYSICAL SCIENCES/PHYSICS 201 journal. The dissertation must not have been submitted to any other institution prior to its submission to the Physics Department at UCI. 5. Defense of Dissertation. Upon completion of the dissertation, the student will take an oral examination, open to the public, before his doctoral committee. 6. Suggested Course Sequences. Typical programs for the first two years designed to prepare the student for Ph.D. qualification and provide him with the foundation necessary for understanding and participating in modern research might include: First Year: Mechanics). - In the second year of graduate study, the student may begin to take courses that will provide a broad background for his thesis area. The following sequences repre- sent a typical second-year program: - For the student with an interest in solid state physics: 214A-B (Statistical Physics); ature Physics, Solids).

Froman, Jr. Dean Undergraduate and graduate education in the School of Social Sciences at UCI in\u00ad volve participation in an experiment. The School includes the traditional subject -areas of anthropology, economics, geography, political science, psychology, and sociology. However, the program, faculty, and students differ substantially from conventional counterparts elsewhere. The specific details of the differences are indi\u00ad cated below. The details are elaborations of a commitment on the part of the facul\u00ad ty and students to a modern social science. This commitment leads to educational programs with a triple emphasis. First, they are built upon systematic empirical observation and quantitative analysis of human behavior. Thus, social science students must become familiar with the mathematical, computational, and statistical tools underlying modem social sci\u00ad ence. The availability of high-speed electronic computers, the development of math- -ematics oriented toward the problems of the social sciences, and the refinement of techniques for sampling, observing, and modifying human behavior have contrib\u00ad uted major new elements to social science. Second, many of the most interesting questions in the study of human behavior cannot be fixed within the traditional disciplinary boundaries of anthropology, economics, geography, political science, psychology, and sociology. Some of the new and evolving areas which cross these orthodox disciplinary boundaries are po\u00ad litical economy, geo-psychology, ethno-sociology, and psycholinguistics. Third, important new problems confront society; and social scientists have are\u00ad sponsibility to help solve these problems. A rapidly changing technology, popula\u00ad tion explosion, urban concentration, the thrust of once underdeveloped societies, the strains of race relations, and the combined efforts of men and machines in prob\u00ad lem solving are only a few of the problems which confront today's social scientists. To confront these and other contemporary problems, training in the so.cial sciences must emphasize the basic analytical tools and the processes by which knowledge of human behavior is gained Such training must also emphasize the exploration of the relations among the social sciences and between the social sciences and other disciplines. At UCI, education in the social sciences is built upon the assumption that students play an active role in the entire educational process. To facilitate education, various resources are provided -students, faculty, courses, programmed instruction, li\u00ad brary, community, lectures, seminars, laboratories, research aids, reading lists, dis\u00ad cussion groups, and examinations. The administration provides routine housekeep\u00ad ing services. The faculty provides succor, advice, and occasional wisdom. Students, individually and collectively, make major contributions to the learning process- by UC IRVINE - 1972-1973SOCIAL SCIENCES 209 participating in regular seminars, prop~sing new educational materials, developing new programs, and by systematic self-directed study. The programs described here represent a careful effort on the part of the faculty to define a modern approach to social science. They are not sanctified by tradition, authority, or pride. From time to time the faculty expects to propose modifications in the programs. It welcomes similar proposals from students, both to meet the educational needs of individual students and to improve the quality and relevance of the general program. Students from other schools are encouraged to take courses and talk to faculty within the School of Social Sciences. In addition to the introductory courses, many of the special topics courses are open to students without previous work in social science. These courses are described generally below. Degrees Offered in the School Political Science ............................................... Ph.D. Psychology ................................................... Ph.D. Social Sciences ............................................ B.A., graduation, cum laude, magna cum laude, or summa cum laude are awarded on the basis of grade point average. At the end of each academic school year, the School also designates undergraduate majors as Outstanding Scholars and Honor Scholars. In order to qualify as an Outstanding Scholar in the School, a student must have completed at least seven graded courses during the school year and be one of the top ten students in the School in terms of grade point average. Honor Scholars are students who have completed at least seven graded courses dur\u00ad ing the year, and rank in the top ten percent of the students in the School in terms of grade point average. UNDERGRADUATE PROGRAMS Requirements for the Bachelor's Degree in Social Science The basic undergraduate degree program in the School of Social Sciences is a pro\u00ad gram in social science, and all students must fulfill. the requirements for that degree. A student qualifies for a degree in social science by exhibiting: A. A basic understanding of important fields outside the social sciences. (See page 23 under University Requirements.) The normal program for majors in the School satisfies part of the breadth requirement (six courses in the School of Physical Sciences) through the School's mathematics requirement. B. Familiarity with the mathematical, computational, and statistical tools under\u00ad lying modern social science. Normally, this requirement is met by passing six courses in mathematics (Mathematics 5A-B-C, 6A\u00b7B-C); one course in computer science (Information and Computer Science 1); and two courses in advanced mathematics, statistics, or mathematical social science. Students who wish to do so may substitute Mathematics 2A-B-C, 3A-B-C for the first six courses in mathe\u00ad matics, provided they subsequently complete at least two quarters of work in probability and statistics. See the section on \"Mathematics and Social Science\" below. C. An understanding of the fundamental concepts, analytical tools, and methods of social science. Normally, this requirement is met by taking Social Science 1 (a UC IRVINE - 1972-1973210 SOCIAL SCIENCES one-quarter course) and two other courses in social science numbered with one\u00ad digit course numbers. D. An understanding of important advanced areas in social science. Normally, the requirement is met by passing satisfactorily six upper-division courses in the School of Social Sciences. E. Satisfactory completion of a senior project. The senioi: project is an individually designed year-long educational program approved for the individual student by a faculty member. Normally, it is a three-course program. A student who has qualified for a Bachelor's Degree in Social Sciences and wishes to receive a Social Sciences B.A. Degree with a concentration in one of the_ sub\u00ad fields (e.g., Anthropology, Economics, Geography, Political Science, Psychology, or Sociology) may do so, if he, in addition, passes a general examination in that field. Ordinarily the examination will be the Graduate Record Examination Advanced Test. Planning a Program of Study The requirements above are specified in the form of knowledge gained rather than specific courses taken, and the School encourages students to satisfy the require\u00ad ments by examination. Some students may find it helpful to consider the following typical course program, so long as it is clearly recognized that it is neither pre\u00ad scribed nor particularly suggested.

Transfer Students Freshmen and Sophomores: Students transferring to UCI as freshmen or sopho\u00ad mores will fulfill the regular requirements of the four-year program either at UCI or through transfer of credit for comparable work elsewhere. Juniors: Junior transfers with good records at other accredited colleges and univer\u00ad sities will normally be presumed to have satisfied the freshman and sophomore re- UC IRVINE - 1972-1973SOCIAL SCIENCES 211 quirements for the social science curriculum. Students anticipating transfer to UCI in their junior year, however, should attempt to plan their program so as to antici\u00ad pate the special requirements of the program. Every effort will be made to accom\u00ad modate individual variation in background, provided the student is prepared to commit himself to intensive work in areas of deficiency. Normally, the typical two\u00ad year program is simply the last two years of the regular four-year program, except that students who have not satisfied the freshman and sophomore mathematics requirements in the School must do so before graduation (see the section on \"Math\u00ad ematics and Social Science\" below). Seniors: Students wishing to graduate with a degree in the School by transferring in their senior year should plan their work carefully to ensure that the requirements can be met in one year of residence. In general, differences between the program at UCI and programs elsewhere make such transfers difficult. Mathematics and Social Science Competence in basic mathematics is a necessary skill for a modem social scientist. All students are expected to have competence in intermediate algebra on entrance. The requirements stem from the nature of modem social science. To an increasing extent, the concepts and terms of mathematics, statistics, and computers are an important part of the social scientist's vocabulary. Basic knowledge of these tools is necessary to an understanding of current literature in these fields, to the analysis of data, and to an intelligent use of models in social science. Each candidate for a degree in the School of Social Sciences is expected to have knowledge of probability theory, matrix algebra, calculus, difference and differen\u00ad tial equations, mathematical statistics, lmd computing. Normally, this knowledge is gained by pursuing a program of nine courses in mathematics, statistics, computing, and mathematical social science. The first seven courses normally are: Mathematics 5A: Finite Equations; Mathematics 6C: Numerical Methods; Information and Computer Science 1: Digital Computing. To complete the requirement, a student normally chooses two courses from an approved list of courses in mathematics, computing, or mathematical social science. Students who wish to do so may substitute the knowledge represented by Mathe\u00ad matics 2A-B-C and 3A-B-C for Mathematics 5A-B-C and 6A-B-C. However, they will then be expected to complete at least two quarters of work in probability and statistics. Students entering as juniors (or graduate students) without previous college mathe\u00ad matics are normally enrolled in Mathematics 5A-B-C and Information and Comput\u00ad er Science 1 during their first year at UCI. Such students ordinarily enroll in Mathe\u00ad matics 6A-B-C and the two additional courses during their second year. An under\u00ad graduate transfer student without previous college mathematics will normally need two regular school years of work at UCI to complete the graduation requirement of the School. GRADUATE PROGRAMS The School offers instruction leading to the Ph.D: degree. The degree programs are restricted to full-time students and emphasize preparation for research and academ\u00ad ic careers in the disciplines involved. UC IRVINE - 1972-1973212 SOCIAL SCIENCES In recent years it has become increasingly clear that the traditional boundaries among anthropology, economics, geography, political science, psychology, and soci\u00ad ology are not always the most convenient boundaries for the research and teaching undertaken by social scientists. For instance, those social scientists focusing on such problems as organizations, choice, conflict, urban affairs, or public policy analysis are likely to find such boundaries irrelevant. This problem has long been signalled by the existence at major universities of such dual-title graduate programs as those in political economy and social psychology. There would seem to be no purpose, however, in multiplying and recombining these titles endlessly. Therefore, the School concentrates its graduate training in a program leading to the Ph.D. in Social Sciences. This program does not pretend that there is a single fixed body of knowl\u00ad edge that all social scientists must master, nor will it serve as a cover for any partic\u00ad ular methodological orthodoxy. Rather, it is designed to allow each graduate stu\u00ad dent to work out for himself, in close conjunction with at least three members of the faculty, a course of study resulting in the mastery of a coherent body of empiri\u00ad cal and theoretical knowledge which can serve as the basis for further creative and fruitful teaching and research. Depending on the student's interests, such a program may range quite widely across disciplines or resemble the traditional one discipline plus outside field type of arrangement found at most universities. The faculty en\u00ad visions a student's Ph.D. program to be of approximately.t_hree to four years dura\u00ad tion. The student will devote the first year to the explorations and preparation nec\u00ad essary to defining and mastering a coherent field of study. He will continue this preparation into the second year, during the course of which he will also submit a dissertation proposal. The third year will normally be devoted to dissertation re\u00ad search and writing. In some instances, of course, pre-dissertation work will require more than two years, and especially those dissertations demanding extensive field research may require more than one year to complete. In addition, all students will be expected to acquire mathematical and language tools appropriate to their studies. Teaching experience is required of all graduate students for the Ph.D. The requirement is normally fulfilled by the equivalent of 50 per cent time as a Teach\u00ad ing Assistant for one academic year. Requirements for the Doctor of Philosophy in Social Sciences 1. Proficiency in a recognized field of scholarly research in which there exists a coherent body of professional knowledge. It is notoriously difficult to specify exactly what constitutes Ph.D. level competence in a subject matter area. Stu\u00ad dents will normally be expected to append to i:heir degree programs a bibliog\u00ad raphy and a list of courses to be undertaken. Proficiency will be tested prior to admission to candidacy by written and oral examinations and inspection of the student's completed research papers. 2. An understanding of the major techniques of social analysis and their application in at least two traditional social science disciplines. This understanding must include a grasp of both the theoretical and empirical techniques, and the results achieved from their use. 3. Proficiency requirements in mathematics, statistics, and computing, equivalent to two years of college mathematics (through calculus), one year of statistics, and one quarter course in computer techniques. 4. Proficiency in reading social science publications in one foreign language or a higher level of proficiency if required by the nature of the student's research program. UC IRVINE - 1972-1973SOCIAL SCIENCES 213 5. Dissertation as described above under general discussion of the School's Gradu\u00ad ate Programs. Requirements for the Doctor of Philosophy in Psychology Because of the varied nature of contemporary psychology, no single course of stud\u00ad ies can be devised to fill the needs of all students. Therefore, the program seeks to provide a maximum degree of flexibility in designing the course of study best fitted to each student. The first task of the student and his committee is to construct a program for the year. By the end of the first year, it is expected that the student will have demon\u00ad strated an adequate degree of knowledge from a broad sample of current psycholog\u00ad ical problems and techniques. For purposes of this program, an adequate fund of such knowledge is defined as follows: 1. Familiarity and research competence in three broadly defined areas of research. These areas may be selected from among several core research courses offered throughout the year. The core courses emphasize study and practice of the methods of data analysis and the research techniques used in each area. Core offerings in the standard areas such as perception, cognition, learning, sociality, and personality will be offered as well as courses in new areas defined by the special interests and competencies of the faculty. The first-year graduate stu\u00ad dent, to increase the breadth of this exposure to different methods and ap\u00ad proaches, is encouraged to select his core courses so that there is no overlap among the instructors teaching the courses. 2. Demonstration of the experimental design and statistical skills necessary for psychological research. It is not required that the student take courses in order to demonstrate his compe\u00ad tence. Courses in the areas listed above will be offered as part of the psychology program, but students whose preparation or personal inclination leads them to work independently are free to do so. In all cases, demonstration of the necessary skills will be through submission of research papers and adequate performance on exam\u00ad inations. Evaluation of this work will be made by the individual teaching the com\u00ad parable course at the time the examination is given. During the second year, the student is expected to complete any parts of the first\u00ad year program which may not have been completed owing to scheduling problems for the need to fill in deficiencies in his general knowledge. However, the emphasis in the second year will be specialization in the area in which the student plans to do his dissertation research; special topics courses in psychology, individual reading and research, and courses in related disciplines will ordinarily occupy the bulk of the student's. time. During his third year, the candidate must submit a dissertation proposal to his advi\u00ad sors. The proposal will consist of a thorough examination of the history of the problem, its current status, and the way in which the proposed research will further knowledge in the designated area. The final section of the proposal will contain a detailed research design. The dissertation completes the final requirement for the degree. UC IRVINE - 1972-1973214 SOCIAL SCIENCES Requirements for the Doctor of Philosophy in Political Science The course of studies in political science follows closely that of Social Sciences with the additional requirement that all students pass a written examination based on the program of reading in political science they undertake during their first quarter.

Enrollment in a course is simply a commitment on the part of a student that he will educate himself (with such faculty assistance as is required). Students at any level are encouraged to suggest areas of individual study and may (with faculty approval) pursue any intellectually challenging area within the social sciences. Such courses may include special seminars, study projects, individual papers, or any other useful educational activity. The faculty encourages students to present evidence that they have done interesting and original work and to receive official credit for that work by enrolling in an individual study course. Such courses are numbered 199 (undergraduate) and 299 (graduate). UC IRVINE - 1972-1973216 SOCIAL SCIENCES Students from other schools are encouraged to take courses and talk with faculty within the School of Social Sciences. In addition to the introductory courses, many of the upper-division courses are open to students without previous work in social science. To supplement the basic courses and to provide both majors and non-majors (both graduate and undergraduate) with the experience of pursuing a subject in depth, the School offers a number of \"special topics\" courses. The specific topics to be cov\u00ad ered in any quarter are announced at the time of pre-registration. Generally speak\u00ad ing, special topics courses are not repeated each year. Rather, the student samples from those courses available in a particular quarter.

UC IRVINE - 1972-1973220 INTERSCHOOL/COMPARATIVE CULTURE INTERSCHOOL CURRICULA These programs grant degrees but are not under any of the regular schools at UCI. They are independent programs and are not interrelated in any way. There are no \"school requirements\" for the Bachelor's Degree in any of the Interschool Curricula programs; the requirements for a degree are specified by each program as described below. PROGRAM IN COMPARATIVE CULTURE \"Culture\" may be defined as that complex whole of knowledge, belief, art, morals, law, custom, and any other capabilities and habits acquired by man as a member of society. \"Culture\" refers to the distinctive ways of life of a \"society,\" a group of people who have learned to work together. Society is made up of individuals; cul\u00ad ture is made of what happens in their consciousness, in their emotions, and in their habits of behavior. The crucial changes taking place in \"society\" very often first take place in \"culture,\" which lies behind society in providing its motives and methods. \u00b7 Recently, a rebellion against departmentalized knowledge has been one of the most remarkable developments in American universities. The possibilities of cooperation between disciplines have been tested and developed in many areas. The study of culture has in common with the development of collaborative study in other areas the conviction that interdisciplinary investigation is essential. We who study culture comparatively believe, first, that a particular civilization or culture, with all its diversity, has a certain underlying homogeneity which can serve as a unifying key to the interpretation of diverse phenomena within this particular culture; and, second, that intercultural or cross-cultural study of cultures illuminates both the peculiar\u00ad ities of any culture and also the connections between cultures. The major in Comparative Culture is elected by students planning careers requiring a knowledge and understanding of peoples and cultures. Apart from affording an 1 1 opportunity to secure an elementary or secondary teaching credential, in coopera-, tion with the Office of Teacher Education, the major prepares students for com-, munity service at all levels -local, state, national, and international. Graduates of l the Program can look forward to pursuing any career requiring direct or indirect human interaction, and should give efficient performance following the normally prescribed period of on-the-job training. The Program also prepares students for entry into graduate and professional schools whose requirements consist essentially of a sound background in socio-cultural studies. UC IRVINE - 1972-1973INTERSCHOOL/COMPARATIVE CULTURE 221 / The student in Comparative Culture is given an opportunity for consistent inter\u00ad action with peoples and ideas different from those to which he has been accus\u00ad tomed. Not only do most of the courses reflect an awareness of, and interest in, the ethnic groups comprising the United States and the Third World, but the partici\u00ad pants- faculty, staff, and students- include representatives of these groups as well. To study Comparative Culture, therefore, is to experience life as it has evolved among different manners of human beings, and to participate in a universal com\u00ad munity in microcosm. The opportunity for a sustained global perception is further enhanced by the fact that students may qualify (at the end of the sophomore year) for study in foreign universities under the University of California Education Abroad Program, with centers in Africa, Asia, Europe, and Latin America. Through the Program's student associations, representatives are elected to serve on the Council of Scholars. These student representatives serve, along with elected representatives of the faculty, on the Standing Committees (Executive, Graduate, and Undergraduate) which make regular reports at the bi-weekly meetings of the Council of Scholars. This council is the deliberative and decision-making body for all policy matters affecting curriculum, recruiting, personnel, and resources. Degrees Offered Comparative takes pride in granting both Intradepartmental Honors and Graduate Honors. Twelve per cent of graduates may receive honors at graduation: one per cent summa cum laude, three per cent magna cum laude, and eight per cent cum laude. The criteria for honors at graduation include a minimum grade point average of 3.5 on work completed at UCI, degree of service to the Program, and degree of service to the University and/or community. Consideration is also given for out\u00ad standing achievements in research projects. The Program has an Annual Awards Banquet at the end of the spring quarter for honoring the graduating recipients of the following awards: The Gunter & Elizabeth Herman Award, The Doctor Johnson Women Studies Award, The Mauree~ Goldston Award, The Orange County Grand Jury Award, and The Program Director's Award. UNDERGRADUATE PROGRAM Requirements for the Bachelor's Degree in Comparative Culture The Program is obliged to help fulfill the spirit of the breadth requirement which is intended to expose students to learning skills and content\u00b7different from the chosen major. To this end, the Comparative Culture major is required to take 48 units, upon advisement, outside the Program. A student may choose courses offered in any school or program, subject to the approval of the Academic Advisor of Com\u00ad parative Culture. Students should plan to earn at least 12 of these units in courses focusing on mathematics, logic, computer science, and other methodological and natural (non-normative) sciences. All majors (except for transfer students who may be granted waivers for courses where appropriate) must satisfactorily complete: Comparative Culture lA-B and at least two Comparative Culture 10 courses by the end of the sophomore year; 48 units outside the Program to satisfy the spirit of the breadth requirement; 24 units in language or equivalent courses; 48 units within Comparative Culture along the line of either Plan A (ethnic/cultural studies), Plan B (disciplinary or interdisciplinary methodologies), or Plan C (contract specifying an individualized curriculum). UC IRVINE - 1972-1973222 INTERSCHOOL/COMPARATIVE CULTURE GRADUATE PROGRAM The Ph.D. program emphasizes work centering on the cultures of the United States of America, including the dominant and minority cultures and their antecedents in time and space. The program is designed to meet the following central objectives: to train interdisciplinary intellectuals -teachers and research scholars -who can deal comparatively with the range of cultures found in the United States of America; to equip graduate students for positions in colleges and universities in interdisciplinary programs, as well as in programs involving English, history, human\u00b7 ities, and social sciences; to prepare top-level personnel for public and private agencies requiring experts in socio-cultural affairs and operations. The Program pursues these objectives by focusing on resources (faculty, courses, colloquia, and special projects) that enable students to emphasize either literature and the arts or history and the social sciences. These basic patterns permit concentration in com\u00ad parative ethnic-cultural analysis (such as African, Asian, Black, Chicano, and/or Latin American), as well as combinations of academic or professional interest with\u00ad in and across the two main emphases. Requirements for the Ph.D. Degree in Comparative Culture Admission. Requirements and standards for admission into the Program are in keeping with those of the University of California as a whole. Students with at least a B.A. degree will be considered for admission on the basis of past academic perfor\u00ad mance and present academic interests. Residency. The university residence requirement for the Ph.D. is six quarters, the student being expected to enroll in at least one course during each of these quar\u00ad ters. Students entering with an M.A. degree may receive up to three quarters course credit for previous work. The Graduate Committee of the Program in Comparative Culture will consider requests in writing for a waiver of the residence requirement and for up to nine courses involving previous work of relevance to the Ph.D. requirements. Required and Elective Courses. Each first-year student, except where a waiver has been granted, will take core course #1, American Culture 200A-B-C, Theory and Methods in the Interdisciplinary Study of American Cultures, and core course #2, Comparative Culture 200A-B-C, Scope and Methods of Ethnic and Third World Studies. In addition, each student may enroll in three elective courses offered within the Program or in some other related department. All elective courses must be approved by the student's academic advisor. During the second year, the student will take two two-quarter research seminars (equivalent of four courses), preferably but not necessarily after completion of the two required core courses. The student may take up to five additional elective courses offered within or outside the Pro\u00ad gram in Comparative Culture. Comprehensive Examination. A written examination is given at the end of the first year to determine, beyond course work, whether a student will be invited to con\u00ad tinue working toward the Ph.D.; this examination also satisfies the university re-- quirement for ascertaining those who may qualify for an M.A. but not for a Ph.D. degree. Language Requirement. One foreign language and one \"alternative skill\" shall be satisfied. The language will be decided upon by the student, in consultation with his advisor, and the requirement must be satisf~ed by the end of the fourth quarter in UC IRVINE - 1972-1973INTERSCHOOL/COMPARATIVE CULTURE 223 residence either through a standard ETS examination or by another method ap\u00ad proved by the Graduate Committee. The \"alternative skill\" may be another lan\u00ad guage, or a sequence of two courses in statistics, linguistics or co~puter, and must be satisfied before the qualifying examination can be taken. Qualifying Examination. The administering committee shall consist of five mem\u00ad bers: three from the Program, one from a completely unrelated field, and one from a related field (e.g., humanities or social science). In special cases, a four-member committee may be from the Program, assisted by an additional member from an outside School or Program. The examination shall be oral, scheduled after the com\u00ad pletion of course work and the language requirement, and it shall consist of four parts: Theory and Methodology (emphasizing either literature and the arts or his\u00ad tory and the social sciences); American Institutions; Ethnic Cultures in America; and the Student's Area of Special Interest. Each student, in consultation with his committee, shall determine the minimum reading requirements for the several parts of the examination. The Dissertation. This is the final requirement. The final draft of the dissertation must be approved by the student's dissertation committee and shall be in accord\u00ad ance with standards set by the Graduate Division. Students will be expected to complete the dissertation in one year. An oral examination covering the student's dissertation topic will be administered by his dissertation committee (composed of three members of the Program) and shall occur when the student has completed the initial draft of the dissertation.

These problems include predicting the orbit of a satellite, simulating the economy, keeping track of inventories, and checking income tax returns. Such problems are solved by having the computer execute a procedure - a sequence of information processing operations including but not limited to the conventional arithmetic oper\u00ad ations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Information and com\u00ad puter sdence is concerned with the development of procedures which are effective and efficient, languages suitable for stating these procedures, and systems for exe\u00ad cuting procedures. The implications of research in the development of information processing proce\u00ad dures and of systems for preparing and executing these procedures extend beyond the direct applications in using the modern digital computer to solve problems rang\u00ad ing from bookkeeping to the control of orbiting satellites. Many animate and inani\u00ad mate systems can be usefully viewed as information processing systems and ana\u00ad lyzed in terms of the way they represent,' store, and process information. Thus information and computer science provides a point of view, an approach, for study\u00ad ing phenomena in many sciences.

B.S., Ph.D. UNDERGRADUATE PROGRAM The undergraduate program in information and computer science is designed for students preparing for professional careers and for students preparing for graduate study in information and computer science. The program is designed to acquaint the student with the presently available methods of information and computer sci\u00ad ence which are useful in solving problems of science, industry, and government; to prepare the student for the additional formal and self education he will require in this rapidly developing field; and to foster and extend the student's abilities to solve the kinds of problems encountered in information and computer science. The use of the computer as\u00b7 a problem-solving tool and the effects of its adoption on proce\u00ad dure and data representation are the underlying themes of the program. Students enrolled in other degree programs who are interested in digital computer\u00ad programming will normally begin their studies with Introduction to Digital Compu\u00ad tation (ICS I) and continue in the programming sequence with Computers and Pro\u00ad gramming (ICS 2) and Information Structures (ICS 3) as far as their interests re- UC IRVINE - 1972-1973238 INTERSCHOOL/INFORMATION & COMPUTER SCIENCE quire and their programs permit. Students who are doing, or planning to do, exten\u00ad sive work with numerical problems are advised to consider courses in numerical analysis. Students are advised by faculty and staff members on academic matters. Advising of undergraduate students is coordinated by the departmental counselor who also provides information on vocational and counseling services available on the campus. Advising of graduate students is coordinated by the faculty graduate advisor. Requirements for the Bachelor's Degree University Requirements: See page 22. Departmental Requirements Mathematics,2A-B-C and two of the following one-year sequences in mathematics: 3, 140, 155, 120, 121, 130, 131, 170; Information and Computer Science 1, 2, 3, llOA-B, 120A-B, 130A-B, 190A-B-C. These requirements are under study and may be changed in the future. Students should consult the Departmental Information Bulletin, issued in fall 1972, for a complete listing of courses and subject content. JOINT PROGRAM WITH THE GRADUATE SCHOOL OF ADMINISTRATION The Department of Information and Computer Science and the Graduate School of Administration offer a special five-year program for selected students leading to both a Bachelor of Science degree in Information and Computer Science and a Mas\u00ad ter of Science degree in Administration. See the description of the Graduate School of Administration program in this catalogue. Inquiries should be directed to the Graduate School of Administration. GRADUATE PROGRAM The doctoral program is designed to prepare teachers and researchers in computer science. The program consists of three phases: study of core topics of computer science, followed by the preliminary examinations (typically taking 12-15 months); independent research into several specialized topics of interest, followed by a candi\u00ad dacy examination (typically 9-18 months); significant research, followed by a pub\u00ad lic defense of the written dissertation (typically 15-24 months). The program is designed to be a full-time activity since quality graduate education demands the full concentration of students and faculty. No Master's degree is offered. Substantive interests of an academic department are, of course, governed by the interests of its members (including students). The main areas of interests of the ICS Department are artificial intelligence, software systems, computer systems, and computer-aided instruction. There are possibilities for dissertation work in many sub-areas of these broad categories and, in addition, it is possible for a thesis stu\u00ad dent to work under the direction of a faculty member of another department. Although described in a formal manner below, the program in fact strives to main\u00ad tain an informal environment conducive to learning and individual development of students' strengths. The small size of the program (approximately 10 faculty and 30 students in 1972) makes frequent and informal interaction between all members of the department a reality. UC IRVINE - 1972-1973INTERSCHOOL/INFORMATION & COMPUTER SCIENCE 239 Admission to the Program Approximately ten students are admitted each year. Applications are evaluated on the basis of the student's prior academic record and more importantly, his or her potential for creative professional contribution to computer science. Applicants are expected to have skills in computer programming at least equivalent to those ob-. tained by good students in a one-year college-level course in programming, and skills in mathematics equivalent to those obtained by good students who complete college-level courses in logic and set theory, analysis, linear algebra, and modern algebra or probability and statistics. Applicants should take the verbal and quantitative sections of the Graduate Record Examination. Where feasible, personal interviews are desired, but inability to have one in no way prejudices an application. Additional information on the formalities of application can be obtained from the Office of Graduate Admissions. Further information on the department and the graduate program can be obtained by writ\u00ad ing to the department. Financial Assistance Limited financial assistance is offered to students in the form of teaching and re\u00ad search assistantships. Stipends vary, depending on the duties involved and range upwards from $3000. About half of the students in residence in 1972 will have support from the department. For nonresidents of California, a very limited num\u00ad ber of out-of-state tuition waivers are available. Requirements for the Ph.D. The program consists of three phases of study and examination. Phase I begins when the student enters graduate school and ends with the preliminary examina\u00ad tions. During this phase the student will spend most of his time acquiring breadth of knowledge in computer science and related subjects via reading and/or success\u00ad fully completing the courses offered in the core curriculum (ICS 200A-B-C, 210A-B-C, 220A-B-C). Courses are not required and preliminary exams may be taken without taking all (or any) courses. The department requires that all graduate students participate in teaching activities sometime during their tenure in the depart\u00ad ment. This is often done during Phase I. Phase II begins after passing the preliminary examination\u00b7 and ends with the candi\u00ad dacy exam. The student's main aim during this phase should be to gain depth of experience in computer science without necessarily making a commitment to a definite thesis topic. The student should be taking specialized courses in computer science and attempting minor research projects under the supervision of a faculty member. The student should attempt to study at least one topic in depth while developing a capability for independent research. Typically, after one year, the student applies for admission to candidacy. After the faculty reviews the student's progress and potential, a committee of the faculty is appointed by the Graduate Division to conduct the candidacy examination. Phase III begins after admission to candidacy. During this period the student is en\u00ad gaged in dissertation research. The research is expected to be an original and sub\u00ad stantial contribution to computer science. The student is expected to demonstrate professional maturity and independence in doing the research. One or more faculty members normally work closely with the student in an advisory capacity. This phase normally lasts 12 to 24 months but may be extended provided the faculty determines that the student is making satisfactory progress.

While the Program is organized like any other department of the University, it is unique in emphasizing all knowledge and methodology associated with the area man and his environment. The Program was conceived and developed for the purpose of providing direct inter\u00ad action between the intellectual life of the university and the recurring problems of the social and physical environment. And since it was founded on the conception of man as a biological organism in a cultural-physical environment, the orientation is necessarily multidisciplinary. This orientation pervades the curricula which are aimed at equipping students to attack and solve environmental problems. In our context of usage, environmental problems include all aspects of man's relation to other men and to his social heritage, on the one hand, and man's relation to his broader biological and Rhysical environment, on the other. It is axiomatic in the Program that learning must be applicable to the community and the community must serve as an auxiliary source of educational enrichment. Because the approach combines environmental education and community activity, the curricula of the Program are organized by problem area, not by discipline or academic subject matter. The curricula are oriented toward producing a coordina\u00ad tion between on-and off-campus experience, theoretical and applied learning, so that each enhances and enlarges the other. The Program is innovative in that it en\u00ad ables students to work effectively on community problems in a variety of contexts, while simultaneously meeting the central goals of an undergraduate education. Stu\u00ad dents are free to choose their fields of assignment and their associated study pro\u00ad grams; required field study involves one course per quarter during the junior and senior years- The following are agencies to which students have been assigned to satisfy the field study requirement: Orange County Planning Department; California Youth Author\u00ad ity; Orange County Community Mental Health Services (regional teams, central office consulting, research); Orange County District Attorney's Office; Environmen\u00ad Institute; Big Brothers; Fairview State Hospital; and Costa Mesa Police Department. In operation, the curricula in Social Ecology are aimed at three classes of students. First, the Program provides the context for educating people needed in professional capacities by various governmental agencies and industrial departments. It has been an initiator, for example, of specialized training in the mental health area at the university level -where the B.A. degree fully qualifies Social Ecology graduates for a new classification of mental health worker. Second, the Program provides the setting for preparing students for professional specialization in schools of administration and law, as well as for graduate work in such academic units as social sciences and biological sciences. To illustrate, our cur\u00ad riculum in criminal justice is proving to be excellent pre-law training. In this curricu\u00ad lum, students spend one-fourth of their junior and senior years in such field activi\u00ad ties as the courts, law enforcement agencies, probation units, and the criminal jus- UC IRVINE - 1972-1973244 INTERSCHOOL/SOCIAL ECOLOGY tice council. The Program expects to produce graduates with unique abilities and capacities for graduate education. Even established disciplines are calling more and more for people with cross-disciplinary backgrounds. And finally, the courses of study of the Program are highly appropriate for educat\u00ad ing students to become more effective and knowledgeable citizens because of a familiarity with community problems and the potential modes of solution, regard\u00ad less of stuCients' ultimate career objectives. For example, working in a child guid\u00ad ance clinic and a crisis clinic can be of immense value to a person who later chooses teaching as a career goal; similarly, assignment to air or water pollution control agencies can be of great help to someone who chooses industrial management as a career. By making most of its courses available to students majoring elsewhere on the cam\u00ad pus, the Program encourages the development of an environmental outlook among students whose.primary interests are more traditional. (The prin~ipal exception to this policy is field study; supervision of field study is an extremely time-consuming activity on the part of the faculty, so enrollment is limited to majors.) Major Subprograms Mental Health (Community Psychology, Behavior Modification): The mental health subprclgram focuses on community intervention and behavior change. A major tenet is that dysfunctional behavior must be considered within the context of the immediate environment, physical as well as social. Courses are offered on forms of psychopathology and discordant behavior patterns in children, adolescents, and adults. Students learn how to make systematic behavioral observations and careful assessments of all factors contributing to problems in living. Courses are also of\u00ad fered on strategies of psychological intervention, including interviewing, counseling, group therapy, and behavior modification. Adequate mastery and evaluation of the relevant research literature is a critical component, as is the application of sound research techniques in the evaluation of each student's own work. Approximately -50 agencies are available for field study in this area, including community clinics, state hospitals, and preschool and special education programs. Depending on his interests, experience, and competence, a student may do crisis intervention, serve as co-leader in group or play therapy, plan and implement remedial programs for handicapped children, or serve as a consultant for families or classrooms, to name only a few areas of the mental health field study. A major objective is to train social change agents who, after completing their undergraduate education, will be able to function as competent mental health professionals in the community. Urban and Regional Planning: The urban and regional planning subprogram is ori\u00ad ented toward the processes rather than the results of planning. The ultimate goal of planning is the achievement of living spaces conducive to .the achievement of opti\u00ad mum human satisfaction. Field study is available in planning departments and com\u00ad munity action councils. Environmental Quality and Environmental Health: The subprogram encompassing environmental quality and health is primarily concerned with the interaction of man and his physical environment. Courses in this subprogram include Air Pollu\u00ad tion, Water Quality, and Noise Pollution. Special emphasis is placed upon the roles of individual citizens and community organizations, both governmental and private, in maintaining and enhancing the quality of the\u00b7human environment. Field study is done at environmental information centers and pollution control agencies. UC IRVINE - 1972-1973INTERSCHOOL/SOCIAL ECOLOGY 245 Human Ecology: The subprogram in human ecology emphasizes study oriented toward the biological substrata of man and his environmental interactions. Exam\u00ad ples of relevant courses are Human Evolution, Dynamics of Human Populations, and Fundamentals of Ecology. - Criminal Justice: The criminal justice subprogram provides Social Ecology students an opportunity to examine critical issues in the nature of crime and society's re\u00ad action to legally prescribed behavior. Course offerings range from analyses of crim\u00ad inal behavior systems and the philosophical underpinnings of social control theories to studies of the operation of criminal justice agencies. Field study placements are available in police departments, prosecutor's and public defender's offices, proba\u00ad tion and parole agencies, and the state juvenile prison system. Students in the crim\u00ad inal justice subprogram have found their training to be excellent preparation for law and graduate schools, as well as for professional careers in law enforcement and corrections. Educational Policy and Institutions: Although Social Ecology has no formal under\u00ad graduate program in teacher education, students interested in careers with educa\u00ad tional institutions are offered a variety of field placements with public and private schools from the nursery through high school years. Students are encouraged to take courses through the Office of Teacher Education in addition to those relevant in Social Ecology. Students interested in obtaining teaching credentials should coor\u00ad dinate their programs closely with both that office and their Social Ecology aca\u00ad demic advisor. Degrees Offered Social Ecology ................................................ B.A. Honors at graduation will be awarded to about 12% of the graduating seniors. Ini\u00ad tial eligibility for such honors will be on the basis of grade point average. Among those qualifying, the awards of summa cum laude, magna cum laude, and cum laude shall be determined by a committee that considers, in addition to grade point aver\u00ad age, scholarship as displayed in day-to-day work, contributions to the community of social ecologists, performance in field assignments, and a paper defining a com\u00ad munity problem and demonstrating insight into its causes, its bases of continuance, and the potential paths toward solution. -Limitations on Enrollments The Program in Social Ecology is predicated on a close faculty-student-community interaction and upon close supervision of field work. While an attempt has been made to stretch resources to the breaking point, it has not been possible to admit all students who have requested transfer into Social Ecology. Those who cannot be accepted into the Program as majors because of capacity enrollment may request that their names be placed on a waiting list in the Program office to insure earliest possible admission. But admission cannot be assured. Requirements for the Bachelor's Degree University Requirements: See page 22. Departmental Requirements Social Ecology 1A-B-C; Social Ecology 10; six quarter courses of Field Study (So\u00ad cial Ecology 197); the appropriate prerequisites for the field study paths under- UC IRVINE - 1972-1973246 INTERSCHOOL/SOCIAL ECOLOGY taken (these prerequisites are numbered Social Ecology 2 through 9); and four upper-division courses in Social Ecology (those numbered 101 or above). During his junior and senior years, the student majoring in Social Ecology is re\u00ad quired to devote o:ae course per quarter to his field assignment. Field work in Social Ecology must be sharply differentiated from the work of a social worker or a com\u00ad munity worker or any comparable applied job. The field program is aimed at en\u00ad hancing the learning experience of students by making field and academic aspects directly relevant to each other. Field study assignments are under the direct super\u00ad vision of field personnel, but each field project has a faculty advisor who visits stu\u00ad dents and evaluates their work, coordinates various efforts, and is responsible for the intellectual-academic policies involved in the work. Moreover, some aspect of the advisor's own research is presumably in the area under his direction and further supports the work in the field and coordination with campus activities. Students in all field assignments work as a part of a project team. Their particular assignments are a function of their backgrounds and accumulating experience. When appropriate, they become participating members of the community of their assignments. while there is broad overlap, field assignments are classified in accord with the MAJOR SUBPROGRAMS of Social Ecology. Thus, for example, assignment to the Orange County Planning Department is classified under Urban and Regional Plan\u00ad ning, while assignment to the Child Guidance Clinic of Orange County is classified under Mental Health. Students choose subprogram area and specific agency within that area in consultation with faculty advisors. To facilitate these selections, there is a manual of available field placements for each subprogram. (Students may pick up these manuals in the Social Ecology office and apply to start field study during the third quarter of their sophomore year.) It is expected that students will choose field agencies in at least two subprogram areas. On the first Thursday of each quarter there is a noon meeting for all students ex\u00ad pecting to do field study assignments that quarter. There is a general discussion about field study assignments, what is expected in the field, and any problems that have been encountered. This is followed by individual enrollment into field study by the advisors. The importance of this meeting must be emphasized as it is the only time to enroll into new field study assignments. Planning a Program of Study Since there is great flexibility in choices among academic courses and field study placements, it is extremely important that each major work closely with his aca\u00ad demic advisor. This contact will facilitate constituting a coherent academic plan for the students, providing important feedback to aid achievement of primary goals and adequate bases for field study selection.

UC IRVINE - 1972-1973SEPARATE PROGRAMS/UNIVERSITY STUDIES 255 SEPARATE PROGRAMS UNIVERSITY STUDIES Contemporary university faculties are composed of specialists -it is unlikely that they could do their jobs if they were not. But many academic specialists have a particular interest in how their chosen disciplines relate to other academic fields, to contemporary society, and to the broad intellectual and social issues of the day. With respect to any area of specialized study there are basic questions of theory and ethics: there are implications for the future of society and for the future of the discipline itself. It is important that these implications be made explicit and that opportunity be provided within the University curriculum for their study and con\u00ad templation. No one should assume that what he is studying at the moment or what he expects to study as his undergraduate major is unrelated to other disciplines of the academic community. Students should have the opportunity to examine intel\u00ad lectual endeavors other than their own and to learn something of the relevance of these endeavors to their own lives. The courses offered in the University Studies Program have been designed with this goal in mind. The University Studies Program at Irvine was instituted by a vote of the local Aca\u00ad demic Senate in the spring of 1967. It is administered by an organization of Senior Fellows composed of faculty chosen from the various schools making up the Irvine complex. Senior Fellows are appointed by the Chancellor. All courses included in the Program are taught by regular members of the Irvine faculty: they have been introduced into the University curriculum through standard accreditation channels. Only one course in the University Studies Program may be counted for credit toward the Bachelor's Degree. SENIOR FELLOWS Nelson C.

UC IRVINE - 1972-1973ENGINEERING 261 SCHOOL OF ENGINEERING Robert M. Saunders Dean The School of Engineering offers junior-senior and graduate programs of study for men and women who will engage in the professional practice of engineering primar\u00ad ily as it relates to design, development, research, and teaching, in industry, govern\u00ad ment, or a university. Programs at all levels emphasize the fundamentals underlying engineering so as to facilitate future maintenance of engineering competence by either formal or informal study. Thus programs of study in the School of Engineer\u00ad ing endeavor to provide UCI graduates with adequate intellectual tools to enter the profession (after a short internship) and also provide for the continued updating of their technological knowledge. At the undergraduate level a single program in Engineering is offered with options in Civil and Environmental, Electrical, Mechanical, and General Engineering. A mul\u00ad tiple major in Environmental Management is also available with the Schools of Bio\u00ad logical Sciences and Social Sciences. The Engineering program is designed to maxi\u00ad mize the freedom of choice while at the same time being sufficiently structured so as to provide a sound base in Engineering. In general each student will devote ap\u00ad proximately 40% of his time over the four years to the scientific and mathematical backgrounds pertaining to the various engineering fields; the purpose of this intense study of the sciences and mathematics is to make sure that graduates are well grounded in the laws and constraints of logic and nature. Another 20% of the pro\u00ad gram will be assigned to the study of the fine arts, humanities, and the social sci\u00ad ences. The remaining 40% will comprise engineering subjects. At the graduate level, programs of study become less rigidly structured and special-\u00b7 ization becomes more intense. The M.S. program requires nine courses to be com\u00ad pleted, but the exact choice of the courses will be a matter of negotiation between the student and his faculty advisor. Thesis or non-thesis programs are available. At the Ph.D. level the program is still less structured but more specialized than at the M.S. level. No courses are required; rather students must demonstrate various com\u00ad petences as they progress toward the completion of their doctoral programs. Accreditation of engineering programs in the U.S.A. is by the Engineers Council for Professional Development. To date the undergraduate electrical option has been so accredited by the E C P D; accreditation of other options will be sought as soon as they have graduates. Uniquely Engineering student organizations are the Dean's Cabinet and the Engi\u00ad neering Society of UCI (ESUCI). All Engineering students are eligible to be mem\u00ad bers of the Dean's Cabinet. Composed of students representing all academic levels from freshman through graduate, the Cabinet provides a direct communication link between the students and the Dean. The Cabinet in turn appoints a Committee on Committees which selects students to participate on the committees of the School UC IRVINE - 1972-1973262,ENGINEERING of Engineering. Whereas the Dean's Cabinet_pertains mainly to academic matters, the ESUCI is professional in nature having ties locally and nationally with the engi\u00ad neering profession through its organizations. All faculty and committee meetings (except those involving personnel considera\u00b7 tions) are open meetings; in addition to designated student representatives, all stu\u00ad dents are encouraged and expected to participate in the development of School policy. Student evaluation of the quality of courses is made annually and both stu\u00ad dents and alumni make in-depth evaluations of faculty members being considered for promotion or other special actions. Degrees Offered in the School Engineering ........................................... B.S., M.S., Ph.D. Honors are awarded to outstanding graduating Engineering students. UNDERGRADUATE PROGRAMS The undergraduate program leads to a B.S. degree with an option in Civil and Envi\u00ad ronmental Engineering, Electrical Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, General Engineering, or Environmental Management. The program is designed to provide a firm background in the basic sciences, through the required courses in physics, mathematics, biology, and chemistry, and a fundamental understanding of the engi\u00ad neering sciences, through the required engineering courses, as well as some special- -ization via technical electives. Admission High school students wishing to begin their engineering programs at UCI should seek admission to the Irvine campus of the University of California designating Engineering as their intended major. Upon registering, a student will be assigned an engineering advisor who will assist in developing a satisfactory program of study and provide the requisite advice for the development of a coherent program of study. Transfer students are admitted to the School of Engineering upon completion of a freshman-sophomore program in another school at Irvine or at another college, including community colleges. Students seeking admission to the School of Engi\u00ad neering from colleges and schools other than UCI must satisfy the University re\u00ad quirements for admission to advanced standing and must have completed the specif\u00ad ic prerequisites for the junior courses to be undertaken in the School of Engineering. Students meeting the Community College-State College-University compact of 1965 on lower-division requirements may complete the requirements for the B.S. degree in six quarters assuming normal progress. Requirements for the Bachelor's Degree University Requirements: See page 22. Note, however, that the breadth require\u00ad ment does not apply to the School of Engineering. School Requirements Credit in 45 courses in one of the options listed in the following table. Variations from these requirements may be made subject to the approval of the appropriate Board of Study. A minimum grade of C must be earned in each core course: Engr. IOOA-B-C, IOIA-B-C, and 105A-B-C.

In addition to the options given in the table, the School of Engineering jointly offers with the School of Biological Sciences and the School of Social Sciences a program in Environmental Management requiring 48 courses. For further informa\u00ad tion contact the Student Mfairs Office, School of Engineering. The Sc~~ol of Engineering is also participating in a joint program in Perception and Recogmt10n. Programs of Study Students are free to follow any schedule of courses in the program they feel is meaningful to them, but they should complete the requisite physics and mathe\u00ad matics for admission to junior courses in engineering and meet the graduation re\u00ad quirements of the School of Engineering at the end of their allotted collegiate peri\u00ad od. Normally a student will wish to complete the science requirements, the digital computing course (Information and Computer Science 1), and some of the courses required in fine arts, humanities, and social sciences in the freshman and sophomore years. Typical programs in the several areas of concentration are available upon request to the Student Affairs Office, School of Engineering. UC IRVINE - 1972-1973264 ENGINEERING Students in the School of Engineering should bear in mind the general campus pol\u00ad icy which permits them to take courses in areas outside their major, or outside their school, on a \"Pass/Not Pass\" basis. With respect to programs in engineering, such areas are fine arts, humanities, and social sciences and any course not being submit\u00ad ted as fulfilling the graduation requirements. Programs of study in the School of Engineering are tailor-made to the desires and objectives of individual students. Students will work out suitable programs of study with their faculty advisors. Students must realize that they alone are responsible for the planning of their own programs and for satisfactory completion of the gradua\u00ad tion requirements. However, the faculty stand ready to give every assistance and necessary advice in the planning of programs. A student may substitute courses of his choosing for those required if he can substantiate the merits of his academic plan and obtain the approval of the Faculty of the School. Proficiency Examinations A student who thinks himself sufficiently proficient in the subject matter under\u00ad lying a specific course in the School of Engineering to receive credit without formal enrollment in that course may consult with the instructor of that course to explore what he must do to demonstrate his proficiency and gain credit. Normally, his abil\u00ad ity will be demonstrated by a written or oral examination; if a portion of his capa\u00ad bility involves laboratory exercises, he may be required to perform experiments as well as to take a written examination. Normally, these examinations (written, oral, or laboratory) will be given at the opening of each quarter in which the specified course is offered. All courses in the School are available for such proficiency demonstrations .. GRADUATE PROGRAMS Graduate study in the School of Engineering permits specialization in a particular area while at the same time developing breadth. Graduate study toward the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees is applied science oriented and will provide an excellent base for future professional growth through understanding of the basic phenomena associ\u00ad ated with the student's chosen field. Admission Admission to graduate standing in the School of Engineering is generally accorded those possessing a B.S. degree in engineering or an allied science obtained with an acceptable level of scholarship from an institution of recognized standing. Those seeking admission without the requisite scholarship record may, in some cases, undertake remedial work; if completed at the stipulated academic level, they will be admitted to full graduate standing. The aptitude section of the Graduate Record Examination is required. Master of Science in Engineering Those wishing to pursue graduate work in the area of electrical engineering will find programs in control systems, optimization theory, operations research, communica\u00ad tion and information theory, pattern recognition, optical systems, and quantum electronics. In the environmental-engineering area there are programs in water quality, hydraulics, hydrology, air pollution, and environmental management. For the M.S. degree with thesis, nine courses are required, of which at least six are graduate level courses; a maximum of two research courses may be submitted. For UC IRVINE - 1972-1973ENGINEERING 265 the M.S. degree without thesis, nine courses will be required, of which at least six are graduate level and may not include research credit. The M.S. thesis must demon\u00ad strate the student's capability of undertaking an original study and carrying it through to a conclusion satisfactory to at least three members of the faculty. For those students electing to study for the M.S. without thesis, a comprehensive exer\u00ad cise demonstrating familiarity with a broad aspect of the field of engineering in which they are majoring will be required. Master of Science programs must be com\u00ad pleted in four calendar years from the date of admission. The detailed program of study is worked out with an advisor who takes .into consid\u00ad eration the objectives of the candidate, his preparation, and the specific and implied requirements of the School. Part-time students generally will be limited to one course per quarter if fully employed, and those holding research or teaching assist\u00ad antships normally will not be permitted a full three-course load. Engineers in indus\u00ad try may find it convenient to complete some courses in University Extension. Upon petition to the School, courses taken on another campus of the University will be accorded full credit if taken after admission to Irvine; up to three courses will be credited upon admission if taken in Extension or on another campus of the Uni\u00ad versity, or in another university. Doctor of Philosophy in Engineering The doctoral program in engineering leading to the Ph.D. is tailored to the individ\u00ad ual needs and backgrounds of the student. There are no specific course require\u00ad ments but rather several milestones to be passed: admission to the Ph.D. program by the Faculty of the School; passage of the preliminary examination assessing the student's background and his potential for success in the doctoral program; satis\u00ad faction of the teaching requirements required of all doctoral students; research preparation; and completion of a significant research investigation. The degree is granted upon the recommendation of the Doctoral Committee and the Dean of the Graduate Division. For at least the final two years of the doctoral program it is expected that the student will be a full-time resident in the School. Doctoral programs must be completed in seven calendar years from the date of admission. Some financial aids such as research and teaching assistantships are available so that each doctoral student, after he has passed the preliminary examination, will have a staff appointment in the School of Engineering for at least one year.

Porter Dean The Graduate School of Administration offers programs of advanced study leading to the M.S. or Ph.D. degree in Administration. Through these programs individuals may prepare for significant roles in business or industry, in education and in govern\u00ad ment, and in other types of organizations. Among others, these roles include corpo\u00ad rate managers, program directors, federal executives, state and local officials, urban and regional planners, administrators for various levels of the education system, organizational staff experts, political leaders, hospital administrators, managers of scientific or research enterprises, engineer-administrators, policy analysts, research\u00ad ers, and faculty members. Three basic assumptions underlie the School's philosophy of graduate education. First, there are significant phenomena and problems common to business-industrial, educational, and governmental organizations; second, a common set of disciplines, concepts, techniques, and technologies can be found which are appropriate to a wide range of organizational or scholarly roles; third, many administrators in the future will work in more than one of the three arenas during their careers. The M.S. program is intended to increase the likelihood that future leaders will be able to communicate effectively and move easily from one kind of organizational unit to another, thereby providing society with versatile managers and administra\u00ad tors. The Ph.D. program for the field of administration has the usual academic and research objectives. General Admission Requirements Requests for application materials should be addressed to the Graduate Admissions Office, University of California, Irvine; Irvine, California 92664. Applicants for the Ph.D. program should complete all phases of the application pro\u00ad cedme by March 15. Applicants for the M.S. program should complete all phases of the application procedure by May 31. (GSA also admits applicants in the winter and spring quarters; application procedures should be completed six weeks prior to the beginning of the appropriate quarter.) In addition to the general University of California rules governing admission to graduate study, the Graduate School of Administration normally requires the following: 1. The Graduate Record Examination (verbal and quantitative aptitude parts) or the Admissions Test for Graduate Study in Business. 2. Subject matter preparation that emphasizes a background in social science courses (psychology, sociology, economics, political science, etc.), and course\u00ad work in quantitative areas, such as mathematics at the level of introductory cal\u00ad culus, and probability and statistics. UC IRVINE - 1972-1973274 GRADUATE SCHOOL OF ADMINISTRATION 3. A previously prepared paper (research report, essay, case study) which may be indicative generally of the applicant's interests and capabilities. Evaluation of the applicant's file for admission will consist of an integrated assess\u00ad ment of all materials (test scores, transcripts of previous academic work, previously prepared paper, statements on application forms, and letters of recommendation). There are no arbitrary cut-off points on any of the criteria for admission -rather, admission is on the basis of the\u00b7 total configuration of qualifications. (In those cases where there is no question concerning the quality of an applicant's aptitudes and previous academic work, but where there are major deficiencies in prior subject matter preparation, applicants can be admitted for a period of one year as \"Limited Status\" students in order to devote full-time to making up these deficiencies in ap\u00ad propriate undergraduate courses on campus. Those anticipating enrolling as Limited Status~ Students should show this on their application forms.) Educational Objectives Regardless of the content of particular courses, it is expected that all degree candi\u00ad dates will be exposed to and have the ability to use the following: 1. General Knowledge: The Broad Context of Organizations and Management: The mid-twentieth century (significant trends, conditions, and problems); history of science, scientific inquiry, and the philosophy of science; economic, political, and social analysis. 2. Conceptual and Empirical Knowledge of Organizations: Basic concepts of man\u00ad agement; the structure and functions of organizations, including comparative analysis and inter-organizational relations; levels and units of decision-making; individual behavior and group norms; operating environments of organizations. 3. Specific Knowledge of Particular Arenas of Administration: Depth study of specific institutional environments for administrative practice, such as education\u00ad al, governmental, business-industrial organizations, and other types of organizations. 4. Mathematics and Statistics: As tools of precise reasoning, as languages which will tend more and more to dominate professional and scholarly literature, and above all, as foundations for relevant quantitative methods: 5. Technical Bases of Management: Decision processes; operations research; sys\u00ad tems and accounting techniques; personnel poli\u00ad cies; techniques for measuring and affecting attitudes and behavior; computer technology and information sciences; research design and strategies. 6. General Skills: Political skills, effective management of interpersonal relations, leadership strategies and tactics, and competence in oral, graphic, and written expression. 7. Professional Orientations: Identification of factors, values, and policies which might bear on successful, responsible, and intellectually honest performance of organizational roles. Recognition of the administrator's potential contributions to society and of ethical and moral problems which arise from social research -and the management of human enterprises. UC IRVINE - 1972-1973GRADUATE SCHOOL OF ADMINISTRATION 275 The Master of Science in Administration The M.S. program in GSA requires a minimum of 23 quarter courses with a mini\u00ad mum overall grade point average of 3.00. The 23 quarter courses normally take two full academic years or their equivalent in part-time registration. The courses in the M.S. program are divided into two groups, each group designed to achieve specific educational objectives. \u00b7 Core Courses The first group consists of twelve Core Courses and has two fundamental aims: (1) to develop skills needed to select and use effectively the appropriate means, methods, and techniques for diagnosing and solving organization problems; (2) to identify the significant concepts and phenomena associated with the study of com\u00ad plex organizations, and to bring to bear the relevant contributions of the core dis\u00ad ciplines or interdisciplinary sources on the analysis of organizations and the admin\u00ad istrative process. The twelve Core Courses are listed below. For descriptions of the general content of these courses, refer to section on courses. With the exception of Quantitative Meth\u00ad ods (two quarters), any core course may be taken in the first or second year. Quan\u00ad titative Methods must be taken in the winter and spring quarters of the first year. The core will consist of the following 12 quarter courses: Quantitative Methods for Administration; Quantitative Methods for Administration (continued); Microeco\u00ad nomics for Administration; Macroeconomics for Administration; Accounting and Financial Control; Organization Theories and Models; Organization Theories and Models (continued); Interpersonal Dynamics; Manpower Utilization and Labor Relations; Institutional Arena (Seminar in Educational Administration, or Business Administration, or Public Administration); Institutional Arena (continued); Work\u00ad shop in Administrative Problem-Solving. Elective Courses The remaining coursework for the M.S. degree will consist of 11 elective courses. The major emphasis in the elective courses will be on the development of special\u00ad ized knowledge relevant to particular institutions (e.g., educational, business, government, or other types of organizations), and on achieving additional depth in a discipline or interdisciplinary area or specialized competence in the use of a par\u00ad ticular set of technical tools and methods. These elective courses are selected by the student in light of his educational and career goals and interests. The Three-Two Program In addition to the two-year program for students who have already received a bach\u00ad elor's degree from this University or another institution, outstanding UCI under\u00ad graduate students may enter a cooperative \"three-two\" program with other campus units such as the School of Social Sciences, the School of Engineering, or the Department of Information and Computer Science. Students in such a program will spend their first three years in one of these other units, followed by two years in the Graduate S\u00b7chool of Administration. Successful completion of requirements in this program leads to a Bachelor's degree in the cooperating field after the fourth year and a Master's degree in Administration after the fifth year. Students contem\u00ad plating entering such a three-two program should contact the Graduate School of Administration prior to, or early in, the start of their junior year, for the purpose of program consultation. UC IRVINE - 1972-1973276 GRApuA:rE SCHOOL OF ADMINISTRATION Part\"Time Study Students may enroll in the M.S. program on a part-time basis. Such students nor\u00ad mally take two courses per quarter and are required to complete the M.S. degree in no more than four years. At present GSA does not regularly offer night courses; however, an attempt will be made to accommodate the needs of part-time students by offering several courses each quarter at convenient late afternoon or evening hours. (Note: University regulations state that \"the full registration fee is required of the students regardless of the number of courses taken.\") The Doctor of Philosophy in Administration Students who have completed the GSA M.S. program (or have obtained a Master's Degree elsewhere in an area of administration) may be eligible for the GSA doctoral program. Requirements of the Ph.D. program include a broad knowledge of core disciplines as represented by the 12 core courses of the M.S. program. In addition, the Ph.D. must qualify as a skilled researcher and must complete a significant exer\u00ad cise demonstrating these skills. Although there is considerable variation in the length of time beyond a master's degree needed to complete the Ph.D., a realistic range would be two to four years. The Ph.D. program is divided into three phases: preliminary, qualifying, and dissertation. The preliminary phase (which must be completed within 5 quarters) is designed to ensure that all Ph.D. students have (1) a thorough knowledge of core materials, (2) familiarity with administrative problems associated with a specific institutional arena (e.g., educational, business-industrial, or government administration), (3) knowledge of how to conduct research, and (4) a depth of knowledge in a basic discipline or tool relevant to administration (e.g., operations research, behavioral science models for administration). : In the qualification phase the student prepares for dissertation research in an area of specialization. This phase is completed when an oral qualifying examination is passed. Passing this examination formally advances the student to candidacy. The dissertation phase involves a significant original research project which demon\u00ad strates the Ph.D. student's creativity and ability to launch and sustain a career of research. The dissertation attests to the usual scholarly objectives of any Ph.D. program. There are no foreign language requirements in the GSA Ph.D. program.

Bailey Director of Teacher Education Education as a discipline involves not only a systematic study of the theories, prob\u00ad lems, and methods of teaching as preparation for classroom teachers, but also seeks to analyze education both as a process and as a cultural phenomenon. The degree to which the lives of a people are shaped and directed by their schools lends urgency to research into what is good, better, and best in educational policies and practice. The relationship between school and society, the learning process, the construction of curricula, the purposes and philosophy of education -these are all legitimate concerns of a university which would clarify the role of the teacher in the school and the role of the school in society. The total faculty of the University assumes as one of its responsibilities the educa\u00ad tion of teachers for elementary and secondary schools and junior colleges. The Irvine plan diffuses the responsibility for teacher education throughout the various schools and departments. Those responsibilities are to be met through curricula combining subject matter concentration in teaching fields, studies seeking to relate theory and practice, and supervised teaching and internships designed to test educa\u00ad tion theory in teaching and to develop professional attitudes. Students planning to become teachers can qualify at UCI for the Standard Teaching Credentials with a specialization in Elementary teaching or with a specialization in Secondary teach\u00ad ing. Entrance into the Graduate Program of Teacher Training requires the same grade point average as for any other graduate program. Preparation of Teachers at UCI The program of preparation of teachers at UCI is divided into three areas. The first of these is the general education background. This requirement is covered by the University's breadth requirement (see page 23). The second area of the program is training in the subject matter to be taught. This includes both the undergraduate major and course work in the graduate school. The third phase of preparation of teachers is professional education and student teaching. At the University usually the first two years of courses cover the general education\u00ad al background, in addition to some training in subject matter. The next two years cover, in much greater depth, the preparation in subject matter, with possibly a small amount of attention to the training in teaching. About two-thirds of the fifth year are spent on training in Education and about one-third on further training in the subject matter area. In recent years, and particularly on the UCI campus, the training in subject matter not only has had the virtue of depth but has tended to have an additional dimension in breadth. Although a prospective teacher cannot be an expert in all areas of his major, he can acquire some knowledge of the various areas through in-depth study in the major field. It should also be noted that the student needs training in subjects closely related to his academic area. For example, a physical science or social science major will need strong mathematics preparation. UC IRVINE - 1972-1973280 EDUCATION OF TEACHERS In the third phase of this program of preparation of teachers, namely the training of teachers, the coverage is broad: training in methods of teaching, in use of multi\u00ad media, training in the area of responsibilities, teaching strategies for minorities, legal information, district procedures, discipline, levels of student ability, means of moti\u00ad vating the reluqant learners, and a number of other aspects of \"good teaching.\" Teaching Credentials A fifth year of college work taken in the Graduate Division is required for any teaching credential. Students planning to become teachers can qualify at UCI for the Standard Teaching Credentials with a specialization in Elementary Teaching, with a specialization in Secondary Teaching, or in junior College Teaching. The Standard Elementary Teaching Credential authorizes persons to teach in kindergar\u00ad ten and grades one through nine; the Standard Secondary Teaching Credential au\u00ad thorizes the teaching of subjects in the teaching major and teaching minor (not required) in grades seven through twelve (all grades of -any senior high school, junior high school, or the seventh and eighth grades of an elementary school). The junior College Credential requires an M.A. in an academic subject. Requirements for either the Elementary or Secondary Teaching Credential are such, that the student who completes the major at UCI (including the 6-3-3 breadth requirement) will have completed virtually all of the undergraduate courses essen\u00ad tial to the credential. Thus it is not necessary for the undergraduate student to con\u00ad sult with the Office of Teacher Education until some time in his upper-division experience. The breadth of the Irvine graduation requirements simplifies the cre\u00ad dential requirements to the point that the only deviation from a regular B.A. degree might be the inclusion of Education 171 and either 170, 172, or 175 during the junior or senior years, plus an English composition course more advanced than freshman English. Under the provisions of the Teacher Licensing Law of 1970 a course in reading is required of all secondary teachers. It will be effective January 1, 1974. In addition to the regular credential program there is the possibility of enrolling in the Elementary Teacher Intern Program. In the intern program the student gets his B.A. degree, attends our summer session, and then goes to work as a regular teacher with a salary but under University guidance. We suggest that students who are aim\u00ad ing at the Intern Teaching program consult with the Office of Teacher Education. A graduate year is defined as 45 quarter units of upper-division work. If the student is officially in a Master's Degree program so that legitimate graduate-level work is included, this number can be reduced. The fifth year for the credential program is three quarters only. The student is expected to be a full-time student and is admit\u00ad ted only for the three quarters. Work taken in Extension or in Summer Schools does not count llS part of the three quarters. During the graduate year the student must complete for the Secondary Credential at least three courses in his major {or in his minor). A minor is not required, but is recommended particularly for the Social Sciences, Biological Sciences, and Humanities students. The three subject matter courses required in the graduate year must be at the upper-division or gradu\u00ad ate level. For the Elementary Credential no subject matter courses are required in the graduate year. To qualify for a credential the student is required to complete specified courses in Education and 12 units (three quarters) of supervised teaching. The sequence of Education courses is flexible. Undergraduate students may begin professional education courses during the upper-division years. UC IRVINE - 1972-1973EDUCATION OF. TEACHERS 281 Fifth-year teacher credential students with exceptional records may in some depart\u00ad ments be admitted to graduate seminars. For example, outstanding English students may be admitted to English seminars on a stand-by basis by--petition to the Gradu\u00ad ate Committee. The Committee will screen petitions as it normally would screen applications to the Ph.D. program, asking students for letters of recommendation, papers, or other evidence of achievement. With the exception of classes designed primarily for teacher credential students, enrollment in a given English seminar will be granted only after English Department graduate students have been assured of places in it. No student will be admitte'd to student teaching without completing a methods course at UCI. Academic advisement is maintained on a daily basis. Three advisors are available. It is recommended that students come in for their first career advisement early in their university experience although the program is specifically a post-graduate program. Requirements for the Standard Teaching Credential with a Specialization in Ele\u00ad mentary Teaching A. The student must complete 17 courses, divided into five of the six areas listed below. The English and the advanced English composition courses are required in every case. Only three of these 17 courses may be in the major and/or three in any minor (i.e., 11 courses must be outside the major and minor fields). Note that the completion of the UCI 6-3-3 breadth requirement will fulfill the area coverage of this requirement but not the number of courses required. The ele\u00ad mentary teacher must complete a course in the theory of the structure, arithme\u00ad tic, and algebra of the real number system (Mathematics 104E) or a course in calculus. 1. Humanities {history, English, speech, philosophy): The student must com\u00ad plete four quarters of English, including a course in English composition more advanced than English 28A-B-C. English 139 is required. 2. Social Sciences (anthropology, economics, geography, political science, psychology, and sociology): Some course work in political science would fulfill the United States Constitution requirement described below. 3. Natural Sciences (biological and physical sciences). 4. Mathematics: Requires a knowledge of high school algebra and geometry as a prerequisite. For the Elementary Credential, the student must complete a course in the theory of the structure, arithmetic, and algebra of the real number system (Mathematics 104E) or a course in calculus. 5. Fine Arts (music, art, and drama). 6. Foreign Languages. B. The following Education courses are required for the Elementary Credential program: Education 170 or 172 or 175; Education 104A-B, 105A, and 171; Education 300A-B-CD-E-F (supervised teaching). Normally in the winter quarter of the graduate year the student will be expected to enroll in Education 300A, and in the spring quarter in 300B and 300C. UC IRVINE - 1972-1973282 EDUCATION OF TEACHERS ' C. Students must also take course work or an examination given on the provisions and principles of the United States Constitution before the credential will be issued. Requirements for the Standard Teaching Credential with a Specialization in Sec\u00ad ondary Teaching A. The student must complete the same basic requirements as listed above for the Elementary Credential, except that the 17 courses must be spread over four of the six areas listed. B. The following Education courses are required for the Secondary Credential program: At least three courses must be upper-division or graduate courses in either the major or minor, but not mixed. Education 170 or 172 or 175; Education 101 and 171; Education 102 (Methods of Teaching in the Secondary School) or a Methods course in the subject to be taught. The student must choose a section of 102 that corresponds to his major teaching field. This course must be taken immediately preceding enrollment in student teaching (Education 320) or concurrently with it. Education 300A-B-C-D-E-F (supervised teaching). Normally in the winter quar\u00ad ter of the graduate year the student will enroll in Education 320A, and in the spring quarter in Education 320B and 320C. C. Course work or examination on the provisions and principles of the United States Constitution, as described in (C) above. Majors and Minors for a Teaching Credential To help the student determine his program of studies both in preparation for and in completion of the teaching credential, the \"major\" and \"minor\" requirements for both the Elementary and Secondary Credentials are detailed below. Each section of the list below (A, B, C, or D) contains an acceptable combination of major and minor(s). All majors: Professional education is excluded by law. Thirty-six quarter hours (nine courses) of upper-division or graduate-level work is required for all majors. All minors: All must be commonly taught in public high schools. A. Major: Academic subject commonly taught in public schools at appropriate level. An academic subject commonly taught in the public schools is one of the following: 1. A single academic subject of 36 quarter units {nine courses) of upper-division and/or graduate course work in one of the subjects within one of the following fields: physical sciences (chemistry, geology, etc.), social sciences (history, politi\u00ad cal science, etc.), humanities (English, speech, a single foreign language, philos\u00ad ophy), fine arts (music, art, and drama), or in the single subjects of mathematics or biological sciences. All the biological sciences (botany, zoology, biology, etc.) are a part of the single subject designated as \"biological sciences.\" This biological sciences major for the Elementary Credential requires 42 quarter units. UC IRVINE - 1972-1973EDUCATION OF TEACHERS 283 2. When an applicant holds a degree with a major in an academic interdepart\u00ad mental area such as social sciences, 36 quarter hours (nine courses) of upper\u00ad division or graduate course work must be offered, including 24 quarter hours (six courses) in one of the subjects making up one of the following interdepartmental majors: physical sciences; social sciences; humanities; biological sciences and mathematics; a single physical science and mathematics; and fine arts. Minor: No minor is required, but if desired, one or more of the following: 1. 30 quarter hours of lower-and upper-division courses in a single academic or non-academic subject, or 2. 30 quarter hours in an academic interdepartmental area (as described under the Major in A.2 above), including 20 quarter hours in one subject. B. Major: Academic subject not commonly taught in public schools. Minor: Two minors that are commonly taught \"in public schools are required* (30 quarter hours each). One must be academic; the other may be non-academic. C. Major: Non-academic subject commonly taught in public schools.

Tustin, California. July 4, 1889. UC IRVINE - 1972-1973288 COLLEGE OF MEDICINE COLLEGE OF MEDICINE Warren L. Bostick, M.D. Dean Good health in its broadest sense- physical, mental, social, and environmental- is recognized as a necessity in our society. Our expanding population, with its ex\u00ad panding needs for health .care, demands an ever increasing number of physicians in all specialties and an increasingly better use of those physicians we are training. At the same time, investigators in the field of medicine must be trained, for medical science cannot advance without the creation of new knowledge about health and disease; and dedicated, skilled teachers are needed to bring this new knowledge to students. The College of Medicine recognizes three responsibilities: to create knowledge through research; to disseminate knowledge through teaching; and to make knowl\u00ad edge available to members of the medical community through continuing education programs. The College also recognizes its responsibility for developing in its stu\u00ad dents an attitude of compassion, of sympathy with and understanding for patients as individuals within a total social and economic environment. Facilities Preclinical instruction at the College of Medicine is conducted in facilities on the Irvine campus, which include departmental offices and laboratories, student multi\u00ad discipline laboratories, and academic support units such as the medical sciences library, biometrics laboratory, scientifkequipment suite, and vivarium. Students can watch televised surgical operations and clinical procedures in color on videotape from the studio at UCI's major affiliated teaching hospital or live from the clinics and operating rooms; a two-way audio system permits students to ask questions during the procedures. Architectural plans for the College's first major facility, Medical Sciences I, will be completed in 1972, and the building will be occupied in 1974-75. This is to be fol\u00ad lowed by a University hospital (Medical Sciences II), to be occupied in 1975-76. Medical Sciences III, a clinical sciences facility, will complete the basic require\u00ad ments for the medical educational program and form the nucleus of the 150-acre health sciences complex at UCI. Clinical instruction is conducted at various affiliated hospitals: -Orange County Medical Center, a general hospital owned and operated by the County of Orange, is a major teaching and research facility. It is staffed by mem\u00ad bers of the College of Medicine faculty. Medical students receive portions of their medical training in every clinical area at the Medical Center. -The Veterans Administration Hospital in Long Beach has training emphases in medicine, surgery, psychiatry, physical medicine, and rehabilitation. UC IRVINE - 1972-1973COLLEGE OF MEDICINE 289 -Memorial Hospital of Long Beach, a non-profit hospital, is a major teaching facil\u00ad ity for medicine and pediatrics. -Childrens Hospital of Orange County provides acute care for children from birth to 17 years of age with any type of medical or surgical condition. Internship and Residency Programs The College of Medicine offers professional postdoctoral programs for interns and residents at its various affiliated hospitals. The intern program includes rotating (mixed) internships in psychiatry, radiology, and pathology, as well as straight in\u00ad ternships in medicine, gynecology and obstetrics, pediatrics, and surgery. The resi\u00ad dent program offers curricula in most disciplines. All programs meet the formal standards of the American Medical Association and the appropriate specialty boards. ADMISSION The College gives equal consideration to applicants of all \u00b7ethnic and racial back\u00ad grounds, religious preferences, and to both men and women. All are encouraged to apply. All inquiries should be addressed to: Office of Medical Admissions, College of Medicine, University of California, Irvine; Irvine, California 92664. First-year students are admitted only in july of each year. A student formerly enrolled in the College may be required, before readmission, to pass examinations in the subjects previously complet~d .. Candidates for admission to the first-year class in the College must meet the follow\u00ad ing requirements: 1. The candidate must have completed a four-year high school course, or its equiva\u00ad lent, acceptable for enrollment in the college of letters, arts, and sciences of an accredited university, college, or junior college. 2. The candidate for admission must have completed, with demonstrated superior scholarship record, a minimum of three full years of premedical work; this work must total not less than 90 semester units or an equivalent number of quarter units and be acceptable for Bachelor's Degree credit in an accredited institution of higher learning. The number of units carried is to be the amount necessary to complete the Bachelor's Degree requirements in no more than four years. Candi\u00ad dates for admission may submit junior college c;:redit only to the extent granted on transfer to a four-year college or university. For scholarship evaluation, actual letter or numerical grades in courses are highly desirable and are essential in the areas of required subjects. The following minimum specified subjects of premed\u00ad ical work are offered as a guide to the candidate: chemistry (including general, organic, and quantitative analysis), 16 semester units or 24 quarter units; \u00b7 physics, 8 semester units or 12 quarter units; biology and/or zoology (including vertebrate embryology), 12 semester units or 18 quarter units. These courses serve as a practical foundation for work in the medical college. Additional work in the sciences does not necessarily improve the applicant's prospect of admission, but courses in mathematics (calculus, statistics), compara\u00ad tive anatomy of the vertebrates, and genetics are considered to provide a stronger premedical foundation and are looked on with favor. Duplication of medical curriculum subjects is not an advantage (i.e., anatomy, physiology, or bacteriology). \u00b7 UC IRVINE - 1972-1973290 COLLEGE OF MEDICINE Premedical students are advised to take advantage of the opportunity for intel\u00ad lectual maturation afforded by a well-rounded liberal arts curriculum. The study of English is of particular importance. The applicant should direct any questions he may have regarding the acceptabil\u00ad ity of a course to the Office of Admissions. 3. The candidate must attain a satisfactory score in the Medical College Admissions Test. The score report for this test must be received by the Admissions Office of the College before acceptance may be granted. Inquiries regarding this test should be addressed to the Medical College Admissions Test, The Psychological Corporation, 304 East 45th Street, New York, N.Y. 10017. 4. A personal interview with a member of an Interview Committee is required of the candidate after preliminary consideration of his application for admission. Letters of recommendation from college professors are invited. Candidates for interview will be notified of the date. Those candidates who live a considerable distance from the Irvine campus may be interviewed by someone designated by the College of Medicine. An interview does not guarantee admission. Western Interstate Commission for Higher Education The College of Medicine participates in the student exchange program of the West\u00ad em Interstate Commission for Higher Education, under which qualified legal resi\u00ad dents of western states without medical schools -Alaska, Arizona, Hawaii, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, and Wyoming- are given a reduction of tuition and fees. To be eligible for this program, the student must apply to the WICHE certifying officers in his own state. For addresses of certifying officers, write to the Western Interstate Commission for Higher Education, University East Campus, Boulder, Colorado' 80304. Procedure for Admission The College is a member of the Association of American Medical Colleges Applica\u00ad tion Service (AAMCAS). Requests for applications may be submitted to the College or directly to the Association of American Medical Colleges, One Dupont Circle N.W., Washington, D.C. 20036. All AAMCAS applications will be reviewed by our Admissions Committee. An applicant may then be requested by us to submit addi\u00ad tional m.\\.terial consisting of letters of recommendation, supplemental transcripts, health history, personal information form, two photographs, and a fee of $20. No additional material should be submitted until requested by the College. Applications may be submitted at any time between June 1 and December 15 of the year preceding that into which entrance is desireci No application for admission will be accepted which does not clearly indicate that all th~ required subjects will have been completed by the date of entrance. Selection of Candidates The fulfillment of scholastic entrance requirements and the ability to pay tuition and other fees do not of themselves constitute a right to study medicine. This privi\u00ad lege is sought by many more applicants than educational facilities can accommo\u00ad date. The privilege is granted, by action of the Admissions Committee and the Dean, to those who possess, in addition to scholarship, other attributes important in the physician. Ethnic background, sex, and religious or political convictions do UC IRVINE - 1972-1973COLLEGE OF MEDICINE 291 not enter into the consideration of the Committee. Those students selected to enter the program must continue throughout the course to demonstrate their ability and worthiness to assume the responsibilities of the physician. No candidate for admission will be considered who has been dismissed from any college, university, or other professional school. If the applicant has attended an\u00ad other professional school, he must submit complete official transcripts and a letter of honorable dismissal from that school. Notice of Appointment The Dean of the College will notify the candidate of his appointment as soon as his application has been acted upon by the Admissions Committee. Written acceptance of the appointment, accompanied by an acceptance fee of $50.00, must be sent to the College within two weeks after receipt of the notice of appointment. This fee will be applied against the University registration fee for the first quarter. Should an applicant accept admission and then decide to withdraw prior to March 1 of the year of anticipated admission, this fee will be refunded; after that date no refund shall be made. This is in keeping with the recommendations of the Association of American Medical Colleges.

Wyle, M.D. University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, Assistant Adjunct Professor of Medicine MEDICAL CURRICULUM The medical curriculum at UCI is based upon a core of 10 quarters plus four elec\u00ad tive quarters. The core curriculum includes the body of knowledge, skills, attitudes, and habits considered requisite for all those receiving the M.D. degree, regardless of their future careers. The first year of the medical education program consists of four interdisciplinary courses, each one quarter in length, taken sequentially by all medical students. The first-year course work concentrates on the sciences basic to clinical medicine; clini\u00ad cians and their patients are an integral part of the learning situation during the en\u00ad tire year. The remaining six quarters of the core curriculum are clinical in emphasis, with basic science correlates as well as correlation with rehabilitative, community, and\u00b7preventive aspects of medicine. The focus is on medical student learning rather than on faculty teaching. Demon\u00ad strations, small group discussions and seminars, prosections, appropriate laboratory work by students, student projects oriented to problem solving, audio-visual aids, computer-assisted instruction, and appropriate exposure to clinical situations are an integral part of this focus. Preclinical Core (first year) 1. Morphology and Clinical Correlates (Summer) This course includes the study of normal human morphology from sub-cellular, cellular, and organ levels to the individual as a whole with clinical material integrated into the organ system presentation. As this is their first exposure to medical school, students commence learning medical terminology during this quarter. 2. Function and Clinical Correlates (F) During this quarter students are exposed to all aspects of human function in its broadest sense, including both classical biochemistry and human physiology. These two disciplines are taught on an integrated basis by faculty under the administrative direction of their re\u00ad spective chairmen. 3. Interaction with the Environment and Clinical Correlates (W) Medical microbiology, immunology, and infectious diseases. During this part of the course, students are taught the fundamental aspects of microbiology and immunology in concert with the principles of infectious disease. Community and environmental medicine, biometrics and epidemiology, and patient inter viewing. The objective of this part of the course is to provide an understanding of the human organism's relationship to its environment. It is an integrated ins!ructional exercise between medical microbiology and community medicine. 4. Introduction to Disease and Introduction to Clinical Medicine (S) Pathology. This course correlates the theoretical aspects or\" disease mechanisms with practi\u00ad cal laboratory work, and an integrating influence of clinical pathology is used to give a verti\u00b7 cal view of disease mechanisms. UC IRVINE - 1972-1973COLLEGE OF MEDICINE 299 Pharmacology. Emphasis is on the mechanism of action of drugs at the organ or system level, since this is the level at which physicians use drugs; however, fundamental mechanisms are presented at whatever depth will be helpful to the physician. Introduction to patient care. Students receive instruction and practical experience in exam\u00b7 ining patients in preparation for the clinical clerkships in medicine, surgery, gynecology and obstetrics, pediatrics, and psychiatry. Clinical Core (second and third years) The clinical core consists of six quarters which may be taken in any order. During the clinical core, students work predominantly in hospitals and outpatient clinics. 1. Medicine and Its Correlates Both inpatients and outpatients are studied under appropriate supervision. Whenever possi\u00ad ble, students study the same patients intensively over a period of time, thus enabling them to develop an understanding of holistic medicine. 2. Surgery and Its Correlates Students study both outpatients, including those in the emergency room, and inpatients. This clerkship emphasizes diagnosis, pathophysiology, and general approaches to the treat\u00b7 ment of surgical patients, including the special problems of mass casualties, with the student becoming an integral part of the surgical team. 3. Pediatrics and Human Development and Correlates This quarter includes instruction in the handling of normal and sick infants and children as well as nutrition and relating with parents and other family members; normal development of the baby into childhood and adolescence; diagnosis of birth and developmental defects and general approaches to repair and/or rehabilitation; common infections predominant in infancy and childhoodi and peculiarities of the effects of medication in children. 4. Clinical Neurosciences and Psychiatry and Correlates During this quarter, each student's study of himself and his patients under adequate super\u00ad vision provides opportunities to learn about normal and abnormal human behavior. Students learn about interrelationships between psychological and physiological processes in both \"functional\" and organic disease. 5. Obstetrics, Gynecology, Reproduction, and Correlates In addition to medical and surgical gynecology, obstetrics, and anesthesia, each student studies the physical, psychological, emotional, and social aspects of the problems of human sexual life, marriage, reproduction, and population control. 6. Half-Quarter Core Elective To increase the flexibility of the core curriculum, each student is offered an elective oppor\u00b7 tunity early in his or her course of study. 7. Half-Quarter Clinical Course: Radiology and Pathology Students assume the role of the radiologist in his various functions, permitting them to thoroughly understand the potentialities of radiological sciences in diagnosis and therapy. \u00b7Students then assume the role of the pathologist in his various functions, with the objective of studying disease processes from the pathologist's viewpoint. Post-Core Electives (fourth year) The last year of the curriculum consists of four elective quarters, within the follow\u00ad ing broad categories: 1. Medicine, including its subspecialties, community medicine, and pediatrics 2. Surgery, including its subspecialties, anesthesia, and obstetrics and gynecology 3. Sciences basic to medicine, primarily in their laboratory and research aspects 4. A totally free elective, which may consist of additional work in any of the foregoing areas, study in other schools or campuses of the University, or other educational experience which satisfies the career needs of the student and is approved by his advisor UC IRVINE - 1972-1973300 COLLEGE OF MEDICINE The fourteen academic quarters will ordinarily be finished by the student in four calendar years, assuming that he takes two quarters for vacation (or for study out\u00ad side the M.D. curriculum). It is possible, however, for a student to finish his required courses in three and one-half calendar years by sacrificing his vacation quarters.
