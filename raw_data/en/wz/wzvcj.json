In such case, the Contractor shall give written notice to the SDOH and the LDSS within thirty (30) days from the date of the formal written notice of the modified Capitation Rates from the SDOH specifying the reasons for and effective date of termination. The effective date of termination shall be ninety (90) days from the date of the Contractor\u00b4s written notice, unless the SDOH determines that an orderly transfer of Enrollees to another MCO or disenrollment to Medicaid fee-for-service can be accomplished in fewer days. The terms and conditions of the Contractor\u00b4s approved phase-out plan must be accomplished prior to termination. 3.3 Rate Setting Methodology - Capitation Rates shall be determined prospectively and shall not be retroactively adjusted to reflect actual fee-for-service data or plan experience for the time period covered by the rates. - Capitated rates shall be certified to be actuarially sound in accordance with 42 CFR 438.6 (c). - Notwithstanding the provisions set forth in Section 3.3 (a) and (b) above, the SDOH reserves the right to terminate this Agreement in its entirety, or for specified counties of the Contractor\u00b4s service area, pursuant to Section 2.7 of this Agreement, upon determination by SDOH that the aggregate monthly Capitation Rates are not cost effective. 3.4 Payment of Capitation - The monthly capitation payments for each Enrollee are due to the Contractor from the Effective Date of Enrollment until the Effective Date of Disenrollment of the Enrollee or termination of this Agreement, whichever occurs first.

SDOH has the right to recover premiums from the Contractor in instances where the Enrollee was inappropriately enrolled into managed care with a retroactive effective date, or when the enrollment period was retroactively deleted in accordance with Appendix H. In any event, the State may only recover premiums paid for Medicaid Enrollees listed on a Roster if it is determined by the SDOH that the Contractor was not at risk for provision of Medicaid Services for any portion of the payment period. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the SDOH always has the right to recover duplicate Medicaid Advantage Plus premiums paid for persons enrolled under more than one Client Identification Number (CIN) in the Contractor\u00b4s Medicaid Advantage Plus Product whether or not the Contractor has made payments to providers. - The parties acknowledge and accept that the SDOH has the right to recover premiums paid to the Contractor for Enrollees listed on the monthly roster where the Contractor has failed to initiate involuntary disenrollment in accordance with the timeframes and requirements contained in Section 8 of this Agreement.

The LDSS is also responsible for making diligent efforts to determine if Enrollees have TPHI and to maintain third party information on the WMS/eMedNY Third Party Resource System. If TPHI coverage is known at the POS, the Plan shall use the TPHI information to coordinate benefits (e.g., alert the provider and ask them to bill the TPHI that should be primary to the Plan). - The Contractor shall make good faith efforts to coordinate benefits and must inform the LDSS of any known changes in status of TPHI insurance eligibility within five (5) business days of learning of a change in TPHI. The Contractor may use the Roster as one method to determine TPHI information. - Post Payment and Retroactive Recovery - The State, and/or its vendor, will also be vested with the responsibility to collect any reimbursement for Benefit Package services obtained from TPHI. In no instances may an Enrollee be held responsible for disputes over these recoveries. A recovery shall not exceed the encounter data paid claim amount. - The State will continue to identify available TPHI and post this information to the eMedNY System. The TPHI information will appear on the Contractor\u00b4s next roster and TPHI file. The Contractor will have six months from the later of the date the TPHI has been posted (eMedNY transaction date) or the Contractor\u00b4s claim payment date to pursue any recoveries for medical services. All recoveries outside this period will be pursued by the State. - For State-initiated and State-identified recoveries, the State will direct providers to refund the State directly. In those instances where the provider adjusted the recovery to the Contractor in error, the Contractor will refund the adjusted recovery to the State. - TPHI Reporting - The Contractor shall report TPHI activities through the Medicaid Encounter Data System (MEDS) and Medicaid Managed Care Operating Report (MMCOR) in accordance with instructions provided by SDOH. To prevent duplicative efforts, the Contractor shall, on a quarterly basis, share claim specific TPHI disposition (paid, denied, or recovered) information with the State. If no information is received from the Contractor, the State will assume there are no retroactive recoveries being pursued by the Contractor and will initiate recovery processing. 3.8 Other Insurance and Settlements - The Contractor is not allowed to pursue cost recovery against personal injury awards the Enrollee has received. Any recovery against these resources is to be pursued by the Medicaid program and the Contractor cannot take actions to collect these funds. Pursuit of Worker\u00b4s Compensation benefits and No-fault Insurance by the Contractor is authorized, to the extent that they cover expenses incurred by the Contractor. 3.9 Contractor Financial Liability - Contractor shall not be financially liable for any services rendered to an Enrollee prior to his or her Effective Date of Enrollment in the Contractor\u00b4s Medicaid Advantage Plus Product. 3.10 Spenddown and Net Available Monthy Income (NAMI) - Capitation rates will exclude all required spenddown and NAMI regardless of whether the Contractor collects the amounts. The Contractor shall report the spenddown and NAMI for each Enrollee in accordance with the time frames and in the format prescribed by the Department. 3.11 Prohibition on Payments to Institutions or Entities Located Outside of the United States - Effective no later than June 1, 2011, the Contractor is prohibited under Section 6505 of the federal Affordable Care Act, which amends Section 1902(a) of the Social Security Act, from making payments for Medicaid covered items or services to any financial institution or entity, such as provider bank accounts or business agents, located outside of the United States, District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands and American Samoa.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the SDOH always has the right to recover the MCO premiums paid for person who have concurrent enrollment in one or more MCO products under more than one Client Identification Number (CIN). Failure by the LDSS or entity designated by the State, to so notify the Contractor does not affect the right of the SDOH to recover the premium payment as authorized by Section 3.6 of this Agreement or for the State Attorney General to bring legal action to recover any overpayment. - Generally, the effective dates of Disenrollment are prospective. Effective dates for other than routine Disenrollments are described below: - Death of Enrollee - Effective Date of Disenrollment is the first day of the month after death. - Incarceration - Effective date of disenrollment is the first day of the month of incarceration (Note: The Contactor is at risk for covered services only to the date of incarceration and is entitled to capitation payments for the entire month in which the incarceration occurs. - Non-consensual Enrollment - Effective date of disenrollment is the first day of the month of Enrollment. - Enrollee moved outside of the District/County of Fiscal Responsibility - Effective date of disenrollment is the first day of the month after the update of the system with the new address In counties outside of New York City, the LDSS or entity designated by the State, should work together to ensure continuity of care through the Contractor if the Contractor\u00b4s service area includes the county to which the Enrollee has moved and the Enrollee, with continuous eligibility, wishes to stay enrolled in the Contractor\u00b4s plan. In New York City, Enrollees who move out of the Contractor\u00b4s Service Area, but not outside of the City of New York (e.g., move from one borough to another), will not be involuntarily disenrolled, but must request a Disenrollment or transfer.

Objectives| |Title II of the Americans With Disabilities Act (ADA) and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (Section 504) provides that no qualified individual with a disability shall, by reason of such disability, be excluded from participation in or denied access to the benefits of services, programs or activities of a public entity, or be subject to discrimination by such an entity. Public entities include State and local government and ADA and Section 504 requirements extend to all programs and services provided by State and local government. Since Medicaid is a government program, health services provided through Medicaid Managed Care, including Medicaid Advantage Plus, must be accessible to all who qualify for the program. | MCO responsibilities for compliance with the ADA are imposed under Title II and Section 504 when, as a contractor in a Medicaid program, a plan is providing a government service. If an individual provider under contract with the MCO is not accessible, it is the responsibility of the MCO to make arrangements to assure that alternative services are provided. The MCO may determine it is expedient to make arrangements with other providers, or to describe reasonable alternative means and methods to make these services accessible through its existing contractors. The goals of compliance with ADA Title II requirements are to offer a level of services that allows people with disabilities access to the program in its entirety, and the ability to achieve the same health care results as any program participant. MCO responsibilities for compliance with the ADA are also imposed under Title III when the MCO functions as a public accommodation providing services to individuals (e.g. program areas and sites such as marketing, education, member services, orientation, complaints and appeals). The goals of compliance with ADA Title III requirements are to offer a level of services that allows people with disabilities full and equal enjoyment of the goods, services, facilities or accommodations that the entity provides for its customers or clients. New and altered areas and facilities must be as accessible as possible. Whenever MCOs engage in new construction or renovation, compliance is also required with accessible design and construction standards promulgated pursuant to the ADA as well as State and local laws. Title III also requires that public accommodations undertake \"readily achievable barrier removal\" in existing facilities where architectural and communications barriers can be removed easily and without much difficulty or expense. The state uses Plan Qualification Standards to qualify MCOs for participation in the Medicaid Advantage Plus Program pursuant to the state\u00b4s responsibility to assure program access to all recipients, the Plan Qualification Standards require each MCO to submit an ADA Medicaid Advantage Plus Contract Compliance Plan that describes in detail how the MCO will make services, programs and activities readily accessible and useable by individuals with disabilities. In the event that certain program sites are not readily accessible, the MCO must describe reasonable alternative methods for making the services or activities accessible and usable. Title II of the Americans With Disabilities Act (ADA) and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (Section 504) provides that no qualified individual with a disability shall, by reason of such disability, be excluded from participation in or denied access to the benefits of services, programs or activities of a public entity, or be subject to discrimination by such an entity.

Title III also requires that public accommodations undertake \"readily achievable barrier removal\" in existing facilities where architectural and communications barriers can be removed easily and without much difficulty or expense. The state uses Plan Qualification Standards to qualify MCOs for participation in the Medicaid Advantage Plus Program. Pursuant to the state\u00b4s responsibility to assure program access to all recipients, the Plan Qualification Standards require each MCO to submit an ADA Compliance Plan that describes in detail how the MCO will make services, programs and activities readily accessible and useable by individuals with disabilities. In the event that certain program sites are not readily accessible, the MCO must describe reasonable alternative methods for making the services or activities accessible and usable. The objectives of these guidelines are threefold: |II. Definitions| | | |III. Scope of MCO Compliance Plan| |The MCO Compliance Plan must address accessibility to services at the MCO\u00b4s program sites, including both participating provider sites and MCO facilities intended for use by enrollee.| |IV. Program Accessibility| |Public programs and services, when viewed in their entirety, must be readily accessible to and useable by individuals with disabilities. This standard includes physical access, non-discrimination in policies and procedures and communication. Communications with individuals with disabilities are required to be as effective as communications with others. The MCO Compliance Plan must include a detailed description of how MCO services, programs and activities are readily accessible and usable by individuals with disabilities. In the event that full physical accessibility is not readily available for people with disabilities, the MCO Compliance Plan will describe the steps or actions the MCO will take to assure accessibility to services equivalent to those offered at the inaccessible facilities.| |IV. Program Compliance:| |Marketing staff, activities and materials will be made available to persons with disabilities. Marketing materials will be made available in alternative formats (such as Braille, large print, audio tapes) so that they are readily usable by people with disabilities.| |Suggested Methods for Compliance| | | |Compliance Plan |IV. Program Accessibility| |B. Member Services Department| |Member services functions include the provision to enrollees of information necessary to make informed choices about treatment options, to effectively utilize the health care resources, to assist enrollees in making appointments, and to field questions and complaints, to assist enrollees with the complaint process.| |B1. Accessibility| |Standard for Compliance:| |Member Services sites and functions will be made accessible to, and usable by, people with disabilities.| |Suggested Methods for Compliance (include, but are not limited to those identified below)| | | |Compliance Plan Submission| | | |IV. Program Enrollees with Disabilities| |Standard for Compliance:| |MCOs must have in place satisfactory methods/guidelines for identifying persons at risk of, or having, chronic diseases and disabilities and determining their specific needs in terms of specialist physician referrals, durable medical equipment, medical supplies, home health services etc. MCOs may not discriminate against a potential enrollee based on his/her current health status or anticipated need for future health care. MCOs may not discriminate on the basis of disability, or perceived disability of an enrollee or their family member.| |Suggested Methods for Compliance| | |Compliance for Compliance:| |Enrollees will be given information sufficient to ensure that they understand how to access medical care through the plan. This information will be made accessible to, and usable by, people with disabilities.| |Suggested Methods for Compliance| | | |Compliance Plan Appeals| |Standard for Compliance:| |The MCO will establish and maintain a procedure to protect the rights and interests of both enrollees and managed care plans by receiving, processing, and resolving complaints and appeals in an expeditious manner, with the goal of ensuring resolution of complaints/appeals and access to appropriate services as rapidly as possible. | All enrollees must be informed about the overall grievance system within their plan and the procedure for filing complaints and/or appeals. This information will be made available through the member handbook, the SDOH toll-free complaint line [1- (800) 206-8125] and the plan\u00b4s complaint process annually, as well as when the MCO denies a benefit or referral. The MCO will inform enrollees of: the MCO\u00b4s procedures; enrollees\u00b4 right to contact the local district or SDOH with a complaint, and to file an appeal or request a fair hearing; the right to appoint a designee to handle a complaint or appeal; the toll-free complaint line. The MCO will maintain designated staff to take and process complaints and be responsible for assisting enrollees in complaint resolution. The MCO will make all information regarding the grievance system available to and usable by people with disabilities and will assure that people with disabilities have access to sites where enrollees typically file complaints and requests for appeals. |Suggested Methods for Compliance| | | |Compliance Plan |Standard for Compliance:| |MCOs must have in place an adequate case management system to identify the service needs of all enrollees, including enrollees with chronic illness and enrollees with disabilities, and ensure that medically necessary covered benefits are delivered on a timely basis. In addition to the care management requirements identified in Section 10 of this Agreement, these systems must include procedures for standing referrals, specialists as PCPs, and referrals to specialty centers for enrollees who require specialized medical care over a prolonged period of time (as determined by a treatment plan approved by the MCO in consultation with the primary care provider, the designated specialist and the enrollee or his/her designee), out of plan referrals and continuation of existing treatment relationships with out-of-plan providers (during transitional period).| |Suggested Methods for Compliance| | |Compliance |Standard for Compliance:| |MCOs networks will include all the provider types necessary to furnish the benefit package, to assure appropriate and timely health care to all enrollees, including those with chronic illness and/or disabilities. Physical accessibility is not limited to entry to a provider site, but also includes access to services within the site, e.g. exam tables and medical equipment.| |Suggested Methods for Compliance| | | |Compliance Plan Submission| | | |IV. Program Health Care Needs| |Standard for Compliance:| |MCOs will have satisfactory methods for identifying persons at risk of, or having, chronic disabilities and determining their specific needs in terms of specialist physician referrals, durable medical equipment, medical supplies, home health services, etc. MCOs will have satisfactory systems for coordinating service delivery and, if necessary, procedures to allow continuation of existing relationships with out-of-network provider for course of treatment.| |Suggested Methods for Compliance| | | |Compliance Plan Submission| |A description of arrangements to ensure access to specialty care providers and centers in and out of New York State, standing referrals, specialist physicians to function as PCP, out of plan referrals, and continuation of existing relationships (out-of-plan) for diagnosis and treatment of rare disorders.| |V. ADDITIONAL ADA RESPONSIBILITIES FOR PUBLIC ACCOMMODATIONS| |Please note that Title III of the ADA applies to all non-governmental providers of health care. Title III of the Americans With Disabilities Act prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability in the full and equal enjoyment of goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages or accommodations of any place of public accommodation. A public accommodation is a private entity that owns, leases or leases to, or operates a place of public accommodation. Places of public accommodation identified by the ADA include, but are not limited to, stores (including pharmacies) offices (including doctors\u00b4 offices), hospitals, health care providers, and social service centers. | New and altered areas and facilities must be as accessible as possible. Barriers must be removed from existing facilities when it is readily achievable, defined by the ADA as easily accomplishable without much difficulty or expense. Factors to be considered when determining if barrier removal is readily achievable include the cost of the action, the financial resources of the site involved, and, if applicable, the overall financial resources of any parent corporation or entity. If barrier removal is not readily achievable, the ADA requires alternate methods of making goods and services available. New facilities must be accessible unless structurally impracticable. Title III also requires places of public accommodation to provide any auxiliary aids and services that are needed to ensure equal access to the services it offers, unless a fundamental alteration in the nature of services or an undue burden would result. Auxiliary aids include but are not limited to qualified sign interpreters, assistive listening systems, readers, large print materials, etc. Undue burden is defined as \"significant difficulty or expense\". The factors to be considered in determining \"undue burden\" include, but are not limited to, the nature and cost of the action required and the overall financial resources of the provider. \"Undue burden\" is a higher standard than \"readily achievable\" in that it requires a greater level of effort on the part of the public accommodation. Please note also that the ADA is not the only law applicable for people with disabilities. In some cases, State or local laws require more than the ADA. For example, New York City\u00b4s Human Rights Law, which also prohibits discrimination against people with disabilities, includes people whose impairments are not as \"substantial\" as the narrower ADA and uses the higher \"undue burden\" (\"reasonable\") standard where the ADA requires only that which is \"readily achievable\". New York City\u00b4s Building Code does not permit access waivers for newly constructed facilities and requires incorporation of access features as existing facilities are renovated. Finally, the State Hospital code sets a higher standard than the ADA for provision of communication (such as sign language interpreters) for services provided at most hospitals, even on an outpatient basis.

The kinds and amounts of required insurance are: - Certification Regarding Debarment and Suspension - Regulations of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, located at Part 76 of Title 45 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), implement Executive Orders 12549 and 12689 concerning debarment and suspension of participants in Federal program and activities. Executive Order 12549 provides that, to the extent permitted by law, Executive departments and agencies shall participate in a government wide system for non-procurement debarment and suspension. Executive Order 12689 extends the debarment and suspension policy to procurement activities of the Federal Government. A person who is debarred or suspended by a Federal agency is excluded from Federal financial and non-financial assistance and benefits under Federal programs and activities, both directly (primary covered transaction) and indirectly (lower tier covered transactions). Debarment or suspension by one Federal agency has government wide effect. - Pursuant to the above cited regulations, the SDOH (as a participant in a primary covered transaction) may not knowingly do business with a person who is debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or subject to other government wide exclusion (including an exclusion from Medicare and State health care program participation on or after August 25, 1995), and the SDOH must require its contractors, as lower tier participants, to provide the certification as set forth below: - CERTIFICATION REGARDING DEBARMENT, SUSPENSION, INELIGIBILITY AND VOLUNTARY EXCLUSION-LOWER TIER COVERED TRANSACTIONS Instructions for Certification - By signing this Agreement, the Contractor, as a lower tier participant, is providing the certification set out below. - The certification in this clause is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when this transaction was entered into. If it is later determined that the lower tier participant knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Federal Government, the department or agency with which this transaction originated may pursue available remedies, including suspension and/or debarment. - The lower tier participant shall provide immediate written notice to the SDOH if at any time the lower tier participant learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or had become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. - The terms covered transaction, debarred, suspended, ineligible, lower tier covered transaction, participant, person, primary covered transaction, principal, proposal, and voluntarily excluded, as used in this clause, have the meaning set out in the Definitions and Coverage sections of rules implementing Executive Order 12549. The Contractor may contact the SDOH for assistance in obtaining a copy of those regulations. - The lower tier participant agrees that it shall not knowingly enter into any lower tier covered transaction with a person who is proposed for debarment under 48 CFR Subpart 9.4, debarred, suspended, declared ineligible, or voluntarily excluded from participation in this covered transaction, unless authorized by the department or agency with which this transaction originated. - The lower tier participant further agrees that it will include this clause titled \"Certification Regarding Debarment, Suspension, Ineligibility and Voluntary Exclusion-Lower Tier Covered Transactions,\" without modification, in all lower tier covered transactions. - A participant in a covered transaction may rely upon a certification of a participant in a lower tier covered transaction that it is not proposed for debarment under 48 CFR 9.4, debarred, suspended, ineligible, or voluntarily excluded from covered transactions, unless it knows that the certification is erroneous. A participant may decide the method and frequency by which it determines the eligibility of its principals. Each participant may, but is not required to, check the Excluded Parties List System. - Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render in good faith the certification required by this clause. The knowledge and information of a participant is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. - Except for transactions authorized under paragraph E of these instructions, if a participant in a covered transaction knowingly enters into a lower tier covered transaction with a person who is proposed for debarment under 48 CFR Subpart 9.4, suspended, debarred, ineligible, or voluntarily excluded from participation in this transaction, in addition to other remedies available to the Federal Government, the department or agency with which this transaction originated may pursue available remedies, including suspension and/or debarment. - Certification Regarding Debarment, Suspension, Ineligibility and Voluntary Exclusion - Lower Tier Covered Transactions - The lower tier participant certifies, by signing this Agreement, that neither it nor its principals is presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, declared ineligible, or voluntarily excluded from participation in this transaction by any Federal department agency. - Where the lower tier participant is unable to certify to any of the statements in this certification, such participant shall attach an explanation to this Agreement. - CERTIFICATION REGARDING DEBARMENT, SUSPENSION, INELIGIBILITY AND VOLUNTARY EXCLUSION-LOWER TIER COVERED TRANSACTIONS - Reports and Publications - Any materials, articles, papers, etc., developed by the Contractor pertaining to the MMC Program or FHPlus Program must be reviewed and approved by the SDOH for conformity with the policies and guidelines of the SDOH prior to dissemination and/or publication. It is agreed that such review will be conducted in an expeditious manner.

The law applies to contracts where the total amount of such contractors\u00b4 sales delivered into New York State are in excess of $300,000 for the four quarterly periods immediately preceding the quarterly period in which the certification is made, and with respect to any affiliates and subcontractors whose sales delivered into New York State exceeded $300,000 for the four quarterly periods immediately preceding the quarterly period in which the certification is made. This law imposes upon certain contractors the obligation to certify whether or not the contractor, its affiliates, and its subcontractors are required to register to collect sales and compensating use tax and contractors must certify to DTF that each affiliate and subcontractor exceeding such sales threshold is registered with DTF to collect New York State and local sales and compensating use taxes.

Unless the information upon which the ST-220-TD is based changes, this form only needs to be filed once with DTF.

Contractor must complete and submit to the Department of Health the form ST-220-CA certifying that the contractor filed the ST-220-TD with DTF. Failure to make either of these filings may render an offerer non-responsive and non-responsible. Offerers shall take the necessary steps to provide properly certified forms within a timely manner to ensure compliance with the law. - M/WBE Utilization Plan for Subcontracting and Purchasing The Department of Health (DOH) encourages the use of Minority and/or Women Owned Business Enterprises (M/WBEs) for any subcontracting or purchasing related to this contract.

The amount must be stated in total dollars and as a percent of the total cost necessary to fulfill the Agreement requirements. Supportive documentation must include a detailed description of work that is required including products and services.

In order to assure a good-faith effort to attain this goal, the State requires that Contractors complete the M/WBE Utilization Plan and submit this Plan. Contractors that are New York State certified MBEs or WBEs are not required to complete this form. Instead, such Contractors must simply provide evidence of their certified status.
