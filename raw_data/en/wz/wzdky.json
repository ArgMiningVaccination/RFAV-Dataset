Associ Ation From the president: Flipping the script unconventional year By David Frisbie, DVM, Ph.D., DACVS, DACVSMR Despite immense, pandemic- induced challenges this year, your association has remained laser-focused on the horse and its members. The AAEP staff and volunteer members deserve kudos for maintaining all core services for members as well as a healthy financial balance. In addition, in every meeting in which I have par - ticipated this year, two central questions have guided discus - sions and decisions: What is best for the horse and what have our members told us they need or want? It is this dedication and focus that enabled us to make significant progress on strategic initiatives and turn the challenges of 2020 into opportunities for growth. AAEP strives to provide the best and most respected continuing education. Although the pandemic prevented us from hosting in-person events, launch of the Virtual CE Summer Series under program chair Dr. Sherry Johnson provided a new and needed outlet for members to obtain premier education. With over 250 participants and overwhelmingly positive reviews, the virtual event was a huge success. It also provided valuable insight into members' consumption of online content as well as a blueprint for this year's virtual convention and future CE opportunities. As the Educational Programs Committee wraps up the year, the ball is rolling to ensure your continuing education needs will be met with the same care to standards and personal safety in the upcoming year. Turning to the many unique circumstances facing our profession, the board of directors embarked on a multiyear effort to address the declining numbers of veterinary students pursuing equine practice and new equine practitioners staying in the profession beyond five years. The board formed a task force and approved funds to retain a consultant in an effort to use the mission model canvas, developed in part by Stanford University and utilized by numerous mission-focused organizations, to unpack the issues and validate the effectiveness of solutions addressing retention and recruitment of equine veterinarians. Look for this group to reach out to the membership as well as report out in 2021. Societal events in the United States and across the globe prompted the board to consider the role this association should be playing in ensuring diversity and inclusion in both equine practice and the association itself. Our commitment to these principles is strong, and a new Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Task Force was formed this fall. We eagerly anticipate the outcome of their efforts in 2021. Horse health and welfare is core to our mission and always a focus of our efforts. When racing came under intense scrutiny for equine injuries sustained in training and racing, particularly at Santa Anita, we saw the stake - holders, including many of our members, take bold steps to address safety issues. Not surprisingly, this effort included veterinarians stepping up to personally certify each horse's fitness to race. This initiative has moved the needle as Santa Anita reported zero fatalities during their autumn meet. I applaud the efforts of all involved for not only enduring the hard times but also rising up to implement novel measures for the wellbeing of those equine athletes. The Racing Committee also grappled with the federal legislation addressing uniform safety and medication standards in U.S. horseracing, keeping horse welfare at the forefront of discus - sions. While the Horseracing Integrity and Safety Act was not viewed as perfect, the veterinary expertise added to its governance structure helped it garner support from the committee and, ultimately, the board. The Performance Horse Committee also made significant strides, beginning with an in-depth outline of issues facing that sector, including medication-related concerns. The committee surveyed the membership to learn more about how various medications are used as well as to identify the most important areas to investigate further. Survey results are expected to be published in early 2021. Meanwhile, the Infectious Disease Committee has worked diligently to protect horse health while providing members and their clients with the information necessary to make thoughtful and educated decisions. This year alone, the committee issued revised guidelines for the administration of selected core and risk-based vaccines, and published new guidelines for Glanders, African horse continued on next pageDr. David Frisbie Societal events in the United States and across the globe prompted the board to consider the role this association should be playing in ensuring diversity and inclusion in both equine practice and the asso - ciation itself. EVENewsINSERT_12-20.indd 3 11/30/20 1:11 PMIV AAEP News December 2020 From the president, continuedAAEP Guidelines for Serology in Horses with Adverse Events from Vaccination is now available on the AAEP website. The guidelines are intended as a reference for veterinarians who wish to utilize serological testing to determine levels of circulating antibodies to specific pathogens in a horse that previously experienced an adverse vaccination event. The guidelines were developed by the AAEP Serology Guidelines Task Force composed of Drs. D. Craig Barnett, Beth Davis, Amanda House, Nicola Pusterla and W. David Wilson, and approved by the Infectious Disease Committee and board of directors. Guidelines are presented for core diseases Eastern equine encephalo - myelitis, Western equine encephalo - myelitis, risk-based diseases equine influenza, equine herpesvirus 1&4, and strangles. Interpretation and utilization of serologic data to guide vaccination decisions should be done with caution and with consideration of all other factors associated with occurrence of disease. These include but are not limited to risk of disease, consequences of disease, risk of systemic vaccine-associated adverse events, prior vaccination history, and data to support titer correlates to protection against the disease. It should be emphasized and recognized that circulating antibodies are only one component of a very complex immune system. Levels of circulating tetanus toxin binding antibody and rabies virus neutralizing antibody appear to correlate with protection in the horse. For most other vaccine antigens, the correlation between vaccine-induced serologic response and protection has either not been established or is not plausible based on the disease in question.

AAEP's charitable arm, The Foundation for the Horse, has continued to prioritize the welfare of the horse while taking giving to new levels under the leadership of Dr. Rick Mitchell. The response from The Foundation\u2014and from many AAEP members and others\u2014to the devastat - ing wildfires in the west and flooding along the Gulf Coast that impacted many horses and their caretakers in recent months has been uplifting and inspiring. Thank you to all the member and industry volunteers who stepped up, especially Keith Kleine, who coordinated The Foundation/AAEP's response, and Dr. Bill Moyer, who has long championed the importance of disaster preparedness. It has been quite a year. As I reflected on the final letters of my predecessors, a common theme arose: admiration and awe at the organization as a whole. Having now had that experience firsthand, I, too, stand back in admiration of our profession and the AAEP. I sincerely thank you for the opportunity to contribute. 1.

The question left unanswered by a veterinary practice act is at what point should a patient be referred? This is the point of ethical consideration that a referring veterinarian must navigate. Usually during the progression of a case, there is a tipping point that leads to case referral. Sometimes the tipping point is obvious, such as a colic that does not respond to treatment in the field; but sometimes it is inapparent, causing a delay in referral and possibly costing a client precious time and money without a diagnosis or definitive treatment. Referral of a horse may be one of the most terrifying things a horse owner ever experiences, or it may be a regular occurrence. As such, the ethical obligation of the referring veterinarian should be to educate the client as best they can by laying out the processes that will occur upon referral. The referring veterinarian also may have to make the decision to refer based on the best interests of the patient. Will the horse survive the 5-hour trailer ride to a hospital? Is it humane to refer a horse with a clearly terminal disease, such as a ruptured viscus? These are choices that often need to be made by the veterinarian, but they must be made in conjunction with the client who owns the animal. Referring veterinarians should develop collegial relation - ships with referral practices so they can make well- informed decisions on when to refer a case. Furthermore, it is important that lack of funds, perceived or real, not be a reason for delay of recommendation of referral. Failure to offer timely referral could be considered malpractice. Upon referral, it is critical to remember that the referring veterinarian has the primary relationship with the client and the patient. But what are you ethically obligated to provide a client and patient during a referral? Most veterinary practice acts are not explicit on requirements of referral of an animal to another veterinarian. However, you are ethically responsible for the care of the animal until the point of referral, at which point you are obligated to communicate with the referral practice any data acquired on the case and any treatments administered prior to referral (not a week later). The act of referring a case and the data that is communicated to the practice accepting the referral is encompassed in that practice's medical record. Therefore, accuracy and timeliness of case data are important for the referral practice to maintain medical records for purposes of accreditation or licensure. Veterinarians who accept referrals are also held to ethical standards\u2014they must abide by the AVMA Principles of Veterinary Medical Ethics (accessible at https://tinyurl. com/pvmeavma). The veterinarian who accepts a referral has an ethical obligation to keep the referring veterinarian apprised of the progression of the case and return the case to them when it is resolved. A veterinarian who has accepted a referral should only provide services or treatments relative to the condition for which the referral was made and should consult with the referring veterinari - an if additional services or treatments become necessary. Communication between the referring veterinarian and the referral veterinarian needs to take place, ideally in advance of a referral situation, so that the expectations are clear with both parties. Indeed, if a referring veterinarian is capable of performing a procedure in-house, should the referral veterinarian even accept the case? Public referral practices, such as teaching hospitals, are ethically bound to not only accept referral cases, but to also be prepared to educate referring veterinarians where appropriate. In teaching hospitals where there is a significant rotation of caregivers (i.e., veterinary students) for any given case, it is critical that patient confidentiality is maintained. This is a learning outcome that should be addressed on every equine rotation in a teaching environment. Hospitals should strive to maintain patient confidentiality so thoroughly that even the horse's name is not written on the exterior of the stall where other clients might see. Lastly, veterinarians on both ends of the referral spectrum are ethically bound to provide the best treatment to their patients, whether it be by themselves or a veterinarian to whom they refer the case. Veterinarians are ethically bound to help clients make informed decisions about their patient's care and quality of life. In the perfect referral situation, both the patient and the client come out as winners regardless of the case outcome.

The following day, the leadership of the organization suspended Dr. C's membership. Soon after, an AAEP member filed a member-on-member complaint against Dr. C with the Professional Conduct & Ethics Committee pertaining to this incident. Per committee procedures, a letter of inquiry was sent to Dr. C asking for their account of what occurred. Dr. C did not respond in writing, as is required, but did call and leave an angry message with the AAEP office. Following committee deliberation, it was decided to give Dr. C another chance to respond to the committee's inquiry. A second letter was sent to Dr. C, who did not respond within the prescribed 30-day period. At this point, the committee recommended to the AAEP board that Dr. C's membership be suspended until such time as Dr. C agrees to meet with the committee on this issue. Outcome: Dr. C's AAEP membership was suspended indefinitely until such time as they agree to meet with the Professional Conduct & Ethics Committee.Ethics in actionEtHics Whether you're an associate seeking a new opportunity or a practice owner seeking qualified candidates for an open position, the AAEP Career Center will help you make a career connection.

EVENewsINSERT_12-20.indd 12 11/30/20 1:11 PMHighlights of recent clinically relevant papers Blood sampling in foals This study by Chiara Del Prete and colleagues in Italy compared venous blood gas parameters from samples collected by a push-pull technique through a jugular catheter with those sampled by direct jugular venipuncture in 17 hospitalised foals. Three different techniques for drawing a blood sample from a catheter are described: the discard, the reinfusion, and the push-pull methods. The push-pull technique avoids the loss of blood associated with the discard method and reduces the risk of contamination associated with the reinfusion method. A 10 mL syringe was used to aspirate a volume of blood equal to three times the dead space volume of a 16 gauge catheter and extension set (total 2.4 mL). This was immediately reinfused into the vein without disconnecting the syringe. This procedure was repeated three times before connecting a 1 mL heparinised syringe to collect venous blood. A 20 gauge 1-inch needle and 1 mL syringe were used to obtain a blood sample from the contralateral jugular vein. There was a high level of agreement between the results obtained by the two sampling methods at both 0 and 24 h for almost all parameters except haematocrit and PVO values. The push-pull technique is an acceptable method for obtaining blood samples for venous blood gas analysis in foals and avoids repeated needle sticks. A manual PCV should be performed in place of haematocrit measurement. Phenylbutazone and gastric ulcers This experimental study by Megan Ricord and colleagues at Louisiana State University, USA, evaluated the effect of omeprazole on phenylbutazone-induced equine gastric ulcer syndrome (EGUS) in adult horses. Twenty-two with equine glandular gastric disease (EGGD) and equine squamous gastric disease (ESGD) scores 2 were divided into three groups: PBZ group (8 horses) received 4.4 mg/kg of oral phenylbutazone every 12 h; PBZ/OME group received the same phenylbutazone dose plus 4 mg/kg of oral omeprazole every 24 h (8 horses); and the control group (CON) consisted of six horses. Horses were treated for up to 14 days and gastroscopy was performed every 7 days. A CBC was performed at the beginning and end of the study period. Five horses did not complete the trial due to intestinal complications (3 PBZ/OME and 2 PBZ). Median EGGD score increased in the PBZ group compared to the PBZ/OME group over the study period. No difference was seen in ESGD scores between the two groups. Serum albumin concentration decreased in the PBZ group compared to the CON group over the course of the study. There was no signi cant difference in albumin concentration between the PBZ/OME and the CON groups. In the PBZ/OME group, 6/8 horses developed intestinal complications, compared to 2/8 in the PBZ group and 0/6 in the CON group. These complications were fatal in two of the horses in the PBZ/OME group. Although concurrent omeprazole reduced the severity of EGGD, caution should be exercised when co-prescribingphenylbutazone and omeprazole in horses, especially with a concurrent change in management. Computer-assisted orthopaedic surgery In this retrospective study Mathieu de Preux and colleagues in Switzerland described clinical applications of computer- assisted orthopaedic surgery (CAOS) in horses with a navigation system coupled with a cone beam computed tomography unit. A search of medical records for horses that underwent CAOS between 2016 and 2019 identi ed 13 adult horses. Data including signalment, diagnosis, lameness grade prior to surgery, surgical technique and complications, anaesthesia and surgery time, and perioperative case management and outcome were retrieved. Surgical implants were placed in the proximal phalanx, third metatarsal bone, ulna, or medial femoral condyle in 10 cases. Navigated transarticular drilling was performed to promote ankylosis of the distal tarsal joints in one case. An articular fragment of the middle phalanx was removed with CAOS guidance in one case. A focal osteolytic lesion of the calcaneal tuber was curetted with the aid of CAOS in the nal case. A purpose-built frame was used for the surgical procedure in seven cases. All surgeries were performed successfully and according to the preoperative plan. Computer-assisted orthopaedic surgery can be an integral part of the clinical case management in equine surgery. Once equine surgeons have become familiar with the operational principles, CAOS can be readily applied for a broad spectrum of indications. Endotoxaemia in donkeys This study by Francisco Javier Mendoza Garcia and colleagues in Spain examined the pathophysiology and gene expression associated with experimentally induced endotoxaemia, and evaluated the effects of meloxicam on endotoxaemia in donkeys and in equine monocyte cultures. Endotoxaemia was induced in six healthy adult female donkeys by an i.v. infusion of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) for 30 min. Animals received either 20 mL of saline or 0.6 mg/kg of meloxicam i.v. after LPS infusion. Blood samples were collected serially for haematology, serum biochemistry, interleukin measurement, and leukocyte gene expression analysis. Monocyte cultures were used to test the effects of meloxicam on LPS-activated monocytes. Lipopolysaccharide induced fever, leukopenia, and neutropenia of similar magnitude in both groups, but meloxicam attenuated increases in plasma lactate, tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF a), and interleukin 1 bconcentrations compared to controls. No differences were detected between groups for cytokine mRNA expression. Furthermore, meloxicam decreased TNF arelease in LPS-activated monocyte cultures. Meloxicam could be a feasible option for the treatment of endotoxaemia and SIRS in donkeys. Additional studies are necessary to investigate possible meloxicam-related post- transcriptional regulation and to compare this drug with \u00a92020 EVJ Ltd618 after castration This study by Francielli Gobbi and colleagues in Brazil evaluated and compared the ef cacy of flunixin meglumine (FM), rocoxib (FX), and meloxicam (MX) after castration of horses. Thirty horses undergoing open castration were divided into three groups (n =10) depending on the anti- inflammatory drug administered: Group I (FM, 1.1 mg/kg bwt, i.v., once a day for 5 days); Group II (FX, 0.1 mg/kg bwt, i.v., once a day for 5 days), and Group III (MX, 0.6 mg/kg bwt, i.v., once a day for 5 days). Clinical, behavioural, and haematological parameters and the peritoneal fluid (PF) were evaluated before and 1, 2, 3, 5, and 7 days after castration. Post-operatively, scores of limb rigidity and prepuce oedema in Groups II and III were greater than those of Group I. Tachycardia was observed in Groups II and III and hyperthermia in Group III. An increase in the number of leukocytes, neutrophils, and monocytes, below the reference values, and hyper brinogenaemia was observed in Groups I (Day 7), Group II (Days 1-7), and Group III (Day 7). Serum protein was reduced after castration, together with an increase of this in the PF of all three groups. The PF on Day 0 was straw yellow and limpid, became reddish and cloudy on Day 1, then gradually moved toward its normal colour without returning to normal on Day 7 in any of the groups. Castration triggers signi cant clinical and laboratory changes and FM, FX, and MX are equally effective in controlling pain and in flammation in horses after castration; however, FM was more advantageous. Knotless barbed sutures This study by Ditte Marie Top Adler and colleagues in Denmark compared a bidirectional absorbable knotless barbed suture (KBS) with a conventional smooth suture (SS) for closure of inguinal castration surgical wounds in the horse. Bilateral inguinal castration was performed on 45 horses (21 KBS and 24 SS). Suturing time as well as the short-term and post-discharge complications were evaluated. At 24 h minor swelling occurred in 29% of KBS horses and 33% of SS horses. Cutaneous dehiscence during recovery occurred in two horses of each group. Post-discharge complications ocurred in three horses (scrotal swelling (KBS); wound exudation (SS) and wound dehiscence after return to pasture (SS)). Wound closure was achieved 6 min faster with KBS than with SS. Use of the KBS suture did not result in increased occurrence of post-operative complications. Wound closure was faster with KBS than with SS in equine bilateral inguinal castration. These results show that KBS can safely be used in the horse following bilateral inguinal castrations without adverse effects and with a reduction in suturing time. African horse sickness vaccination In this study Marina Rodr /C19guez and colleagues in Dubai evaulated the immune response of horses to inactivated African horse sickness (AHS) vaccines.A total of 29 horses in two groups were vaccinated. Group 1 consisted of 18 horses which were further divided into nine subgroups of two horses. These horses were individually immunised with one of 1 to 9 AHS serotypes. Group 2 consisted of 11 horses that were immunised with all nine serotypes simultaneously with two different vaccinations, one containing serotypes 1, 4, 7, 8 and 9, and the other containing serotypes 2, 3, 5 and 6. The duration of this study was 12 months. Blood samples were periodically withdrawn for serum antibody tests using ELISA and VNT and for 2 weeks after each vaccination for PCR and virus isolation. After the booster vaccination, 27 horses seroconverted; however, two horses responded poorly as measured by ELISA. In Group 1 ELISA and VN antibodies declined between 5 - 7 months post-vaccination. After 12 months the antibody levels in most of the horses decreased to the seronegative range until the annual booster where all horses again seroconverted strongly. In Group 2, ELISA antibodies were positive after the rst booster and VN antibodies started to appear for some serotypes after primary vaccination. After booster vaccination, VN antibodies increased in a different pattern for each serotype. Antibodies remained high for 12 months and increased strongly after the annual booster in 78% of the horses. PCR and virus isolation results remained negative. These results indicated that horses vaccinated with single serotypes need a booster after 6 months and simultaneously immunised horses after 12 months. No challenge infection could be carried out as facilities were not available. S. WRIGHT EVE Editorial Of ce References Adler, D.M.T., \u00d8stergaard, S., J\u00f8rgensen, E. and Jacobsen, S.

Delph, E. R. Perryand S. J. Valberg Kansas State University Veterinary Health Center, Manhattan, Kansas; andMichigan State University Diagnostic Center for Population and Animal Health, Lansing, Michigan, USA *Corresponding Vanner stallion was presented for evaluation of intermittent recumbency, muscle fasciculations, weakness, low head carriage, shifting of weight between the hindlimbs and an elevated tail head post breeding accident ( Fig 1 ). Initial diagnostics revealed leukocytosis characterised hypochloraemia, and elevated muscle enzymes. Serum a- tocopherol concentrations (results not available until Day 6 of hospitalisation) were critically low at 0.9 lg/mL (r.r. 2 -4). History, physical examination and serum a-tocopherol concentrations were highly suggestive of vitamin E de ciency and equine motor neuron disease (EMND), and a-tocopherol therapy was initiated. Sacrocaudalis dorsalis medialis muscle biopsy (obtained on Day 4 of hospitalisation) results were not available until Day 16 after presentation. Prominent mononuclear and rare polymorphonuclear cells surrounding and invading myo bres were evident in the biopsy. Numerous sarcocysts that resembled Sarcocystis fayeri were present both within and separate from areas of in flammation ( Fig 2 ). Muscle bre sizes were generally decreased but there were no angular atrophied bres that would be indicative of neurogenic atrophy and EMND. Thus, the con rmed diagnosis was severe myositis secondary to sarcocystosis and vitamin E de ciency. Aggressive treatment with a-tocopherol, ponazuril (6 weeks duration) and sulfadiazine/pyrimethamine (4 months duration) resulted in signi cant improvement in muscle weakness and body condition, with resolution of sarcocystosis and in flammation onrepeat muscle biopsy 6 months later. Four other horses on the property also had evidence of anaemia and low serum vitamin E levels and were serially monitored for the development of similar clinical signs of sarcocystosis. This case illustrates the importance of muscle biopsy in horses with neuromuscular disease, as concurrent diseases may be present that require speci c treatment for a positive outcome. Key points \u0081Symmetric muscle atrophy, weakness, and critically low serum a-tocopherol are highly suggestive of vitamin E de ciency-related disorders such as EMND, but muscle histopathology is necessary to make a denitive diagnosis. \u0081The concomitant presence of both a large number of sarcocysts and mononuclear and polymorphonuclear cell in ltrates in the sacrocaudalis muscle of the horse is suggestive of sarcocystis myositis being a concurrent, if not primary, underlying cause of muscle pain, weakness and malaise. \u0081Diagnosis and resolution of such clinical cases is best achieved by assessing a-tocopherol status, evaluation of sacrocaudalis muscle histopathology and aggressive, combined, long-term therapy.

L. Elane *, E. M. Corbin, L. Reigand J. A. Brown Marion DuPont Scott Equine Medical Center, Virginia-Maryland Regional College of Veterinary Medicine, Virginia Polytechnic and State University, Leesburg, Virginia; andThe Joint Pathology Center, Silver Spring, mare presented for computed tomography (CT) of the head following a 4-year history of sensitivity, pruritis and rubbing the left side of the face. Three months prior to presentation, swelling at the infraorbital foramen developed, and the mare began to self-mutilate the area and head-shake. Referral radiographs showed extensive lysis of the left maxilla and both compartments of the left maxillary sinus; however, both infraorbital canals appeared normal. Temporary improvement was seen following oral doxycycline and topical steroid application. On presentation, the mare was bright and alert, in fair body condition (BCS 4/9), with moderate hirsutism and poor coat quality. Physical examination revealed left masseter and temporalis atrophy, submandibular left palpebrum, enophthalmos and an absent menace response. Moderate left-sided facial nerve paralysis and multiple super cial abrasions were present on the left facial crest and medial canthus. CT imaging showed soft tissue attenuation within the maxillary sinuses, involving the infraorbital canal ( Fig 1a ).Deviation and lysis of the infraorbital canal was evident from the maxillary foramen to the infraorbital foramen, with extensive lysis maxilla, alveolar bone and facial crest. Bony was present in the ventral nasal concha, left nasal bone and left side of the hard palate. Soft tissue swelling was present lateral to the infraorbital foramen; no evidence of lysis or soft tissue expansion was evident surrounding the optic chiasm, or the orbital ssure containing the oculomotor, trochlear, abducens left maxillary neoplasia with extensive lysis, consistent with soft tissue sarcoma, brosarcoma or chondrosarcoma. The mare was euthanised, and a post-mortem examination revealed a proliferative tan soft tissue mass overlying the infraorbital nerve ( Fig 1b ). The mass was easily separated from the infraorbital nerve and did not appear to inltrate the nerve on gross examination. A histopathologic diagnosis of pleomorphic sarcoma with giant cells was made. Immunohistochemical analysis failed to fully elucidate the mesenchymal cell of origin of the sarcoma. Pleomorphic sarcoma with giant cells involving the infraorbital canal of the horse has not been previously described. While inflammation of the infraorbital canal has been associated with head-shaking and self-mutilation, the unusual histomorphologic characteristics of this sarcoma with marked pleomorphism and giant cells make this case unique. This case highlights chronic subtle behavioural changes attributable to this neoplasm prior to development of overt clinical signs and the utility of advanced imaging in the diagnosis. Key points \u0081Pleomorphic sarcoma with giant cells in ltrating the infraorbital canal was diagnosed in an aged Thoroughbred mare. \u0081Standing CT was found to be superior to radiography in identifying the extent of the neoplasm. \u0081Subtle clinical signs (head-shaking, pruritis, facial sensitivity) should be investigated early, and neoplasia should be considered as a differential diagnosis. a) b) Fig 1: a) Coronal CT image of the skull.

A. Canola, D. da Grac /C223a Macoris, G. M. Bueno, D. J. de Queiroz and J. A. Marques Department of Veterinary Clinic and Surgery, School of Agricultural and Veterinarian Sciences, S ~ao Paulo State University American Quarter Horse stallion presented at the veterinary hospital with a 6-h clinical history of abdominal discomfort, after being kept with a mare for breeding purposes. On physical examination, the stallion showed signs of abdominal discomfort. Conjunctival and oral mucous membranes were slightly hyperaemic with a capillary re ll time of 3 s. There was no spontaneous re flux on nasogastric intubation. On visual inspection, the right testicle was retracted in relation to the contralateral but no external wound was visible. During palpation, the right side of the scrotum was cold to the touch and the anatomical structures could not be identi ed due to its rm consistency. The patient exhibited severe discomfort on palpation. Intravenous sedation was given, and 15 min after, the patient was painful again. Transrectal palpation was performed, and a structure that could not be differentiated from an intestinal segment wasidenti ed over the right internal inguinal ring. Peritoneal fluid, collected as part of the colic emergency protocol, was serosanguinous, and the laboratory analysis results were consistent with a haemoperitoneum. Testicular ultrasonography failed to reveal any abnormalities of the testicular parenchyma. Based on clinical and laboratorial ndings and suspicion of inguinoscrotal herniation, the patient was referred for exploratory celiotomy. Further analysis of the images obtained from the ultrasound showed a large intra-testicular haematoma over the right testicle. Exploration of the abdominal cavity revealed haemoperitoneum with normal anatomical positioning of the viscera and no signs of intestinal incarceration through the right internal inguinal ring. A second incision over the right testicle revealed an extensive haematocele within the vaginal tunic, which was incised, showing a longitudinal rupture through the testicular parenchyma ( Fig 1 ). Unilateral orchiectomy was performed, and the midline incision was closed. Clinical signs of abdominal discomfort were not perceived during the post- operative period, and the horse was discharged on day 10.

Van Ongeval, N. van de Velde\u00a7, E. Raes\u00b6and M. Oosterlinck* Department of Surgery and Anaesthesiology of Domestic Animals, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Ghent University;Department of Large Animal Internal Medicine, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Ghent University; \u00a7Department of Pathology, Bacteriology and Poultry Diseases, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Ghent University; and\u00b6Department of Veterinary Medical Imaging and Small Animal Orthopaedics, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Ghent gelding was presented with chronic right hind lameness with abduction of the limb during the swing phase, and several small multifocal, black nodules at the base of the tail, the preputium and the penis. Diagnostic analgesia including perineural and intra-articular blocks up to the sti fle was negative. Rectal palpation revealed a small mass (293 cm) at the level of the lumbosacral region. Ultrasonographically (Esaote MyLab Class C with a rectal probe of 5.5 -7.5 MHz), the mass presented a heterogeneous, hyperechoic echogenicity and measured approximately 2 - 3 cm in thickness. There was no clear delineation between the mass and the wall of the iliac vein. The bone surfaces appeared intact. The mass displaced the aorta and the external and internal iliac arteries. Moreover, the internal iliac artery seemed interrupted or at least deviated where it came in contact with the mass at the level of the mid-ventral aspect of the sixth lumbar vertebra. Doppler imaging (5.6 MHz) showed turbulences in the iliac a rtery just cranial to the mass. Post-mortem examination revealed a poorly demarcated black mass (approximately 1 kg; 20 915910 cm) at the cranial part of the right ilium, close to the iliac vein and artery. Additionally, there were multinodular in ltrative, nonencapsulated intramural black masses of approximately 4 x 3 cm, bulging into the lumen of the iliac vein ( Fig 1 ). The surrounding lymph nodes were swollen and contained black pigmentation. Histological examination of the mass close to the iliac vein con rmed the presumptive diagnosis of a melanoma. In contrast with the fact that melanomas are frequently diagnosed in daily veterinary practice, lameness associated with this neoplasm has been reported infrequently. The vascular compression and in ltrative growth of the melanoma in the iliac vessels may have resulted in decreased muscular perfusion of the hind limb, with secondary ischaemia, pain and lameness. It cannot be excluded that the mass also resulted in compression of nerves (e.g. femoral nerve), or periosteum, which could also have caused lameness. The main differential diagnoses were intra-vascular in ltrative growth of a melanoma or another neoplastic mass, intra-vascular thrombosis, or less probably haematoma formation or abscessation. The chronic, progressive lameness in the absence of fever or weight loss,and multifocal melanomas at various other locations, resulted in a melanoma being considered most likely. Rectal palpation severely underestimated the size of the mass (2 93c m v s . 20915910 cm on post -mortem examination). Key points \u0081Intra-pelvic malignant melanoma is a rare cause of chronic, progressive lameness, and should be considered especially in grey, middle-aged horses with melanomas at other locations, when other causes of lameness have been excluded using diagnostic analgesia. \u0081Vascular compression and in ltrative growth of the melanoma in the iliac vessels may result in ischaemia, pain and lameness. \u0081The size of the mass may be underestimated by rectal palpation. Fig 1: Macroscopic view of the multinodular, in ltrative, nonencapsulated, black-pigmented mass surrounding the iliac vein and artery, with multinodular masses bulging into the lumen of the vein Commentary Melanocytic tumours in horses K. E. Sullins* Midwestern University College of Veterinary Medicine, Glendale, Arizona, will develop at least one melanocytic tumour if they live long enough (McFadyean 1933). Histopathology and clinical features de ne three or four clinical types (depending upon source) of melanocytic tumours (Valentine 1995; Knottenbelt et al . 2015b). Whiter or lighter grey horses seem to be more susceptible, while darker grey, dappled or flea-bitten grey horses tend to be less affected. Valentine reported a series of 29 melanocytic nevi (Valentine 1995). Horses of all colours with a mean age of 5 years were affected by solitary masses in a variety of sites. Histologically, the pigmented masses are located at the dermoepidermal junction (Valentine 1995). Excision was generally curative. Foley et al . (1991) described 18 horses with occurrences before 2 years of age with similar outcomes. Dermal melanoma and dermal melanomatosis are histologically identical in that the pigmented masses are located in the deep dermis (Valentine 1995). Isolated single or multiple discrete lesions are termed dermal melanoma, whereas multiple coalescing lesions are considered dermal melanomatosis. Dermal melanoma is generally seen in younger mature horses, while dermal melanomatosis was found in horses over 15 years old in one series (Valentine 1995). Some (including this author) consider the two presentations as stages of a single type (Moore et al . 2013; Knottenbelt et al . 2015b). Isolated lesions may occur in more variable sites, but both types are heavily pigmented masses with predilections for tail, perineum, perianus, Subjectively, these favoured sites seem to facilitate larger or multiple growth into dermal melanomatosis. Older horses with dermal melanomatosis are more likely to have distant or internal metastases (Valentine 1995) which makes sense since time would allow more opportunity for spread. However, melanocytic tumours have been reported in almost every external and internal location in horses. In this issue, an internal pelvic melanoma dispersed itself around the iliac artery and invaded the iliac vein resulting in hindlimb lameness (Van Ongeval et al . 2020). Anecdotally, the author has also observed hindlimb to diffuse proximal perineural impingement by melanocytic tumours. Smaller lesions typically cause no clinical signs. Larger tumours may obstruct the rectum or prepuce and parotid melanomas can limit neck flexion or impinge upon the upper airway (Moore et al . 2013; Groom and Sullins 2018). Necrosis of the tumour and the overlying skin may result in substantial open wounds with a tarry black discharge and bleeding (Moore et al . 2013). Anaplastic malignant melanoma presents a completely different clinical picture and possibly should not be included in discussion of the previous melanocytic tumours. Thesefortunately uncommon tumours usually affect ageing non- grey horses. Pigmentation is variable and they are often not black at all. Reports and the author 's experience indicate the tail and tail head to be sites predilection ( Fig 1a ; Valentine 1995; Knottenbelt et al . 2015b). Isolated skin lesions can respond to wide excision (Knottenbelt et al . 2015a) but typical lesions subjectively seem to have metastasised by the time of diagnosis and are almost universally fatal ( Fig 1b ). Separating reports of these tumours in the literature from metastatic/malignant-behaving dermal melanoma/ melanomatosis can be a challenge. Veterinarians worldwide daily face treating hundreds of horses with dermal melanoma/melanomatosis. For these tumours, this author has struggled with the terms 'malignant ' and 'metastatic '. The term benign describes a histologically well-differentiated cell type that is not prone to invasion of surrounding tissue or distant metastasis. The term malignant describes a less differentiated (more anaplastic) cell type that is prone to invasion of surrounding tissue, post-operative recurrence and distant metastasis (Knottenbelt et al . 2015c). Metastatic tumour typically has a primary source. So, with multifocal/disseminated melanoma, which (of the possibly many sites) was the primary location? Should it follow that all distant/internal foci are evidence of malignancy? Size has been related to malignancy. One report stated that benign melanomas were generally <4 cm in diameter (Valentine 1995). Another proposed that all dermal melanomas be labelled 'equine malignant melanoma 'and staged (1 -4) by factoring size, number, rate of growth and the presence of distant lesions. Lesions >4 cm in diameter were de ned as stage 4 equine malignant melanoma (Moore et al . 2013). Many sources would consider nondermal internal melanocytic masses metastatic and/or malignant by their location and behaviour (MacGillivray et al . 2002; Moore et al . 2013). Approximately 22 of 38 resected melanocytic tumours 4-20 cm in diameter were nondermal cervical, thoracic inlet, perirectal) masses, but none recurred and no systemic growth acceleration followed (Groom and Sullins 2018). So, is it possible to have 'benign 'metastases? Because surgery or other treatments successfully address so many lesions, this author opposes labelling dermal melanoma/melanomatosis as malignant unless histologically proven (Groom and Sullins 2018). Compelling evidence for a 'primary 'source for distant metastases is an unpublished long-term prospective study comparing surgical excision of dermal melanomas upon discovery to leaving them alone. Of thirty- ve 2- to 4-year-old light grey horses, 30 underwent surgical removal of every detectible dermal melanoma as it appeared until age 22. Eighteen horses reached age 22 with the others succumbing \u00a92019 EVJ Ltd624 EQUINE 624-630 doi: 10.1111/eve.13159to unrelated conditions. None of the 18 had detectable evidence of melanocytic lesions, and none was destroyed for reasons of melanoma. Four horses in the treatment group that later died and underwent necropsy had no internal melanocytic lesions. The untreated control group consisted of ve horses whose owners had refused surgery on the belief that surgery would make the tumours worse. One died of an unrelated cause while another developed dermal melanoma and the owner insisted that it be removed. The three remaining unoperated horses were subjected to euthanasia between 15 and 20 years of age due to unacceptable melanoma growth (D. Knottenbelt, personal communication 2019). While larger numbers and more necropsies would have improved the study, the consistent results bear consideration. Although the primary source lesion was still not strictly identi ed, the study supports reduction of tumour load and illustrates signi cance of each dermal melanoma (Mooreet al . 2013). Further, this and other evidence (Groom and Sullins 2018) should dispel the notion that removal of dermal melanoma/melanomatosis activates the tumour process (Frank 1959). Excision has been reported to be curative for melanocytic nevi and small dermal melanomas but is a controversial option for larger tumours (Valentine 1995). Some have suggested that surgical excision of large tumours is not possible (Moore et al . 2013; Phillips and Lembcke 2013). For amenable cases, this author considers resection of individual tumours to be de nitive and the process is over sooner than some other less invasive procedures. Thirty-eight horses underwent resection of super cial and deep melanocytic lesions 4 -20 cm in diameter with no recurrence or new local growth for a mean of 39-month follow-up period (Groom and Sullins 2018). Some authors would have considered some of those lesions inoperable. Case selection for resection of tumours is important. Rate of tumour growth and horse 's age are important considerations in that (for example) a 10-cm tail base/ perianal tumour with additional internal perirectal masses may be left alone in a 20-year-old horse whereas surgery becomes more advisable for a 10-year-old horse due to potential growth and complications throughout the horse 's remaining lifetime. Proximity to critical anatomic structures and extensive necrosis or ulceration also factor into the decision-making process. External lesions would usually be dermal melanomatosis, whereas internal lesions would be considered metastatic melanomas from one of the external 'primary 'locations. However, solitary deeper lesions do occur (Groom and Sullins 2018). Histology is not predictive of tumour dissemination (MacGillivray et al . 2002), and it is generally accepted that the diagnosis of melanocytic tumours in horses can be reliably made from gross appearance and signalment (Knottenbelt 2016). These tumours are usually located at the intradermal and/or (possibly deep) subcutaneous level and have variably well-de ned margins (Knottenbelt et al . 2015b). General comment on surgical resection of a few speci c types of melanomas may be useful. Perianal, perineal, perivaginal and ventral tail locations are the most common presentations in grey horses. Small dermal melanomas readily respond to complete removal by almost any means. Surgical excision of all the black tissue and simple wound management works. Black masses can be effectively and completely ablated with a CO 2laser. Layer by layer ablation until the black tissue is removed is both precise and clean (Fig 2a -d). Deep perirectal spheroid tumours at approximately 10 and 2 o 'clock positions are common and are detected by lifting the tail straight up thereby pulling them caudally towards the skin, or rectal or ultrasound examination ( Fig 3a ). Less common flatter lesions dorsal to the rectum more often obstruct faecal passage. Particularly large perirectal masses (such as those reaching the peritoneal re flection) may be better left alone. These internal tumours are approached directly or as extension of dissections of external lesions. Surgery in this area is always performed in the standing horse; recumbency pushes viscera into the pelvic canal placing pressure on the dissection. Preoperative mineral oil or laxative diet is often helpful; with pain control, the tendency to retain faeces usually passes within 1 -3 days. Epidural analgesia may require local augmentation with local in ltration. Margins of resection are planned and outlined during surgery. Dissection a) b) Fig 1: a) Anaplastic malignant melanoma (deep surface) resected from the tail head of a chestnut horse. Tail amputation (perhaps a valid consideration) would have been required for deeper margins on this variably pigmented mass. Adjunctive local cisplatin and radiation therapy did not save this horse. b) Necropsy specimen of caudal thoracic spine approximately 1.5 years after initial surgery and radiation. The horse returned to work but later presented with ataxia and was subjected to euthanasia. Metastatic tumour is present in the vertebral body, spinal canal and surrounding soft tissue. \u00a92019 EVJ Ltd625 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / DECEMBER 2020may need to be extensive. A carbon dioxide laser is useful in limiting haemorrhage as long as the target tissue is visible (Sullins 2012). Hand/ nger or blunt or careful sharp scissor dissection should be used for the deeper less visible areas. The rectum and larger pelvic vessels should be protected as dissection gets deeper; the rectum itself is very rarely involved. Dorsal internal masses can be particularly tedious. Resection of large masses leaves a sizeable wound often with exposed rectum ( Fig 3b and c). If the sphincter is absent, the rectal wall may require suturing to the surrounding subcutaneous fascia. Moderate to large wounds usually cannot be primarily sutured and often dehisce if they are. Open wounds are lavaged daily. Deeper defects arepacked until they ll in. Phenylbutazone (2.2 mg/kg bwt per os b.i.d. 5 -7 days) and turn out or exercise keep horses willing to defecate. Broad-spectrum oral antimicrobial is administered until granulation tissue is established but, despite the location, infection has not been problematic. Extensive preoperative client education is mandatory because diligent nursing care is required. A tail wrap and meticulous fly control are advisable particularly where Habronema is a problem. Petroleum jelly applied below the wounds protects the normal skin from scalding by plasma exudate and faeces. Even extensive wounds granulate, contract and epithelialise well ( Fig 3d ). These types of lesions are usually well demarcated and can be completely resected so adjunctive a) b)c) d) Fig 2: a) A 1-cm dermal melanoma (arrow) on the ventral tail of a grey horse. b) Intraoperative image of the lesion in (a) undergoing CO 2ablation.

However, all visible black tissue should be removed. Quite large ventral tail lesions can be resected ( Fig 4a and b) but the author does not operate on cases where the tumour surrounds the entire tail where resection would leave no skin. Bandaging helps the post-operative care for these lesions considerably. Preputial lesions involve the dorsum almost universally. Size, growth potential and possible ulceration factor into the decision for surgery. A longitudinal fusiform dissection with horizontal closure usually preserves preputial patency ( Fig 5a and b). Uncommonly, a stricture may have to be revised so the penis can protrude; however, time usually resolves that issue. The commissures of the lips are a further preferred site for dermal melanoma/melanomatosis. Size and rate for growth mainly determine the need for surgery. No matter how wide the outer portion of the mass, the bases can usually be resected in a wedge shape. The CO 2laser noticeably reduces haemorrhage and swelling. Buried absorbable sutures prevent the horse from worrying the area with its tongue and they are eating hay the same day ( Fig 6a -c). Healing is invariably uneventful. Internal melanocytic tumours present their own set of issues. Size and physical compression or distortion of adjacent structures are the most common problems. Tumour invasion of adjacent tissues is relatively uncommon. Parotid lesions are located within the salivaryglandular tissue making dissection challenging. However, within reasonable size limits, good results usually follow. Noticeable seroma/saliva accumulation may occur but this resolves in a few weeks. The facial nerve exits adjacent to the more dorsal aspect of these masses and must be protected; more ventral masses are simpler to operate. Most cases have noticeable adjacent vascular wall black stains that are left alone. No new growth has been observed in these sites after surgery (Groom and Sullins 2018). Internal melanocytic tumours can appear almost anywhere in the horse. An example is a horse with a series of spheroid melanocytic tumours displacing the trachea ( Fig 7a and b). Margins were obvious to follow with combined blunt and sharp dissection but the recurrent laryngeal nerve required protection. The wound was closed primarily with Penrose drains. Cisplatin (cis-diamminedichloroplatinum) is a broad-spectrum alkylating antineoplastic drug used widely in the local treatment of solid tumours in horses (Theon et al . 2007). Biodegradable cisplatin beads1(1.6 mg cisplatin/ bead) are preferred due to diffusion of the drug into surrounding tissue, and they have a 1-month duration of action. Melanocytic tumours are cisplatin sensitive but, without debulking, visible response is usually slow. In one series of horses, cisplatin beads were placed into tumour beds when complete excision was not possible (assessed visually by presence of black tissue) or when other melanocytic tumours were located close to the resection margins (Groom a) b)c) d) Fig 3: a) Preoperative image of a horse with moderately large perianal dermal melanomatosis and deep perirectal tumours. b) Immediate post-operative image of horse in (a). The anal sphincter is gone so the rectum has been sutured to the exposed fascia.

Beads were placed at 1.5 -2 cm intervals to provide adequate drug concentration across the lesion. Intratumoural (injectable) cisplatin has been recommended as a series of four treatments at 2-week intervals, either with or without surgical debulking (Theon et al . 2007). Using this protocol, the reported cure rate for equine melanomas was 81%. However, this author has not observed consistent substantial reduction of large lesions implanted with cisplatin beads. Lesions amenable to monthly treatment with relatively few cisplatin beads may be effectively and economically addressed. However, amenable larger lesions are more ef ciently addressedsurgically. Other chemotherapeutic agents including mitomycin C are worth investigation. Electrochemotherapy (EC) is becoming more widely available. This process couples the administration of a chemotherapeutic agent (usually injectable cisplatin in oil) with the delivery of electric pulses having appropriate waveforms to increase the cellular uptake and the ef cacy of the drug (electroporation) (Spugnini et al . 2011). Repeated general anaesthesia is required because the stimulation causes seizure-like activity. Success has been observed (Spugnini et al . 2011). Reasonably, EC may be more ef cient than cisplatin injections alone. However, comparison has not been made directly between cisplatin beads producing tissue levels for a month and requiring no general anaesthesia vs. biweekly EC treatments in anaesthetised horses. Irreversible electroporation (IRE) is a yet experimental but promising technique for the focal treatment of pathologic tissues that involves placing minimally invasive electrodes within the targeted region. A series of short, intense electric pulses are then applied to destabilise the cell membrane, a) b) Fig 4: a) Preoperative image of a large, necrotic ventral tail dermal melanoma. this location. b) Nine-month post-operative image of surgical site in (a). a) b) Fig 5: a) Preoperative example image of a moderately large dorsal preputial melanocytic tumour. b) One-month post- large dorsal preputial melanocytic tumour. Ltd628 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / DECEMBER 2020inducing cell death in a nonthermal manner. A large coxofemoral/proximal femoral sarcoma in a dog was successfully treated using IRE (Neal et al . 2011). More recently, high-frequency IRE (HFIRE) has eliminated the systemic muscular responses such that it can be applied to a standing horse (Arena et al . 2011), which this author hasused. A recent case report of two grey horses with dermal melanomas describes tumour reduction of 52 and 99% following standing treatment (Byron 2019). Various topical or locally injectable substances have surfaced and have been submerged over the years. To date, no objective results have been published in refereed journals. This author 's opinion is that causing necrosis of a surface tumour producing an open wound is less ef cient and more trouble than surgically resecting amenable tumours. Tumours not amenable to surgery for a variety of reasons would typically be in a location where inducing necrosis would not be advisable in any case. Anecdotally, this author has used laser energy to raise the measurable temperature of surface melanocytic tumour to 50\u00b0C or slightly less where tissue is known to more or less quietly necrose (Hildebrandt et al . 2002). The tumour did necrose to the depth measured to have reached temperature. Much more work will be required to predictably cause tumours of various depths to reach that temperature. This technique may have tumour size limitations as well. Van Ongeval et al . (2020) and many others have described inaccessible multicentric/metastatic melanocytic tumours and the insurmountable problem presented if they are causing clinical signs (Van Ongeval et al . 2020). Certainly, an effective systemic treatment would be miraculous. Various autologous vaccine preparations have been attempted for many years. This author 's observations of the results of these methods have been equivocal at best. Similar to dogs with malignant melanoma, equine melanocytic tumours have been shown to overexpress tyrosinase (Phillips et al . 2012). It followed that a canine melanoma vaccine that targets tyrosinase could potentially be protective in horses with melanocytic tumours. Vaccinated horses produced humoral and cell-mediated a) b) c) Fig 6: a) Preoperative image of a moderately large pedunculated dermal melanoma at the commissure of the lips of a horse. b) Intraoperative image of a laser wedge resection of the tumour in (a).

Moderately widespread vaccination of horses with Oncept2has ensued in the past few years. The product has been made available only to board-certi ed internists or institutions and requires a needleless injector. No comprehensive review of results has been published. Anecdotal information is that the vaccine may have largely limited growth and may even have resolved some early small lesions. No adverse reactions have been reported but no cure for the typical disseminated condition has occurred. A recent report of a similar product describes noticeable tumour shrinkage of melanocytic tumours in one trial (M\u20acahlmann et al . 2015). No further results have been published. Any product that effectively limits growth would be useful. Cimetidine has been administered to countless grey horses with melanocytic tumours since a report of effectiveness in three horses was published (Goetz et al . 1990). Another cited improvement in four of 12 horses based upon client questionnaires (Hare and Staemp fli 1994). Two more recent reports cite no signi cant clinical effect of cimetidine (Warnick et al . 1995; Laus et al . 2010). This author has treated many horses that have been treated with long-term cimetidine and observed no reduction in tumour size(s).

Kanellis* Department of Dermatology, cancer; melanometer; skin; It is common knowledge that avoiding excessive ultravioletlight exposure is key to good sun safety practices in humansand horses. Photoprotection and avoiding excessiveultraviolet light exposure can reduce the risk of actinicdamage, skin cancers and premature ageing. Accurate,cheap and self-contained ultraviolet light sensor devices canmeasure parameters such as light intensity that in turn can beused to quantify the potential of light to cause harm.Knowledge of local light intensity is important because it canactively guide good sun safety practices. Other devices,called melanometers, can measure an individual 's skin sensitivity to ultraviolet light, quantify their tendency tosunburn and determine the degree of photoprotectionrequired by that individual whilst outdoors. This articlehighlights the potential of the aforementioned devices andgood sun safety practices to reduce the incidence andburden of skin cancers caused by excessive sunlightexposure in horses and other companion animals.Metastatic melanoma, especially when presenting withominous clinical signs, often leads to devastating anddistressing consequences in humans, horses and othercompanion animals (Van Ongeval et al. 2020). I have read with great interest about advances made by recent studiesin understanding the molecular pathophysiology of greyhorse melanoma and the potential for this knowledge for thetreatment of melanoma in horses and other animals includinghumans al. 2004; Metcalfe et al. 2013; Daud 2015; Xu et al. 2017). Given the possibility of extrapolating this knowledge into human melanomatreatment, I believe it is sensible to reciprocate our currentknowledge of sun safety practices in humans for the bene t of our equine friends as well as other companion animals. Actinic damage will most frequently occur in horses and other animals in non-pigmented skin regions not protected byhair such as the eyes and nose. Such areas receive thehighest dose of ultraviolet radiation (UV) from sunlight and soare most likely to develop actinic keratosis and malignantneoplasms such as melanoma. Whilst studies have examinedthe similarities and differences between human and equinemelanoma (Seltenhammer et al. 2004), there are few publications exploring animal photoprotection and sun safetypractices. As with humans, good sun safety practices are thebest way to minimise the potential burden of actinic-inducedmalignancy. In horses, such practises anecdotally includedaytime use of water-resistant zinc oxide-based sunscreenlotion, UV-protective fly masks with dropped nose pieces and housing horses indoors when the UV intensity is mostdamaging and therefore most likely to cause sunburn. Inhumans, a universally accepted linear numerical scale oflight intensity from 1 to 11 +that quanti es how damaging a given UV intensity will be to skin is called the UV index (UVI)(He et al. 2013). This scale allows the public to appropriately modify their sun protection behaviours by adjusting their sunsafety practices. The World Health Organization (WHO)recommends that people use sun protection when the UVIexceeds safe levels, de ned as an index score of 3. Although the use of the UVI has not been studied in animalsand despite the obvious differences in the skin anatomybetween humans and animals, when extrapolated fromhuman use, the UVI has great potential to reduce theincidence of melanoma in horses and other animals byreducing excessive UV exposure. There are numerous sensor devices ranging from stickers, handheld devices and satellite-based sensors that can beused to measure various parameters of UV such as the UVIand accumulated UV dose (Kanellis 2019b). For example, UVIvalues are taken every minute at every major capital city inAustralia and can be freely obtained from the AustralianRadiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency (ARPANSA)government website or by using the Australian CancerCouncil SunSmart App using any smartphone or web-linkedcomputer. However, independently functioning devices areavailable that directly measure local UV measurements andmay be useful in regional and rural locations, far away fromARPANSA 's ground-based research-grade instruments. Other sensors, called melanometers, have the potential to quantifyUV sensitivity by measuring an individual horses 'epidermal melanin concentration (EMC) and individual maximum saferadiant exposure (IMSRE) (Kanellis 2019a). This kind of datacan make possible customised sun safety practices for asingle horse according to its own risk factors such as skinpigmentation, geographical location and hair distribution.These melanometers also have potential applications forother companion animals.

ADMequine.com Case Report Successful treatment of a splenic abscess secondary to migrant metallic wires in a horse C. Thomson, D. Archer, B. Ahern and C. E. Medina-Torres* School of Veterinary Science, Equine Specialist Hospital, The University of Queensland, Gatton, splenectomy; weight loss Summary This case report describes the rst successful treatment of a large splenic abscess secondary to accidental ingestion and migration of multiple metallic wires from the small intestine into the spleen of a horse. A 2-year-old Thoroughbred colt was hospitalised 5 weeks after an episode of severe colic followed by gradual weight loss and anorexia, pyrexia for 5 days and dehydration on the day of referral. A large splenic abscess was g/L) and hypoferraemia (5.9 lmol/L) were present. Following initial medical treatment for rehydration and stabilisation, including isotonic crystalloid fluids, broad spectrum antimicrobial and anti-in flammatory therapy, an exploratory laparotomy was performed. The mass was exteriorised, and two metal linear foreign bodies (0.2 cm thick and approx. 4 and 6 cm in length) were identi ed within the splenic mass and penetrating through the wall of the jejunum, causing it to adhere to the spleen. The adhesion was broken down and the jejunal wall repaired. Following ligation of arcuate splenic vessels, a partial splenectomy was performed using a linear stapler (ILA 100); approximately 70% of the spleen was removed ( Fig 1a ). Blood loss occurred following splenic transection; this was successfully controlled via manual ligation over the staples. Post-operatively, PCVvalues declined to 0.16 L/L and subsequently increased, with a decrease in TP after 72 h. The abscess and splenic tissue removed weighed 15 kg. Culture of a sample of its purulent content ( Fig 1b ) yielded a mixed population of bacteria. The colt was discharged after 14 days in hospital. On follow-up 3 months after discharge the patient remained clinically normal and haematological parameters had normalised after 60 days. This paper summarises the potential advantages of using a partial vs. a total splenectomy and highlights the potential complications of these surgical procedures in equine cases. Key points \u0081There are limited case reports of splenic abscesses associated with migrant metallic wires in horses, and all documented cases in which surgical treatment has been attempted have not survived to discharge. \u0081Both medical and surgical treatment of splenic abscessation carry a grave prognosis due to the high risk of splenic haemorrhage, abscess perforation and subsequent peritoneal contamination. \u0081This report describes the successful treatment of a large splenic abscess and intestinal adhesions, secondary to migration of multiple linear metallic foreign objects in a 2-year-old colt. a) b) Fig 1: Photograph of a) the splenectomised portion of the spleen containing the abscess, weighing 15 kg and showing the area of transection (arrows); and b) close up (white box in a) of the incised abscess exuding pus.

Biasutti Research and Clinical Training Unit, University Veterinary Teaching Hospital Camden, University of Sydney, Camden, New South Wales, Australia *Corresponding author email: andrew.dart@sydney.edu.au Keywords: horse; spleen; abscess; peritonitis; abdomen The spleen in the horse is of variable size and weight, suspended high in the left side of the cranial abdomen adjacent to the diaphragm, between the rib cage and left part of the greater curvature of the stomach. The long axis contours around the greater curvature of the stomach with the base in contact with the diaphragm and sublumbar muscles and the apex at the level of the 10th or 11th rib, about a hand 's breadth or more above the costal arch. Blood supply is delivered through the splenic artery and vein. The spleen acts as a lter for the blood, removing foreign material and bacteria, as well as recognising and removing old degenerating blood cells from the circulation. In the horse, the spleen also acts as a reservoir for up to 30% of the body 's total red blood cells. When commencing exercise, during periods of excitement or where there is blood loss, the spleen will contract and release these cells into the general circulation providing a substantial increase in the capacity to transport oxygen. While removal of spleen is reported to compromise optimal athletic function, it is thought that horses can live without a spleen (Persson and Bergsten Sherlock 2011). Nonetheless, the spleen, in most species, has an extremely important role in immune function including the production of IgM, optimising the function of B cells, a reservoir for immunocompetent lymphocytes and antibody production, and ltration and elimination of bacteria (Peroni 2008). In humans undergoing total splenectomy, overwhelming post-splenectomy syndrome may develop years after surgery. Patients with this syndrome have as much as a 5-fold increase in susceptibility to sepsis from encapsulated polysaccharide-coated bacteria that would ordinarily be removed by the spleen. These bacteria are often highly resistant to antimicrobials, poorly immunogenic and resist antibody binding 1989; Okabayashi and Hanazaki 2008; Peroni 2008). While this complication of splenectomy has not been reported in horses, a decreased resistance to protozoa and equine piroplasmosis has been noted, raising overwhelming post-splenectomy syndrome as a potential issue that should be considered after total splenectomy in this species (Mahoney et al . 1977; Rosner and splenic abscesses have all been reported in the horse, although splenic disorders are generally uncommon. Splenic abscessation is particularly rare, possibly because the role of the spleen as a blood lter and its contribution to the immune system renders it less susceptible to bacterial infection. Where splenic abscessation has been reported in horses, it has often been associated with foreign bodiespenetrating the wall of the gastrointestinal tract adjacent to the spleen. However, infection secondary to trauma and haematoma formation and perforation of the stomach by Gasterophilus intestinalis larvae have also been reported as potential causes (Spier et al . 1986; Dart et al . et al . 2009; Thomson et al . 2020). The most common clinical signs associated with splenic abscesses in the horse are nonspeci c and include fever, anorexia, lethargy, weight loss, tachycardia, tachypnoea and intermittent abdominal pain (Coleman and Schmitz 2019). Clinical pathology re flects a severe chronic in flammatory process including marked, often mature, leucocytosis, hyper brinogenaemia and hyperproteinaemia characterised by a hyperglobulinaemia and often hypoalbuminaemia. Recently, elevations in hepatic enzymes, in the absence of liver pathology, have been reported in some cases of splenic abscessation (Coleman and Schmitz 2019). Dehydration, elevations in blood urea nitrogen and creatinine and mild abnormalities in serum electrolytes have also been noted. The prognosis for horses with splenic abscesses is poor, whether treated medically or surgically, because the nonspeci c clinical signs and chronic disease process delay a diagnosis. By the time horses are diagnosed, the disease process is usually associated with a generalised peritonitis characterised by elevated total protein and white cell counts in an abdominal fluid sample and evidence of substantial intestinal and mesenteric adhesions. Transabdominal ultrasound will, more often than not, be rewarding in detecting the presence of a splenic mass and may help determine the size and extent of the mass and associated adhesions (Zicker et al . 1990; Coleman and Schmitz 2019). Generally speaking, the differentiation between peritoneal abscesses and neoplasms has been reported to be problematic based on clinical and laboratory data alone (Zicker et al . 1990). However, ultrasound-guided aspirates of the mass may provide samples that help make this differentiation on cytology and guide appropriate antimicrobial therapy (Coleman and Schmitz 2019). Medical therapy is reported to be more likely to be successful in horses that are not severely, systemically compromised by the septic process, if the underlying cause can be identi ed (Dart and Bischofberger 2011). In these horses, the abscess is more likely to be localised or contained and treatment can be targeted against the causative organisms based on culture and sensitivity. There have been no previous reports of successful surgical treatment of splenic abscesses (Rosso et al . 2012; Coleman and Schmitz 2019). The case presented by Thomson et al . (2020) in this edition of Equine Veterinary Education describes a 2-year-old \u00a92019 a splenic abscess secondary to migrating metal wires. This colt underwent a partial splenectomy and is the rst reported case of successful surgical treatment of a splenic abscess (Rosso et al . 2012; Coleman and Schmitz 2019). The clinical history and presenting signs in this colt were consistent with the chronic process described in previous reports of horses with a splenic abscess (Rosso et al . 2012; Coleman and Schmitz 2019). The systemic effects were well established prior to a denitive diagnosis being con rmed. The colt had clinical and laboratory evidence of a chronic, severe, infectious process and associated in flammation which was localised to the spleen on ultrasound; however, the cause of the abscess (metallic foreign bodies) could not be determined by ultrasound or radiographs. After the colt was rehydrated and broad-spectrum antimicrobials were commenced, a decision was made to perform an exploratory laparotomy. Albeit in a small number of cases, culture and sensitivity of transcutaneous ultrasound-guided aspirates of the abscess in previous reports have been successful and provided useful information to decide the best way to proceed, without signi cant complications or risk (Coleman and Schmitz 2019). Furthermore, cytology of either an aspirate or abdominal fluid sample to detect any evidence of neoplasia may be a useful prognostic indicator before initiating treatment. Despite the author 's concerns about risk of perforation and contamination of the peritoneal cavity or haemorrhage (Thomson et al . 2020), successful ultrasound- guided aspiration of the mass or even retrieval of an abdominal fluid sample in the case presented in this edition may have provided a more complete picture to decide whether attempting medical management would have been a more suitable approach to treatment, at least initially, particularly in light of the poor success reported with surgical treatment. Laparoscopic and more traditional, invasive techniques including a left paralumbar fossa approach or left-sided transthoracic approach with rib resection have been described as surgical approaches for experimental splenectomy (Rigg et al . 1987; Ortved et al . 2008). A study of the angioarchitecture of the normal equine spleen as an anatomical basis for partial splenectomy has also been documented (Foz Filho et al . 2013). However, splenic abscesses are usually associated with extensive adhesions to the body wall and associated intra-abdominal organs, including the intestinal tract. The surgical approaches described for elective experimental splenectomy in healthy horses may, therefore, not be appropriate for horses with clinical disease. The authors of the case report in this edition (Thomson et al . 2020) elected to use a ventral midline approach which is better suited to wider abdominal exploration (Dart and Bischofberger 2011) and is likely to have contributed to the successful outcome in this case. In the colt reported in this edition (Thomson et al . 2020), adhesions were limited to the body wall and adjacent intestine and were amenable to resection. The localisation of the infection and the ability to surgically access, manipulate and free the adhered intestinal segments without excessive contamination or haemorrhage were features of this case that facilitated the surgical process and outcome. Partial splenectomy and removal of the mass were performed using a combination of the ILA 100 stapler and manual ligationover the staples. The staples of the ILA 100 come in various sizes, and the B-shaped con guration is noncrushing while compressing tissues aimed to create some haemostasis without necrosis (Dart and Dart 2016). While stapling devices are not infrequently used in equine surgery for organ resection, they are suited to intestinal transection or anastomosis and not designed to be effective in thicker tissues such as the spleen. Despite combining multiple discharges of the ILA 100 and ligation, there was still clinically signi cant and concerning abdominal haemorrhage during and after surgery in this colt. It is not entirely clear in the case report whether complete splenectomy was a treatment option (Thomson et al . 2020) but, in the absence of reports of overwhelming post-splenectomy syndrome being a concern in the horse, a complete splenectomy may have been associated with less risk of haemorrhage and provided an alternative approach in this or future cases. Alternatively, other approaches to haemostasis such as large jaw thermal vessel sealers and haemostatic scaffolds alone, or in combination, along with other means of haemostasis could be considered in future cases. The follow-up on the colt in this case (Thomson et al . 2020) was limited to 3 months. The long-term prognosis remains unknown. There were surgically signi cant small intestinal adhesions identi ed and broken down during surgery that must be considered to potentially predispose the colt to further post-surgical adhesion formation with potentially fatal consequences. Further, as noted by the authors, horses undergoing total splenectomy can return to competitive levels of athletic competition (Ortved et al . 2008; Dart and Bischofberger 2011); however, at the elite level and at maximal intensity exercise, effects on the ef ciency of the cardiovascular system have been Sherlock 2011). These are most likely associated with the loss of a splenic reserve of red blood cells. How and whether this would be ameliorated by performing a partial splenectomy are unknown. However, given the current body of knowledge on splenic abscessation, a favourable prognosis for return to any level of athletic activity for a horse undergoing surgery for this condition would be optimistic. Despite the successful outcome in this case 3 months following discharge, based on the current literature, the primary decisions made around diagnosis and treatment of splenic abscesses should focus on whether it is possible to salvage the horse. Future athletic performance should be a secondary consideration. The case report in this edition of Equine Veterinary Education provides valuable insight into surgical treatment and complications of splenic abscessation in the horse and provides some optimism for this approach to treatment for select cases. More experience with surgical treatment of splenic abscesses is needed before clinicians can be con dent this is an appropriate treatment option.

(altrenogest) Solution 0.22% Intervet/Merck Animal Health ORAL PROGESTIN FOR USE IN ANIMALS ONLY SOLUTION 0.22% (2.2 mg/mL) For suppression of estrus in mares. Suppression of estrus allows for a predictable occurrence of estrus following drug withdrawal in mares with ovarian follicles 20 mm or greater. Suppression of estrus will facilitate: Attainment of regular cyclicity during the transition from winter anestrus to the physiological breeding season. Management of prolonged estrus conditions. Scheduled breeding during the physiological breeding season. WARNING: DO NOT USE IN HORSES INTENDED FOR HUMAN CONSUMPTION. Keep this and all medication out of the reach of children. CAUTION Federal law restricts this drug to use by or on the order of a licensed veterinarian. DESCRIPTION Regu-Mate\u00ae (altrenogest) Solution 0.22% contains the active synthetic progestin, altrenogest. The chemical name is 17-allyl-17 -hydroxyestra-4,9,11-trien-3-one. The CAS Registry Number is 850-52-2. The chemical structure is: Each mL of Regu-Mate\u00ae (altrenogest) Solution 0.22% contains 2.2 mg of altrenogest in an oil solution. ACTIONS Regu-Mate\u00ae (altrenogest) Solution 0.22% produces a progestational effect in mares. INDICATIONS Regu-Mate\u00ae (altrenogest) Solution 0.22% is indicated to suppress estrus in mares. Suppression of estrus allows for a predictable occurrence of estrus following drug withdrawal. This facilitates the attainment of regular cyclicity during the transition from winter anestrus to the physiological breeding season. Suppression of estrus will also facilitate management of prolonged estrus conditions. Suppression of estrus may be used to facilitate scheduled breeding during the physiological breeding season. CONTRAINDICATIONS Regu-Mate\u00ae (altrenogest) Solution 0.22% is contraindicated for use in mares having a previous or current history of uterine inflammation (i.e., acute, subacute, or chronic endometritis). Natural or synthetic gestagen therapy may exacerbate existing low-grade or \"smoldering\" uterine inflammation into a fulminating uterine infection in some instances. PRECAUTIONS Various synthetic progestins, including altrenogest, when administered to rats during the embryogenic stage of pregnancy at doses manyfold greater than the recommended equine dose caused fetal anomalies, specifically masculinization of the female genitalia. DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION While wearing protective gloves, remove shipping cap and seal; replace with enclosed plastic dispensing cap. Remove cover from bottle dispensing tip and connect luer lock syringe (without needle). Draw out appropriate volume of Regu-Mate\u00ae solution. (Note: Do not remove syringe while bottle is inverted as spillage may result.) Detach syringe and administer solution orally at the rate of 1 mL per 110 pounds body weight (0.044 mg/kg) once daily for 15 consecutive days. Administer solution directly on the base of the mare's tongue or on the mare's usual grain ration. Replace cover on bottle dispensing tip to prevent leakage. Excessive use of a syringe may cause the syringe to stick; therefore, replace syringe as necessary. DOSAGE CHART Approximate Weight in Pounds Dose in mL 770 7 880 8 990 9 1100 10 1210 11 1320 12 WHICH MARES WILL RESPOND TO REGU-MATE\u00ae (altrenogest) SOLUTION 0.22%: Extensive clinical trials have demonstrated that estrus will be suppressed in approximately 95% of the mares within three days; however, the post-treatment response depended on the level of ovarian activity when treatment was initiated. Estrus in mares exhibiting regular estrus cycles during the breeding season will be suppressed during treatment; these mares return to estrus four to five days following treatment and continue to cycle normally. Mares in winter anestrus with small follicles continued in anestrus and failed to exhibit normal estrus following withdrawal. Response in mares in the transition phase between winter anestrus and the summer breeding season depended on the degree of follicular activity. Mares with inactive ovaries and small follicles failed to respond with normal cycles post-treatment, whereas a higher proportion of mares with ovarian follicles 20 mm or greater in diameter exhibited normal estrus cycles post-treatment. Regu-Mate\u00ae (altrenogest) Solution 0.22% was very effective for suppressing the prolonged estrus behavior frequently observed in mares during the transition period (February, March and April). In addition, a high proportion of these mares responded with regular estrus cycles post-treatment SPECIFIC USES FOR REGU-MATE\u00ae (altrenogest) SOLUTION 0.22%: SUPPRESSION OF ESTRUS TO 1. Facilitate attainment of regular cycles during the transition period from winter anestrus to the physiological breeding season. To facilitate attainment of regular cycles during the transition phase, mares should be examined to determine the degree of ovarian activity. Estrus in mares with inactive ovaries (no follicles greater than 20 mm in diameter) will be suppressed but these mares may not begin regular cycles following treatment. However, mares with active ovaries (follicles greater than 20 mm in diameter) frequently respond with regular post-treatment estrus cycles. 2. Facilitate management of the mare exhibiting prolonged estrus during the transition period. Estrus will be suppressed in mares exhibiting prolonged behavioral estrus either early or late during the transition period. Again, the posttreatment response depends on the level of ovarian activity. The mares with greater ovarian activity initiate regular cycles and conceive sooner than the inactive mares. Regu-Mate\u00ae (altrenogest) Solution 0.22% may be administered early in the transition period to suppress estrus in mares with inactive ovaries to aid in the management of these mares or to mares later in the transition period with active ovaries to prepare and schedule the mare for breeding. 3. Permit scheduled breeding of mares during the physiological breeding season. To permit scheduled breeding, mares which are regularly cycling or which have active ovarian function should be given Regu- Mate\u00ae (altrenogest) Solution 0.22% daily for 15 consecutive days beginning 20 days before the date of the planned estrus. Ovulation will occur 5 to 7 days following the onset of estrus as expected for non-treated mares. Breeding should follow usual procedures for mares in estrus. Mares may be regulated and scheduled either individually or in groups. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION A 3-year well controlled reproductive safety study was conducted in 27 pregnant mares, and compared with 24 untreated control mares. Treated mares received 2 mL Regu-Mate\u00ae (altrenogest) Solution 0.22% /110 lb body weight (2 x dosage recommended for estrus suppression) from day 20 to day 325 of gestation. This study provided the following data: 1. In filly offspring (all ages) of treated mares, clitoral size was increased. 2. Filly offspring from treated mares had shorter interval from Feb. 1 to first ovulation than fillies from their untreated mare counterparts. 3. There were no significant differences in reproductive performance between treated and untreated animals (mares & their respective offspring) measuring the following parameters: interval from Feb. 1 to first ovulation, in mares only mean interovulatory interval from first to second cycle and second to third cycle, mares only. follicle size, mares only. at 50 days gestation, pregnancy rate in treated mares was 81.8% (9/11) and untreated mares was 100% (4/4). after 3 cycles, 11/12 treated mares were pregnant (91.7%) and 4/4 untreated mares were pregnant (100%). colt offspring of treated and control mares reached puberty at approximately the same age (82 & 84 weeks respectively.) stallion offspring from treated and control mares showed no differences in seminal volume, spermatozoal concentration, spermatozoal motility, and total sperm per ejaculate. stallion offspring from treated and control mares showed no difference in sexual behavior. testicular characteristics (scrotal width, testis weight, parenchymal weight, epididymal weight and height, testicular height, width & length) were the same between stallion offspring of treated and control mares.

Sherlock*, A. Fairburn, A. Lawsonand T. Mair Bell Equine Veterinary Clinic, Mereworth, UK; andInstitute of Veterinary Science, limb Summary The utility of magnetic resonance (MR) imaging in the evaluation of equine solar foot penetrations is well established. The objective of this pilot study was to evaluate the utility of MR imaging in assessment of equine distal limb wounds excluding solar penetrations. Low- eld MR images of 23 horses that had previously sustained distal limb wounds were reviewed in consensus by two ECVDI diplomats. Structures (bone; synovial structure; subcutaneous tissue and skin; and ligament/tendon) were identi ed as normal or abnormal on MR images, radiographs and ultrasound images and reports. All abnormalities were described. The presence of artefacts and their effect on image interpretation were also noted for each modality. Comparisons were made between imaging modalities, and it was noted if MR imaging influenced case management. Abnormalities of the bone were identi ed in 26% of horses on MR images and 17% of horses on radiographs; there were no osseous abnormalities identi ed on radiographs that were not identi ed on MR images, and additional features and better characterisation of lesions were noted on MR images. Tendon/ligament abnormalities were identi ed in 57% horses on MR and 47% of horses on ultrasound images. Magnetic susceptibility artefacts compromised MR image interpretation in 17% of horses. MR imaging of equine distal limb wounds allowed identi cation of both osseous and tendon/ligament abnormalities in more cases than either radiography or ultrasonography, and altered case management in 20/23 horses. Although MR imaging should not replace conventional imaging, this study highlights that MR imaging of equine distal limb wounds can yield information not detected on conventional imaging which may direct treatment and affect prognostication. Introduction Distal limb wounds are commonly encountered in equine practice. The utility of MR imaging for the investigation of foot penetrations in horses was reported in 2005 (Boado et al . 2005; Kinns and Mair 2005). Since then, MR imaging has become well established as a diagnostic tool for evaluation of known and suspected solar foot penetrations and has also identi ed previously undiagnosed solar foot penetrations (Urraca del Junco et al . 2012; Findley et al . 2014). Its value lies in its ability to assess the tract direction and depth, and also assess involvement of individual structures within the hoof capsule (Meehan 2017). MR imaging therefore may provide information useful for directing treatment and prognosticatingmore effectively in horses with penetrating solar wounds (Meehan 2017). Although MR imaging studies of horses with foot penetrations have been acquired in both standing and anaesthetised horses, reports of horses imaged in low- eld magnets under standing sedation predominate . 2012; Findley et al . 2014). This is likely to be due to the lower risks of standing image acquisition compared with the risks of morbidity and mortality in adult horses undergoing anaesthesia (Andersen et al . 2006; Franci et al . 2006). The safety and practicality of MR imaging of standing sedated horses yields varying possibilities for its utility in horses that are worthy of exploration. In addition to imaging the foot, MR imaging has been used for the evaluation of penetrating wounds elsewhere in the body in both human patients (Ledermann et al . 2002; Imokawa et al . small et al . 2008; Ober et al . 2008) and its bene ts and limitations have been described. These include the acquisition of high contrast resolution images and tomographic slices which can aid identi cation of a foreign body and its relationship to adjacent anatomy, thereby guiding surgical planning. This contrasts with the signal voids and magnetic susceptibility artefacts potentially compromising image interpretation as well as partial volume averaging artefacts preventing identi cation of small foreign bodies. Therefore, the objectives of this study were to assess the utility of MR imaging of recent distal limb wounds, excluding solar penetrations, in horses. The hypothesis was that MR imaging will yield more information about the involvement of soft and osseous tissues in horses with distal limb wounds than conventional imaging modalities (radiography and/or ultrasonography). Materials and methods A pilot study was conducted at Bell Equine Veterinary Clinic between July 2012 and July 2017. The study was approved and conducted in accordance with the clinic 's Animal Care and Use Committee. Owners of horses or ponies admitted for management of a distal limb wound that could be imaged with MR within 5 days of conventional imaging were offered MR imaging, and the uncertainty of the diagnostic utility was explained to ensure speci c informed client consent was obtained prior to undergoing MR imaging. The MR imaging was offered free of charge but the remainder of the diagnostics \u00a92019 EVJ Ltd637 doi: 10.1111/eve.13122and treatments were performed at the discretion of the treating clinician with client consent and at cost to the client. All wounds were distal to the mid metacarpus/metatarsus, and horses with solar penetrations were not included in the study. Sample size was dictated by owner consent over the 5-year time course of the study. All horses and ponies included in the study underwent low- eld MR imaging1for the evaluation of a recent wound (sustained within the previous 6 weeks) to the distal limb. History, treatments and outcome were recorded for each case. Horses were diagnosed as having affected (breached or contaminated) synovial structures at presentation if the nucleated cell counts of synovial fluid was >309109cells/ Lo r >90% neutrophils and/or degenerative changes within neutrophils, and two or more of the following were present: affected limb lameness, increased heat in the affected region and/or effusion of the affected synovial structure, bacteria seen on cytological examination of Gram-stained synovial fluid and a total protein concentration >30 g/L (Taylor et al . 2010). Synovial cavities were also considered breached if there was egress of fluid from the wound after instillation of sterile saline into the affected synovial cavity. All adult horses underwent MR image acquisition under standing sedation, and foals <3 months underwent MR imaging under general anaesthesia using varying sequences depending on the area of interest using a dedicated extremity radiofrequency coil. All MR images were reviewed in digital imaging and communications in medicine (DICOM) format using an image analysis workstation by consensus by two ECVDI-LA diplomats (C.S. and A.F.), and anatomic structures (skin and subcutaneous tissues; tendon/ligament; bone; and synovial structures) were graded as normal or abnormal. Imaging abnormalities of each structure were recorded in detail. The presence of MR artefacts and whether the artefact compromised image interpretation were recorded for each case. Horses also underwent conventional imaging (radiography2 and/or ultrasonography3) under standing sedation using routine protocols determined by the area of interest (Kidd et al . 2014; Butler et al . 2017) directed by the treating clinician. To prevent observer bias, following a 2-week interval after examining the MR images, anatomic structures were similarly graded as normal or abnormal on both radiographs and ultrasound images and imaging abnormalities were recorded in detail. The presence of artefacts and whether the artefact compromised image interpretation were also recorded for each case. This was achieved by examining both the clinical notes and the stored images/cineloops where possible on the same imaging workstation as for the MR images. The utility of MR imaging was estimated by comparing the percentage of abnormalities identi ed on each imaging modality for each anatomic structure. Additionally, cases were grouped into those where MR imaging changed the treatment and/or prognosis beyond conventional imaging, those where MR imaging afforded no additional bene t over conventional imaging and those where MR imaging misled the clinician. Any follow-up MR imaging examinations were also evaluated, but comparisons between imaging modalities were limited to the initial studies. Results There were 23 horses and ponies that met the inclusion criteria for the study ( Fig 1 ). Two cases were foals <3 months,and the remainder were adult horses with a mean age of 10.5 years (range 2 -22 years). There were three entire males, nine geldings and 11 females. Forelimbs were imaged in 14 horses ( ve left fore and nine right fore), and hindlimbs were imaged in nine horses ( ve left hind and four right hind). The mean length of time between the injury and presentation to the hospital was 6 days (range 0 -35 days), and the mean time between hospital presentation and MR imaging was 2 days (range 0 -7 days). MR and conventional imaging occurred within 48 h in 20 horses. The delay between conventional imaging and MR imaging in the remaining horses was 4 days in two horses and 5 days in one horse. The wounds involved the pastern region only (including the coronary band) in 18 horses, the fetlock region only (metacarpophalangeal or metatarsophalangeal joint) in three horses, the pastern, fetlock (metatarsophalangeal joint) and distal metatarsal regions in one horse and the distal metacarpal region only in one horse. Synovial structures were considered to be affected (contaminated or breached) at the time of presentation in 11 horses. An additional two horses had evidence of intrathecal tendon damage in the location of the wound on MR images in the absence of evidence of synovial cavity contamination or breach at presentation ( Fig 2 ). All horses received systemic antimicrobials and local wound management. Twelve horses underwent surgical treatment. Nine horses underwent surgical intervention that was not directed by the MR imaging ( Supplementary Item 1 ). The surgery performed was lavage of the digital flexor tendon sheath (DFTS) in six horses ( Figs 3 4), lavage of the navicular bursa and distal interphalangeal (DIP) joint in one horse ( Fig 5 ), lavage of the DIP joint only in one horse and lavage of the metacarpophalangeal joint in one horse. Subsequent MRI examinations afforded no advantage in one horse, were misleading in one horse whose lameness persisted for 2.5 months at which time it was subjected to euthanasia, ruled out soft tendon/ligament damage suspected at surgery in one horse and altered the post-operative treatment and/or prognosis in six horses. Four horses underwent surgery after the MR imaging that was directed by the MR images ( Supplementary Item 2 ), including partial hoof wall resection to remove a sequestrum in one horse ( Fig 6a,b ), partial hoof wall resection over a tract in one horse and exploratory surgery to remove a wooden foreign body in two horses ( Fig 7a,b ). One of these two horses with a wooden foreign body underwent surgery prior to the MR imaging for a DIP joint lavage and post-MR imaging for another DIP joint lavage and wound exploration to attempt removal of the foreign material; the horse also had evidence of damage to the collateral ligament of the DIP joint and its entheses on MR imaging ( Fig 8a,b ). Eleven horses were treated medically ( Supplementary Item 3 ). Surgical intervention was recommended but declined in two of these horses with synovial cavity involvement, both of which were subjected to euthanasia. Against veterinary advice, one of these horses was not subjected to euthanasia until 20 days after the MR imaging study at which time more extensive soft tissue damage was notable grossly than on the MR images. There were six horses where MR imaging altered the treatment and/or prognosis, four horses where MR imaging ruled out soft tissue lesions \u00a92019 EVJ Ltd638 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / DECEMBER 2020when their persistent lameness was inconsistent with the severity of the wound that was subsequently treated successfully for cellulitis, and there was one horse where the Surgery directed by MRI n = 4 MRI altered case management n = 4MRI altered case management n = 7MRI altered case management n = 10Medical management n = 11 MRI misleading n = 1MRI misleading n = 1 MRI afforded no value n = 1MRI afforded no value n = 1Surgery not directed by MRI n = 9n = 23 Case 7 in both groups Case 1 in both groups Fig 1: Flow chart of cases included in the study.

In contrast, the wooden foreign body appeared as a signal void on T1-weighted images and a well-de ned linear hyperintensity within a signal void on T2*-weighted images in the other horse ( Fig 7a ). After surgical foreign body removal, there was a heterogeneous intermediate T1- and T2*- weighted signal in the location of the previous tract and foreign body ( Fig 7b ) on follow-up MR imaging.

Ultrasonography identi ed more synovial structure abnormalities (63% horses) than MR imaging (48%) ( Table 1 ). Magnetic resonance imaging identi ed more tendon/ ligament abnormalities (57% horses) than ultrasonography (47% horses) ( Table 1 ). There were four horses in which abnormalities were identi ed on MR imaging but not on ultrasonography, and there was one horse that had suspicion of damage to the lateral collateral ligament of the DIP joint on ultrasonography but magnetic susceptibility artefacts prevented complete evaluation of the ligament on MR imaging initially; the ligament was normal on repeat MR imaging. There were an additional three horses that had magnetic susceptibility artefacts that compromised interpretation of the area of interest on the rst MR examination; this was improved in one horse on follow-up MR examination and did not resolve in one horse, and there was no indication for follow-up examination in one horse. Fast spin echo sequences were used to minimise the detrimental effects of magnetic susceptibility artefacts.Discussion This pilot study describes the utility of low- eld MR imaging in a heterogeneous group of horses with distal limb wounds. Magnetic resonance imaging altered the treatment and/or prognosis of most (20) horses with distal limb wounds, including four horses where surgery was directed by the MR imaging and ve horses in which tendon/ligament lesions were ruled out as a cause of unexpected/persistent lameness. Magnetic resonance imaging afforded no advantage over conventional imaging techniques in two horses and underestimated the ultimate severity of the lesion in two horses which were subsequently subjected to euthanasia 20 days and 2.5 months after MR imaging one of whom was treated against medical advice after MR imaging had identi ed severe tendon and osseous lesions. The potential for magnetic susceptibility artefacts to create nondiagnostic studies was a concern relating to the use of MR imaging in the evaluation of recent distal limb a) b)Lat Lat Fig 7: Case 10: a) Transverse T2* 3D gradient echo image at the level of the distal phalanx after a penetrating pastern wound.

Magnetic susceptibility artefacts have been noted in horses with solar penetrations (Boado et al . 2005; Urraca . 2012; Findley et al . 2014), horses that have undergone previous arthroscopic procedures (Thomas et al . 2016) and secondary to needle tracts after bursocentesis (Black et al . 2013). These artefacts are likely to be caused by hemosiderin deposits (Gomori and Grossman 1988; Bradley 1993) and/or small metallic or rust particles (Freer and Scrivani 2008). Magnetic susceptibility artefacts cause focal areas of signal void and adjacent regions of signal hyperintensity resulting from 'piling up 'of signal assigned to the wrong anatomic location and are more prominent on gradient echo compared with fast spin echo sequences (Arena et al . 1995; Hecht et al . 2011; Bushberg et al . 2012). In this study, there were magnetic susceptibility artefacts noted in 43% of cases imaged, although they were only considered to compromise image interpretation in 17% of cases. The effects were minimised by using fast spin echo sequences with short echo times in two horses and by performing a repeat study 5 days after the initial study (4 days after surgery) in one horse and 5 days after the initial study (1 day after surgery) in another horse. This highlights the necessity to explain to owners that MR imaging may be nondiagnostic in the early stages after wounds have occurred; however, the effects of these artefacts can be minimised by sequence selection and repeat imaging, potentially after lavage and debridement of the affected wound. It is noteworthy that after experimental arthroscopic procedures, magnetic susceptibility artefacts have been reported to persist for 12 weeks in 40% of cases, although these artefacts did not affect evaluation of the operated metacarpophalangeal joint (Thomas et al . 2016), and magnetic susceptibility artefacts have been reported to persist for years in human patients after intracranial haemorrhage (Imaizumi et al . 2003; Schommer et al . 2013). In 11 of the 20 horses where MR imaging altered the treatment or prognosis, the main contribution of the MR imaging was the recognition of tendon and/or ligament damage that was previously undiagnosed or underestimated. The tendon and/or ligament damage identi ed affected the rehabilitation type and duration after injury, and recognising involvement of the soft tissues allowed provision of a more accurate prognosis. Although it is arguable that a more thorough ultrasound examination could have yielded similar information without the necessity for MR imaging, the majority of horses had undergone detailed ultrasound examination by the senior clinician during the work-up, and the lesions were not observed or were underestimated, with the MR imaging providing additional or new information. There are inherent difculties in ultrasound evaluation of some areas of the distal limb, including the collateral ligaments of the DIP joint within the hoof capsule and areas of the deep digital flexor tendon that are off incidence to the primary beam (Carstens andSmith 2014). The presence of a wound and associated subcutaneous gas impedes identi cation of soft tissue injuries as well as subtle periosteal changes and may take several days to resolve, thereby delaying thorough evaluation. Additionally, tendon and/or ligament lesions may not be immediately apparent on ultrasound examination (Cauvin and Smith 2014), with MR imaging having better soft tissue contrast and reported as having a higher sensitivity for soft tissues lesions in several studies (Brokken et al . 2007; Sampson et al . 2007). These could be potential reasons for the lower rates of detection and assessment of severity of tendon and/ or ligament lesions on ultrasonography compared with MR imaging, and suggests that further MR imaging of horses with distal limb wounds may be warranted, especially in those horses whose lameness severity does not correlate with the clinical and conventional imaging ndings; however, conventional imaging should remain the initial approach to such horses. In an additional four out of 20 horses, the MR study directed surgical intervention. Magnetic resonance imaging has previously been reported to help direct surgical approaches for the treatment of keratomas, and its use has been associated with lower complication rates and shorter convalescent times compared with conventionally treated horses without advanced imaging-directed surgical approaches (Getman et al . 2011). Two of the distal limb wounds in this study that bene tted from MR imaging to aid surgical planning used similar principles to those used to direct partial hoof wall resection for removal of keratomas. The other two horses that underwent surgery directed by the MR imaging had wooden penetrating foreign bodies. There are contradictory reports regarding the sensitivity of MR imaging to accurately diagnose wooden foreign bodies; some reports suggest MR imaging ndings correlate well with the presence of wooden foreign bodies, whereas others report that computed tomography is more sensitive. This may be associated with a number of factors including the size of the foreign body and the duration of its presence, with MR imaging having worse sensitivity for acute small wooden foreign bodies (Dobromylskyj et al . 2008; Ober et al . 2008). Wooden foreign bodies have been reported as areas of signal void that correlate well with the size and shape of the retrieved foreign body in human patients (Bodne et al . 1998). Failure of MR imaging to identify foreign bodies in two of 55 horses with solar penetrations that were subsequently found during surgical intervention has been reported (Urraca del Junco et al . 2012). The sensitivity and speci city of low- eld MR imaging for detection of wooden foreign bodies is currently unknown, and it is very likely that small wooden foreign bodies may be overlooked, although in two horses in this study wooden foreign bodies were correctly identi ed and surgical removal validated the imaging ndings.TABLE 1: Table documenting the numbers and percentages of cases identi ed with abnormalities affecting anatomic structures on MR imaging, radiography and ultrasonography and the presence of imaging artefacts Modality No. of casesBone (% abnormal)Synovial (% abnormal)Ligament/tendon (% abnormal)Artefacts (% identi ed) MR imaging 23 26 48 100 57 43 Radiography 18 17 39 100 N/A 67 Ultrasonography 19 0 63 89 47 42 \u00a92019 EVJ Ltd642 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / DECEMBER 2020KILBY'S EQUINE DENTAL EXTRACTION TOOLS, LLC.

Although it is possible that the tendon injuries were caused indirectly by blunt trauma at the time the wound was sustained, it is more likely that the original wounds did cause breach of the DFTS and the tendon injuries directly and that the synovial structures were contaminated (although not necessarily infected) at the time of the injury (Cauvin and Smith 2014). The absence of evidence of synovial infection at presentation (7 and 18 days after injury) may be attributed to misleading synovial fluid results, such as with sequestration of infection within the DFTS or, more likely, because the contamination of the synovial structure resolved. Unfortunately, a de nitive explanation for the intrathecal tendon injuries detected on MR imaging in the absence of synovial breach is not possible retrospectively. There were an additional ve horses in which MR imaging was performed due to suspected severe tendon and/or ligament injury and an unexplained severe and/or persistent lameness in the absence of synovial sepsis. Magnetic resonance imaging was useful in these cases at ruling out severe tendon and ligament injury as a cause for the lameness. In one horse, there was a soft tissue defect palpated at surgery although there was no soft tissue abnormality identi ed on the MR images. The horse was rehabilitated based on the absence of soft tissue damage and the lameness resolved. It was therefore presumed that the defect palpated was of the subcutaneous tissue or a fascial plane. Regarding the two horses with misleading MR imaging studies, pathology of the navicular bone and bursa was not noted on MR imaging on days 1 and 7 of hospitalisation, but was present on a third MR study obtained 2.5 months after the pastern wound in one horse with unexplained severe lameness during hospitalisation that had recurred intermittently after discharge. The horse had also undergone navicular bursal lavage on days 0 and 5 of hospitalisation. The horse was subjected to euthanasia after the third MR examination. Post-mortem examination was declined by the owner but the imaging ndings were consistent with an aggressive osseous lesion with flexor compact bone destruction and marked STIR signal within the navicular spongiosa. In light of the history, these changes are most likely to represent a low-grade osteomyelitis, likely to be related to the initial pastern region wound and treatment. In view of the failure of the rst two MR examinations to detect pathology, the sensitivity of MR imaging for osteomyelitis detection is uncertain and questionable; however, in human patients, it has been reported that it may take 3 -5 days before detection of osteomyelitis on MR imaging (Kocher et al . 2006). An additional horse with severe imaging changes of the super cial digital flexor tendon, metatarsus, proximal sesamoid bones and proximal phalanx identi ed on MR images was noted to have changes in the DDFT grossly at post-mortem examination 20 days later. It is uncertain in this horse if MR imaging underestimated the DDFT damage initially or if the untreated sepsis within the DFTS caused the DDFT pathology subsequent to the MR imaging, as has been noted previously (Kidd et al . 2004). Although uncommon, both horses demonstrate that repeat MR imaging examinations are warranted if lameness persists beyond what is expected for the diagnosed severity of injury.More horses (63%) were noted as having ultrasonographic abnormalities of synovial structures compared with MR imaging (48%). This is likely to be due to the superior spatial resolution of ultrasound for diagnosis of small areas of brin and synovial membrane abnormalities compared with low- eld MR imaging. Magnetic resonance imaging is susceptible to partial volume averaging artefacts, and the motion insensitive sequences with thicker slices in particular lend themselves to this type of artefact. Partial volume artefacts can cause a signal intensity within a single pixel on MR images to represent both brin and synovial fluid within its corresponding voxel which would be dif cult to clearly differentiate from an adjacent pixel only representing synovial fluid. Previously, MR imaging has been reported to identify capsular thickening, joint effusion and synovial proliferation in 93% of 14 adult horses with septic arthritis (Easley et al . 2011). However, intrasynovial brin was only identi ed after administration of (Easley et al . 2011). Additionally, 4/6 foals with septic arthritis were noted to have a heterogeneous appearance to synovial fluid in contrast to a homogeneous appearance in foals with nonseptic arthritis (Gaschen et al . 2011). Possible explanations for the discrepancy are that images were acquired in a 1.5 Tesla high- eld magnet under general anaesthesia with better spatial resolution in both studies (Easley et al . 2011; Gaschen et al . 2011). The study in foals (Gaschen et al . 2011) compared ndings in septic and nonseptic arthritis, but the aim of the study in adults (Easley et al . 2011) was to describe the characteristics of equine septic arthritis in 14 affected horses and therefore was potentially biased. Two additional important features to consider are the duration of sepsis, which may have a large impact on the synovial cavity pathology, and the size of the synovial cavity affected. In human patients, only 22% of cases with synovial sepsis were noted to have synovial proliferation in one study, and the low prevalence was attributed to the small size of most of the human joints included in the study (Karchevsky et al . 2004). This highlights the importance of considering each imaging modality 's characteristics when choosing and interpreting imaging investigations. There are several limitations to this study that are associated with the clinical study design. The study includes a heterogeneous population of horses as the case inclusion was based on client consent for an imaging study with unproven value. This prohibited standardisation of imaging and investigative protocols, and not all horses had available radiographs, ultrasound images and/or reports, and the design also limited the numbers of cases. Although there was a delay between reading the diagnostic images, due to the clinical nature of the study, the clinicians involved were not blinded to the cases, which could have introduced bias into the study. However, the study does not aim to make denitive recommendations regarding indications for MR imaging of distal limb wounds, but to describe its potential use and provide a basis for future study and describe the ability to safely achieve diagnostic MR images in standing adult horses. In conclusion, this pilot study has demonstrated that low- eld MR imaging may have a utility in horses with distal limb wounds. As with all imaging modalities, its value in case management is dependent on appropriate case selection. Magnetic resonance imaging may be useful to rule in or out \u00a92019 EVJ Ltd643 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / DECEMBER 2020soft tissue and osseous abnormalities, and the presence of foreign bodies in horses with distal limb wounds with persistent or severe lameness was not explained by conventional imaging modalities. It may also be useful to guide surgical interventions in horses with distal limb wounds. Further studies into the utility of MR imaging in distal limb wounds, wounds involving the carpus and tarsus and the use of gadolinium contrast enhancement are warranted.

AAEP-Spread_1.indd 1 9/15/20 Clinical and ultrasonographic evaluation of three suture techniques for closure of the equine linea alba M. E. Verkade*, Tiel, The Netherlands; and\u00a7Department of Surgery and Anaesthesiology of Domestic Animals, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Ghent an important role in preventing ventral midline incisional complications. The aim of this study was to compare the clinical and ultrasonographic outcome of three suture techniques for closure of the linea alba. In this prospective case series (n =43), horses operated for acute abdominal intestinal disease through a midline incision were randomised in three groups: closure with a conventional continuous technique (Group 1), a small stitches continuous technique (Group 2) and the UX-technique (shoe-lace conguration, Group 3). Age, sex, body weight, type and duration of surgery were recorded and the suture to wound length ratio was calculated. Clinical evaluation of the wound (wound discharge) was performed daily during hospitalisation. At 7 weeks post-operatively the linea alba was evaluated clinically and ultrasonographically. The linea alba width was measured halfway along the length of the incision. One horse in Group 1 had acute incisional dehiscence, but there were no further signi cant differences between the groups in the short term. Seven weeks post-operatively two horses had complete herniation in Group 1 and one horse had partial herniation in Group 2. In the UX group no herniation occurred. The incidence of herniation was not signi cantly different between the groups. On ultrasound at 7 weeks the linea alba width was signi cantly smaller in Group 2 (P =0.00029) and Group 3 (P =0.0018) compared with Group 1, even with exclusion of the acute incisional dehiscence and two herniated horses. Limitations were the small group size and relatively low incidence of incisional complications for statistical analysis. It was concluded that the use of small stitches and the UX-technique resulted in a smaller linea alba width compared with the conventional continuous suture technique and might therefore be preferred for closure of the linea alba in equine colic surgery. Introduction Colic surgery is frequently performed in horses and the ventral midline incision is the most commonly used surgical approach. Incisional complications are frequently observed and include incisional infection, hernia formation and acute dehiscence (Gibson et al. 1989; French et al. 2002; Mair and Smith 2005a,c; Isgren et al. 2017). These complications can be serious and herniation may need surgical re-intervention in the long term, while acute dehiscence always needs surgical repair. The incidence of hernia formation after abdominal surgery in horses has decreased over the last decades, but isstill up to 10% (Gibson et al. 1989; French et al. 2002; Mair and Smith 2005a,b,c; Kelmer 2009). Most incisional hernias are associated with the development of oedema, drainage or infection in the rst week after surgery (Kelmer 2009). Several risk factors contribute to the development of post- surgical incisional complications. These include on the one hand intrinsic factors, such as age, metabolic disorders, immune status (and disorders), level of pain, body condition score, and on the other hand extrinsic factors, such as surgical technique, suture material characteristics and experience of the surgical team (Humphreys 2009). Whereas intrinsic factors can only be improved to a certain extent as they are related to the horse, extrinsic factors can be optimised by the surgeon. Several studies describe the importance of suture technique in the prevention of incisional complications both in humans and horses. The choice of suture material and suture technique plays an important role in wound healing by contributing to incisional strength, preservation of the vascularisation and tension on the wound edges (Gibson et al. 1989; Israelsson and et al. 2016). Therefore, an optimal closure technique of the linea alba is important to prevent complications. The recommended conventional technique after a midline laparotomy in horses is a continuous pattern with a bite size and interval size of 1.5 cm (Trostle et al. 1994; Hassan et al. 2006; K \u20acummerle 2012). In human surgery there is evidence that a continuous closure with smaller stitches reduces the complication rate and increases the strength of the suture line (Israelsson and Jonsson 1993; Harlaar et al. 2009; Millbourn et al. 2011). The described small stitch pattern uses a stitch interval of 5 mm and incorporates only the linea alba without passing through the rectus muscle sheath. Another technique described in human surgery for abdominal incision closure is the UX-technique (Ugahary 2006). In this technique, a double continuous suture pattern (the 'X')i s supported by a longitudinally placed tape in the medial corner of the rectus sheath (the 'U') to re-inforce the linea alba. The aim of the present study was to compare the clinical and ultrasonographic outcome for closure of the equine linea alba using three different suture techniques: the conventional continuous technique, the small stitches continuous technique and the UX-technique. The hypothesis is that the small stitches continuous technique and the UX- technique would reduce the risk of incisional herniation and would result in a smaller linea alba width, compared with the conventional continuous technique. \u00a92019 EVJ Ltd646 doi: 10.1111/eve.13109Materials and methods The study was performed between April 2009 and February 2012. Horses that had a midline laparotomy for acute abdominal intestinal disease were included if owners gave informed consent for participation to the study. Exclusion criteria were horses younger than 3 years, a bodyweight under 500 kg, pregnant mares, horses with a previous laparotomy and diseases interfering with wound healing (e.g. pituitary pars intermedia dysfunction, recurrent airway obstruction, neoplasia, renal disease or liver disease). To eliminate variations based on individual surgeons, only horses admitted on days when the same surgeon was on duty were included. Horses were randomised into three groups just prior to surgery by picking an envelope. All horses were sedated with detomidine under general anaesthesia with Iso flurane (IsoFlo 100/C2266) into a mixture of oxygen and air. The horses were placed in dorsal recumbency and the abdomen was clipped, prepared aseptically and draped in a routine matter. A ventral midline incision was made through the linea alba starting at the umbilicus and directing cranially. The length of the incision was measured with a sterile stainless steel ruler and recorded. The length of any incisional deviation from the linea alba, evident by exposed muscle bres from the rectus abdominis muscle, was measured in the longitudinal axis with a ruler and recorded. The surgical procedure was dictated by the acute abdominal intestinal disease the horse was suffering from and was performed by the same surgeon for all groups. Closure of the linea alba was performed using one of the three techniques described below, depending on the group to which the horse was assigned. The subcutaneous layer was closed with a continuous suture pattern using polyglactin 910 USP 0 (Vicryl7) and the skin was closed with polyamide USP 2 (Supramid8) in a continuous interlocking suture pattern. A sterile cotton stent was sutured on the abdominal wound and all horses had a head and tail rope-assisted recovery. Most horses got up at the rst or second attempt and were kept in a standing position with the assistance of the ropes. No abdominal bandage was applied during recovery or in the days after. The horses were allowed to lie down in the stable after surgery. Post-operative care was performed according to the needs of the horses. The cotton stent remained in place for 5 days after surgery. It was removed sooner if it became soaked with wound discharge. All horses received 5 days of i.v. gentamicin The horses were box rested with 10 min in hand walking daily until re-evaluation at 7 weeks post-operatively. Linea alba suture techniques Group 1: Conventional continuous technique In the conventional group, the linea alba was closed with a bite size of 1.5 cm and an interval of 1.5 cm using a 150-cm long polydioxanone USP 2 (PDS7). The bite sizeand stitch interval were measured with a sterile stainless steel ruler, to make sure these were uniform throughout the pattern. The suture was placed in the medial corner of the external rectus sheath, passing through the external fascia of the rectus sheath, the rectus abdominis muscle and the internal fascia of the rectus sheath ( Fig 1a ). The end of the suture line was knotted with surgical knots with 5-6 throws. Group 2: Small stitches continuous technique A bite size of 6 mm and a bite interval of 6 mm were used in the small stitches continuous technique group using a 150-cm long polydioxanone USP 2 (PDS7). The bite size and stitch interval were measured with a sterile stainless steel ruler, to make sure these were uniform throughout the pattern. The stitches were placed in or closer to the linea alba compared with the conventional technique ( Fig 1b ). If the suture material was too short, a second suture strand was used, starting on the opposite site of the incision. In these cases, sutures lines were overlapped 2 -3 cm in the centre of the incision and the suture ends were knotted separately with surgical knots with 5 -6 throws. Group 3: UX-technique Using the UX-technique, a PDS tape of 5 mm width and 200 cm length (PDS7), was positioned in a U-shaped con guration in the medial corner of each rectus sheath, and oversewn using an X-shaped pattern ( con two tunnelling devices (custom made9) are required. These tunnelling devices are slightly curved metal tubes of 40 cm length and a 5 mm external diameter with a blunt trocar ( Fig 2 ). A small incision was made in the external fascia of the rectus sheath, 1 cm lateral to the cranial end of the midline incision. The tunnelling device was introduced through this small incision and guided through the medial corner of the rectus sheath to the caudal end of the midline incision. At the caudal end of the midline incision the tunnelling device was exteriorised by making a small incision in the external fascia over the tip of the tunnelling device. The same was done at the opposite side of the midline incision. The tape was divided into two equal parts (but not cut) and suturing was started at the cranial side of the midline incision. The tape was placed from left to right in a simple continuous pattern with a curved Buhner needle with a diameter of 2.5 mm (custom made9,Fig 2 ), perpendicular to and just around the tunnelling device, moving from the cranial edge to the caudal edge of the incision. The bite size was 1.5 cm from the wound edge and had a stitch interval of 3 cm. The bite size and stitch interval were measured with a sterile stainless steel ruler, to make sure these were uniform throughout the pattern. After having placed one half of the tape from the left to the right, the other half of the tape was encircled around the tunnelling devices from the right to the left in the same pattern. This created a X-shaped 'shoe-lace ' con guration, with both ends of the tape at the caudal end of the incision. At this stage the ends of the tape on both sides were attached to the trocar in the tunnelling device and retrieved through the tunnelling device to the cranial side of the incision. Thereafter, the tunnelling device was withdrawn from the rectus sheath, leaving the tape in place. In this way, the longitudinal part of the tape was positioned in the medial corner of the rectus sheath (U- \u00a92019 EVJ Ltd647 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / DECEMBER 2020shaped), and was encircled by the running part of the suture (X-shaped). The loose ends of the tape were looped several times under the running part (2nd or 3rd X) and attached to it with a polyglactin 910 USP 0 (Vicryl7) surgical knot with 5 -6 throws. Data recording and measurements Age, sex, bodyweight, type of surgery (with or without enterotomy/resection) and duration of surgery were recorded. The longitudinal length of the linea alba incisional deviation was recorded in centimetres with a ruler and, if this occurred at multiple locations, these numbers were added up to one length. Wound length (WL) was measured with a ruler for all horses and for Groups 1 and 2 the suture length(SL) was measured by reducing the total suture length with the cut ends which were measured with a ruler. The SL:WL ratio was calculated for Groups 1 and 2. Acute dehiscence was de ned as the failure of the abdominal wall closure with protrusion of the abdominal contents and was acted upon immediately, by re-operating if possible. Clinical evaluation of the wound for signs of infection was performed daily during hospitalisation. Infection was de ned as any purulent discharge from the incision 48 h post-operatively and of more than 36 h of duration. Seven weeks after surgery, the wound was evaluated clinically for herniation, which was de ned as a palpable or visible defect in the abdominal wall with overlying intact skin. Ultrasonography of the linea alba was performed 7 weeks after surgery (Aloka 3500, linear probe 5 - RAMERSa) c) b)IRSLARAMRunning tape Longitudinal tape cranial caudal 6 5 423 1 Fig 1: Schematic presentation and picture of the three suture techniques.

The incisional area was cleaned, clipped and alcohol was applied to retrieve the best image. The area of interest was halfway along the length of the incision, and this was determined with a tape measure. Transverse images of the linea alba were obtained and the width of the linea alba was measured by measuring the distance between the medial corners of the rectus abdominis muscle. All measurements were done using an automatic ruler. Standard machine settings for tendons were used and the frequency, focus and depth were adjusted to individual horse and area of interest. Statistical analysis Relationships between suture techniques and the recorded variables (age, sex, bodyweight, type of surgery, length of incisional deviation, length of incision, surgical site infection, width of the linea alba 7 weeks post-surgery, occurrence of herniation and duration of hospitalisation) were explored. For continuous variables, differences between suture techniques were analysed using ANOVA. Normality of residuals was evaluated on QQ plots and by Shapiro-Wilk tests. Homogeneity of variances was evaluated on residuals VS tted plots and by a Levene 's test. When residuals were not normally distributed, a Kruskal-Wallis test was performed instead. When heteroscedasticity was detected, the data were analysed using a Welch test with Games-Howell post- hoc test. For discrete variables, differences between suture techniques were analysed using chi square tests, except when occurrences of an event were low, in which case a Firth regression was used. Signi cance was set at P <0.05 (SPSS 25 for Windows11). Results Seventy-three horses were initially included in the study: 11 were subjected to euthanasia during surgery, 10 were subjected to euthanasia within a week after surgery for other reasons than wound complications and 9 were lost during the follow-up period. Data were retrieved from the remaining 43 horses and are presented in Table 1 . Results were obtained for 14 horses in both Groups 1 and 2 and for 15 horses in Group 3. The results are reported as mean /C6s.d. There was no signi cant difference in age, sex, bodyweight, type of surgery, length of incision, duration ofsurgery and duration of hospitalisation between the three different groups. The mean length of the linea alba incisional deviation was greater in Group 3 than in Groups 1 and 2, although not signi cantly (3.0 cm /C60.76 cm in Group 3, 1.64 cm /C6 0.47 cm (P =0.414) and 1.5 cm /C60.62 cm (P =0.306) in Groups 1 and 2 respectively). Any deviation from the linea alba always occurred in the cranial part of the incision. The mean incision length (in cm) did not differ signi cantly between groups (19.5 cm /C61.2 cm in Group 1, 19.9 cm /C6 1.4 cm in Group 2 and 22.3 cm /C61.1 cm in Group 3). The conventional technique had a SL:WL ratio of 4.5:1, while the ratio in the small stitch group was 5.6:1. One horse in Group 3 developed a surgical site infection 48 h after surgery and still present 96 h post-operatively. There were no horses in the other groups with signs of surgical site infection as previously de ned. This difference between the groups was not signi cant. There was no prolonged antimicrobial treatment or additional wound drainage necessary during this period of time. The skin sutures were removed 14 days post-operatively, at which time no wound drainage was encountered in either groups. In Group 1, there was one horse with an acute dehiscence during recovery from anaesthesia, because of a rupture of the suture at 2/3 of the incision length. This horse was re-operated and excluded from the ultrasonographic evaluation at 7 weeks. Clinical evaluation 7 weeks post-operatively showed two horses in Group 1 with a complete herniation. In Group 2 one horse showed a herniation of the cranial third of the incision. In Group 3 no herniation occurred. This difference was not signi cant between the groups (Group 2; P =0.321, Group 3; P=0.079 compared with Group 1). On ultrasonographic evaluation 7 weeks post-operatively ( Fig 3 ) the width of the linea alba was signi cantly smaller in Groups 2 and 3 compared with Group 1 (6.0 /C61.0 cm in Group 1, with exclusion of the acute burst and two herniated horse; 2.5/C60.3 cm (P =0.012) in Group 2 and 3.0 /C60.1 cm (P=0.03) in Group 3) ( Fig 4 ). Discussion Despite extensive research into intrinsic risk factors, different suture materials and methods to protect the incision after surgery, the incidence of incisional complications after ventral midline celiotomy is still high (Fogle 2019). Human literature states that up to 70% of incisional complications can actually be linked to extrinsic risk factors like the experience of the surgical team and the surgical technique used (Israelsson 1998; Humphreys 2009). This nding urges the necessity to investigate the outcome of different surgical techniques to prevent incisional complications in equine horses. To the authors 'knowledge, this is the rst prospective study comparing different suture techniques for closure of the linea alba in clinical equine horses. The incidence of herniation in this study (9.3%) is in agreement to previous studies (Trostle et al. 1994; French et al. 2002). Although the numbers are small and there was no signi cant difference, the occurrence of one acute dehiscence and two herniations in Group 1 suggests that the conventional technique might be the weakest of the three suture techniques in this study. In these three horses no surgical site infection was present. The USP 2 suture material that was used is relatively small for the over 500 kg horses that 1. 2. 3.

A larger suture material size could potentially improve the results, especially for the conventional technique. The small stitches technique in Group 2 could apparently compensate for the smaller sized suture material, since complete incisional herniations did not occur. A larger size suture material, in combination with the small stitch technique could be even more resistant to hernia formation. As the linea alba becomes smaller in width when it advances cranially, incisional deviation is more likely to happen in the cranial part of the incision, which was also thecase in the present study (Trostle et al. 1994). Deviation from the linea alba and opening of the rectus sheath impairs the suture strength, because the holding power of the external fascia of the rectus sheath is less than the holding power of the linea alba (Boone et al. 2014). Not only the brous mass contributes to this holding power, but also the alignment of the bres (Axer et al. 2001; Levillain et al. 2016). In the external fascia of the rectus sheath the collagen bre pattern is orientated predominantly in a craniolateral-caudomedial oblique pattern. The internal fascia of the rectus sheathTABLE 1: Horse and surgical data for the 43 horses where follow-up after surgery was available Group 1 Conventional N=14Group 2 Small stitch N=14Group 3 UX-technique N=15 Pre-operative Mean age (years +range) 11.6 (4 -30) 10.6 (3 -22) 8.7 (3 -20) Mean bodyweight (kg +range) 569 (510 -628) 576 (506 -620) 580 (504 -698) Sex(N) Stallion 1 3 1 Gelding 6 5 7 Mare 7 6 7 Breed (N) Warmblood 11 11 12 Friesian 1 1 2 Other 2 2 1 Peri-operative Mean incision length (cm /C6s.d.) 19.5 /C61.2 19.9 /C61.4 22.3 /C61.1 Mean length (cm /C6s.d.) 1.64 /C60.47 1.5 /C60.62 3.0 /C60.76 Type of surgery (N) Enterotomy/resection 6 8 7 No enterotomy/resection 8 6 8 Duration of surgery (min/C6s.d.) 80 /C65.5 /C65.5 91 /C66.2 SL:WL ratio 4.5:1 5.6:1 - Hospitalisation Clinical signs (N) Surgical site infection 0 0 1 Acute dehiscence 1 0 0 Days of hospitalisation (mean +range) 7.8 (5 -18) 7.7 (5 -14) 7.3 (5 -14) 7 weeks post-operative Incidence herniation (N) 2 1 0 Width of LA (cm +s.d.) 6.0 /C61.0* 2.5 /C60.3 3.0 LALARAM d) b) Fig 3: evaluation of the linea alba 7 weeks post-operatively.

In the linea alba, where the fascia of both external and internal rectus sheaths join, the bre directions from both sides are continued, resulting in a complex crossing pattern of bres. As a result, the suture cannot cut through the linea alba as easily as compared with the fascia of the rectus sheath (Axer et al. 2001; Boone et al. 2014; Levillain et al. 2016). In the conventional suture technique, the stitches are placed lateral to the linea alba through the rectus sheath. Because of the tensile forces the suture is pulled through the external fascia of the rectus sheath until it reaches the lateral border of the linea alba (Wiemer and Ugahary 2008). This could have contributed to the pronounced widening of the scar of the linea alba which was observed ultrasonographically 7 weeks post-operatively. With this tearing, additional tissue trauma occurs, leading to disturbances in vascularisation and possible in flammation which may result in delayed healing and an increase in complications (Kelmer 2009). Several surgical aspects, like surgical time, type of surgery and incision length have previously been described as risk factors for incisional complications (Wilson et al. 1995; Honnas and Cohen 1997; Colbath et al. 2014; Darnaud et al. 2016). In our study, these risk factors did not appear to be signi cantly different between the groups. There is limited data available on suture bite intervals in a simple continuous suture pattern for the equine linea alba. Trostle et al. (1994) suggested an ideal suture interval and bite size of 1.5 cm. Hassan et al. (2006) then investigated a smaller suture interval with the same bite size and did not nd any signi cant differences in bursting strength, compared with the 1.5 cm interval and bite size. Both these studies only investigated the strength of the linea alba in cadaver tissue by tensile forces in a transverse direction, with one single failure load. This does not represent a clinical situation where the linea alba shows an anisotropic behaviour and is exposed to multi-directional tension and repetitive loading (Cooney et al. 2015, 2016). Further research on clinical horses is needed to nd the ideal suture interval and bite size.The choice for including the UX-technique in the comparison was based on the promising results obtained in human medicine (Ugahary 2006) and on the results of an ex vivo study showing that equine linea alba closed with the UX-technique had a signi cantly higher tensile strength compared with the conventional suture pattern (Wiemer and Ugahary 2008). From a technical point of view, the UX- technique is superior in terms of tension distribution, because the longitudinal part of the tape reinforces the linea alba by distributing the tension on the linea alba equally (Hollinsky et al. 2007; Wiemer and Ugahary 2008). The technique however has some potential downsides in equine horses. There is a higher amount of suture material needed to complete the UX-technique, but no knots are made with the tape to prevent bulking of the suture material. Although no surgical site infections occurred in this study, there could be a risk of the tape forming a nidus and becoming infected. To reduce the risk of infection, it is preferable to place the tape in a flat con guration to avoid pocket formation by twisting of the tape. Compared with a standard continuous pattern, the UX-technique is more challenging to perform. Therefore, the authors do not use this technique routinely, but it is considered in horses with an increased risk for herniation. Further research should be done to investigate the possibility of using a combination of different suture materials with this technique (e.g. tape for longitudinal part, normal suture material for running part). The incidence of surgical site infections in this study (2%) is lower than the 10 -37% previously described (Fogle 2019). This could partially be related to the fact that the cotton stent stayed in place for 5 days post-operatively. The outcome of using a stent as preventative for incisional complications varies widely in the literature (Gibson et al. 1989; Mair and Smith 2005a,c; Torfs et al. 2010; Tnibar et al. 2013). Although the incision was checked daily for drainage and the stent was removed when it became soaked with discharge, the stent could have contributed to missing horses with mild incisional discharge. At the time of suture removal 14 days post-operatively, none of the horses showed signs of either surgical site infection or incisional drainage. Ultrasonography is a useful diagnostic tool to evaluate the linea alba (Mendes et al. 2007; Beer et al. 2009; Verkade et al. 2018). At ultrasonographic evaluation 7 weeks post- operatively, both the small stitch and the UX-technique had signi cantly less widening of the linea alba. This is probably due to a stronger suture-wound interface, with less tearing of the suture, resulting in reduction of vascular compromise and inflammation. The UX-technique showed a slightly wider linea alba scar compared with the small stitch technique, which could be explained by the fact that the Buhner needle is not so curved that it could follow the radius of the tunnelling device. Because of that, the running tape is not entirely tightly apposing the longitudinal part of the tape. In the small stitch technique, the stitches are placed in or just beside the linea alba with a narrow stitch interval. The tensile forces are distributed onto more stitches ( /C65 stitches/3 cm vs. /C61.8 stitches/3 cm for a conventional suture pattern), resulting in less tearing at the wound edges. The small stitches technique achieved a good outcome even with the small suture material size (USP 2) used in this study. This nding suggests that with the smaller stitch interval technique the suture material size could potentially be down-sized from the conventional used material (USP5-7), thereby contributing to ** UX Small stitch Conventional10 8 6 4 2 0 Suture techniqueWidth of LA (cm) Fig 4: Width of the linea alba 7 weeks post-operatively in the three groups.

Conclusion Although the numbers are relatively small, the present studyindicates that both the small stitch technique and the UX-technique resulted in a signi cantly smaller linea alba scar compared with the conventional continuous suture techniqueand might be preferred for closure of the linea alba in equinecolic surgery.

Health problems in a pregnant mare in each stage of gestation can adversely affect the pregnancy. It is important to obtain a thorough history and perform a detailed and systematic examination of the pregnant mare so that the mare may be classi ed as normal or high-risk. However, even after a thorough examination, practitioners may face problems with the interpretation and assessment of risk. Normal mares should foal in the stable or pasture. Mares classi ed as having a high-risk pregnancy need to be monitored precisely for signs of oncoming foaling with attendance of trained personnel when labour begins. A valuable method for monitoring of the high-risk mare is assessing fetoplacental well-being. Fetoplacental well-being is most accurately assessed with ultrasonography as well as several available hormone pro les. We are proposing our scoring system of the mare 's health, which may be useful in the assessment of risk during pregnancy and help clinicians to decide whether sending the mare to the clinic is reasonable or unnecessary. Introduction The perinatal period includes the last month of pregnancy, parturition and puerperal period, 7 -9 days after foaling (Deskur 1964). Perinatal period monitoring requires many years of practical experience in observing pregnant mares, assisting parturition and looking after neonates. Early detection of signs of disease or pregnancy disorders is essential, considering that some illnesses or injuries of the pregnant mare can predispose to fetal stress and abortion. Owners may observe more frequent genital discharge or precocious udder development with premature lactation; this may be a sign of abortion or premature delivery. Rarely, enlargement of the abdomen suggesting twin pregnancy or hydrops of the fetal membranes may be observed. Those conditions indicate the need for performing a general examination to determine the viability of the fetus or to identify a high-risk pregnancy. Although improved diagnostic techniques are available in equine reproduction, the incidence of pregnancy loss is still high, varying between 10 and 15% during gestation (Bucca 2006; McCue and Ferris 2012; Baska-Vincze et al. 2014). A mare 's pregnancy lasts for about 11 months (330 - 345 days) and its length depends on many factors bothphysiological and pathological. The duration of gestation is sometimes exceedingly long, 360 days or more, with no adverse effects on the fetus or mare (Bos and van der Mey 1980; Lester 2005; Clothier et al. 2017). The pregnancy length may vary not only because of pathologies but also due to some individual factors that may be important in the assessment of pregnancy length: fetal gender (a male fetus may lengthen pregnancy), breed, number of previous pregnancies proceeding, the mare 's rank in the herd and environmental agents (e.g. maternal nutrition). Infectious agents (Leptospirosis, rhinopneumonitis /herpesvirus type I/, infections and in flammations of the uterus and placenta) as well as exposure of mares to ergot alkaloids may lengthen the duration of gestation (Marteniuk et al. 1998; Davies Morel et al. 2002; Dwyer et al. 2003). Foals born before 320 days of gestation are typically premature and nonviable (Leadon et al. 1986; Lester 2005). Some authors de ne abortion as the expulsion of the fetus before day 300 of gestation and use the term prematurity to designate birth of an underdeveloped foal between days 300 and 320 of gestation (Dwyer et al. 2003; Clothier et al. 2017). Overall survival rate of foals born prematurely is estimated to be around 5% (Leadon et al. 1986; Lester 2005). Mares which previously experienced complications during pregnancy or gave birth to a premature foal or a stillborn foal should be designated as high-risk. There are some rarely occurring abnormalities, which prove troublesome when it comes to risk management. Their symptoms are often equivocal and dif cult to interpret for inexperienced veterinarians. With the growth of horse population, many practicing veterinarians are treating horses as an addition to their usual routine, rather than as their eld of specialisation. Transportation of a pregnant mare is both costly and can prove risky for the health of both mare and the foal, therefore the decision to drive the mare to clinic should be made carefully and responsibly. We created a scoring system based on our own experience and thorough analysis of available literature that may be used in evaluation of a pregnant mare 's condition and outline a contingency plan for equine practitioners. The mare 's requirements during normal pregnancy Pregnant mares that are not designated as having high-risk pregnancies do not require special management or more attention than other horses. Mares should have permanent \u00a92018 EVJ Ltd654 doi: 10.1111/eve.13018access to a safe pasture in an established, stable herd, due to three important, inseparable issues: social relations in the herd, exercise and nutrition. Permanent access to the pasture ensures the ability to move freely and covers all social and nutritional needs. It is important to remember that pregnant mares need to be removed from endophyte-infected tall fescue 90 days before foaling (Brendemuehl et al. 1994). Rank among other horses and relations in the herd are important factors in fluencing a mare 's welfare, thus affecting risk of pregnancy and parturition complications associated with stress. Excluding young and aggressive horses from the group improves herd epizootic status (by eliminating exposure to herpes virus infections which are common in young horses) and decreases the risk of accidents and trauma (Watson 2016). Pasture hosting is more suitable for pregnant mares rather than box rest, even in cases of chronic orthopaedic problems as demonstrated by Norton et al. (2007), who showed that box hosted mares develop more pregnancy and parturition pathologies compared to pasture hosted mares. Proper nutritional support of the broodmare improves fertility and promotes normal growth and vigour of the developing fetus, and constant monitoring of body condition provides information about ful lling dietary energy requirements. It is very important to pay attention to the condition of the mare, as healthy and strong animals will endure parturition more easily and will be able to produce better quality colostrum and milk. Pregnant mares should be kept in good body condition (body score of 6 -7, based on a scoring system 1 -9; Cavinder et al. 2012). Mares should be in a positive energy balance at the time of parturition due to enormous metabolic demands in late gestation and early lactation. The balanced metabolism in this period will allow proper ovarian function, which is crucial for successful breeding within 1 month after foaling (Peugnet et al. 2016). A pregnant mare 's nutrition depends on the season of the year and quality of the feed. Access to fresh water and high quality hay or pasture is crucial, whereas oat supply should be established individually depending on the mare 's needs dictated by lactation status and stage of gestation (added especially during the last quarter of gestation due to 60 -65% of total fetal growth occurring in this period; Peugnet et al. 2016). In the last 3 months of gestation, feeding with at least 0.5-1.0 kg of grain and 1 -1.5 kg of good-quality hay per 100 kg of body weight is recommended. Three different feeding programmes including energy, protein and minerals are necessary for pregnant mares. Digestible energy requirements for mares increase during late gestation over 8 months and remain at the level of 110% for 9 months, 115% for 10 months and 130% for 11 months in comparison to the maintenance requirement (100%). Mares also need 44 g of crude protein per megacalorie of digestible energy in late gestation because of the linear increase in needs during the last 3 months. The intake of quality protein (for example alfalfa hay) should increase from 7 to 8% in the rst 8 months to 9 to 10% of the total ration in 9 -11 months of pregnancy (Hintz 1993; Cavinder et al. 2012). The primary minerals considered essential in pregnant mare rations are calcium and phosphorus in addition to selenium in regions where selenium de ciencies exist. Calcium should be added to the grain mixture to avoid osteochondrosis of the fetus, though phosphorus content should not exceed calcium content in the ration, especially in late gestation. Salt enriched inselenium ad libitum should be offered to mares (Hintz 1993; Peugnet et al. 2016). Routine management of the pregnant mare in the stable In the perinatal period, the breeder 's goal is to decrease the incidence of complications during parturition and their consequences as well as reduce the in fluence of foaling trauma. This can be achieved with proper preparation of the mare for parturition, providing sanitary conditions and collecting equipment and medicine necessary in case of dystocia. Routine management of the pregnant mare in the stable includes: preparation of a place for delivery (if the delivery is planned in the stable), implementation of a preventative health programme (vaccination and deworming) and pregnant mare observation (to detect signs of approaching labour). Under normal circumstances, parturition can take place either in the stable or at pasture. If the stable has a labour ward the mare should be placed there 4 -6 weeks before the estimated time of foaling. During this time the mare can adapt to the new environment and produce antibodies, which pass to colostrum and will provide immunological resistance against local pathogens for the foal. The labour ward should be spacious and clean, typically measuring to be a 4 m 94 m box and with large amounts of good quality bedding -preferably straw. Shavings have the capability to harbour potential pathogens and as a result the use of shavings for bedding in the labour ward is not recommended due to a greater risk of potential contamination to the mare 's reproductive tract; additionally shavings have the frustrating tendency to cover the wet neonate and get in the mouth of the mare while the mare grooms the foal. If shavings or sawdust has to be used, they should be nonetheless covered with straw (Dascanio 2014). A preventative health programme recommended for pregnant mares includes regular immunisation for common infectious diseases and serves two purposes: protection of the dam (and gestating fetus) and eventual protection of the newborn foal. Vaccinations, as the routine procedure in the perinatal period, are performed 1 month before parturition to increase the concentration of antibodies in colostrum to provide the highest possible passive immunity for the foal. It is important to recognise that immunoglobulins produced in response to vaccine antigens are too large to diffuse through the placental barrier and should be concentrated in colostrum and ingested by the newborn foal in the rst 24 h after parturition. Vaccinations against equine herpes virus 1 (EHV-1) and equine arteritis virus (EVA) are very important for pregnant mares due to risk of causing an abortion or giving birth to compromised foals (Fukunaga et al. 1997; Hullinger et al. 2014; Dascanio 2014). Frequent deworming on a schedule and faecal egg testing mares allows one to discount additional treatments before foaling. However, deworming on the day of foaling or shortly after parturition is common practice as it prevents Strongyloides westeri invasion within the foal. During lactation the infective larvae are ingested by the foal with milk starting from the fourth day after birth. Nevertheless, due to increasing parasite resistance to medicines, it is important to choose the deworming schedule based on faecal egg \u00a92018 EVJ Ltd655 EDUCATION / AE / DECEMBER 2020testing results. Deworming medications are considered safe for use during pregnancy and a variety of anthelmintic drugs are approved, including ivermectin, pyrantel and pyrantel tartrate. Thiabendazole, fenbendazole and piperazine are not known to cause any adverse effects at the therapeutic dose; however, cambendazole should not be used during the rst 3 months of pregnancy (Lyons et al. 2008; Rose Vineer et al. 2017). A month before the estimated date of parturition, a breeder should start observing the pregnant mare, paying attention to somatic changes that precede approaching labour. The changes include enlargement and development of the udder, vulvar region -relaxation and tissue oedema, same as in the pelvic region -and relaxation of the sacrosciatic ligaments (Stewart et al. 1982). The udder should gradually enlarge during the last month of pregnancy and become signi cantly larger 2 weeks before delivery. In the last 1 -4 days of pregnancy, small amounts of colostrum may ooze and create wax-like droplets on the end of the teats. Somatic changes may be used as indicators of progression, however tests based on calcium concentration (Ousey et al. 1984) and pH mammary gland secretions (Canisso et al. 2013) are more precise. The most precise test allows one to estimate approaching labour with accuracy of up to 12 h. Major changes were also documented for sodium concentration, which starts decreasing a few days before parturition, while potassium increases slightly. However, calcium is still considered to be the best predictor for date of parturition evaluation, but sodium and potassium may be used for evaluation of fetal maturity (Ousey et al. 1984). Within the last hours before parturition it is recommended to clean the perineum and udder in order to decrease the foal 's exposure to pathogens before the colostrum intake and decrease the incidence of diarrhoea in the rst weeks (Magdesian 2005). In mares which underwent a Caslick 's procedure, incision of the scar should be performed 1 - 2 weeks before delivery (Dascanio 2014). Normally, parturition without any complication does not require human assistance (McCue and Ferris 2012; Bazzano et al. 2016). Designating a pregnancy as high-risk Designating a high-risk pregnancy is based on medical history, clinical examination, obstetrical examination and additional tests, including ultrasonographic examination and blood testing (Daels et al. 1991; Bucca 2006). Factors which classify a mare as high-risk are classically divided into two categories, as shown below, based on the signs present during a previous pregnancy or the signs present during the current pregnancy (Lofstedt 1994; Frazer et al. 1997; Bucca 2006; Christiansen et al. 2010). Recurrent signs or ndings from the previous gestations: \u0081Vaginal current parturitionNew This classi cation can cause dif culties in clinical practice because of ambiguous signs that may present in a patient. Therefore, to summarise all aspects of the pregnant mare examination we are offering our clinical examination scoring system for veterinarians and horse breeders shown in Table 1 . In this marking system, all parts of the standard examination were shown in three separate sections of the clinical examination table. Each sign has a point value added when a sign is identi ed. This scoring system allows performance of the clinical examination step by step, even if the signs are not speci c. It is a consistent protocol that would prevent the tendency to immediately focus on the most obvious clinical nding and foregoing a complete examination. Such an approach will allow the detection of minor abnormalities before they become serious problems as well as identi cation of immediate major dysfunctions determining the viability of the fetus, preterm labour or abortion. At the end of the examination the veterinarian would summarise the point total from all three sections: general examination, obstetrical examination and any additional tests, which must be totalised. We suggest six points as a threshold indicating a need of referral to a specialist or specialty hospital. Six points or more should be designated as high-risk and undergo pregnancy monitoring; furthermore, it is urgent that all mares having more than 10 points should be monitored within the clinic. Our proposed system and the corresponding point values can be a helpful guideline in assessing the importance of particular signs found during the examination. While not all practitioners may agree with the designated scoring allocations, this system of classi cation is used in the authors 'practice and is being proposed as a clinically useful tool, not as an of cial diagnostic standardised system. The protocol of the clinical examination scoring system The clinical examination is initiated with the general physical examination and should include obtaining parameters such as the mare 's heart rate, respiratory rate and rectal temperature along with assessment of the mucous membranes, capillary re ll time and lymph nodes. All ndings should be noted and compared to the scoring table in order to sum the points from the rst section of protocol. During the obstetrical examination, the origin of genital discharge can usually be determined via the vulvar and vaginal examination. A scar after the Caslick 's procedure indicates the inadequate vulvar labia angulation and may be connected with minor mucopurulent which \u00a92018 EVJ Ltd656 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / / from in flammation of the vulva or vestibulum. The presence of urine in the vagina, occurring occasionally in older mares, may cause an ascending infection and result inan in flamed cervix, therefore when possible these problems should be identi ed and surgically corrected via a urethral extension before mating/insemination.

A urovagina is a result of conformational changes associated with progressing pregnancy. Bloody discharge with clots of blood suggests that vaginal varicosities may be haemorrhaging from subepithelial veins in the vulva or vagina; this condition typically occurs with decreased frequency in older mares. Mucopurulent discharge may indicate a bacterial infection and placentitis, thus a speculum examination should be performed with caution in order to determine the origin of discharge, evaluate the status of cervical relaxation and to obtain a culture swab sample for microbiological testing. Purulent or brownish bloody discharge through a relaxed cervix indicates the possibility of an impending abortion. In this case, assessment of fetal viability, combined thickness of the uterus and placenta (CTUP) and volume and appearance of amniotic fluid should be performed, and the discharge should once again be swabbed for microbiological tests. Speculum examination is also useful in assessment of the cervical mucus plug state, which provides not only a structural barrier, but also numerous antimicrobial components to prevent placental infection and preterm birth. Changes in its composition can be detrimental to pregnancy outcomes. While the vaginal speculum examination may be useful, it is extremely hazardous and must not be performed if it is not indicated. In all indicated cases, speculum examination should be performed carefully in an aseptic manner to avoid contaminating the vagina and cervix (Macpherson and Bailey 2008; LeBlanc 2010; McCue and Ferris 2012). The second step of obstetrical examination is palpation per rectum, recommended for the assessment of fetal viability, fetal position and development, cervical dimension and uterine position (in a case of uterine torsion), CTUP and risk of pathological fluid accumulation (Lofstedt 1994; al. 2010; Loux et al. transrectal palpation is routinely combined with transrectal ultrasonography, which is classi ed as an additional test and limited by month of gestation. Transrectal ultrasonography is recommended to detect fetal movement, umbilical blood flow and fetal heartbeat in early gestation. Combined thickness of the uterus and placenta can be measured with transrectal ultrasonography between the caudal uterine wall and the caudal boundary of the allantoic fluid for detecting placental thickening or separation and fluid accumulation between the endometrium and allantochorion. The norm for CTUP signi cantly differs between pregnancy months (Renaudinet al. 1997; Bucca et al. 2005) and is heavily dependent on measurement of areas in relation to the mare 's abdomen (Bucca et al. 2005). Renaudin et al. (1997) recorded CTUP from the ventral aspect of the uterine body, both in transrectal and transabdominal imaging. They suggested normal mean of CTUP summarised in Table 2 . (CTUP: ventral aspect of UB). Bucca et al. (2005) extended previous studies on measurements and performed transabdominal ultrasound examination in nine aspects of the uterine body. They suggested that focal areas of placental abnormality may be missed when only the parts of the uterus and placenta are examined. The comparison of these and previous (Renaudin et al. 1997) results is quite dif cult and the highest similarities are summarised in Table 2 (CTUP: selected aspects of UB). The excessive thickening is indicative of placental failure caused by ascending placentitis, progressive placental separation (Reef et al. 1996) and impending delivery (Bucca et al. 2005). The daily monitoring of fetal heart rate and CTUP are useful tools post-operatively to determine the health of the fetoplacental unit. The main indication for surgery in pregnant mares is colic, which happens with some frequency. Most colic responds to medical management but when surgical intervention is required or endotoxaemia occurs the pregnancy is put at risk. In both cases, the mare should be closely monitored and the therapies with anti-endotoxin and progestin components should be implemented to avoid abortion or fetal death (Drumm et al. 2013). Transabdominal ultrasonography may be conducted in advanced gestation due to the examiner 's inability to image the fetus with transrectal ultrasonography. It can be applied in pregnancies with abnormalities such as omphalocele, fetal ascites, placental separation (excessive the placenta), twin pregnancies and fetal death (Reimer 1997; McCue and Ferris 2012). Transabdominal ultrasonography is considered useful in assessing the fetal heart beat and its rate. A foal 's normal fetal heart rate in late gestation is 60 -92 beats/min. The normal mean of HRR (fetal heart rate at rest) (beats/min/ month [Mo.]) suggested by Bucca et al. (2005) is summarised inTable 2 . Reduction of fetal heart rate combined with changes in fetal movements are indicators of fetal hypoxic stress. Persistent brady- or tachycardia is correlated with deterioration of fetal well-being. The transient tachycardia to the level of 100 -130 beats/min may occur shortly after vigorous fetal movement, therefore the monitoring of fetal TABLE 2: Information on fetal heart rate at rest (HRR) (Bucca et al. 2005) and CTUP recorded from the ventral aspect of the uterine body (UB) (Renaudin et al. 1997) in comparison to selected aspects of uterine body (UB) (Bucca et al. 2005) Month of pregnancy CTUP ventral aspect of UB CTUP selected aspects of UB HRR/fetal heart rate at rest References Renaudin et al.

ORheart beats should be performed over a period of 10 min (Bucca et al. 2005; Baska-Vincze et al. 2015). It is important to remember that both in transrectal palpation and transabdominal ultrasonography, the lack of fetal movement is not proof of fetal death (Reef et al. 1996; Macpherson and Bailey 2008; Baska-Vincze et al. 2014). When the fetus is in anterior presentation transrectal and transabdominal ultrasonography may be used in fetal size assessment, which include fetal aortic and orbital diameters. Fetal aortic diameter is signi cantly correlated with neonatal foal weight, girth and hip height in normal pregnancies (Reef et al. 1995) whereas fetal orbital diameter was signi cantly correlated with foal birth weight (Bucca et al. 2005). The fetal size determination is especially important in mares after pelvic fractures. When pelvic fractures healed with exuberant callus formation space occupying lesions in the pelvic canal occur. In these cases, obstruction size should be compared with estimated fetal size in order to determine whether elective caesarean section will be necessary to obtain a living foal (Watkins et al. 1990). All pregnant mares with pelvic fractures should be classi ed as high-risk and undergo special care management in the clinic, especially in late gestation. A new technology used in monitoring mares is measurement of uterine blood flow. The higher total uterine flow (especially in last 60 days of gestation) is correlated with foal well-being -the foal is bigger and healthier. It may lower in older mares, because of endometrosis . However, aborting mares tend to have higher uterine blood flow in later gestation, until the day of abortion via secretion of vasodilators by the foal. This technique, combined with ultrasound monitoring of fetoplacental well-being may be very helpful in early detection of pregnancy problems and enables earlier initiation of treatment, which increases the chances of delivering a healthy foal (Bucca et al. 2005; Klewitz et al. 2015). The blood hormone concentration tests are informative and are becoming an increasingly common procedure in the clinical examination used to evaluate placental condition. Mares 'progesterone levels (P 4) gradually increase in the second and third trimesters up to the level of 2 -12 ng/mL. In the last week before parturition, P 4levels increase rapidly forming a progesterone peak. After 305 days of gestation, an increase in progesterone concentration should be interpreted cautiously, as it can be a part of the physiological sequence of hormonal changes preceding the delivery. On the other hand, a premature rapid increase of P 4level at <310 days of gestation may re flect fetal stress, due to progesterone synthesis from the fetal adrenal gland (Daels et al. 1991). Serial assessment of P 4levels is a useful tool for pregnancy monitoring at the clinic, with limited application in the stable. Because of variations in P 4levels among mares, it is necessary to determine the individual baseline for each mare. The recommended frequency of blood sampling varies from as frequently as three times a day to as little as once every 2 - 3 days, because only regular testing provides reliable information on placental and fetal condition (Daels et al. 1991; Conley 2016). While P 4levels are being monitored, three pathological pro les may be described in late gestation: a sudden decrease, a rapid increase, or lack of a P4peak. The sudden P 4level decrease is connected with an acute condition, such as colic, uterine torsion, mare stress and indicates high probability of fetal death. On the other hand, a rapid P4 level increase occurring prior to the mareentering the normal window of parturition (i.e. prior to 320 days gestation), indicates the possibility of placental pathology occurrence (placentitis) and often results in preterm labour of an immature foal. A lack of P 4prior to delivery occurs with poisoning with fescue grass or tall fescue (Deskur 1964; re flect placental and fetal health. In the last months of pregnancy, oestrogens decrease gradually to baseline levels. In late gestation, total oestrogen levels, including not only oestrone sulphate, but also 17-beta oestradiol and its metabolites as well, may be used for fetal monitoring. Between 150 and 280 days of pregnancy, total oestrogens concentration in the mare should exceed 1000 ng/mL. During this period, oestrogen levels lower than 1000 ng/mL indicate stress or fetal weakness, whereas a level lower than 500 ng/mL may indicate fetal death (Rossdale 1993; LeBlanc 2010; Shikichi et al. 2017). Progestogen levels usually are at low levels from 100 to 300 days of gestation, while oestrogens in total may reach levels above 1000 pg/mL in days 150 -310. Elevated progestin levels oestrogens <600 pg/mL) were shown in both healthy and placentitis suspected mares. Proles change in different manners in regard to developing pregnancy and progressing placentitis, respectively ,therefore total oestrogen and progesterone concentrations should be monitored together in mid- and late gestation as helpful diagnostic tools in the management of placentitis. In cases where placentitis appears to be progressing, fetal viability should be monitored with heightened frequency in the event that clinicians are forced to consider whether or not induction of parturition is in the best interest of the foal. In a situation such as this, the fetal examinations should occur within the clinic in the event that parturition needs to be abruptly induced. Being within the clinic allows clinicians to efciently prepare staff, equipment, and treatments essential in providing intensive care for the compromised foal (Lester 2005; Macpherson and Bailey 2008; Conley 2016). The third hormone, which can be monitored in high-risk mares is relaxin, produced by the placenta and is detectable in blood after the 80th day of pregnancy pre-partum levels range from 4 to 7 ng/mL without any changes until the second stage of labour when it increases rapidly up to 11 ng/ mL (Stewart et al. 1982). Relaxin concentrations decrease below 4 ng/mL in mares with impaired placental function, in cases of placentitis, placental abruption, hydroallantois and hydramnios. In the case of placental hydrops, the risk of spontaneous rupture of the fetal membranes increases signi cantly. After rupture, large amounts of allantoic or amniotic fluid evacuate, changing the mare 's blood pressure which should be recognised as a life-threatening condition (Christensen et al. 2006). Low circulating levels of relaxin have been reported both in pony mares affected by fescue toxicosis associated with placental disease and agalactia and in Thoroughbred mares, with other forms of placental disease or insuf ciency (Ryan et al. 2009). Relaxin has been explored as a potential marker of treatment success in placentitis due to its level decrease in cases of spontaneously occurring and experimentally induced pregnancy loss (Klein 2016). However, using circulating relaxin levels is limited due to signi cant breed differences and lack of commercial tests for determining relaxin levels in blood samples (Rossdale 1993; Klein 2016). \u00a92018 Ltd659 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / DECEMBER 2020It is also possible to measure androgen levels in a pregnant mare 's circulation; levels increase from the beginning of pregnancy (20 -40 pg/mL), rises at the seventh month (200 -300 pg/mL) and returns to basal values after parturition (Silberzahn et al. 1984). Androgen levels rise around 210 days of gestation due to increasing production by the fetal gonads after which some of these androgens are converted into oestrogens by the placenta (Daels et al. 1996). Androgens and oestrogens levels drop rapidly after fetal death and will decrease due to stress or fetal weakness. Because of this metabolism, it is recommended to monitor levels of androgens simultaneously with oestrogens, for better determination of the state of fetus (Conley 2016). These changes are detectable in blood samples and require several repeated blood testings. Regardless of the chosen schedule, to determine the tendency in hormone prole at least three samples are required (Daels et al. 1991; Conley 2016). Additional diagnostic markers used during assessment of a high-risk pregnancy include electrolytes, platelet count, brinogen, triglycerides and albumin concentrations in the mare 's plasma. In sodium, calcium, phosphorus and chloride ions concentrations, the most signi cant changes are observed 2 weeks before and after parturition. In the last month of gestation, plasma concentration of sodium ions increases due to the renin -angiotensin -aldosterone system activation, whereas plasma concentration of phosphorus ions decreases in correlation with fetal skeletal mineralisation. When deviations of plasma electrolyte levels are signi cant, the mare may be classi ed as high-risk after parturition (Bucca 2006). The number of platelets increases signi cantly prior to foaling and returns to the basal level 3 weeks after. In females in general, not only in mares, brinogen levels increase during pregnancy in a progressive fashion, and drop after foaling. Those changes are induced by a stress factor in pregnancy in order to develop a hypercoagulable state to prevent excessive bleeding, thus those changes should not alarm clinicians (Bazzano et al. 2014). Similarly, triglycerides and albumin concentrations increase during gestation, due to higher needs of the organism (Vincze et al. 2015). The sudden drop of one, several or all additional indicators of high-risk mares being monitored may suggest impending labour. Thus if basic blood tests are already provided, those parameters may be also noticed (Vincze et al. 2015; Bazzano et al. 2016). Bene ts of monitoring of the pregnant mare in the clinic Proper evaluation of a high-risk pregnancy is very important for estimating prognosis and formulating a treatment plan. Mares classi ed as high-risk should be monitored to detect approaching parturition in an equine veterinary clinic, where an experienced team will be able to implement treatment procedures immediately. In the case of complications, a set protocol prepared individually for high-risk mares will help in making proper decisions (Bucca 2006). Supervision of parturition at an equine veterinary clinic requires providing 24 h cautious care in the last days of gestation. Equipment such as a locally placed alarm sensor in the vulvar region of the mare that is able to detect an increase in humidity and subsequently send noti cation once the mare has increased in sweating, or a simple mountable labour box camera, areuseful tools when providing constant supervision for foaling mares. Foaling occurs more often at night, so 24-h mare 's monitoring, which is possible in clinic, is very important (McCue and Ferris 2012). The most valuable tool available for continued assessment of a high-risk pregnancy is transrectal or transabdominal ultrasonographic examination. Transrectal and transabdominal ultrasonography should be performed during the rst clinical examination and repeated every week, or even more often if monitoring of the fetus and placenta is necessary. This examination provides information about fetal well-being, probability of perinatal morbidity and perinatal mortality in the mare. This pro le became the 'gold standard 'for transabdominal ultrasonography for many years in the examination and treatment of pregnant mares in clinical practice (Baska-Vincze et al. 2014). Transabdominal ultrasonography is truly a useful diagnostic tool, whereas transrectal palpation is not sensitive enough because only a small part of the fetus can be reached by hand (Reef et al. 1996; Renaudin et al. 1997; Troedsson and Zent 2004; Baska- Vincze et al. 2014). Reef et al. (1995, 1996) extended the 'gold standard 'by providing a larger database of numerical values which can be referred to during ultrasonographic assessment of fetal and maternal measurements during late gestation. They suggested presentation, position, posture, activity, aortic diameter and heart rate should be determined to de ne the biophysical pro le (scoring system) for the equine fetus as a predictor of outcome. They also stated that the transabdominal fetal monitoring and the application of the biophysical pro le are promising to improve the ability to diagnose fetal distress and intervene appropriately to decrease perinatal mortality and morbidity. On the other hand, the authors indicated that obtaining a maximal score on the equine biophysical pro le still did not guarantee a positive outcome therefore we suggest even further enhancement of this 'gold standard 'by monitoring the reproductive hormones and the additional chemistry tests mentioned above. This extended pro le may be considered as a 'platinum standard 'and conducted if precise management of a pregnant mare is needed. The application of the 'platinum standard 'allows proper identi cation of problems with pregnancies and cautious monitoring of fetoplacental well-being, including fetal movement and hypoxic stress, as well as effective initiation and evaluation of the effects of treatment, which decreases the dystocia rate and increases the chance of a healthy foal delivery. Dystocia may occur even in the most precisely monitored mare. The percentage of parturition complications varies from 4% in warmblooded mares, to 10% in draught mares. Dystocia is more frequent in multiparous, than in primiparous mares (Lu et al. 2006). Causes of dystocia are: abnormalities in the presentation, position and posture and fetal congenital defects. Dystocia occurs more frequently when the fetal well- being has deteriorated. About 75% of labours are in anterior presentation, 18% in posterior presentation and 7% in transverse presentation (Frazer et al. 2002; Carluccio et al. 2007; McCue and Ferris 2012). Parturition monitoring at the clinic allows the evaluation of the progression of labour and in case of disorders to implement necessary operations immediately, whereas the assistance is not required at normal parturition. Physiological labour, divided into three phases, should progress in particular timeframes: the rst phase in 1 -4 h, the second \u00a92018 EVJ Ltd660 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / DECEMBER 2020phase in 30 min and the third phase in 3 h. It is estimated that every 10 min of delay in the second phase of parturition increases the risk of foal 's death by 10% during the delivery and by 16% after birth (Vandeplassche 1993; McCue and Ferris 2012). Providing professional assistance at parturition up to 90 min after the beginning of the second phase raises the foal survival rate from 83 to 95% (Norton et al. 2007). Survival rate decreases severely, even to 11%, when the second stage is prolonged for more than 60 min (Freeman et al. 1999) due to progressive hypoxia and deterioration in the mare 's general condition. These changes are associated with uterine contractions, mare 's anxiety, reduced connection between epitheliochorial placenta and the uterine wall and equine high susceptibility to infections and endotoxaemia. Disorders of labour progression are an indication for veterinary assistance at parturition, where the proper choice of treatment method is essential. In 71% of cases, dystocia can be managed without surgery and solved with correction of fetal orientation and its controlled extraction. In more complicated situations, fetotomy or a caesarean section is required. Mares classi ed as high-risk could be presumed to have an increased rate of dystocia due to fetal compromise preventing the foal from actively participating in the parturition process as occurs in normal mares and consequently should be foaled out in a clinic setting (Lu et al. 2006; Norton et al. 2007; McCue and Ferris 2012). This increased risk of dystocia should persuade owners in allowing their veterinarian to hospitalise their high-risk mare for constant monitoring so that the foaling can also be attended. With increased expense resulting from that required level of care, veterinarians will want to be con dent in their recommendations and by utilising the provided assessment tool above, a mare 's pregnancy status can be more accurately determined and the appropriate care provided. (Freeman et al. 1999; Carluccio et al. 2007). Conclusion The last weeks of gestation, as well as the time immediately after parturition, are crucial for foal survivability but are also important time frames to be attentive to the mare 's health status. Diagnostic techniques and associated technologies that were previously considered advanced have now become more common practice and affordable to clients, making it easier for veterinarians to provide optimal veterinary care to pregnant mares and their foals. However, qualifying animals as high-risk may still cause some dif culties. In this article, we present an innovative method of classi cation, which may solve this problem. We hope that the new clinical examination scoring system may become a very valuable diagnostic tool and will make designating a high-risk pregnancy much easier. A clear system of scoring dissipates doubts if more considerate care is required. We want to note that both mother and newborn wellness depends on conditions and treatment of them, even before parturition.

Normal variants are recognised upon gross anatomical dissection and also observed radiographically. Understanding the range of normal variants is essential for proper radiographical interpretation. This ensures that these variants are not mistaken for pathological lesions and helps avoid radiographical misdiagnosis. Common sites of normal anatomical variation in the foot, pastern, carpus, tarsus, elbow, shoulder and axial skeleton are reviewed. Introduction Accurate radiographical interpretation requires more than recognition of abnormalities. A solid understanding of normal anatomical and incidental variants is crucial to avoid misinterpretation of radiographical ndings. A normal variation commonly occurs in a typical location without other evidence of concurrent pathological bone change, such as sclerosis or lysis. The misdiagnosis of a normal variant as a signi cant lesion can result in deleterious consequences, including inappropriate case management, unnecessary surgery or incorrect client counsel in the prepurchase examination scenario. In addition, identifying a normal variant as pathological precludes accurate diagnosis of the true source of lameness. The following is a review of normal radiographical variants that are commonly mistaken for pathological abnormalities. Distal phalanx, navicular bone and distal interphalangeal joint Numerous anatomical variants of the foot have been described. These include normal variation in the extensor process shape, separate centres of ossi cation of the palmar processes, ossi The dorsal margin of the distal interphalangeal joint is a common area of misinterpretation within the foot. The dorsodistal aspect of the middle phalanx and extensor process of the distal phalanx can have variable conformation. In some horses, these surfaces are smooth and rounded, whereas in others the margins are pointed with sharp contours ( Fig 1 ). In some cases, it can be challenging to differentiate the sharply pointed normal variant from an osteophyte and normalvariants can be easily overinterpreted as degenerative changes. The pointed, sharp contour variant of the distodorsal middle phalanx will generally be bilaterally symmetrical without other evidence of joint disease, such as additional sites of osteophytosis, joint capsule enthesopathy, subchondral bone sclerosis or evidence of distal interphalangeal joint effusion. Concurrent osteophytes on the distopalmar/plantar aspect of the middle phalanx and articular surface of the navicular bone help indicate true joint pathology. Additional radiographical views can be used for the evaluation of distal and middle phalangeal osteophytes, such dorsolateral margins of the distal interphalangeal joint with minimal superimposition. No evidence of osteophytosis on these aspects of the articular margin helps con rm the pointed contour of the dorsodistal aspect of the middle phalanx as a normal variant. Anatomic variations of the navicular bone have also been described, including variable thickness of the flexor cortex, parallel or convergent joint space between the navicular bone and distal phalanx, the shape of the central eminence, a n daw e l l - d e ned, crescent-shaped lucent region in the sagittal ridge (also known as central eminence) of the flexor surface observed on the palmaroproximal-palmarodistal (navicular skyline) al. 1989; Kaser-Hotz 1992; Becht et al. 2001). This focal lucent area has previously been described as a normal indentation or synovial fossa. A study of 48 forelimbs radiography, computed lucent region is noncompact bone between a reinforcement line of compacted cancellous bone and the flexor cortex, resulting in a normal site of decreased mineralisation within the cortex (Berry et al. 1992) ( Fig 2 ). The size and prominence of this lucent region will vary from horse to horse. Typically, the appearance is symmetrical between limbs on the same horse; however, that does require that radiographical projections are identical, as slight variation in the obliquity of the skyline view can affect how conspicuous the crescent lucency appears. The lateral radiographical view can also be of aid. Horses with a more prominent central lucency on the skyline view tend to have a more prominent concave curvature of the flexor cortex on the lateral view (Dyson 2011). In contrast to the normal area of decreased bone density described above, erosions of the flexor cortex are classically rounded or 10.1111/eve.13088amounts of which may result in a distinct concave radiolucent defect on the flexor surface. These radiographical features help differentiate the normal architecture of the navicular bone from a flexor erosion. Flexor cortex erosions are clinically relevant ndings; therefore it is important that these normal lucent regions within the cortex are not overinterpreted and misdiagnosed as flexor cortical lysis. To achieve a diagnostic navicular skyline radiograph, multiple factors need to be considered including the position of the horse 's limb, conformation, exposure and x-ray beam angle. A horse 's limb should be placed caudally, behind the shoulder with the foot fully contacting the ground to achieve correct position of navicular bone relative to the middle and distal phalanges with a distinct separation between the middle phalanx and navicular bone. An upright foot conformation will require an increased beam angle incomparison to a flat foot. A recent study investigating the use of varying angles of the palmaroproximal-palmarodistal oblique (navicular skyline) radiograph found that a 35 /C176view in conjunction with the standard 55 /C176view improved radiographical detection of flexor cortical lysis (Johnson et al. 2018). Including additional navicular skyline projections of varying degrees can aid interpretation and result in a more accurate radiographical diagnosis. Proximal and middle phalanges, proximal interphalangeal joint and fetlock The distal aspects of the middle and proximal phalanges have a smooth, concave curvature between and proximal to the palmar aspect of the condyles, creating a central, rounded relative lucency on the dorsopalmar view ( Fig 3 ). This region can sometimes be confused for a cyst-like lesion (Becht and Park 2000). In contrast to a true cyst-like a) b) Fig 1: Lateromedial a) and dorso60 \u00b0proximo45 palmarodistomedial oblique radiographical views b) of the distal interphalangeal joint of the same horse. On the lateral image, the extensor process of the distal phalanx and the dorsal distal aspect of the middle phalanx have sharp, pointed margins. There are no other signs of degenerative change associated with the distal interphalangeal joint, including the joint margins on the 60 /C176 oblique image. This dorsal contour is a normal variant for this horse. a) b) c) Fig 2: Palmaro55 \u00b0proximal-palmarodistal (navicular skyline) radiographical view a) and transverse CT b) of the navicular bone.

The prominence of this lucency will vary depending on patient conformation and the angle of the x-ray beam.Carpus The distal most aspect of the ulna (styloid process) has a separate centre of ossi cation from the distal radius. In juvenile horses, a well-de ned lucent, linear to ovoid region extends obliquely between the distal radius and the separate centre of ossi cation of the styloid process of the ulna. In most horses, this will fuse completely. However, in some skeletally mature horses, there is incomplete closure of the ossication centre ( Fig 4 ). This persistent lucent ovoid junction between the remnant ulna and radius can be mistaken for a fracture of the distal radius. Another common area of confusion in the distal radius is the radial fossa (Becht and Park 2000). On the caudal aspect of the distal radius, there is a prominent, smooth indentation. This indentation appears as a round lucent area on the dorsopalmar view of the carpus and can be mistaken for a cyst-like lesion ( Fig 5 ). Similar to the relative lucent region found in the proximal phalanx, this lucency can be distinguished from a cyst-like lesion due to the lack of surrounding sclerosis and lack of other evidence of joint disease. In advanced radiocarpal joint disease, this fossa can enlarge due to pressure resorption from chronic synovitis, creating even more of a cyst-like appearance. In a group of 222 horses, investigators found several variations in the equine carpus, including the inconsistent presence of the rst and fth carpal bones. The rst carpal bone and fth carpal bone were found in 29% and 1.4% of limbs respectively (Simon and Dyson 2010). In some horses, the rst carpal bone does not separate from the second carpal bone completely, resulting in an oblong and irregular palmar surface of the second carpal bone ( Fig 6 ). The inconsistent appearance and presence of these carpal bones can result in misdiagnosis of pathological osseous fragmentation. Additionally, the fossa of the rst carpal bone within the second carpal bone can be quite prominent. This can occur whether or not the rst carpal bone is present and should not a) b) Fig 3: Dorsopalmar radiographical view of the pastern a) and transverse T2-weighted MRI of the distal aspect of the proximal phalanx b). The round ill-de ned lucent region in the distal aspect of the proximal phalanx on the radiograph (long white arrow) corresponds with the normal palmar concavity of the proximal phalanx seen on the MRI (short white arrow). The linear lucent region in the mid aspect of the middle phalanx represents a nutrient foramen. Fig 4: Dorsolateral-palmaromedial oblique radiographical view of the carpus. There is a persistent, well-de ned lucent ovoid region and line between the distal radius and the incompletely ossied separate centre of ossi cation for the the ulna \u00a92019 EVJ Ltd666 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / DECEMBER mistaken for a cystic lesion within the second carpal bone. Importantly, while the presence of a rst carpal bone is typically bilateral, the degree of irregularity or concave defect of the second carpal bone is variable and often asymmetric or unilateral; therefore, comparison to the opposite limb should not be relied upon to distinguish whether this is a normal or abnormal nding (Simon and Dyson 2010). Elbow The equine elbow is a region of few anatomic variations. Altered appearance of radiographical anatomy is more likely due to variation in radiographical position rather than true differences in gross anatomy (Dyson 1986). A common site of misinterpretation is the radioulnar articulation and the interosseous space between the ulna and radius ( Fig 7 ). The superimposed undulating and irregular surfaces of the radial notch and the ulna at the level of the coronoid processes can be mistaken for a fracture or bone lysis in the mediolateral image. As with many of these variations, comparison with the contralateral limb can be performed to help clarify the normal heterogeneity of the bone at this site. The radial head has prominent medial and lateral eminences at the attachment of the collateral ligaments. This is often mistaken as enthesopathy of the medial collateral ligament when observed on the craniocaudal view (Dyson 1986). The normal eminence is well-de ned and smoothly marginated. In contrast, enthesopathy of the medial collateral ligament is relatively uncommon and typically results in bone roughening and bone spur formation ( Fig 8 ). Shoulder The glenoid notch of the scapula has a concave margin that creates an ovoid lucent region on the cranial aspect of the Fig 5: Dorsopalmar radiographical view of the carpus. The radial fossa has a prominent lucent zone in the central aspect of the distal radius. The prominence of this appearance will vary with x- ray beam angle and from horse to horse.

There is incomplete separation of the rst and second carpal bone, creating an irregular margin to the fossa on the second carpal bone (white arrow).

There is an undulating lucent line at the radioulnar articulation EDUCATION / AE / DECEMBER 2020distal scapula that can be mistaken for a subchondral bone defect or cyst-like lesion ( Fig 9 ). A second site of overinterpretation is a lucent zone at the junction of the glenoid cavity of the scapula and the humeral head that is often mistaken as subchondral cyst or fracture. This lucent zone is due to the medial rim of the glenoid being projected a) b) a) b) Fig 9: a) Mediolateral radiographical view of the shoulder.

In contrast, osteochondrosis lesions of the shoulder joint more typically occur on the caudal aspect of the shoulder with accompanying sclerosis and articular surface irregularity. Tarsus Previous studies have shown that the distal aspect of the medial trochlear ridge of the talus is a common site of misinterpretation, in large part due to the variability in shape (Shelly and Dyson 1984; McIlwraith et al. 1991). The distal aspect can be rounded, pointed, or even a separate osseous body. The separate osseous bodies are often referred to as 'dew drop 'lesions and are an incidental normal variation (McIlwraith et al. 1991). The mid dorsal aspect of the medial trochlear ridges of the talus can be variably flattened to focally concave. Apart from rare cases with concurrent subchondral bone sclerosis or fragmentation, this is an incidental variant and should not be confused with osteochondrosis ( Fig 10 ). Stifle In juvenile horses, the trochlear ridges of the femur have irregular articular margins, which can persist until approximately 5 months of age (Adams and Thiisted 1985). The irregularity should be con ned to the articular surfacewithout evidence of bony lysis within the trabecular subchondral bone ( Fig 11 ). When joint sepsis is suspected, the irregularity of the trochlear ridges and varying degree of ossication of the patella can be challenging to interpret. Radiographs of the contralateral limb can be helpful in differentiating normal juvenile bone irregularity from bone lysis associated with sepsis. The medial femoral condyle has a normal variation in shape from rounded to flattened on the caudocranial view (Jeffcott 1984) and the appearance can be affected by x- ray beam angle. A flat medial femoral condyle articular surface in the absence of subchondral bone defects or sclerosis is an incidental variant. A slight concavity on the caudocranial view is of variable signi cance, is not necessarily an incidental nding and deserves further exploration. A flexed lateral oblique view of the sti fle can be incorporated into the sti fle study to provide improved visualisation of the weight-bearing aspect of the medial femoral condyle and more completely assess for pathological changes at this site. This radiographical projection can help detect more subtle lesions that might otherwise be missed on the caudocranial or caudolateral oblique view or demonstrate that what looks like a small defect on the caudocranial view is actually a more substantial articular surface defect (Barrett and Selberg 2012). Cervical spine The C6-7 articular process joints are unlike the cranial and mid-cervical spine articular process joints. The sixth cervical Fig 10: Lateromedial radiographical view of the tarsus with a flat contour to the dorsal aspect of the medial trochlear ridge (white arrow). There is no subchondral bone sclerosis or fragmentation, thus this is considered a normal anatomic variant. Fig 11: Lateromedial view of the sti fle in a normal 3-week-old foal. The trochlear ridges are irregular and undulating (white arrows), consistent with the described appearance of a normal foal <5 months of age. \u00a92019 EVJ Ltd669 EQUINE VETERINARY AE / DECEMBER 2020vertebra has shorter, thicker caudal articular processes that are situated further laterally. Correspondingly, the cranial articular processes of the seventh cervical vertebrae are wider and longer (Getty 1975). Consequently, these C6-7 articular process joints are normally more rounded and larger than the articular process joints in the cranial cervical spine. In addition to the anatomically normally larger articular process joints at C6-7, these articular process joints frequently undergo modelling and enlargement, which can be clinically insigni cant. Although challenging to obtain, right 55 \u00b0dorsal- left ventral and left 55 \u00b0dorsal-right ventral oblique radiographs of the cervical articular process joints can aid in differentiation between bilateral and unilateral changes with improved evaluation of the articular process joints with decreased osseous superimposition. Recent work has investigated the morphological radiographical variation in the sixth and seventh cervical vertebrae and the rst thoracic vertebra in 270 horses. This group found the spinous process of the seventh cervical vertebra was identi able in 76.1% of horses with described shape variations, including sharp triangle, rounded triangle, or spur-like shape (Santinelli et al. 2016). The spinous process of the seventh cervical vertebrae is partially superimposed with the dorsal aspect of the C6-7 articular process joints and can be mistaken for osteophyte formation and osteoarthritis (Fig 12 ). A separate centre of ossi cation of the caudal aspect of the transverse process of the sixth cervical vertebra can be present in juvenile horses. In one review of a large equine population, this separate centre of ossi cation was only found in 4.8% of horses, the majority of which was <3 years of age (Santinelli et al. 2016). This physis remains open until 4 -5 years of age and should not be confused for a fracture (Whitwell and Dyson 1987). Thoracic spine The cartilaginous summits of the thoracic spinous processes of T2 through T8 are not ossi ed in the newborn foal and begin to ossify around 12 months of age (Jeffcott 1979).These separate centres of ossi cation are commonly heterogeneously mineral with irregular margins and remain separate from the parent bone for the horse 's lifetime. These normal separate centres can be distinguished from traumatic fractures by their alignment with the adjacent spinous processes and lack of other osseous abnormalities of the withers. The thoracolumbar spinous processes and interspinous spaces are common areas of evaluation in prepurchase examinations and insurance claims (Penell et al. 2005). The standard grading scales are based on interspinous distances of <4 mm indicating pathological abnormalities. This is dependent on the age of the horse as the interspinous distances decrease with age (Jeffcott 1979). In Thoroughbred horses, the summits of the spinous processes tend to be beak- shaped with narrower interspinous spaces, which can predispose Thoroughbreds to spinous process impingement. (Jeffcott 1979). Patient positioning, x-ray beam angle and geometric distortion have also been proven to have signi cant effect in interspinous distances (Berner et al. 2012; Djernaes et al. 2017). Horses are commonly sedated for spinal radiographs and head position becomes low, resulting in flexion of the cranial thoracic spine and extension of the caudal thoracic spine (/C19Alvarez et al. 2006). The interspinous distances between eighth and 14th spinous processes were signi cantly wider in a low head position compared with intermediate (neutral) and high head positions. The 15th -17th interspinous distances were signi cantly wider in the low head position compared with the high head position, but not signi cantly different than the intermediate head position. In the high head position, variable interspinous distances were signi cantly narrowed compared with the intermediate head position (Berner et al. 2012). A recent study also found x-ray beam angle to make a signi cant difference in interspinous space measurements. If Fig 12: Lateral radiographical view of the caudal cervical spine.

Interestingly, this difference in width did not have a consistent pattern and could not be predicted. Attempting to evaluate an interspinous space at a distant site (edge of lm) will lead to geometric distortion, thus the reason for signi cantly different measurements. Concurrent osseous abnormalities, such as cortical lysis and sclerosis of the spinous processes, can help con rm true spinous process impingement when present. For these reasons, veterinarians acquiring spinal radiographs should be cognisant of head position and x-ray beam angle creating limitations when interpreting this region. A neutral head position with the spinous processes of concern centred in the x-ray beam is advised for the best quality diagnostic radiographs and ease of interpretation. Nutrient foramina While most practitioners are familiar with the common locations of the nutrient foramina within the long bones and phalanges, there are some nutrient foramina that are not consistently present in all horses and are often not bilaterally symmetric. These less commonly visualised nutrient foramina can be easily mistaken for a fracture, particularly in patients with acute onset of severe lameness in which a fracture is suspected. Common areas of misinterpretation include a variable present dorsal foramina in the proximal phalanx (Kneller and 1996) ( Fig 13 ). Smaller foramina are also seen extending from the more prominent nutrient foramen in the metacarpus. Nutrient with well-de ned thin opaque linear borders on either side of the foramen. In contrast, fracture margins can be sharp, but not cylindrical and do not have a thin, symmetric line of surrounding opacity. The typical radiographical appearance of a nutrient foramen may aid in differentiating a nutrient foramen from a fracture. In cases where it is unclear if a linear lucent area in the bone is a normal foramen or a fracture, the patient should be con ned with repeat radiographs obtained in 7 -10 days. A nutrient foramen will not alter in appearance, whereas a fracture will have widening of the fracture margins and progressive surrounding sclerosis. Conclusions In summary, there are multiple radiographical variants associated with normal conformational or anatomic variations. Recognising these normal variants is essential to avoid inappropriate radiographical interpretation and subsequent improper case management. Understanding normal anatomy, radiographical signs of disease and engaging in collaboration with veterinary colleagues will maximise accurate radiographical interpretation and minimise the risk of misdiagnosis.
