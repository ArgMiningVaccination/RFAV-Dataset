Shevlin, MSPH, Christopher Summers-Bean, RN, Donna Thomas, MPH, Cynthia G. Whitney, MD, MPH, Daryl Todd, RN, MSN, Susan M. Ray, MD Background: While the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommends a standing order as the most effective mechanism to increase pneumococcal and influenza vaccination rates,Georgia's Medical Practice Act does not authorize nurses to screen, order, and administeradult vaccines in inpatient settings. Methods: The setting was a 1000-bed public teaching hospital in metropolitan Atlanta. A 1-month intervention (INT1) included four wards randomized to intervention or control. A5-month hospital-wide intervention (INT2) followed INT1. The intervention used wasprovider reminder with in-service training. Chart review was the measure used. The mainoutcome was pneumococcal vaccination prior to discharge. Results: During INT1, 534 patients (296 intervention and 238 control) were discharged. Of the 534 patients, 475 (89.0%) were African American, 188 (35.2%) were uninsured, and themedian age was 48 (range 19 to 96). Of the 205 intervention patients with vaccineindications and no contraindications, 78 of 205 (38%) were vaccinated compared to 7 of143 (4.9%) of the control patients ( p/H110210.001). During INT2, 879 patient charts were reviewed. Patient demographics were similar to INT1. However, of 554 eligible patients,16% were vaccinated, signicantly higher than control floors during INT1 ( p/H110210.001). Although nurses initiated the form almost 70% of the time, physicians assessed fewer than35% of patients with indications. Conclusions: Signicantly higher proportions of high-risk patients were vaccinated through the use of a preprinted nurse screening and physician order form. However, a signicant percentage ofpatients did not receive the vaccine owing to the physician's failure to order it. In thesecases, use of standing orders would have further increased vaccination rates while alsopromoting a more sustainable program.

Nationwide, approximately 44% of the respiratory pneumococcal isolates were resistant topenicillin, 3and costs associated with treatment of mi- crobial-resistant S. pneumoniae have escalated to cost-efcient vaccine\u201423-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide\u2014has availablesince 1983, but it is widely underused. The nationalvaccination rate for adults aged /H1135065 years was 54.1% in 1999 (49.7% in Georgia), yet the rate differed signi-cantly by race/ethnicity at 56.8% for whites, 34.6% forHispanics, and 36.4% for blacks. 5More alarming is that patients aged /H1102165 with chronic health conditions have even lower vaccination rates. Many studies have shown increases in adult vaccina- tion through the use of a physician standing order.6-11 In addition, the Advisory Committee on ImmunizationFrom the Department of Medicine, Atlanta Veterans Affairs Medical Center (Shevlin, Thomas), Emory University School of Medicine(Ray, Summers-Bean), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention(Whitney), Grady Health System (Todd, Ray), and Georgia EmergingInfections Program (Ray, Shevlin, Thomas, Summers-Bean), Atlanta,Georgia Address correspondence and reprint requests to: Susan Ray, MD, Department of Medicine/Div ID, Emory University School of Medi-cine, 69 Butler St, SE, Atlanta, GA 30303.

PII S0749-3797(01)00408-1Practices (ACIP) and the U.S. Task Force on Commu- nity Preventive Services strongly recommend the use ofstanding orders as one of the most effective mecha-nisms to increase pneumococcal and in fluenza vaccina- tion rates. 12-14Standing orders as a single-component intervention have been associated with a median 51%increase in vaccination coverage. 14Provider reminders are also recommended as effective strategies for im-proving rates with a median 17% increase in vaccina-tion coverage when used alone. 14We have not been able to employ a standing order in our institutionbecause Georgia 's Medical Practice Act, as interpreted by our facility 's legal department, does not authorize registered nurses to order and administer medications,including immunizations, without a physician 's assess- ment in the inpatient hospital setting. Thus, we de-signed and evaluated the effectiveness of a nurse-initiated, provider-reminder system as a substitute forstanding orders. Methods Grady Memorial Hospital is a 1000-bed public hospital serving primarily an indigent, African-American population in At-lanta, Georgia, and is staffed by residents in training from twolocal residency programs. We evaluated the effectiveness of aprovider-reminder system initiated by nurses on pneumococ-cal vaccination rates in our inpatient areas. The remindersystem used a preprinted screening and order form. Vaccina-tion rates were evaluated during two phases: a 1-monthperiod in which four wards were randomized to the interven-tion or control (INT1) group, and a 5-month period in whichthe intervention was implemented hospital-wide (INT2). INT1 compared vaccination rates among patients dis- charged from two intervention floors to patients discharged from two control floors for 4 weeks in May and June 1999. All four floors were adult medicine wards. Intervention area nurses, physicians, and administrators received both in-ser-vice education prior to commencing the pilot study, and thenreceived continual feedback regarding the form 's use and vaccination rates. Two cycles of physicians rotated throughthe areas, and they were in-serviced upon commencement.The preprinted forms were included in patients 'admission packets and placed in the physician-order section of thechart. Nurses assessed patients for vaccine candidacy uponadmission and flagged the form for physicians if the patient had indications. Physicians ordered the vaccine for eligiblepatients (i.e., those with indications and no contraindica-tions) after obtaining the patient 's verbal consent. No educa- tion or organizational changes were provided for the controlfloors. Chart reviews to determine underlying disease, vacci- nation history, and vaccination during the current hospitalvisit were conducted during discharge for all patients fromboth the intervention and control floors. Patients were con- sidered previously vaccinated if the completed provider-reminder form indicated that the patient reported priorvaccination or if we found documentation of prior vaccina-tion in the chart review. After INT1 was completed, modi cations were made to the preprinted form, including the addition of the in fluenzavaccine. The hospital-wide intervention, INT2, began on February 1, 2000, and surveillance was conducted for 5months. Rather than targeting only two hospital areas, thisintervention targeted all inpatient areas of the hospital withno control group, including both critical care and psychiatricunits. Study personnel routinely conducted chart reviews forall patients discharged during a speci ed 1-week period during each surveillance month. A broad range of in-serviceswere provided for nursing, administration, and physicianstaffs prior to initiating the intervention, and feedback wasprovided to hospital staff throughout the surveillance period.New cycles of physicians began at the start of each month andwere in-serviced upon commencement. Chart reviews wereconducted at discharge for patients in non -critical care areas. Since critical care patients were rarely discharged directlyfrom their units, they were not included in this analysis.Emory University 's Internal Review Board approved the project study design. Categorical comparisons between study groups were car- ried out using Mantel -Haenszel /H92732tests, while t-tests were used to evaluate continuous variables. Logistic regression modeling techniques to determine pvalues were performed using SAS 6.12 (Cary, North Carolina). Logistic regressiontechniques used methods outlined by Kleinbaum, 15where demographic variables remained in the nal model. Col- linearity and interactions were analyzed and found to benonsigni cant. Results INT1 Results During the 4-week INT1 study period, 534 patients were discharged from four inpatient areas, 296 patients fromtwo intervention floors, and 238 from two control floors. Intervention and control groups were similar with regard to race/ethnicity, gender, age, and insur-ance status (Table 1). Overall the population wasAfrican American (89.0%), female (51.7%), and mid-dle aged (median age 48), and more than one thirdwere uninsured (35.2%). However, there were differ-ences between the groups regarding the presence ofvaccine indications. Eighty-three percent of interven-tion patients had vaccine indications, compared to only72% of control patients ( p/H110210.01). Although the most common indications were diabetes (28%), alcoholabuse (26%), age /H1135065 years (26%), and pulmonary disease (20%), there were statistically more patientsclassi ed as alcoholics in the control group (33.3% vs 21.1%, p/H110210.01). Only 16% of high-risk patients (i.e., those with indications) were previously vaccinated. On the intervention floors, almost 70% of patients were eligible for vaccination, compared to 63% on thecontrol floors ( p/H110050.13) (Table 2). Nurses screened 55% of patients with indications, and 47% were as-sessed by their physicians before discharge. The overallvaccination rate among eligible patients (i.e., thosewith indications and no contraindications) on theintervention floors was 38%, compared to the vaccina- tion rate of 5% on the control floors. Patients dis- Am J Prev Med 2002;22(2) 93charged from intervention areas were 7.8 times more likely to receive the pneumococcal vaccine than pa-tients discharged from control areas (95% CI, 3.70 - 16.34; p/H110210.001). Multivariate analysis controlling for patients 'race/ ethnicity, gender, age, insurance status, and vaccineindications demonstrated that the intervention groupwas 11.7 times more likely to be vaccinated than the control group (95% CI, 5.07 -27.22; p/H110210.001). When using a model to determine other variables that in flu- enced vaccination among eligible patients, diabetes(odds ratio [OR] or chronic renal fail- ure (OR /H110050.15, p/H110050.02) decreased the likelihood of vaccination during admission.Table 1.

INT1, Intervention 1; INT2, Intervention 2. 94 American Journal of Preventive Medicine, Volume 22, Number 2INT2 Results During INT2, 9813 patients were discharged from adult patient care areas, and 879 (9.0%) of these patients ' charts were reviewed (during a selected week eachmonth as described in the Methods section). Theoverall demographics among this population were sim-ilar to the INT1 population regarding race/ethnicity,insurance, and median age. However, more of thecharts reviewed were those of male patients duringINT2 than during INT1 (Table 1). As this interventioninvolved all inpatient areas, including psychiatric andsurgical floors, fewer patients had vaccine indications (70%), compared to INT1 (83%, p/H110210.001). Only 63% of the patients discharged were eligible for vaccinationversus 70% of the eligible patients on the interventionareas during INT1 ( p/H110050.05). Moreover, almost half of all patients did not attend one of our primary careclinics. Throughout the hospital-wide intervention (INT2), nurses consistently initiated the reminder system forpatients with indications (Table 2). However, physi-cians assessed fewer than 35% of patients with indica-tions. The overall vaccination rate among eligible pa-tients reached an average of 16% over the 5-monthsurveillance period, signi cantly less than the 38% vaccination rate during INT1 ( p/H110210.001). Still, this rate was substantially higher (95% CI, 1.5 -6.7) than the vaccination rates on the control floors during INT1 (16% vs 4.7%, p/H110210.01). In addition, in both INT1 and INT2 there were very few patient refusals \u2014less than 2.5% during all time periods. Importantly, of thepatients whose nurse had initiated the system anddetermined that the patient was a potential candidatefor vaccination, over half (226 of 397, 56.9%) receivedcare from a physician who failed to consider vaccina-tion before discharge, creating an unnecessary missedopportunity. Univariate analysis demonstrated that patients with a form present in the chart were more likely to bevaccinated (OR /H1100520.6, p/H110210.001) and that diabetics were less likely to receive the pneumococcal vaccine(OR/H110050.58, p/H110050.03). Multivariate analysis indicated that positive risk factors for vaccination included havinga form in the chart (OR /H1100528.6, p/H110210.001) and being treated by a nonsurgical physician team (OR /H110052.24, p/H110050.047), while having diabetes (OR /H110050.56, p/H110050.049) negatively impacted vaccination rates when controllingfor race/ethnicity, sex, insurance status, and speci c vaccine indications. Discussion Our nurse-initiated, provider-reminder system was suc-cessful in improving vaccination rates with seven-foldand three-fold increases over control areas during theINT1 and INT2 phases, respectively. These results metor surpassed other reminder systems 6,16 -19and even some standing order programs.6Organizational strate- gies utilizing reminder systems in states that do notauthorize standing orders can be successful at improv-ing vaccination rates. The provider-reminder system was also successful at keeping patient refusal to a minimum, with /H110213% of patients refusing vaccination after it was offered bytheir physician. Patient refusals were higher in otherstudies in which standing orders were utilized. 6-9,11 The reason for our low refusal rates was most likely the physician 's involvement in offering immunizations. Many recent studies20-23have demonstrated a strong correlation between provider immunization recom-mendations and increased patient vaccinations. Nicholet al., 21for example, found that provider recommen- dation was strongly associated with increased in fluenza and pneumococcal vaccinations, regardless of the pa-tients 'positive or negative immunization attitudes. An additional bene t of keeping physicians \u2014and speci - cally those in residency training programs \u2014involved in the immunization process is to assist with the formationof good long-term practice habits. Still, physicians 'lack of compliance directly contrib- uted to the lower vaccination rates during the hospital-wide intervention (INT2). In this teaching facility,nurses were the consistent presence on the floors, while the physician staff had a high turnover rate, with newresidents and faculty rotating in each month. Thisregular turnover created a low institutional memoryamong physicians and hindered the success of theprovider-reminder system. In addition, preventive ser-vices \u2014and more speci cally immunization programs \u2014 conducted in the hospital setting are a low priority forphysicians, thus strengthening the argument for theuse of standing orders, especially in facilities wherephysician turnover is high. In contrast, when patientshad indications, nurses initiated the system almost 70%of the time. If standing orders were hypotheticallyimplemented in this system, it may have resulted inhigher vaccination rates, assuming that nurses wouldoperate equally well with a standing-orders program. In examining published success rates for standing- order programs, we found that INT1 reached a compa-rable vaccination rate to a standing-order programconducted at two small community hospitals in Minne-sota. 6These two hospitals had an average of 29 beds each and reached a vaccination rate of 40%, compara-ble to the pilot study vaccination rates of 38% in our60-bed area. In another standing-order program con-ducted at a 400-bed New York teaching hospital, vacci-nation rates reached 78% with the use of a \"shot nurse. \" 7This program may have faced long-term sus- tainability issues, especially in times of nursing short-ages, where the designated shot nurse may be pulledaway from these duties to assist with other patient carefunctions. Furthermore, in a large teaching hospital Am J Prev Med 2002;22(2) 95such as our facility, a designated shot nurse may not be able to reach all patients before they are discharged. Inner-city urban hospitals are ideal locations for such immunization projects because many patients are athigher risk for contracting invasive pneumococcal dis-ease and have never been vaccinated. An interventionsuch as the one described here can save lives and becost saving even with a 15% vaccination rate. Weestimate that in 2 years approximately 48,000 adults aredischarged from the Grady Health System (GHS) inAtlanta, Georgia; 33,860 (70%) have vaccine indica-tions, and these have never beenvaccinated. On average, 15% of adults with indicationsare HIV infected. We calculated the difference inhospital charges and invasive pneumococcal diseaseincidence and mortality over a 2-year period among thispopulation with the use of a provider reminder thatresults in a discharge vaccination rate of 15%, com-pared to a baseline discharge vaccination rate of 3%.We made the following conservative assumptions:(1) annual invasive pneumococcal disease incidence of100 per 100,000 of HIV-negative adults with indications(Georgia Emerging Infections Program, Atlanta, Geor-gia, unpublished data, 1999) and 800 per 100,000HIV-positive adults 24; (2) invasive pneumococcal dis- ease mortality rate of 15% for both HIV- and non -HIV- infected patients (Georgia Emerging Infections Pro-gram, Atlanta, Georgia, unpublished data, 1999);(3) vaccine ef cacy in in (HIV-infected patients admitted toour hospital have a median CD4 count of /H1102175); (4) pharmacy and administration charges of $17.20 perdose; and (5) an average of $13,000 in hospital chargesper admission with invasive pneumococcal disease(GHS Information Services, unpublished data, 1999).No additional healthcare worker costs were consideredas adult vaccination represents an activity that shouldbe part of usual practice in this setting. Using theseassumptions over a 2-year period, the provider-re-minder system would result in savings of $924,838 inhospital charges, 76 fewer cases of invasive disease, and11 fewer deaths. These ndings are signi cant because most cost-effective prevention programs are not usuallycost saving. Sisk et al. 25state that \"policymakers gener- ally consider costs of up to $50,000 or even $100,000 tobe worth an extra year of healthy life. \"GHS and similar institutions should consider this type of project anopportunity to save money and lives. Obstacles to receiving the pneumococcal vaccine include lack of form placement in the chart by theclerical staff and availability of the vaccine on the floor. Since having the form in the chart was associated withimproved rates, further efforts should be made toimprove the clerical staff 's placement of the form. In our hospital, the protocols and policies developed wereadvocated by the nursing administration. However,floor staff implemented the policy and gaining theirsupport was a more challenging task. This was further complicated by the facts that form placement andvaccination rates decreased by the fth month of surveillance. This observations makes the long-termsustainability of the program questionable. However,vaccination rates of 10% to 15% per year can still beconsidered a cost-effective alternative to no interven-tion. The issue surrounding vaccine availability was thatvaccines were stored in the pharmacy department andsent to floors when orders were made rather than being stocked on the floors. In a few cases, physicians had ordered the vaccine for their patients, but because thevaccine had to be sent up from the pharmacy, thepatients left before being vaccinated. In addition to having a form in the chart, we found that a nonsurgical physician team predicted appropri-ate use of the provider-reminder form and pneumococ-cal vaccination prior to discharge. As the importance ofadult vaccination is not emphasized in surgical house - ofcer training, this is not surprising. It was surprising that patients with diabetes (overall the most commonvaccine indication in our patients) were less likely to beappropriately vaccinated than nondiabetics, and we arenot able to offer a speci c explanation for this nding. Undervaccination of diabetics is a problem nationally;black diabetics have a 20% prevalence of pneumococ-cal vaccination. 26Many patients and providers are not aware that diabetes is an indication for both pneumo-coccal and in fluenza vaccines. Additional factors may have in fluenced the decrease in vaccination rates during the hospital-wide interven-tion. For example, during INT1 education was pro-vided for each physician team assigned to the interven-tion floors, while during INT2 all physician services were educated at a brief meeting rather than at thephysician team level. Furthermore, during INT1 floors were monitored for 4 weeks, while during INT2 floors were monitored for only 1 week during each month.The surveillance staff was not present on a daily basisduring INT2, and their day-to-day presence duringINT1 may have heightened both nurse awareness andphysician awareness, thereby affecting vaccinationrates. Inpatient vaccine programs at urban inner-city hos- pitals should be considered a standard of care andshould continue to be pursued as efforts are made toreach Healthy People 2010 objectives. 27In a recent article, Dexter et al.28describe a successful computer- ized reminder system for patients hospitalized in anurban, public teaching hospital. This program wasmade possible by the presence of computer orderentry, automatic \"screening \"for vaccine indications by the computer, and the fact that physicians could re-spond to the prominent reminder with a single key-stroke. Improved hospital information systems, such asthose used by Dexter et al., 28will eliminate problems such as the absence of a form in the chart and will be 96 American Journal of Preventive Medicine, Volume 22, Number 2the key to sustaining success with provider-reminder interventions. It is possible that vaccine interventionprograms may not be as effective in community hospi-tals where the prevalence of vaccine indications may belower and patients may have had more vaccinations.Organizing reminder programs or standing-order sys-tems in outpatient settings should be pursued, espe-cially in areas serving minority populations, but inpa-tient interventions can serve to reach the patients athighest risk. States such as Minnesota and New York have standing orders for adult pneumococcal vaccination. The Geor-gia Medical Practice Act does not speci cally prohibit standing orders in inpatient settings. However, we wereunable to nd any other Georgia hospital using a standing order for inpatients, and our lawyers were notready to permit one at our institution without clearprovision in the Medical Practice Act. In states that donot have Medical Practice Acts authorizing standingorders for nurses in hospital settings, ACIP recommen-dations for standing-order programs can have littleimpact. Therefore, we suggest considering the substitu-tion of provider-reminder systems as an interim solu-tion while pursuing standing-order legislation for adultvaccines. While our results are comparable to somepublished standing-order programs, the high rate ofphysician noncompliance is a clear barrier and contrib-utes to continuing missed opportunities. Even with thisbarrier, our protocol was measurably more successfulthan no protocol. Widespread implementation of stan-dardized protocols for inpatient vaccination with in flu- enza and pneumococcal vaccines could have positiveimpact for the health of the general adult population. We are grateful to Debbie Vigliotti, PharmD, Julie Rubin, PharmD, Gwen Catchings, RN, and Frances Williams, RN, fortheir advice and support during the development and imple-mentation phases of this project. In addition, we are gratefulto the Grady Health System inpatient staff for their coopera-tion and patience during implementation.
