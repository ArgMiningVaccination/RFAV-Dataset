Health or the relative, absence of it can serve as a discriminating feature betweenthe developed and the developing world. The health conditions that characterize many Third World nations arethose that characterized the developed nations one hundredyears ago.They include high infant mortality rates, highbirth rates, high morbidity rates and a relatively abbreviatedlife expectancy at birth.Today in the Third World themajor causes of death are still infectious diseases as opposed to degenerative diseases in industrial nations.The improvement of health status of Third Worldpopulations is the result of a complex meshing of factorsand cannot be simplistically attributed to the modernizationand development of medical care. Frequently policy makers end political leaders think that health and medicine aresynonymous and, as a result, also think that the promotionof health requires the presence of hospitals, the training ofspecialized physicians and the acquisition of the mostadvanced medical technologies. The seminal work of McKeown and an increasing number of studies have shownthat, historically, health improvements have been associatedwith better environmental habitats, nutrition and education,and not so much with the presence of medical facilities and xpersonnel.This is an important acknowledgement. Unfor- tunately,it has been erroneously interpreted by many tomean economic development.That is, the placement ofmedical care after other prerequisites for improving thehealth status has led to the false assumption that economicgrowth will be followed by better health conditions. Thisnew inte -pretation is now being questioned by some studentsof development and, more and more, we find evidencesuggesting that development, modernization and the tech-nologies used to produce them not only have a limitedimpact on health, but in sone instances they have haddetrimental effects on the health status of the population.This collection of articles is devoted to the study ofthe impact of technological and economic development onthe Third World within the context of health status. Inthis respect, impact can best be analyzed in terms of effect.There can be both positive and negative effects resultingfrom the implementation of a development program. Positive effects are those that contribute to an improved healthstatus as exemplified by improved economic conditions, theadoption of health-enhancing behavioral practices, cleanerenvironmental conditions and political and financial policiesthat support action to alleviate poor health standards.Negative effects are, of course, those that contribute to adecrease in health status either through a loss of economicor agricultural capabilities, poorer environmental conditions,abandonment of '..raditional health-promoting culturalpractices, social stress or political prevention. The effectsof a particular program can be multiple and may perhapsreflect both positive and negative trends.Ina similar yet distinct view,itis obvious that technologies can be used for the benefit of a few or for thebenefit of the majority.It is not a matter of questioningthe potential that modern technologies might have for thegood of mankind.What needs to be critically analyzed isthe manner in which new technologies are used, and theway in which the very same process of development andmodernization is being implemented. In this regard, the evidence is very disquieting, because the examples that areemerging from many nations strongly suggest that those whoreap the benefits of modern technologies and the develop-ment of the Third World are their elites and the industrialnations.With some qualifications, this analysis can be Ito xiapplied to the health sector. We underline the need to qualify it because the health sector is particularly complex,and little will be gained by making gross generalizations.Thus, low infant mortalityis strongly correlated with economic development, major advances are being made inthe Third World in the control of a few contagious diseases,and life and suffering siving technologies have beenintroduced successfully in many countries.Scholars and practitioners of development theory haveoften questioned the appropriateness of introducing newadvanced technologies in the Third World. Cost-benefit analysis, social conditions such as high levels of un/under-employment, and lack of supporting facilities are commonlyvoiced as reasons to delay the transfer of these techno-logies.The term \"adequate technologies\" has been coinedand become part of developmental jargon. Again, with some qualifications, this analysis can be applied to the healthsector.Thus, the concept of cost-benefit analysis might beinadequate when we deal with life and suffering saving technologies.But new technologies which increase costsand do not produce new curative effects, such as me-toodrugs, can certainly be classified as undesirable. At the same time, there is a danger that life and suffering savingtechnologies may be classified as inappropriate only becausethey are costly.It is frequently argued that high tech-nology hospitals or equipment are not adequate or appro-priate because the investment of resources in these facilitiesand/or technologies have less impact on health than if theseresources had been allocated to primary health care. This is a false dilemma. The way in which some technologies areused may be questionable.For example, the use of tertiaryand/or university hospitals for normal deliveries is not awise allocation of resources. New, expensive and scientifi-cally demonstrated life and suffering saving technologiesshould be used in the Third World and elsewhere. The argument can be made that the choice is not between thesetechnologies and primary care, but between them and otherexpenditures, such as military equipment. We do not denythe futility of acquiring technologies which cannot be usedbecause of the lack of necessary supporting materials orpersonnel.Students of Third World , iealth services are wellacquainted with examples of expensive equipm' At that waspurchased and never installed, or installed equipment that isseldom utilized.These cases should not be offered as 1.1 xiiexcuses for postponing the introduction of life and sufferingsaving technologies, however, but as examples for the needof improved planning.We are not opposed to the use of advanced andexpensive technologies in the Third World, as is clearlymanifested in the previous paragraph. However, there are many technologies which are introduced in the Third World,for the purpose of producing economic growth, that can beconsidered as undesirable for the development of a countryand for the health ofits population.Fertilizers and pesticides are one of the many examples frequently used toillustrate the negative effects of modernization on thequality of life and health of Third World populations. The introduction of extensive cash cropping has, in many regionsof the world, depleted the soil of nutrients. When this occurs, growers, in order to maintain the level of produc-tion; need to introduce large amounts of fertilizers whichcontaminate the soil and enter into the food chain. On thesocial side, cash cropping tends to concentrate landownership in the hands of a few and increase unemploymentamong the peasants.Furthermore, cash crop prices fluctu-ate so wildly that once prosperous regions can becomesuddenly economically depressed. The following example clearly shows the interrelationship between modernizationand health.A cotton growing region in Northern Mexicowhich used large amounts of fertilizers had to discontinueproduction when prices collapsed. The region was then turned into alfalfa to be used as feed for a newly developeddairl industry. Some time later, a research team found thatchemicals in quantities considered unsafe from the fertilizersand pesticides used for the cotton were present in the diaryproducts.Another type of questionable technologies are thosedeveloped to undo the damage incurred in the process ofeconomic growth and development, or to reduce the costs ofservices. The concept of risk-benefit is invoked frequentlyas a decisive factor' in the implementation of a chosentechnology.It is frequently the case that, when such atechnology is applied with the objective of reducing illness,little research has been conducted to explore possiblealternative solutions without potential side effects. This is the case, for example, with chlorine, a convenient andinexpensive chemical with harmful side effects. This12 chemical need not be used for water purification when thereare Ither treatment or handling technologies available, albeitmore expensive.In the health sector, particularly in the Third World,we find E. number o7 technologies which have been producedto cover the exploitation of the many by the few. We would call then. palliative technologies, a protot7pe c` whichare the oral rehydration salts. The treatment of diarrhea by the inexpensive and easy to prepare package of saltsserves to postpone the introduction of social changesrequired to prevent rather than cure the disease, thustransforming the Alma Ata declaration into a cruc' parody.A few have gone so far as to include some vaccinations asexamples of palliative technologies.The articles that follow are mostly written from theperspective of what has come to be known as the politicaleconomy of health, although it could be argued that a moreappropriate term might be the political sociology of healthand illness,since the articles deal more with issues ofpower and domination than with the economic aspects ofthese relationships. The article by Grazia Borrini presents atheoretical overview of those elements generally consideredto be the principal determinants of the Third World's heaithstatus. A review of the standard theoretical constructs usedto e. plain the existence of widespread poor health condi-tions in the Third World is presented. Discussion is centered on the concept of intervention with regard togovernmental and international financial agency response andcommunity action.Change, as a feature of development, has becomerapidly accelerated in the past twenty years and has hadlargely unanticipated results. The massive trend forurbanizationis apparent in nearly every country of theThird World.The rapid concentration of populations incities as a result of internal migration and high birth rateshas caused enormous problems of overcrowding and oftendismally inadequate provision of municipal services such assanitation and wafer supply. However, the aisadvantagesmay be outweighed by the greater accessibility of healthcare services, a greater opportunity for profitable employ -n.ent and enhanced educational avenues. Halberstein's article provides an overview of the effects of urbanizationn xivon health status in the Third World. The author discusses many of the features of the urbanization process, i.e. physical living conditions, noise and pollution levels,changing morbidity and dietary patterns, that are affectinghealth in explosively growing cities of the developingnations.The selection by Feyisetan describes an in-depth studyof one aspect of modernization and urbanization, that of theimplementation and utilization of municipal water, sanitationand disposal system.The author's findings present aninteresting example which demonstrates that technologiesproven to be successful for the maintenance of health inadvanced nations may have the op- site effect in the ThirdWorld.The rapidly changing conditions in the Third World andthe glaring inadequacies of governments to meet the basichealth needs of their populations have served as a moti-vating factor in the World Health Organization's develop-ment of a primary health care policy which has beenadopted by the gover ments of virtually all of the ThirdWorld nations.The policy of primary health care is agrassroots system wherein administrative procedure isconceived as a process channeled from the bottom up versusthe case in industrialized health service systems. The community itself is considered the focal point of theprimary health care system and the mobilization of commu-nity members with the utilization of appropriate technologiesis integral to the philosophy. Melville's research note onthe work of Communit;' Health Aides in Jamaica illustratesthe role of community workers as a principal component ofa primary health care program. The author builds a case for the effectiveness of the CHA in improving nutritionalstandards in one of the more economically stressed areas ofthe country.The strategy of primary health care has been lessemphasized in the urban areas of the developing world thanin the rural.Perhaps more evident in the urban zones hasbeen the evolving tendency for the development andimportation of First World medical care strategies. How-ever, there has been little effort to gauge and/or assess therelativa success of primary health care policies in a broadsense.The conjunction of the acceleration of development14 XVstrategies with the implementation of a high technology andalternative health care systems in the Third World is onethat should not be ignored. Nor should the effect of \"modern\" health care service delivery on traditional patternsof health care be ignored.A goal of primary health carepolicies is a comfortable mixing of traditional and modernmedical beliefs and practices that are socially and medically,appropriate.Bletzer's work on the Ngawbere of Panamaconsiders the impact of the entry of \"modern\", nontradi-tional health care services on cultural networks andrelationships of an indigenous population.Programs designed to promote industrial developmentare in evidence through the less developed countries of theworld.Development of industry includes the importation ofsophisticated equipment and the need for trained workers tooperate it.Industrial development often emphasizes urbangrowth as it frequently requires a large concentration ofpeople from which to draw its employees. The results of industrial development are diverse and can range fromincreasing wage earning potential so as to procure a moreadequate diet, an essential component of good health, tocreating a situation where the occupational hazards ofworking in the industrial arena far outweigh the benefits inrelationship to health standards. The case study presentedby Jackson and Stocker examines the impact of a regionaldevelopment project in central Mexico with specific regardto the needs and necessities of the poor population of thearea, the intended \"target population\".Industrial development has as a major feature theutilization of advertising techniques to sell the finishedproduct.The use of media and advertising can haveextremely important effects on health status and healthpractices.These effects can be both positive and negative.The most well-known case of a negative effect is that ofthe strong advertising campaign used by some infant formulaproducers in the Third World. The result was a drastic riseininfant mortality deaths as a consequence of incorrectusage of infant formula and improper preparation techniques.The paper by Cerquiera et al. on infant feeding practices inMexico illustrates the effects of advertising on infantnutrition in addition to the effects of changing lifestyles asa result of urbanization and increased female employment.The article addresses several important issues, particularly xviwith regard to the sociocultural incentives for shifting frombottle to breast feeding.The initiation of industries related to health care mustalso be considered within the realm of industrial develop-ment.Many countries have started to produce their ownpharmaceuticals and are now able to sell them to theirpopulace at a fraction of the cost of an imported drug.MedLal equipment has also started to be produced bydeveloping nations.The importation and development ofhigh and moderate technology systems relating to healthcare services and products has resulted in the increased useof pharmaceuticals and greater immunization coverage.However, the inappropriate and often extreme overuse ofpharmaceuticals has been well documented. The articles devoted to the topic of pharmaceuticals in this issue presentspecific case examples which demonstrate the channeling ofdrugs through the various networks present in the countryand the sociocultural perceptions of pharmaceutical usagepatterns. The authors of these three articles, Alubo, Stockand van der Geest, concur on the conclusion that while thenational government health agencies often cannot provideadequate pharmaceutical coverage, the same drugs arereadily available in the private sector. The three articles touch on different aspects of a similar topic, the role offinancial gain in pharmaceutical distribution, which allowsfor an interesting point of comparison within Africa andother developing nations.The use of microcomputers has become virtuallyinstitutionalizedin the health service sector of thedeveloped world.Itisalso increasingly becoming aniirportant tool for administrative and information processingtasks in businesses and public sector services in the ThirdWorld. Questions have been raised as to the appropriatenessof this new trend in the developing nations with the obviousimplications of possible over-expenditures on imported,sophisticated equipment when there is sc much need forbasic equipment and services. Bertrand addresses these issues in his article and provides a case study to illustratethe tasks performed with a microcomputer in a developingcountry's public health sector. While there is no questionthat microcomputers will become standard office equipmentfor the health sector in the Third World, what still remainsan issue is the impact on decision-making which may be16. xviimade by the additional information made available throughthe use of a computer.Past experiences suggest that theavailable information was seldom used by policy makers.There is no evidence to suggest that increased amount ofinformation will change this situation.Developers commonly stress the goals of agriculturaldevelopment as a means of improving living conditions ofthe world's poor.Agricultural development can includehighly technological innovations such as the use of sophisti-cated machinery to enhance production and create greateracreage for cultivation.Agricultural development programscan also be designed for more participation in the economicrealm of a country by shifting from a subsistence-basedagricultural system to one devoted to the cultivation of cashcrops for sale on the world market. Techniques employed by developers include creating greater amounts of arablelands through damming of rivers and other landscapemodification efforts.The use of pesticides and herbicideshas become extremely common in the Third World as aresult of the desire to improve crop production. The shift from subsistence to cash crops may have an effect on thebuying i.., wer of the population and/or it may decreaseavailable food resources to the poor. Again, the effects of agricultural development can be both negative and positive.Ugaide's contribution examines the effects of agriculturaldevelopment from the perspective of the internationalagricultural trade and its effect on the local situation withregard to agricultural products available and the economicresources necessary for their purchase.The articlesinthis issue devoted to the impact oftechnological and economic development on health status inthe Third World provide an avenue with which to displaymany of the programs that have been initiated in a varietyof Third World settings and to evaluate their impact onhealth status.The effects of technological and economicdevelopment on health that are examined by the authors ofthis collection include several of those factors that convergeto characterize a population's health status. As mentioned previously, we are well aware that this issue can only touchupon some of these important factors and cannot assume tobe fully comprehensive in its scope. However, the top!cs discussed and case studies presented reflect the diversity ofprograms, policies and technological interventions imple- xviiinented to promote health status in a number of LatinAmerican and African countries. The selection of articles presented is predominantly negative in their conclusions.Only two of the twelve present information supportingpositive health effects of some aspects of developmentprograms.Nonetheless, the result should not be a sense ofoverwhelming pessimism or failure; rather, it should be onewhere the information presented will serve for change andprogress in the goal of elevating health standards in theThird World.As readers, the material presented in thefollowing pages can provide us with the opportunity tocompare and contrast programs, social aryl political situa-tion, policies and effects and theoretical constructs andarguments.Perhaps this issue cm* :-.2!p to serve as a toolwith which to design future programs that have as their aimthe elimination of past mistakes and the optimization of thechanges for success of future programs and policies. 18 OVERVIEW Ei HEALTH AND DEVELOPMENT:A MARRIAGE OF HEAVEN AND HELL? GRAZIA BORRINIUniversity of California, Berkeley INTRODUCTIONThe customs, the environment and the ways of life ofthe inhabitants of our planet vary enormously between urbanand rural populations, men and women, rich and poor, peopleof different race, cast, class, culture and religion. Today,however, it is most common to hear about the differencesbetween \"developed\" and \"underdeveloped\" people (alsoeuphemistically called \"developing\" people). Neglectins judgements of merit and preference, which find meaningonly within that culture which created a particular way oflife, we can ask ourselves whether these differences arereflected in the health status of the population. For instance, we can compare a few general indicators ofphysical survival and wellbeing. We find (see Table I) thatthe average life span is much longer in rich and developedcountries (mainly, but not entirely, because of a smallerinfant mort7,1ity).We find that infectious diseases andparasites arct much more common in poor and underdevelopedcountries (this may be partially explained by their mostlytropical climate, and bait -iced by the fact that other typesof illness are not so widespread). It is in these countries,and especially in recently born shantytowns around the maincities or in some desolate rural areas, that we meet withthe worst sanitary conditions: clean water still a luxury. no sewers, large families crowded in small places with inade-quate heating, cooking and washing facilities, very poorpersonal and property security; adults and children workinglong hours in dangerous environments, medical and socialassistance almost nonexistent.

Is therean immediate cause of such events? Or are we dealing withthe acute phase of a chronic disease (only those die fromhunger who are also in normal times exposed to hunger)?There exist precise theories and opinions about the maindeterminants of the African famine and similar catastrophes,and in general about the health scarcity of underdevelopedpopulations.The analysis of these theories is very signifi-cant, for it is the way in which a problem is defined thatinspires and indicates its possible \"solution\". This paper willdiscuss these theories by grouping them within a fewfundamental and climate; (2)population historical factors and recentdynamics of socio-culture change. Different kinds of developmental projects and interventions will then beconnected with the underlying, often unexpressed, assump-tions about the health problems which they are supposed tosolve.Some conclusion will be drawn on the relationshipbetween development and health.GEOGRAPHY AND CLIMATEThe drought that recently struck the Sahel (the zonebordering the southern Sahara desert and extendiny fromthe Senegal almost to the Red Sea) is a climatic pheno-menon.Some hypothesizedit was caused by a climaticmutation on a grand temporal scale, tied to variations ofvolcanic activity and to the increased concentration ofcarbon dioxide in the atmosphere (Bryson 1973). Othersinvoked the sunspots (Lamb 19714). Still others suggested that an increased concentration of dust may have blockedthe sunlight and so created a colder and dr. ,t- than normalzone in the Sahel.The dust would have originated from theground erosion of vast areas whose covering vegetation hadslowly disappeared (Mc Lead 1976). An alleged rapid desertification of the areas to the south of the Sahara hadbeen denounced for a long time (Stebbing 1937; USAID 1972; 6Ware 1975), but not without controversies concerning itsextent (Dalby and Harrison 1973) and its causes. Some maintained that the traditional slash and burn agriculturalpractices, which make use of large fires to clean the landfrom vegetation before sowing, damaged the environment(Stabbing 1937). Others, however, asserted that thesepractices are innocuous or actually beneficial for the localecology, and at any rate limited in their extension (Frankeand Chasin 1980).Factors of a much more recent origin,such as the conversion of large forests to open space for cultivation, the intensive use of the soil, and above all thedestruction of the vegetable covering by the overgrazing ofpasture animals, were also supposed to have caused thedeterioration of the environment that led to the drought(Stamp 1940; Wade 1974; Franke and Chasin 1980).According to this last hypothesis, climatic changes are caused by human interference with an already fragileecosystem, and not by bizarre celestial events (Ball 1975).And, indeed, not only in Africa can ecological deteriorationbe ascribed to a bad use of existing resources. On the island of Jeva, ground erosion has been caused by an indiscriminate destruction of the forests, first by Dutchcolonizers to make room for plantations, then by theJapanese army, who cut large amounts of timber for militarypurposes. The results is that where once luxurious forestsgrew, the land is now dry and desolate (Franke 1974). TheNortheast of Brazil, a once most fertile region withenormous potential for the production of food, is now to alarge extent an arid and infertile land which has been aptlydescribed as 600,000 square meters of suffering (De Castro1966). The trees and the natural vegetation were eliminated to make room for sugar cane plantations; these exploited thetop-soil and left behind a poor, sterile, largely eroded land,which is now easy prey to floods. Similarly, extended laterization of the soil has followed cotton growing schemespromoted by the Sudanese government in the Azande area (McNeil 1972).In El Salvador, the coffee plantations havedisplaced the villages and their crops from the more fertile volcanic land.The population was forcefully relocated intozones with poorer and more fragile soil whzh has beenrapidly exhausted tDurham 1979). Nor are the great forestsof the planet spared, in Amazonia, Guyana, and in theCongo basin.They area being increasingly exploited forcommercial purposes and for the production of food, causing23 7the destruction of an enormous number of unique and stiillargely unknown plant species, which may lead to unforese.2-able climatic consequences (Raven 1984).When disasters such as a drought or a flood are not directly responsible for miserable human health conditions,the intrinsic poverty of a region is often cited as the cause. The Sahel, for instance, is generally described as a miser- able zone, able to produce only the bare minimum forkeeping the population alive even in years of regularprecipitations.Yet historically the Sahel has sustained thedevelopment of some of the vastest and richest Africanempires, such as the empire of Ghana (500-1200), the empireof Mali (1200-1450),the empire of Songhay (1450-1600) andvarious kingdoms that existed at different times Senegal (Awe empires could have developedonly if there existed an ample surplus of food and exchangeproducts.In fact, there is no reason to assume that a fragile ecological system must necessarily be poor and unproductive.The Sahel only can be viewed as a poor geographic-climatic area if considered in isolation. In reality, however, the Sahel is inserted into an ecological system which, ingradual transition towards the south, changes from desertwithout any vegetation outside the oases to steppe withseasonal shrubs, to grassland, land covered with an inc-easing amount and variety of vegetation, thickly woodedspots, marsh regions and, finally, tropical rainforests. Thecharacter of the terrain is modified by the seasons, whichregulate the hot and dry wind of the north and the humidwind of the south, which brings rains quite irregular inquantity and distribution.Nomadism is ideal for this kindof geography.Indeed, the Sahel has always been inhabitedby nomadic herder populations. Traditionally, during the rainy season the nomads left the humid land of the south,because the marshes and water currents breed the tsetsefly,bearer of a grave cattle disease, and the north offerssufficient pastures for the animals. During the dry season they returned south, having travelled thousands of kilo-meters and established contact with a great number ofdiverse groupsA typical encounter, very important forboth parties, was with the sedentary farmer populations ofthe south.The nomads exchanged meat, milk and milk 44 8products for millet and vegetables, while their cattlefertilized the land for future sowing. For a very long time this complex ecological and social reality allowed thepeoples of the Sahel to live in prosperity and to exploit thelocal resources in an adequate and well-balanced manner.Thus, it is rather superficial to define these lands as poorand inhospitable.If the balance is presently breaking, thiscan not be ascribed to a change in geography or climate(Franke and Chasin 1980).The arguments that reduce problems of precarious lifeto climatic- geographic conditions can be summarized withthe word scarcity; hunger is the result of scarcity of food,just as poverty and misery are results of an insufficientproduction of material goods and services. According to Lapp4 and Collins (1977), this hypothesis serves only toconceal the real causes and responsibilities of the so-callednatural disasters.They report that in 1942 more than oneand a half million people starved to death in Bengal, aregion in the Northwest of India. !t is true that the riceharvest in the season preceding the famine was exceedinglypoor because of lack of rain, but it is also true that in thevery same year India exported both rice and grain.Furthermore, in the years preceding the famine the produc-tion of cotton increased by 85% due to huge investments,vhile the per-capita production of rice in Bengal declinedby 38% (Blyn 1966).The situation was very similar duringthe famine of 1974 in Bangladesh, While people literally died for le:* of food, four million tons of rice were storedin expectation of a price increase. Again in Mali, in the years before the famine of 1970-74, the land cultivated incotton doubled while the land cultivated incerealsdecreased.And in Latin America, where malnutrition iswidespread, half the land iruse (generally the most fertileland) is used for growing export crops and breeding cattle(again for export).Scarcity, therefore,, is nothing but amyth (Lapp4 and Collins 1977). Indeed, there are even scholars who maintain that it is the very wealth of a region- both in human and natural terms which created the conditions for exploitation during colonial times, and hastherefore resulted in misery and underdevelopment today(Frank 1972; Galeano 1973). In fact, favorable geologicaland climatic conditions, and a healthy indigenous labor forcewere needed for the establishment of the colonial exporteconomies.25 9The difference between life conditions in the geograp-hical North and South is real. This is most dramatically evidenced in statistics of life expectancy: most countries inwhich the average life expectancy is less than sixty, oreven fifty years, are situated in equatorial and tropicalareas (World Bank 1985).But the North-South difference,which is principally of a geographic and climatic nature(amount and periodicity of rainfall, solar irradiation, windand ocean currents, kinds of flora and fauna), is also cultural,social, and historical difference. Whether the particular geo-climatic conditions of the Southern countrieshave determined their social and historical paths, or whethertheir historical paths have conditioned and shaped thepresent human interaction with the natural environment, is amatter of debateMost likely, both phenomena intertwinedthrough the centuries to produce the present situation andthe marked North-South differences we observe today inquantitative indicators of human survival.POPULATION PRESSUREThe second category or current of thought concerningthe causes of hunger and health scarcity focuses on thepopulation factor and its pressure on the natural environ-ment.While the world's population increases at an accele-rating rate, those who reproduce more quickly are thepoorer and less well fed (PRB 19814). Each additional person is said to aggravate the problem not only because he or sheis an additional mouth to be fed, but because he or she is afurther weight for the ecological system and the economy ofa country (Meadows et al.1972; Ehrlich 1973; Brown andEckholm 1974; Echols 1976).The become more and more arid because there aretoo many cattle consuming the meager vegetation. In turn, the cattle increase in number because people increase innumber (Wade 1974).Thus, in the Sahelian and otherexamples of ecologic and economic crises, excessive popula-tion would be the mrin culprit.This simple and direct analysis is perhaps one of thebest known and most accessible to the public. Bu its simplicity can hide superficiality. Certainly, a rapidly increasing population presents grave problems in the shortrun.For such a population the relative number of childrenis very high, therefore the need for social services is very 10high.If the growth of production keeps pace with thedemographic growth, the pressure on the environment mayas well increase.Yet, it does not foilow that the naturalresources, used in an appropriate way, would not be capableof sustaining a population larger than the present one(Simon 1977).A study by the Massachusetts Institute ofTechnology maintained that by itself the Sahel couldproduce food for two million people in addition to thoseactually living there (Seifert and Kamrany 1974) .And e-nsidering the potential productivity of all the nations ofthe continent, a study estimated that Africa could nourishup to almost three times its actual population (World Bank1984).Furthermore, economic growth seems to proceedmore rapidly in countries in which the population expandsthan in countries with a stable population (Simon 1977).Until recently, the production of food has, on theaverage, kept pace with the population increase, not only inthe world at large but also in poor countries considered asa separate group (Murdoch 1980). There are, however, numerous exceptions, mainly among the countries of sub-Saharan Africa.For instance, Somalia, Mozambique,Senegal, Lesotho and Zambia have seen their food produc-tion per capita drop by about 30$ in a few years (WorldBank 1985).As regards the future, some writers presentthe situation as a desperate race between the production offood and the increase in population. Although some view the future with optimism (Bale and Duncan 1983; Simon andKahn 1984),in general the predictions are gloomy. In particular, the Global 2000 rer3rt to the United StatesPresident has called much attention to the progressiveerosion of Earth's carrying capacity. According to the report, the present environmental and population-relatedstresses are bound to result in impoverishment and lifedegradation for many of the world's inhabitants (USCEQ1980). How could the sub-Saharan countries produce enoughfood for fifteen to twenty million additional people everyyear, when today they are not even able to feed their livingpopulation ( Adedeji 1985)?Evenifin the future there will be enough food tosustain the whole world's population, it is unlikely that thepoor countries will be able to pay the price on the worldmarkets (Brandt Commission 1983). This pessimistic point ofview has led to theories of so-called lifeboat ethics.27 11According to these theories, only part of the population ofthis planet will be able to survive: those without hope should be left to their fate as quickly as possible (Paddockand Paddock 1967; Hardin 1974). Food aid should be concentrated on those countries who \"can hope to make it\"(triage), otherwise one would merely end up encouragingpopulation growth, and therefore aggravating the problemrather than solving it (Hardin, 1976). Others maintain that food aid is dangerous not \"because it helps to keep alivepeople without space and resources\", but because it createsa situation of forced dependence on foreign countries, it hasa negative influence on the production of food in thereceiving countries and it tends to neutralize the popularpressure for reforms (Lappd et al. 1981). Also, food aid often promotes the consumption of non-local products. For instance, 60-70% of US food aid to Africa consists of grainor flour, foreign to local production and consumptionpatterns (Jackson 1982).In addition, food aid tends tooccur in a discoordinated and discontinuous way, and in avacuum of structural reforms. The African nations shouldcount on planned and safe support for at least severalyears; they would be able to develop local production andexecute reforms (Eicher 1982).Many of those who have firmly rejected \"lifeboatethics\" maintain that the growth of population and thepatterns of food production are intimately connected andmutually dependent.According to Murdoch (1980),itis poverty, and especially poverty in the rural areas, whichmakes it impossible to nourish the increasing population and,at the same time, limits the food production. This vicious cycle would be maintained and reinforced by both theinternal economic structure of many developing countries,and the external constraints imposed or. them by the richnations.Mamdani (1972) has emphasized that populationdensity is not in itself a problem (\"the masses of Calcuttamake a greater impression on us than the masses of Londonnot because one deals here with more people, but withpeople who are visibly poor and in a miserable condition\").And Franke and Chasin (1980) present the argument in anoriginal way:The people of the Sahel were not simply produc-ing more people to be cared for during the yearsnrecedinq the famine:they were also producing 12more from the land, for outside markets as wellas for themselves.It could be argued that oncethe drought came, larger and more dense popula-tions would have had more human resources toput to work in both relief efforts and efforts tosalvage the environment and begin the process ofreconstruction. That people were not put at workat these tasks can hardly be a byproduct of theirnumbers per se. The explanation must be soughtin the organization of these efforts.But why does population increase? What drives the poorer people to set so many children into the world? Mostoften, the answer is that poor people behave rationally:many children mean greater possibilities for the entirefamily - while one son can seek work in the city and sendmoney home, others can take care of the fields, and of theill or elderly relatives (Mamdani 1972).To have many children multiplies the chances of survival of the family, animportant factor in precarious living situations. This startedat the time of the colonial domination. The colonial period (from the slave trade to the extortion of taxes, from theforced induction into foreign armies to the progressiveexploitation of localland and resources) stimulated thecolonized population to have large families in order tosurvive.It is true that medical interventions and sanitationcontributed to decrease the mortality rate, and this resultedin population increase.tisalso true that parental motivations are still the main -eason for population growth.Imnrovements in the life conditions of the parents andbetter chances of survival for the children already born arelikely to reduce the birthrate in developing countries just asthese factors have reduced it in developed ones (Murdoch1980).In fact, the birthrate is negatively correlated toeconomic well being, the availability of social services andthe level of employment and education (especially for thefemale population).Finally, some ask whether it isillogical for thepopulation to expand in those African countries - like Malior Burkina Faso - which could use more rural labor (Frankeand Chasin1980).If, however, that shortage was due tomigration to urban areas,it would not be mitigated by with Latin American countries have no realsurplus of people; on the contrary, they have toofew.Brazil has thirty-eight times fewer inhabi-tants per square mile than Belgium, Paraguay hasforty-nine times fewer than England, Peru hasthirty-two times fewer than Japan. Haiti and El Salvador, the human antheaps of Latin America,have lower population density than Italy. The spreading and imposing of family planning [...1aims to justify the very unequal income distribu-tion between countries and social classes, to convince the poor that poverty is the result ofthe children they do not avoid having. These pretexts are an insult to our intelligence, the realintentions [of these policies) anger us.Evidently, a thorough exploration of the population contro-versy has to take into account absolute indicators, such asdemographic counts and growth rates, together with relativeindicators, such as population density in particularly poor orrich areas, distribution of resources, and cultural and socialchange.ECONOMIC UNDERDEVELOPMENTAccording to the third current of thought, theproblems of the so-called Third World result mainly from itseconomical and technological \"backwardness\". The key categories here are development and underdevelopment.Bridging the gap between the two requires the moderniza-tion of the productive sectors by means of appropriatecapital investments, technological innovations and expansionof infrastructures.Prime indicator of development is thegrowth of the gross national product (GNP) and of thevolume of exchanges in the internal and internationalmarkers. Again, the analysis is very simple. People suffer because they lack goods and services: the 'cake' is not big enough for all.Increase the dimensions of the cake(increase the amount of goods and services), and theproblem will be solved. Although the concept of \"developingother countries\" can be traced to colonial times, its impulse,and its emphasis on economics, peaked after World War II.The successes of the Marshall Plan and Recovery Programsin Europe suggested that an extension of economic aid toThird World countries would have soon lifted them out of3(1 114thei.. \"backward\" conditions.This, many argue, is what indeed occurred.Data collected in the last decades show apositive correlation between indicators of economic develop-ment (for example, the GNP), and some health indicators(see Table 1).Also, food production increased substantiallyafter the introduction of new seeds, such as the varieties ofrice and grain of the \"Green Revolution\" (Bale and Duncan1983).Itis usually assumed that if the total caloricproduction of a country has increased, the nutritional statusof its population has improved.All theories of economic development are strategies forincreasing the dimensions of the 'cake', and aim to increaseits per capita consumption. Some theories emphasize the role of capital investment as a prerequisites for development(Nurkse 1953; Hirschman invest-ments in the economic sector sustain production andstimulate the demand for goods and services in the internalmarket, while investments in the socio-political sector aremeant to remove the structural obstacles to \"economictakeoff\".International aid fits well into this scheme,providing both capital and technological innovations. Other theories, following more closely the analyses of Marx andRicardo, accentuate the labor force rather than capital.According to them, any production increase is a consequenceof the increased productivity of the labor force (Myint1954), or of its use in a more appropriate way (Lewis 1955).Whether we look at matters from a standpoint of socialistideology (Lenin 1963; (Little 19814), the picture is the same:economic development must be promoted to control thenatural environment and thereby increase the wellbeing andhealth of the human population. In turn, economic develop- ment can only be achieved through the continuous innova-tion and improvement of the means of production, that is, itdepends on scientific and technological progress.Economic theorists have dealt at length with the roleof capital,labor and technology, but have neglected thecontribution to the productive process of both the naturalenvironment and the specific cultural milieux of the affectedpopulations.The natural environment (the \"rest of thesystem\") has most often been treated as a process constant.31 15This assumption was perhaps reasonable in the early decadesof the industrial revolution. Lately, however, with thedevelopment of more powerful and widespread technologicalmeans, along with the sustained growth of human popula-tion, the natural environment has been strongly affected bythe production of goods and services (chemical and radio-active pollution, destruction of specific habitats, disappearance of vegetable and animal species, near depletion ofirreplaceable resources, transformation of natural intoartificial systems, climatic and geographical changes, etc.)Nature displays strong resilience and the ability to restore ahealthy equilibrium after injury, yet some natural environ-ments have already been hopelessly sacrificed, and theplanetary ecological equilibrium is showing disquieting signsof progressive deterioration. Despite allthis, economicscience tends to deal with the environment as if the ser:ondlaw of thermodynamics would not exist or would not applyto economic phenomena (Ueorgescu-Roegen 1971).In the short term, the price of environmental deterio-ration is mostly felt by the weakest social strata, such asthe poor living in highly polluted industrial environments,the nomads deprived of the vast grazing lands necessary forthe survival of their herds, or the people dislocated frc--.their homes because of the building of dams or the estab-lishment of industrial, commercial or touristic enterprises.These people pay for \"development\" with physical sicknessand the disruption of their lives. Similarly, they pay the highest price in socio-cultural health terms, because of thechanges which usually accompany the transition fromtraditional to developed society: impoverishment of social life, breaking of family ties, imposition of material valuesand associated behaviors over symbolic values and customs.The seasonal workers who reside for most of the year farfrom their families and homeland provide an extremeexample of this phenomenon.Theories of development have also arisen from theconcrete experience of the developing countries themselves.The uniqueness of these theories has been their focus onthe specific cultural, technological and social context of thepopulations concerned.One example is found in recentChinese history,in the phase of Maoist revolutionarydevelopment that rejected economic growth as a goal initself and emphasized agricultural improvements, anti-elitist 16egalitarianism and the building of local communities.Auother significant example is the Gandhian philosophy, inwhich the traditional forms of village production and thetraditional values of frugality and collaboration are keyelements to improve the life of the Indian people. The advantages of a development keyed to small industries andcrafts have been summarized by Myrdal (1968). Such development is more 'organic' and flexible, adapts itselfbatter to particular local conditions, does not need greatfinancial investments, and would put an end to the creationof \"cathedrals in the desert\" ( Kohr 1973; Jacobs 1984) .Other researchers have directed attention to the urbanbias of the main theories and emphasized the necessity ofdeveloping rural areas (Johnston and Kilby 1975; Lipton1977; Eicher 1982).Murdoch (1980) pointed out that theindustrial revolution in Europe had been preceded by an agrarian revolution (new technologies, seeds, opening of newland to cultivation) which led to a constant increase ofagricultural output.On the contrary, the models ofdevelopment applied in Third World countries have too oftenfavored capital-intensive industries. India, for example, has concentrated on building large steel and power plants,financed with foreign capital. This kind of intervention, says Murdoc.i, has perpetuated in the developing world theexistence of two \"parallel economies \", the urban and therural, a system originated in the colonial period. The urbaneconomy depends on the lor.al elite which controls politicaland military power, urban industries, export of localproducts and foreign imports. Usually, the benefits of improved health care which might follow economic develop-ment are absorbed by these elite minorities (Navarro 1984).These groups maintain power thanks to their political andmilitary connections in foreign countries and economic linksto the transnational companies which regulate internationaltrade (Frank 1972).The rural economy continuously losesproducts, labor and capital to the first, in a way suggestiveof a process of \"internal colonization\" (Gritti 1985). Health services offered to rural communities, when provided at all,are scarce and unrelated to local realities (Navarro 1984).The health consequences come conspicuously into view interms of infant mortality (see Table !:). 3J 17TABLE I IUrban-Rural Differentials in Infant ofSurveyUrbanRuralRural Pop.as $ ofTotalIndia198065.0124.076Congo1980107.0172.045Mozambique1975-80130.0183.083Senegal197871.4136.866Somalia19751146.0174.067 Peru1970-7573.6158.233 Syrian ArabRepublic1976-7943.067.052Papua NewGuinea198050.080.086Sources:(1) National evaluation reports on the Strategy forHealth for All by the Year 2000, (2) World Bank, WorldDevelopment Report 1985. The analysis just outlined offers an explanation for thefailure, in the sixties and seventies, of the so-called trickledown policies of development. These policies rested on theTaii that the poor would benefit in any case from the economic development of the \"more advanced\" strata of thepopulation.Thus, it was meaningful to invest in a fewtrainant sectors of the economy, waiting for the rest ofsociety to follow.By the end of the seventies, however, itwas clear even to the World Bank that the poorest socialstrata had not benefitted from development programs(Aihuwalia et al. 1979; World Bank 1984). On the contrary,consistently with earlier forecasts of Kuznets (1955) andMyrdal (1957), during economic takeoff the distance ineconomic power between the rich and the poor increased,resulting in further misery for the latter. In their exhaus- tive study of non-communist developing nations, Adelmanand Morris (1973) have shown that:Economic modernization shifts the incomedistribution in favor of the middle class and upperincome groups, and against lower income 0 .4 18groups.1..]Development is accompanied by anabsolute as well as a relative decline in theaverage income of the very poor. Indeed, an initial spurt of dualistic growth may cause such a decline for as much as 60% of the population.Some authors welcome modernization and economic develop-ment per se, but, believe that a combination of national andinternational exploitation prevents most people from takingadvantage of economic growth and any increased availabilityof goods and so-vices. Their analyses focus on the relativeconcept of pay! Ay vs. the absolute concept of scarcity, ondistribution of goods and services vs. their mere production,and on patterns of growth vs. growth itself (Samater 1984).For instance, Samir Amin has spoken of irrationality ofcapitalism at the global level, and identified capitalism as the very root of misery (Amin 1973, 1976, 1985). Griffin (1978) wrote:In a world capitalist system composed of nation-states and characterized by rapid technicalprogress in the developed countries, the poorcountries tend to be deprived of their mostvaluable resources, namely high level manpowerand national economic surplus I..] through trade,migration, flow of finance capital I..] with theresult that international inequality is increasedand, in some cases, the standard of living of themass of the poor is depressed absolutely.Development programs have generally favored thespecialized workers and the urban and industrial sectorsover the non-specialized labor force and the rural sector,whose economic growth is much slower. Economic mirage and forced rural eradication have then set in motion apowerful process of urbanization. If this process continues at today's pace, by the year 2000 half of the world'spopulation, will inhabit urban areas (in 1971 this percentagewas less than one sixth).For many, urbanizing meanslosing a system of support and cultural solidarity, andbecoming \"marginalized\" and powerless (Gritti 1985). This isparticularly true foithe weakest social subjects, such asracial minorities, tribal groups or women, who may besubjected to new forms of oppression because of socio-economic change.For these particularly vulnerable people, 35 19terms such as \"victims of progress\" (Bodley 1982) and\"victims of the miracle\" (David 1977) have been coined.Wealth and poverty are culturally relative concepts. In many societies, and perhaps also in our industrial societies,exchange and consumption of material goods and \"utility-oriented\" production are not the unique or main concern.Symbolic exchange., artistic expressions, leisure time, socialrituals, spiritual practices and even voluntary choices ofpoverty( Rahnema 1986) well rival material gain. For instance, rural markets in Africa have minimal economicimpact (very slow and unconspicuous exchange of goods),but play a fundamental role in the social life of the concerned populations.Transforming these markets intomore efficient economic systems, where higher volumes ofgoods flow at a faster pace, goes against the will and theinterests of local people.An argument may even be madethat destruction and not construction of material wealth isan overriding, universal concern of cultures Berthoud andSabel li1979, and references therein). Yet, theories and practices of \"development\" deal with people as purely economic entities, who necessarily want and benefit fromproducing more goods and services. The fact that above a certain threshold both production and consumption of goodsmay become meaningless or even counterproductive isgenerally not considered.TECHNOLOGICAL BACKWARDNESSDuring the initial phases of economic development of a\"traditional\" society, the return on invested capital is generally high, and the entry of foreign capital is encour-aged.Since the fifties, private banks and internationalagencies have promoted enormous loans from the North,which the developing countries in the South hastened toaccept.Initially, the conditions of these loans seemed quitefavorable, and foreign capital guided the economic growth ofmany countries.In Mexico,ft),example,it created the economic basis of the new urban middle class. Today, however, some nations find themselves exporting theirresources solely to pay the interest on their debt. This creates a continuous net flux of resources from poor to richcountries.Moreover, the debt allows the World Bank andthe International Monetary Fund (IMF) to influence thepolitical economy of debtor nations. These institutions IJv 20determine the adjustment policies that countries in financialcrisis have to adopt to maintain their foreign credit status.Along with the intern lona' market leaders, who establishthe terms of trade, these institutions regulate the biologicaland human costs and the economic profits of \"development\".One of the aims of the international loans was toenable the developing countries to acquire new technologies,and in particular the new food production technologiesreferred to as Green Revolution. The Green Revolution hasreplaced traditional cultivation and seed varieties. The newseeds, developed in years of laboratory and field work, yieldhigher productivity when treated with abundant irrigation,fertilizers, and pesticides.In places, the Green Revolutionhas in fact dramatically succeeded in its main aim of increasing the agricultural yield. Yet, more than a fewproblems have followed.At the international level, theNorth-South flow of capital and technology has contributedto the debt crisis and to the technological dependence ofmany developing countries.At the local level, increased agricultural output has rarely benefitted the malnourished orstarving people.For instance:In the 1960s, Mexico seemed to be on the vergeof permanent food self-sufficiency [ ..] and the gains in agricultural productivity provided thebase for industrial growth rates matched by fewother nations.[Yet] in the 1970s the country haddrifted into becoming an importer of basicfoodstuffs [ ..] and poverty persisted for manyrural people.The Green Revolution had [just]been an enormous publicity success, promoted bypoliticians and private interests.\" (Wright 1984)It has even been reported that the Green Revolutionhas caused new problems for the rural poor (Falcon 1970;Feder 1976; Hussain 1985).For instance, Java, a denselypopulated Indonesian island, welcomed the introduction ofmore productive rice varieties. Historically, however, accessto the rice harvest had been guaranteed to all. As an oldtradition, everybody could participate in the harvest workand receive a percentage of the rice gathered a compensa-tion.The Green Revolution introduced important changes.Rather than a \"high yield\" variety, the new rice would bemore appropriately called a \"high response\" variety, since it37. 21needs high doses of fertilizers and insecticides, and intenseicrigation.Thus, the new technology requires monetaryinvestments and musk bring monetary returns. To dispose ofthe traditional harvest customs without losing face, the ricefields owners end up selling the harvest before season topeople living outside the area. These people can harvest without allowing the poor to participate in the share. The poor must then buy the rice in the local markets. Perhaps the rice is not too expensive, but it is not very appetizingeither - the new variety has a taste far inferior to the oldone.A more important point, however, is the monetizationof the economy:only those with monetary income can eat.Compared to the old system, the new system seriouslydisfavors the weaker social groups (women, elderly or sickpeople, etc.) who find work with difficulty in an economywith a surplus labor force.New agricultural practices have produced negativeconsequences in two other aspects. First, because of active promotion of the new seeds, many indigenous varieties ofpotatoes, rice, maize and other cereals are disappearing.These varieties had lower yields, but higher nutritionalvalue.They were also more robust and better resistant tothe local climate and pests. Second, the pesticides neces-sary to sustain the new seeds have caused widespread acuteand chronic poisoning of agricultural workers. Most pesticides used in the developing world (Paraquat, DBCP,Endrin, BHC, Aldrin, Dieldrin, Parathion, banned in Europe and theUSA.The way in which they are handled is also unsafe.They are sold in stores which also sell food, stored togetherwith food and handled without masks or gloves or appropri-ate measuring devices.When the pesticides do not immedi-ately affect the workers who apply them, they may stillproduce tragic consequences at a later time. This was the case in Iraq, in 1972, where at least 400 people died andthousands were poisoned because of the delayed effects ofan organic mercury fungicide, used to coat wheat andbarley.The poison worked its way into ecological cyclesand the food chain, and reached people through pou!try,meat, river fish and bread. That fungicide had been bannedin the USA and ina number of other industrializedcountries, but it was freely exported to Iraq by USAcorporations( Taghi Farvar 1976).The production ofpesticides, increasingly transferred to developing countries, :IQ 22is a dangerous industry.It is subject to disastrous acci-dents, obvious example being the Bhopal disaster, andprovides slowly accumulating, non-dramatic injuries to the workers and the environment.A technological innovation usually considered indisput-ably appropriate is the biogas plant, which produces biological gas from vegetable and animal waste.With this simple, small-size, relatively inexpensive procedure, dung can be converted into gas for domestic energy, and the residuecan still be used as fertilizer. There are millions of converters of this type in China, and about 60,000 in India.However, while in China the biogas plants belong to a village, in India they tend to be in the hands of privates (inaddition to the initial cost, the plant requires at least the waste products of two cows). In the latter case the benefits of the plant are enjoyed by a minority, while the dung, before freely collected and used, has now become a cm:3=er good. Bought and sold in the market, the dung isout of reach for the destitute people for whom it used to be a unique source of freeenergy.Technological innovations can increase the gap between the rich and the poor and further aggravate the life conditions of the latter, but not necessarily so.Several problems can be alleviated i' not solved, merely by applying better technological means. For instance,itis now rek.ognized that inside dwellings with open-fire cooking facilities, the air shows a high concentration of pollutants.Combined with weather exposure, this phenomenon may affect the incidence of respiratory diseases, one of the main causes of mortality in developing countries (de Konig et al.1985). Carefully designed and locally produced stoves could provide better indoor air quality and a more efficient use of fuel.Yet,it has to be considered that the smoke - by blackcoating the straw roofs of dwellings helps to kill dangerous parasites. Once the new stove is introduced, therest of the dwelling has to change too.Very simple health technologies, such as breastfeeding, oral rehydration therapy and growth monitoring of children,together with expanded immunization can save many millions of children from death (UNICEF 1984). Except for the improved vaccines and the cold chain needed to transport them in areas far from urban centers, these health techno- 23logies are not expensive nor sophisticated. Indeed, they mainly depend on the political will of governments to create and sustain a network of community health workers to promote them.However, in the case of large campaigns,such as mass vaccination of children, it is vital to remember that the complexity of the bio-social environment may counteract any aggressive, large scale approach. A sad example of such failure has been the chemical warfare against malaria.The use of increasinglymore and more potent pesticides has been accompanied by an incidence of malaria equal, and at times greater, than pre-eradicationcampaign levels.Moreover:In Ethiopia, in the early 60'srecrudescence of malaria caused some 150,000deaths in an area where malaria was virtually not lethal previously:a temporary interruption of transmission hadcaused the natural immunity of the population to disappear.(Taghi Farvar 1976).By comparison with this failure, the worldwide eradicationof smallpox is a most inspiring accomplishment. It was achieved through a combination of careful monitoring of potentially affected areas, and immediate vaccination of thecommunity where any single case was found.Vaccine technology and smart planning eliminated a scourge con- sidered in1775\"the most general of all diseases\" in Europe,affecting ninety-five percent of the population and causinga death rate of one in seven. A disease brought to Americaby European colonizers and responsible for millions of deaths among the indigenous population, is finally defeated.Among the most promising \"new\" technologies in foodproduction are agroforestry, azolla/algae symbiosis in ricefields, raising of non-traditional animal species, use of zeolites in animal and fish feeding, biological nitrogenfixation and stimulation of plant growth with fungi (OTA1985).Most of these technologies are very old and thenovelty consists in exploring them for widespread use.It is questionable that technologies such as these need high level of economic growth to be successfully adopted. Whether new or old, or 'soft' or 'hard', technologies need to beevaluated -within the particular environment of theirutilization, and to be c ntrolled by the community who adopts them.No technology is appropriate in an absolute40 24sense, outside the context of the community into which itworks.Only the affected people can decide whethertechnological change and economic growth are, for them, apositive \"development.\"HISTORICAL FACTORS AND RECENT DYNAMICSOF SOCIAL AND CULTURAL CHANGEThe above considerations aptly introduce the fourthcurrent of thought about the determinants of widespreadhonger and poor health conditions. This view emphasizes the recently increased vulnerability of human ecosystems inmany of the so-called poor or underdeveloped countries (byhuman ecosystem I mean the biological, social and politicalenvironment in which a community lives). For instance, most precapitalist societies developed their social relationsof production around the problems of risk and security.Communities had institutional and social means of providingsecurity through a network of horizontal and verticalrelationships and reciprocities. Watts (19C:,) has studied thecaliphate and the individual Hausa states in Nigeria, wherecomplex pattern., of agricultural adaptation ( ..\"risk-aversion\"cultivations, preference of consumable versus marketableproducts, reliance on historically established planting andintercropping strategies.. ), constituted the technic& skills tocope with environment& unpredictability. He writes.Under the aegis of the colonial State, peasantproducers from the Nigerian Hausa land wereprogressively incorporated into the circuits of theglobal economy, largely through the colonialtriade of ta,:ation, export cropping ant monetiza- tion.[. IAithe peasantry were torn from asocial matrix of kin affiliation an ' obligation, the existential problem of subsistence became sub-servient to marketing behavior. In short, the social nature of the subsistence system and thequalities of the moral economy were severelyruptured.Reciprocity and solidarity, and hencethe nature of inequality itself, had changed.(Today] while all households are theoreticallycapable of coping with various forms of stress(drought, etc.) in practice these responses arer efracted through the prism of social andeconomic inequality.4 '1. 25Thus, Watts declares that a famine is a social crisis,with historical roots in the colonial period, and reinforcedtoday by the very process of 'development' from a tradi-tional society to a society based on the market law. It is because of the deterioration of traditional practices andinstitutions in many communities that \"..the economic risk isadded to the natural risk...\" (Clarke 1977). We arrive at paradoxes such a,. that \"..during the famines of the pastseventy years (in Nigeria], it has been the men and womenwho work on the land who have perished for lack of food.Those who died were those who produced (Watts 1980), and\".. town dwellers can still get something to eat, whilecountry people starve.\"(Spitz 1978).Recent changes in the name of economic development, particularly cash cropcultivation, are responsible for great part of this pheno-menon.Yet, cash crops are not born out of the mode: 11\"free market\" but of colonial domination. The colonizers defined the colonized people's territories, political structuresand trade patterns for their convenience and interests(Rodney 1972).Today's most depressed regions are thosethat experienced the largest volume of contacts withdeveloped countries in the past. As noticed by Frank (1972), this contradicts the thesis that underdevelopmentresults from isolation and pre-capitalistic institutions.Walter Rodney wrote that the African peasantentered the colonial era with the hoe, and cameout of it with the hoe.Rodney could have addedthat while the hoe with which he entered waslocally produced, the one with which he came outwas a foreign import(Mamdani 1985).Africa has to free herself from the yoke (..] ofproducing what it is not consumed by its people,and consuming what it dues not produce. This makes Africa an exporter of low-cost rawmaterials, to be able to import finished or semi-finished products at very high costs. There is nodoubt that Africa needs, and with extremeurgency, to de-colonize completely its economies,and to break clearly and totally with its colonialpast of economical dependency (Adedeji 1985).The term neo-colonialism has been coined to describethe economical dependence of developing countries on the42 26world's industrialized economies. The conditions of this dependence are less obviously brutal than in colonial times(for instance, there is no trade of slaves), but they stillproduce severe consequences for the well being of theaffected populations.Taghi Farvar (1976) offers anilluminating example:About 2 Kg. of cotton bring in 1.$ of foreigncurrency in Guatemala, of which 0.75 $, or threefourths, leave the country immediately to pay forthe synthetic insecticides, fertilizers, spray-planes,etc.[..] as little as 1 or 2% of the cotton grownin Guatemala could probably bring in the sameamount of net foreign exchange earnings as rawcotton exports, if finished products (say Guate-malan shirts) were being exported to the coun-tries of destination.If these shirts and otherfinished products were made locally as a cottageindustry using existent indigenous methods, thehousehold economy would improve and noexpensive capital outlay of foreign made machi-nery would be required.[...] Such an approachwould also leave most of the area now devoted tocotton (the most fertile lands) free for other uses(such as food production), would prevent erosionand poisoning of the top-soil and would result ina more meaningful economic growth [and anuplifting of the] population, now badly fed andhoused and in despicable conditions of health.\"It can be argued that large scale trade and economicsystems are the main avenue of oppression which maintainthe misery and poor health - both physical and economical-of people in the developing world. In fact, the last decades have seen a progressive and accelerating \"system captureand enlargement\" (Brookfield and Kirkby communities have been subsumed bylarge, high-risk economic systems. The latter can yield highprofits, disastrous consequences or both (unequally distri-buted among the populatior). Most profits derive from the exploitation of natural resources. The modern \"neutral\" ethics of economic pragmatism promotes crops for a quick cash return, such as large-scale monocultures dependent oninsecticides and fertiFzers. Often times, these new schemes 43 27removed cultivations for local consumption. In the Sahelian south, cash crop plantations have crowded sedentarypopulations into less fertile areas, and restricted the nomadsin their journeys.The traditional collaboration andexchange of products between peasants and pastoralists have suffered (Franke and Chasin 1980). In the Amazonian forest, palm oilplantations,oil companies and timber companies' are destroying the complex and fragile environ-ment on which the survival of indigenous groups depends.Economic pragmatism has encouraged developmentalprograms of gigantic proportions, such as dams, irrigationplans, mines, deforestation of large areas for timber and for opening new land to agriculture. The impact of these programs on the ecology of the territory and human wellbeing has been too often much more tragic than expected.Dams and irrigation schemes have provided electrical energy and water reservoirs, and allowed to cultivate newlyirrigated land. They have also induced disastrous epidemicsof schistosomiasis (a parasitic disease whose vectors thrive in the shallow warm water of irrigation schemes), andprompted huge ecological changes. For instance, following the entry in operation of the Aswan dem, the Mediterraneansea gained land from the Egypt coastline, some marinespecies nearly disappeared (the salinity of sea water has changed), and the regular fertilizing by flood of large areas around the Nile stopped (Rosenfield and Bower 1982; Heyneman 1984) .Dams also dislocated large populationsfrom their homelands, buried and destroyed archeologicalpatrimonies, and led to the salinization of millions of hectares of land.Simiiarly, forests keep being exploited as timber mines, despite the severe pr-Jblems causel bydeforestation.Because or this practice, some most fertilebut ecologically fragile regions have been already destroyed( Rich 1985).And the insectick.les and herbicides now \"necessary\" to produce anything (with prodyct losses higherthan before their very introduction, see den Bosch 1980), are changing the ecological equilibrium of large regions(Linear 1985).The essence of pre-industrial indigenous societiesis their variety and local adaptation. Each is tied to a specific habitat, and has evolved its culturaland behavioral expression.The witie variety ofresulting human social forms is a response to an4 4 28equal variety of habitats, each with a set ofdistinctive environmental constraints. In almost diametrical opposition, industrial technologicaldevelopment is characterized by a controlled,relatively uniform and highly simplified environ-ment [...1. High levels of environmental pauperi-zation and widely distributed homegenizationcharacterize industrialized societies in all politicaland economic systems throughout the world.(Heyneman 1984)An impoverished envit onment and an ecology far fromequilibrium mean a decreased flexibility and an increasedvulnerability of natural systems. People survive by becom- ing dependent on non-local inputs. The recent history ofthe Dominican Republic gives us a typical example. In 1953, the dictator Trujillo decided that the development of thecountry demanded the establishment of large sugar caneplantations.Thousands of families of the rural innerlandsaw their houses and fields destroyed from one day to thenext, and were assigned to common barracks in stateplantations. The sugar cane invaded the land, displacing themarvelous variety of local vegetation. After a period of high prices on the world market, sugar entered a crisis, asdid the economy of the Dominican Republic. The rural population was left idle and helpless, their varied andgenerous environment destroyed by a monoculture completelydependent on the vagaries of international markets.1 he example of the Dominican Republic throws light onthe connection between economic development of a countryand its political structures. Nearly everywhere, economic development strengthened the material basis supporting thenational states and the people in power. This strength has frequently been used to finance the imposition of a militaryrule.In Africa al( le, 25 states are under military rule,s;nce 1960 there have been 90 overthrows of governmentand from 1976 to 1980 thre3 and a half million people werekilled in revolts and civil wars (Hettne 1985). On the otherhand, one can expect that rapid processes of industrializa-tion, accumulation of capital, disciplining of the labor force,eradication of the traditional economic and social structuresand relative impoverishment of the social strata producingthe economic surplus (peasants, for example) create fertileterritory for repression and dictatorship. Some affirm in a45 29very straightforward way that economic development plannedand imposedfrom above\"is incompatible with truedemocracy, as well as with peace, joy of living, and thepreservation of the cultural identity of the people (Esteva1985).And some know that only with the help ofrepressive regimes can \"development\" and \"civilization\" beachieved.Cycles of vioknt repression and rebellion in developingcountries are a main cause of misery, ill health and deathfor enormous numbers of people. While the roots of internal unrest may be deeply seeded in peculiar realities ofhistorical, ethnical, racial, and cultural nature, they havebeen made more acute by the changes induced by econc nicdevelopment. At the least, the development process offeredthe world superpowers an excuse to get involved in theinternal affairs of the Third World. Following the SecondWorld War, most struggles between East and West have beenplayed out in the Third World, and development has offereda convenient justification for it. The numbers of people dislocated, wounded, disabled, tortured and killed in internaland external conflicts is of the order of millions. Moreov- er, wars devastate farmlands, and even in ecologically robustareas, fires and chemicals agents create long-lastingproblems for vegetation and crops.Low income economies devote to defense spending morethan six times the percentage of total government spendingsdevoted to health expenditures (data of 1982,World Bank1985).This may explain at least part of a recent finding:the countries with proportionally highest military spendingalso evidence the highest infant mortality rate (Woolanderand Himmelstein 1985).Arms trade, a most prominent voicein international exchanges, well expresses the link betweeneconomic development and political violence. Whil*' increased export of resources (in order to buy weapons)nourishes the GNP growth, the imported weapons, used tofight internal or border wars, create misery for the locals.Most wars fought in the world in the last four decades tookplace in developing countries, many of whom are also knownfor bombing and killing their own people, using massarrests, concentration camps and torture. The consequencesof these practices for the physical and mental health of thepeople subjected to them - although most obvious andtouching if one considers a single case - have yet to be4G 30properly understood in quantitative terms. In particular, it isnot known how many people have been eliminated byconcerted physical violence, economic exploitation and newdiseases during the frontier expansion of the last twohundred years.Estimates of tribal depopulation from 28 to50 million people are reported by Bodley (1982).The strategy of survival of a community can be definedas that system of behaviors and productive practices whichassures the community's existence and reproduction, andspecifying its cultural and social identty. Any long-lastingsystem of interactions between the individuals and theirhosting environment represents a particular strategy ofsurvival, whose success if reflected in the health of thecommunity. For instance, Andean communities have survivedfor centuries on a production system which takes advantageof the particular ecology of the territory, of labor sub-division within the family and labor sharing among families,of experimented behaviors and technologies in the face ofagricultural risks, and of internal cohesion born out of thelocal culture (Sanchez Parga 1984). All these factors are important, and if only one is altered, the consequences forthe health of the community cannot be foreseen. In particular, cultural change has direct repercussions onsurvival and health matters such as food, housing, reproduc-tion, hygiene, care of diseases, child raising, marriage, etc.(Kroeger and Freedman 1984). In this sense, colonialism first, and economic development later, have negativelyaffected the survival and health of people by graduallydestroying their built-in defense system (Rahnema 1983).They have corroded their culture.Throughout the centuries, communities survivedcombining mental and behavioral resistance and adaptationto change.Yet, social change impcsed in the name of'development' has too often been violent (Bodley 1982), ormanipulative:By ignoring the great wealth of unique relevantknow-how and wisdom that each culture hasgenerated throughout the ages for the preserva-tion and development of its specific particularitiesand potentialities, 'developers' infantilize popula-tions [...].Learning is transformed into a scarcecommodity called education, the production of 4 7 31which becomes the responsibility of the institutioncalled school.Health is identified with Westernmedical products and science, which have to beprovided through the development of medicalfacilities and training centers. Food becomes acommodity, outside people's life space, theproduction and the distribution of which becomepart of a development blueprint. (..1 People who learned throughout the ages how to live relyingon their own forces, become inhibited 'objects' ofanonymous strategies which they often do notunderstand and on which they have no control.(Rahnema 1983)Rahnema warns against the very concept of \"develop-ment\".As used today, this word is \"corrupted language\"and misrepresents reality.Instead of a process of self-liberation from various 'envelopes' of dependency, develop-ment has in fact inhibited the genuine unfolding of locallives and cultures.For Escobar (1985): Onhe\"deAt times, development became so important [..1that we accepted the price of massive impoverish-ment, of selling our resources to the mostconvenient bidder, of degrading our physical andhuman ecologies, of killing and torturing, ofcondemning our native populations to nearextinction, so important that we began to thinkof ourselves as 'inferior', as 'underdeveloped', as'ignorant', that we began to doubt the value ofour own cultures and decided to pledge allegianceto the banners of reason and faith; so important,finally, that the realization of such 'development'clouded the awareness of the impossibility offulfilling the promises that 'development' itselfseemed to be making.e may even wonder whether problems of hunger and pooralth have not been waved around merely to generatevelopment\" activities.Development writers often mistakenly attribute totribal cultures the conditions of starvation, ill- health, and poverty, which are actually related tocivilization and the industrialization. Self-C5 32sufficient tribal peoples do not belong in theunderdeveloped category.[ ...] 'poverty' is atotally irrelevant concept in tribal societies, anddoes not result from subsistence economies per se.(Bodley 1982)While being \"helped\" and \"developed\" the world'scultures are progressively homogenized into a common path(literacy, western-style education and health care for the few, foreign technologies, large-scale trade, industrialization,etc. ).Although local folklore is highly regarded andpreserved for the enjoyment of paying tourists, true culturaltolerance is uncommon. Most rulers of developing countrieshave been educated abroad, in western universities, andoften the only allowance left to their original upbringingare colorful clothes ininternational gatherings. These people share the same behavior, attitudes and values oftheir \"developed\" models, and all pay allegiance to whatPeter Berger (1982) calls the \"religious category of develop-ment\".Berger has called for an assessment of the humancosts of developmental policies, in terms of pain and physical deprivation, and in terms of loss of life's meaning.This is a way of demanding that human health - be It physical, mental, or social - be first on the list of develop-ment concerns.It is also a quest for a different level ofunderstanding problems, more related to the affectedindividuals and their ways of perceiving what health isabout (Fuglesang 1982).In today's world, so powerfullydominated by technological grandeur and speed, there is a compelling tendency to allow abstract concepts and theories,and distant authority figures, to take charge of human lives.This happens not only, as usually throughout history, bystealing people's economic and political power, but also bypervading and controlling the intimate relationship betweenpeople and their environment, their community, their familyand themselves.The quality of the lives of individuals [ ..] must beknown by personal experience before any sugges-tions for change can be made. [...] suggestions for change should come from friends, not fromdistant 'thinkers'.It is time to stop ratiocinatingabout the lives of people one has never seen, itis time to give up the belief that 'humanity'(what a pretentious generalization! ) can be saved0 33by the breeze in wellheated offices I...].(Feyerabend, 1987)Who has the right to define problems and solutions ifnot the affected populations? Even seemingly \"objective\"definitions, such as human nutritional energy requirements,are questioned:...the issue of energy requirement is so contextand value dependent ( ..energy requirement forwhat?in what context?for how long?decidedby whom?..)as to exceed the limits of a purely'objective', 'scientific', or 'medical' definition. It involves matters of power, be it the cultural andideological power of deciding what is valuable,meaningful and prioritary, or be it the physicaland factual power of 'shaping the context' in which resources, credit, land or food are distri-buted.[...] energy requirement is a politicalissue.I..]This is the most important researchrecommendation we can offer: that people be able to research their own situation themselves.(Borrini and Margen 1987)The fourth current of thought on the determinants ofhealth scarcity stresses the complexity of the strategies ofsurvival and wellbeing of individual communities (forinstance, their dependence on social ties, aliveness ofculture, health of the environment), and calls attention tothe development process (free or manipulative? Supportivecr violent?).To the arguments of geography and climate,this perspective adds the dimensions of history and humanmanagement of the environment (is the land plundered orcarefully managed? Whose interests are served by exploitingnatural resources?), to the arguments of population pressureit adds the specificity of context (what population densitywould best balance local resources? What socio-cultural system and technologies would better serve the end of thatbalance?), and to the arguments of economic development itadds ethical and cultural concerns beyond mere economicconsiderations (who defines what development is about?What is a just price to pay for it? Who should pay thatprice?For whom has a technology to be \"appropriee\"?). 314INTERVENTIONSThe reader will have by now realized that the fourcurrents of thought just described intertwine and merge, andthat they have been introduced mostly as an expedient toexplore the debate on health and development. But althoughthese currents do not exist as separate entities, theirdifferentiation acquires meaning when we consider specificinterventions promoted to improve health. The priorities and forms of th4se interventions reveal assumptionsunderlying an urJerstanding of health problems whichfrequently fits tine of the aforementioned currents ofthought.The current US administration affirms that improve-ments in the lives of the poor will follow from a sufficientstimulation of international trade, and an economic climateconducive to private investments and transfers of tech-nology.The recipe for health improvement is economicgrowth, fostered by a political atmosphere which does notrestrain or interfere with private initiatives in the interna-tional market place (Reagan 1982) .The World Bank and the IMF put forth similar perspectives. The only altar they pay homage to is economic pragmatism: maximum financial return is the paramount goal of their policies, and social,ecological, demographic, ethical, health or aesthetic con- siderations are all secondary concerns. Accordingly, the adjustment policies promoted by the IMF and World Bankfor developing countries in financial crisis have not addressed the issues of health and living standards of thepopulation.On the contrary, austerity measures have attimes withdrawn resources from public health programs. These measures have focused on the immediate financial costof health care, not the human and social costs, nor the long-term financial costs, of not promoting it. For instance, Tanzania had to decrease national health expendi-tures in the early 80's in order to meet financial criteria.Those who consider economic development necessary toimprove the life and health of a population usually make a further assumption:improved health is a prerequisite for,or at least strongly favors, economic development. For instance, in terms of nutrition, development (increased foodproduction) is good for health (better nutrition); in turn,better nutrition provides for healthier workers, able to5I 35produce more and thus sustain development. This argumentmay reveal itself to be a Damocle's sword for at least tworeasons.First, the people most in need of support andinterventions are not likely to be nor to become involved intasks of a developmental nature. They are elderly or disabled people, children without family support, landlesspeasant families.Their primary concern is survival andself-sufficiency, achievements which are not likely toincrease the country's GNP. Second, the increased produc-tivity of modern technologies is greatly diminishing the needfor human labor.This latter phenomenon, coupled with thesustained growth of human population, makes peopleincreasingly more 'expendable' for purely economic goals.Thus,itis important that health advocates promote andpursue health not because it furthers economic development,but because health is a value in itself, and indeed a highervalue than any \"economic\" development.In the sixties and early seventies, concern for thedemographic environment enjoyed a high-priority status inthe international debate.The first World Population Conference, held in Bucharest in 1974, stressed the risks ofuncontrolled fertility and the need for population policies.The World Bank and the USA were in the forefront amongthe sustainers of this opinion, and countries such as Chinastarted implementing impressive programs to curb the growthof their population.Lately, however, the \"populationpressure\" argument has enjoyed lesser popularity. Some stillaffirm that first duty of a government is to stabilize itspopulation at a level that will permit sustainable manage-ment of resources and a satisfactory quality of life ( IUCNNRand IPPF 1983).Others, however, maintain that freeenterprise and economic development can themselves takecare of the pressure created by increased population. As rational economic agents, people will modify their reproduc-tive habits when it will be in their economic self-interest todo so.This is the view of the current US administration,and it has been expressed in the second World PopulationConference, held in Mexico City in 1984.Accordingly, bilateral US aid and international organizations in which theUSA has a strong influence are now less prone to supportfamily programs in developing countries.At the opposite end of the political spactrum from theUS administration, the IMF and the World Bank, are thoseC\" ()u,,, 36who see economic exploitation and political oppression asroot causes of human misery. They usually advocate arevolution by the masses to overthrow the present structureof power.Some call for popular violence against the\"violence of the status quo\" (Fanon, 1963), others fordemocratic, non-violent radical uncompromising actionleading to liberation struggles and structural reforms(Gandhi 1922; Deming 1968), Some even believe that the very \"modernization of poverty\" and the increased vulner-ability of human ecosystems brought about by developmentalactivities are bound to revive the struggle at the grassroots(Esteva 1986; Fals Borda 1985; Shiva 1985). and non-violent means are foind themany voices advocating revolutionary change according tothe historical circumstances of each region or country. Theinnumerable instances of liberation struggles in this centuryare living examples of this debate. In the last years,increasing popular support has sustained the movement ofliberation theology, for which the path of spiritual fulfill-mer cis based on personal and communal action andliberation in this world.Liberation theology regards socio-political,cultural, environmental and health matters asreligious concerns.It secularizes spiritual commitments, andplays an active role at the community level in manydeveloping countries.HEALTH, DEVELOPMENT AND THE CRASSROOTSIn most of the enormous changes affecting their livesunder the name of \"development\", people have been not theactors but the recipients (the target population!), and toooften the victims.National planners of more or lesstotalitarian regimes, foreign aid experts, missionaries,business companies and military people have been at therudder of projects and programs. Contrary to this, self- originated and self-reliant change has emerged as a viablepathway genuine development 1986; Fals Borda1985; for specific examples see also at the end of thereferences under the ent:y of \"periodicals specialized inalternative development\").improvements in the health andsocial conditions of many communities in the developingworld have started to express the will, the peculiarities, and53 37the cultural sap of the affected populations. This hashappened in an immense variety of forms and circumstancesin what have come to be called grassroots movements andprojects.These initiatives, born out of local organizing,tend to prosper wherever the country's government allows,or cannot avoid, some shift of control to local community.Far from being an isolated phenomenon, local associa-tions are today widespread in both developed and developingcountries.They are the contemporary expression of thatspirit of solidarity and cooperation which has sustained theevolution of the human race throughout the centuries(Kropotkin1985).Nerfin(1986)has recently reviewed the multiplicity of forms and circumstances in which theseassociations appear, and has proposed to describe them withthe term Third System. The role of the Third System is toface governmentnl power (the Prince) and economic power(the Merchant) and to help people assert their own auto-nomous power.Inherently a non-homogereous body, theThird System works by networking and offering concretealternatives to conventional institutions. The term \"alterna-tive\" refers to the non-hierarchical nature of grassrootorganizations, to their emphasis on solidarity, their sharingof power and responsibility, their flexibility according tovarying circumstances and their willingness to experimentwith unconventional practices.A further aspect of the Third System, fostered by theintense networking, is the tendency to link issues. Health is a by-product of peace, freedom, personal security,ecological pnuilibrium and socio-cultural well-being.Working for he..means working for these goals, whichare human rights of the living and future generations. In this sense, health advocates should support ecologicallysound practices, such as sustainable agriculture, cultivationof local plants, raising of local animals, and careful use ofwater, land, and wood.Health Hvocates should alsosupport drastic cuts in nuclear and non-nuclear armaments,and the respect of political and social rights. In fact, some maintain that today the most important health task isavoiding war (especially nuclear war, see Adams and Cullen,1981).This goes hand in hand with de-militarizing oursocieties and promoting the active participation of citizensin internal and external security matters (Thompson andSmith 1981; Sharp 1986).De-militarization \"Icy\" of the population ofthe whole planet by averting nuclear annihilation, wouldavoid large numbers of war-related casualties and environ-mental destruction, and re-direct resources towards healthgoals.In particular, de-militarization could be the primeing: edient e genuine development, severing the violentlyenforced ties of dependency on foreign powers, and allowinginternal participatory democracy to flourish.Grassroot movements tend to define problems andsolutions differently than development institutions or national gover tments (in the words of Ynthari [1986],\"people are more important than the stet .Grassroots movements organize productive activities more grounded inthe local technology, culture and traditions. The relativelysmall- scale at which these projects usually operate allowsthem to be easily absorbed into the biological and the socialenvironment.Most importantly, when change is locally anddemocratically controlled, it has a better chance to benefitthe people who pay the social costs of carrying it out(1a,..or, environmental sacrifice, etc.). This is not '.he placeto discuss, but just to mention the possible iJng-termpolitical consequences of grassroot movements, whic'i inmany instances de facto promote decentralization of power,pluralism, and alternatives to state actors and institutions.Recently, umbrel'a organizations grassroots is to connect localgroups to exchange information di ;cuss issues of common concern, and support and protect -1 another in times ofdifficulty or harassment.These umbrella groups may growin time to occupy at least part of the political space .traditionally occupied by parties.If local organizing is \"the solution\", is there any rolefor people in developed countries? In the past the accent has been on 'positive' aid (North-South transfer of food,technology, knowledge, etc ). Today, we may ask ourselveswhether the developed aid idustr:alized countries shouldnot first of all remove th-. structures of oppression theystill impose on the ex-colonial states (as in the Hippocraticoath \"First, do not harm.\"). The intermingling of humani- tarian aid, military aid, cash crop trade and weapons salesis being exposed, and the consequences of economic growth 55 39are re-considered.Beyond questions such as \"What mustgrow?\", people start asking \"What must not grow? What should we forbid to grow? What should decrease?\" (Epp ler1985).Or not only \"What does economic development do forthe people?\"but also \"What does it do to the people?\"(Arns 1985).To answer these questions we do not need toinvestigate the relationship between health and developmentin an abstract and clear-cut way. Rather, we ought to allow the perceptions and the informed uneerstanding of theaffected people to take charge. People in developed countries may help with political action at home, but alsoby dispelling the myth that development and health aredefinable \"objectively\" and come as a package deal. Must primary health care redly come with a side-order ofradioactive waste?Health is a culturally relative concept. It is closely related to human feelings and sense of identity, to themeaning ascribed to life, disease and death, and to thespirit and the customs of the community in which indivi-duals live.These factors evolve with time, in the dynamiccontext of each society.In this sense, there is room toquestion even the health indicators which appear most unbiased and universally acceptable, such as infant mortalityand life expectancy.There is room to question theestablishment of permanent connections with relativelyisolated and self-sufficient communities (building roads,airports, expanding of state infrastructures, etc. ). There isroom to respect seemingly irrational traditions, religious andcontemplative attitudes, voluntary choices of poverty (wherepoverty may mean choosing-'f-sufficiency rather than being assimilated in a market economy) in the light of thesense of security and meaning they provide. There is room to supn -t the human right of be.lci different, and thesocial right of resisting change and \"development\", in orderto reproduce specific traditions and specific cultural values.\"Development\" denotes a powerful set of socio-econo-mical transformations, which require the cooperation, andoften the sacrifices, of most sectors of societies. Itis meant to offer economic returns to all, but in practice itseffects are much more -,omplex. First, not allreceive economic returns of improved good:, and services. Second,not all assign the same value to them. Third, not all are equally affected in environmental, cultural or physical health .456 40terms.What if people in developing countries are disci-plined and controlled by modern myths (health care, formaleducation, increased consumption, defense, etc. ) while thereis no chance that they will really benefit from them? Whatif in the meantime they are deprived of their own peculiarstrategies of survival and wellbeing because of the imposi-tion of different socio-cultural practices, or the degradationof the environment previously supporting their subsistence?What if they are in fact being lured into modernizedpoverty and new ways of being mentally and physicallyunhealthy?What if they are now losing their own tradi-tional knowledge, slowly and uniquely developed, for thesectoral recommendations of professional self-appointedexperts who have nothing personal at stake in makingmistakes?Development should be a process of changepromoting health for all.Such a process unfolds from theempowerment, rather than the disempowerment, of thosewhose lives it affects.It benefits the very people who paythe social costs of carrying it out (for instance with theirlabor, or the sacrifice of their immediate natural environ-ment), and is meaningful for them. Such a development isecologically sustainable and originates locally, because healthis rooted locally, in the natural and cultural environment ofthe populations concerned.Indeed, health and developmentare linked at the grassroots.

HEALTH IMPLICATIONS OF URBANIZATION ROBERT A. HALBERSTEINUniversity of Miami Urbanization is a relatively recent worldwide demo-graphic trend in the evolution of the human species.Fostered by the \"Agricultural Revolution\", urban settlementsfirst appeared in the archeological record approximately9,000 years ago, or within the latest one per cent of mankind's total existence (Hamblin 1973; Moorey 1980).Ancient and modern cities developed mainly because ofeconomic and social advantages such as increased employ-ment opportunities and the elaboration of cultural institu-tions, e.g. religious and educational facilities (Pfeiffer 1972) . Urbanization has accelerated rapidly over the past century,especially in Third World populations. Now stimulated by the ongoing \"Industrial Revolution\", urbanization continuesto be closely tied to economic development in countriesthroughout the world.While no definition of \"urban\" willsatisfy all researchers, a large and densely compactedpopulation is the single most frequently cited criterion inthe literature.The United Nations defines a city simply as any community of 20,000 or more inhabitants (UnitedNations 1970), and this has been adopted by many researchers (Weinstein 1980:2). 55Y2 56The rapid growth of urban environments has beer.accompanied by a number of biosocial stresses that areproducing a tremendous impact (Carruthers 1976; Clegg and Garlick 1980; Glass andSinger 1972). The purpose of the present paper is to reviewthe effects of urbanization on physical and mental health inthe Third World. An attempt is made to identify biohavioraladaptations which aid survival in cities.The Urban EnvironmentUrban environments are cross-culturally heterogeneous,especially with respect to conditions that may influencehuman biology and health.While some cities are charac-terized by extreme poverty and serious sanitation problems,others possess abundant resources and medical care facilities(Pacey 1978; Theodorson 1981). Regardless of location or variability or urban structure, however, adaptation to citylife typically involves extensive exposure to noise stress,crowding, frequent crime, various forms of pollution, and adiverse assortment of diseases and public health problems.Urban climates are generally warmer and more humidthan the surrounding countryside (Bach 1972). According toBryson and Ross (1972) precipitation is 20-30% greater, cloudcover is 5-10% heavier, and wind velocity is 20-30$ lower inurban than in rural areas. Temperature and ventilationdifferences are related to the composition and arrangementof physical structures.For example, concrete and metalhave relatively higher capacities for heat absorption andthermal conductivity than soil and plant life (Bryson andRoss, 1972).In addition, urban buildings trap air andinhibit wind flow.Urban dwellers face exposure to a number of otherhazards which potentially threaten health and well-being.Boyden( 1972 )estimates that one-half million differentchemical substances, many of which are undegradable, arereleased daily 'nto the world environment as a result of themetabolism of cities.On a worldwide basis, city watersupplies are typically contaminated by human and industrialby-products (Briscoe 1986; Russell 1978). Ionizing radiationloads are greater in urban than in rural environments(Eisenbud 1984). Besides particulate pollution, urban air hasa relatively high content of carbon dioxide, carbon mon- 73 57oxide, sulfur dioxide, and hydrocarbons (Abend 1971; Boyden1972).In recent years many urban neighborhoods have beenblighted by trash accumulation and the decay of housing andother structures.Disposed solid wastes amount to one tonper capita annually in cities around the world, and paper,metal, rubber, plastic, glass are the most prominent (Abend1971). Other potentially dangerous stresses and hazardsaffecting urban adaptation are described by Briggs (1983),Brown (1985), Harriss et al. (1978), Jerimer (1982), Merry(1981), Kalt and Zalkind (1976), and Torry (1979).Urbanization played integral role in the ongoingworldwide \"demographic transition\", which encompassesrural-to-urban migration accompanied by fertility andmortality changes and substantial modifications in householdstructure and the human life cycle (Boyden 1972; Kirkby1985; Nelson 1976). Urbanization is associated with evolvingpatterns of fertility, child growth, migration, mate selection,morbidity, aging, and mortality.In general, cities have rapidly grown because ofimmigration more so than internal reproduction. A sizeable volume of investigations suggests that fertility is depressedin urban societies.In comparison with rural controlpopulations, birth rates and completed fertility are lower incities in various countries including Jordan, Jamaica, Korea,Costa Rica, Mexico, Venezuela, Puerto Rico, Colombia,Argentina, and Guatemala ( Ahmad 1985; Bogin and and Crawford 1972; Lee and Farber1984; Stinner and de Albuquerque 1980). Important factors are later age e.t first marriage, delayed childbirth andintentional birth spacing because of wider availat3ility ofcontraceptives, elevated occurrence of induced abortion,higher employment rate of adult females, larger proportionof single adults, crowded housing and more frequent changeof residence, and possible adverse biophysiological aspects ofthe urban environment.In the Philippines Stinner (1977)discovered larger average household size in urban areasdespite lower fertility rates, due primarily to the increasingformation of extended family and non-relative dwellingunits.Nag (1980) points out reasons why \"modernization\"may in certain cases actually lead to gains in achievedreproduction--improvements in nutrition, reduction inreproductive wastage (including spontaneous abortion), less ..,74 58common breast feeding, and more frequent rate of remarri-age following separzon or death of spouse.Mortality patterns in urban populations are quite variable.On Gne hand, crowding and sanitation problemspromote contagious diseases and the persistence of childhoodmortality, while on the other hand cultural adaptations such as modern medicine and piped water contribute to improvedhygiene and extended longevity, such as in Brazil and Sierva Leone, Africa (Mills 1967; Shimada 1981). Thus, falling mortality rates characterizea number of Latin American cities (Carvajal and Burgess 1978; Halberstein and Crawford 1972), but mortality remains relatively high in urban India because of chronic diseases related to population density (Gurkaynak and LeCompte 1979). In developing nations infant mortality rates (annual deaths under one year of age per 1,000 live births) are generally lower in urban comparedto rural areas, such as in Morocco, Tunisia, Chad, Pakistan, Turkey, and the Philippines (Basta 1977:117).With respect to urban nutrition, a number of studies suggest that growth and development are more rapid in urban children, leading to relatively earlier maturation as measured by the timing of menarche, the appearance of secondary sexual characteristics, and rural-urban body size comparisons.For example, Tanner and Eveleth (1976) andMeredith( 1979) report that youngsters are taller and heavier in urban areas of Africa, Asia, and Central America. In Latin America rural samples generally display growth deficits when compared to their urban peers (Bogin and MacVean 1978, 1983; Graham et al. 1980; al. Johnston et al.1985; Malina et al.1981; Meredith 1979). Corlett's recent study (1986) of the growth of 721 African children revealed that urbanyoungsters were taller and heavier than their rural counterparts but were still smaller than age-matched European and American children. The correlation between ethnic background and growth variations underscores the genetic component in developmental pat4firns (Melina at al. 1981).Urbanization, however, is also associated with nutri- tional stress in the form of undernutrition (overall shortage of sufficient calories and/or nutrients) and malnutrition (deficiency of specific nutrients). Austin (1980:12) tabulates eight Third World countries in which average daily per75 59capita caloric intake is lower in urban than in rural regions:Pakistan, Brazil, India, Thailand, Trinidad, Chad, Korea, andIndonesia. The same author makes the following statements:Malnutrition is simultaneously an especially severecontributor to, and consequence of, the urbanpoverty syndrome...The incidence is acceleratingmore rapidly in urban areas. Furthermore, the degree of malnutrition among urban dwellers isfrequently more severe than among their ruralcounterparts (Austin, 1980:6).Conversely, there are many cities where nutritional status isbetter than in the surrounding countryside, such as inAfrica (Mills 1967; Vorster 1977). Complicating the picture further is the fact that intra-urban differences are oftengreater than urban-rural differences in Third Worldcountries (Basta 1977).Considering the history of human nutrition, dietarybehaviors are unique in urban populations. Industrializationand rapid population growth have led to the consumption ofless \"natural\" foods in favor of more packaged, artificiallypreserved, and synthetic foods. Itis not realistically possible for every person in a city of one million or moreto have access to fresh food each day. Beside the matter of convenience, increased reliance upon \"junk\" (low nutri-tional value) and \"processed\" (chemically treated) food isalso a function of taste preferences influenced by culture.Overnutrition, which includes obesity and the excessiveintake of alcohol and drugs, is historically more of an urbanphenomenon (Fernandes-Costa et al. 1984) .Serum chole- sterol Fi n d triglyceride levels are typically higher in urbansamples as a direct consequence of greater dietary intake oftotal fat and a variety of fatty acids (Garcia-Palmieri et al.1977).Nutritional surveys of urban populations have alsouncovered a number of instances of specific nutrientdeficiency, including iron, folate, potassium,fiber, protein, carbohydrates, 1984;Gilat et 1977; Ward and Sanders 1980; Pickering 1985). 7G 60Cities in Third World countries differ from cities intechnologically advanced nations in many aspects of environment and culture that influence health. For example,the biomedical threat of industrial pollution is not as great today in Third World cities, but these same cities possess fewer \"modern\" medical facilities. Third World cities are also individually unique with regard to natural resources, economic structure, and exposure to parasites and otherhealth hazards (Tulchin 1986). The Biological Impact of Urban Hazards and StressesBesides potentially harmful weather conditions andproblematical nutritional resources, the urban environment isalso distinguished by crowding, noise stress, and pollution.Recent research indicates that each of these factors hasimportant biomedical effects on the human body. It should be noted that many of the findings in this area have been obtained in industrialized cities and may not always be fullyapplicable to Third World cities.Crowding is an inevitable accompaniment of urban lifewhich is related to a number of serious biosocial stresses.Animal and human data indicate that mankind is the mostcrowded of all species (Davis 1971), and that humanreactions to overcrowding are remarkably similar to otheranimals (Freedman 1980).Many investigators believe thatthe persistent crowding of people, such as in apartment complexes, streets and highways, offices, hospitals, andvarious other urban contexts, is at least partially responsiblefor increased levels of noise, pollution, aggression, crime,psychological disturbances, social disruption, a variety of medical disorders, and even child abuse (Baum and recent human physiologicalchanges arise in connection with crowding. One consistentfinding is heightened adrenal activity and elevated bloodpressure (Davis 1971; Evans 1979; Factor Waldron have respiration and perspiration, as well as modifica- tions in the function of a number of body parts, such as77 61the liver, spleen, kidney, pituitary gland, skin, stomach,hypothalamus, (Davis 1971; Epstein1980; Factor and Waldron 1973; Stoll 1973).Crowding stress is also manifested in measurablealternations in behavior and psychological characteristics.(Epstein 1981, 1982; Ehrlich and Freedman 1971; Kirmeyer1978; Zlutnick and Altman 1972). Current evidence illu- strates that the extreme crowding in densely populatedcities such as is common is Third World countries comprisesan \"unnatural\" condition that threatens human health andsurvival.As ,mankind increasingly evolves into more of anindoor species, biological and psychological adaptiveproblems will undoubtedly be compounded in the future(Cassel 1972).Noise, often defined as undesired or disagreeable sound( Cohen and Weinstein 1982; Kryter 1970:1), representsanother element of urban life that threatens human physicaland mental health (Welch and Welch 1970). The harmfuleffects of excessive noise upon human auditory organs rangefrom temporary hearing loss to permanent deafness. Manyroutine urban noises, especially those emitted by vehiclesand construction loudness intensities farabove recommended 1973:275;Weinstein 1980:33).Itis thus not surprising that ruralresidents generally score better on hearing tests thanmatched urban samples.Recent research has also estab-lished a link between long-term noise exposure and theretardation of human growth and development. Ontogeneticmodifications have been observed throughout the d..tvelop-mental cycle from reduced fetal size to delayed maturation(Schell 1981; Schell and Hodges i Irelated toviolence and aggression.It may also lead directly to fatigueand higher probability of early mortality (Cohen andWeinstein 1982).Pollution, broadly defined as environmental contamina-tion,is perhaps the most ominous roadblock to successfulsurvival in cities. Throughout history large populations havefaced major challenges in waste disposal and in the acquisi-tion of safe foods and drinking water. In today's urban environments excessive amounts of pollutants and othertoxic poisons are typically found in all vital resources--air,78 62water, soil, and food (Randolph, 1976). Urban pollution is closely tied to human biology and health, as evidenced by the fact that morbidity and mortality rates are directly correlated with measurable levels a pollution (Nurnberg andVigneon, 1985; Waldbott, 1978).Water pollution is caused by a number of factorsincluding radioactive fallout, the release of particulatematter into the atmosp;,ere, sewage discharge into naturalwaters, and the dispersal of harmful chemicals such as mercury and lead (Boughey 1975). Viessmnn end Hammer 119851234) list 129 different. toxic pollutants commonlydetected in urban water supplies. Numerous attempts have been made, with varying degrees of success, tc treat water with chemicals and filtration devices, sometimes withunforeseen results.For example, chlorine has been utilizedfor many years to destroy bacteria, but it has potentiallymutagenic effects in the human body (Russell 1978).Urbanization is also responsible for the consumption ofincreasingly polluted air in urban areas.Impressive statistics have been compiled which prove: that air pollution is damaging to the human body. During inversion periods there is a significant increase in death rates, hospitaladmissions and doctor visits, and the initial incidence ofvarious diseases, especially respiratory and cardiovasculardisorders and lung cancer Goldsmith andFriberg 1977; Stewart Lave and Other diseases directly associated ',vith biological changes causedby air pollution include coronary heart disease, vasculardisease, stomach cancer, renal disease, ocular and auditorydisorders, emphysema, bronchitis, pneumonia, tuberculosis,asthma, Seskin 1977; Coffin and Stokinger 1977; Gardner 1982).Cities of the future are expected to experienceunprecedented pollution and related health problems. Oil spills, pesticide poisonings, nuclear waste dumpings, gas leaks, air pollution alerts, food poisonings, photochemicalsmogs, defoliations, water contaminations, toxic chemicalexposures, factory smoke deposits, and other \"modernproblems\" will likely be encountered with greater frequencyin the future (Harris et al. 1985; Hinkle and Loring 1977;Sharp et al. 1980; Weiss and Clarkson 1986). It will be necessary to closely monitor and control pollution in order-1/) 63for people to be able to eat, drink, and breathe with areasonable amount of safety. Urbanization and DiseaseUrban morbidity is epidemiologically unique owing tothe stress factors discussed here -- adverse weatherconditions, crowding, noise, unusual nutrition, and pollution.On one hand, tririous diseases are the direct result ofcertain urban-specific conditions (e.g. Briscoe 1986;Christiani 1984), while on the other hand technologicallyadvanced medical resources and facilities are more availablein cities (Greer and Greer 1983; Weinstein 1980).Several diseases exhibit higher incidence and preva-lence in urban than in rural populations. Degenerativedisorders such as coronary heart disease, cancer, ulcers, andliver cirrhosis are all influenced by pollution, diet, andother urban conditions.In a recent study of mortalitytrends in the Brazilian state of Rio Grande do Sul, Shimada(1981) discovered that in the Porto Allegre metropolitanarea overall mortality rates are falling, but the number andproportion of deaths due to ischemic heart disease, cerebro-vascular disease, respiratory tract cancer, and breast cancerare relatively high compared to .r.ural regions. Cancer of the digestive system (esophagus, stomach, intestine),however, is reiatively more lethal in farming communitiesbecause of the dietary practices of excessive salt intake andthe heavy consumption of a potentially carcinogenic tea.Heart cli.s=dbe mortality is prominent in cities due in part tohigher blood pressure and blood free fatty acid (FFA) valuesthat hove been reported for urban residents (Carruthers1976; Factor and Waldron 1973). Heart/cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in urban areas of TheSudan (Herbert and Hijazi 19814). Cancer susceptibility is also closely linked to the pollution of urban environments.On an international scale cancer is more prevalent and morelethal in cities than in the countryside, especially lung anddigestive tract cancers (Gr:..enberg 1983). Ample research has now proven that certain chemicals commonly containedin air, food, and water have carcinogenic effects in thehuman body (Eisenbud 1978). Christian' (1984) attributes the dramatic rise in lung disease, cancer, and heavy metal8 0 64and industrial chemical poisonings in China to urbanizationand the consequent buildup of harmful wastes in theworkplace.Since coal is the major energy source in China,pneumoconiosis is increasing in prevalence. It was detected in 4.2% of miners in one province studied. Between 3-5% ofminers and factory workers exposed to silica-containing recent years pesticide poison-ings, and lead and asbestos poisonings have beenfrequently reported in China. A recent study of a large asbestos products factory in Shanghai revealed asbestosis in20% of the workers (Christiani 1984) .Infectious diseases also pose a threat to urban health.Crowding and concentrated population density favor therapid contagion of a number of infections in cities, such as sexually transmitted diseases, tuberculosis, measles, pneu- monia, hepatitis, influenza, and the common cold (Factorand Waldron 1973; Hunter and Thomas 1984; Johnson 196;4).The substantial prevalence of endemic respiratory infectionsis partially explained by the fact that ozone, nitrogendioxide, and sulfur oxide ;r urban air supplies are known to cause pathological alterations in the respiratory tract(Coffin and Stokinger 1977; Gardner 1982). Malaria is the most commonly reported disease in urban Sudan, accountingfor over 25% of hospital patients surveyed in three cities byHerbert and Hijazi (1984).In their review of epidemiologi-cal trends since 1900 in Africa, Hunter and Thomas (19814:57)conclude that \"Tuberculosis is promoted by urbanization.\"According to Ebrahim's (1984) survey, epidemics of certaininfectious diseases have been especially common in warm climate cities in Africa, Asia, and Latin America, includingcholera, dengue, haemorrhagic fever, leishmaniasis andfilariasis.Pointing to the need for improved sanitation andmore effective immunization, the same author reports thatchildhood infections (measles, cough, polio),roundworm infestations andother gastro-intestinal parasites (e.g. Salmonella andShiqella) are more prevalent in urban than in correspondingrural populations of India, Bangladesh, Indonesia, and thePhilippines.Ganapati (1983) reports that the incidence ofleprosy in India is greatest in congested urban slums. By contrast, in Africa Hunter and Thomas (1984:27) discovered\"a negative correlation between leprosy and urbanization.\" 81 fu 65A variety of other urban diseases and public healthproblems are sometimes attributed to aspects of city life,varying from drug addiction to mental illness, varicoseveins, gall bladder disease, postural disorders, injuries frommotor vehicle and industrial accidents, liver amyloidosis, alcoholism, anencephalus, and visual defects Hendel et al.(1983) discovered \"significantlybetter visual acuity in rural youths than in urban youths.\"in a thorough comparison of societies around the world,Post (1982) likewise uncovered a negative correlationbetween visual acuity and degree of urbanization. Due to \"selection relaxation\" visual acuity is sharpest today inhunting-and-gathering populations and weakest in the mostindustrialized cultures.Recent research indicates thatdental malocclusion is more prevalent in urban populations,mainly because of the consumption of processed foods andgreater occurrence caries Purcell (1982), and Trowell andBurkitt (1982) have assembled extensive data on theassociation of urban factors with disease epidemiology.It must be cautioned, however, that not all rural-urbanepidemiological differences are due to urbanism per se. As Weinstein (1980:11) points out, \"It is difficult to interpretdata on city and country differences in health becausefactors other than urbanization may be causing the differ-ences. For example, urban-rural differences may result fromthe fact that people who live in cities are older on theaverage than their rural counterparts.\"In addition to new disease patterns, urbanization hasalso led to changes in health care. Traditional medicine haspersisted in urban societies (Davidson 1983; Dobkin de Rios1981; Press 1978; Wirsing 1985), and the spread of \"Western\"medical practices and treatments has allowed for multipleavenues of health rare in many parts of the world 1980; Dur finding inresearch evolution of medical care is that manypopulations ;:xperiencing acculturation express a cleardi; tinction between diseases which would be best handled byclinic exams and \"modern\" medicines and, on the other hand,82 66those diseases more treatable by traditional medical prac- tices and medicinal plants, such is the case in Nepal, Taiwan, Zaire, and the Bahamas (Durkin-Longley 1984;Halberstein and Uavies 1979; Kleinman and Gale 1982; Mahaniah suggest signifi-cant ethnic variations exist in health-seeking behavior,prescribed treatment regimens, and attitudes toward healthand disease in metropolitan areas (Low 1981).Urban stresses also exact a toll of mental health. Theclassic study by Faris and Dunham (1960) shed light on this fact by showing that diagnosed psychiatric disorders, mentalhospital admissions, crime, drug abuse, and \"deviant\"behavior occur more frequently per capita in urban than inrural populations.In a review of more recent literatureBasham( 1978:145) makes the following statement: \"A significant body of literature suggests that urban life eitherpromotes or is associated with higher levels of suicide,crime, and mental illness than exists in non-urban areas\".The field studies by Dawson (1964) and Chu (1974) inAfrican and Chinese cities illustrate the role of rapidurbanization and attendant culture change in mental illnessetiology, pointing to change of residence, medical problems,crowdi..g, and exposure to competing values (e.g. religious,political,etc.) as agents of stress. Within c pies the prevalence of psychological disorders is statistically corre- lated with population density (Hunter and Brunn 1974).According to some investigators the multitude of sensory stimuli in citiesis difficult to process properly by thehuman nervous system, leading to neurological adaptationssuch as the selective screening of stressful inputs andreduced attention span (Milgram 1970; Wohlwill 1975).Violent crime, an indicator of psychosocial stress, ispredominately a phenomenon of large cities. Freedman's (1975:56; data show that the rate of felony, crimes (murder,rape, armed robbery, kidnapping, terrorism.. etc. ) is over tentimes greater in cities than in rural areas around the world.Voluminous field studies support the eiesociation of urbanismand crime, many citing the influence of crowding, socio-economic streIs, pollution, noise, and structural problemssuch as inadequate lighting (Harries 1,-73; Lee and Egan1972). 67It might prove difficult to generalize the presentfindings to all of the great variety of Third World cities.Many of the cited baseline data on the biological impinge-ments of urban environments have been obtained fromsubjects from technologically advanced nations. It cannot be assumed that the urbanization experiences in long-industrialized countries will simply be repeated in developingcountries. There are unparallel situations in the nature andenforcement of city zoning and building codes and statutes,the activities of multinational corporations, health caredelivery systems, and sanitation services (Lee 1985; Pacey197Richards and Thomson 1984). Herbert and Hijazi (1984:342) estimate that \"as much as 40-50$ of diseasesfound in Third World countries are related to low qualityenvironments and are Controllable.\"In addition, there are numerous instances in ThirdWorld populations of misapplication of adaptive technologiesoriginally developed and tested in advanced countries. By way of example, the improper treatment of drinking waterwith faulty chlorination procedures has directly lead todiarrhea and other health problems in Colombia andBangladesh (Bersh and Osorio 1985; Levine 1976). Unfore- seen environmental hazards resulting from technologicaldevelopment have also been responsible for increases in anumber of nutritional and infectious diseases and otherpublic health problems in Africa (Hughes and Hunter 1972).In Guyanese cities the incorrectly supervised delivery of\"Westernized\" health care services has hindered medicalmodernization.By prejudiciously misreading ethnic andreligious variations in health needs and attitudes, primarycare workers have actually contributed to resentment,resistance, and the reactionary rejuvenation of \"folk\"medicine (Fredericks 1986). Future ProspectsThe stresses of citylife are affecting human healthand disease by causing changes in fertility, mortality,growtli, nutrition, physiology, mental illness and health care.M. -nographic, economic, and ecological barometers indicatethat La aan adaptation will be even more challenging and84 68difficult in the future.World population is growing at analarming pace, and rural- to-urbafl migration is continuing on a large scale.In addition to the intensification of crowd-ing, noise stress, pollution, crime, and disease, adaptiveproblems will certainly be compounded by the overconsump-tion of energy, the projected shortage of food, and theconcomitant depletion of natural resources. On the optimistic side, scientific researct. and seemingly unlimitedhuman ingenuity may well prevail and solve these pressingsurvival problems and improve the quality of life in futurecities.It ispossible only to speculate about adaptivebiological traits which may evolve through natural selection.Resilient digestive, respiratory, and nervous systems willundoubtedly have high survival value. Thus, people of thefuture might well possess \"cast-iron\" stomachs and lungs,heightened sensory capabilities, and increased nervous tolerance to psychological stress. As further gains are achieved in human longevity in the Third World, artificialbody organs and replacement parts will become more common there, including false teeth, glasses and contactlenses, hearing aids, hairpieces, implantable devices such aspace makers, and internal prosthetic organs made of siliconand plastic such as hearts, stomachs, colons, blood vesselsand kidneys.Many cities around the world have designed andenacted various measures in an attempt to manage theenvironmental crisis and control inherent biological hazards.Positive results may be realized in the future from thefollowing actions:population regulation through birthcontrol and urban planning, effective anti-noise and anti-pollution laws, elimination of toxic wastes, efficient disasterwarning systems and survival training, new guidelines and,equipment to reduce traffic and industrial accidents,synthetic foods and fuels, automated health care, and thetechnological reconnaissance of diseases and their riskfactors.It is distressing to point out, however, that manyof today's world cities are inadequately equipped to effec-tively prepare for natural disasters and that most c-banpeople are unfamiliar with the fundamentals of survivaltraining (Sorenson 1983).Urban renewal and revitalizationprojects comprise an essential step toward the protection ofthe physical environment and the maximization of health andlongevity.On the other hand, if the biosocial stresses ofcity life persist unabated, human welfare will be increasingly85 69threatened and reverse migration to suburban communitiesmight become a necessary alternative.Due to its recency, the total biomedical impact of theongoing urbanization \"experiment\" may not be fully under-stood for years to come.The unique ecology of urbanenvironments deserves close monitoring and possiblemodification in order to improve the quality of life andmaximize the potential for successful survival in cities.This is especially urgent since Weinstein (1980:xiv) estimatesthat over 70$ of the world's population will live in cities bythe year 2000.Hopefully, the final advantage will belong tothe human species because of its future orientation--theability to foresee problems coming down the road. Imme- diate action is strongly recommended, especially in the formof applied field and laboratory research in differentsocieties throughout the world. REFERENCESAbend, N.

ANDUNDERDEVELOPMENT IN NIGERIA S. OGOH ALUBOUniversity of Jos The more fundamental question is whether their(multinational pharmaceutical corporations)positive contributions are not in fact outweighedby, and are incidental to, the damage they do andthe bad health care they promote; in economic terms, whether the resources they have capturedcould not generate more benefits to theirconsumers if applied in other ways.Muller 1982:19 89 90INTRODUCTIONDrugs are essential components of Western medicine.In a simplified version, a core theory of Western medicine iscomprised of germs and intervention with drugs with theobjective of destroying the germs while magically sustainingthe host.Beyond, perhaps because of, this perceivedindispensability to Western medical practice, drugs are nowpresented as cure-alls, marketed and consumed withoutchecks in Nigeria. But drug marketing and usage are hardlyalways this necessary, benign or in good faith. To thecontrary, drug marketing and usage are often characterizedby misrepresentation by drug companies, misprescription byphysicians, and/or consequently, misuse by the consumingpublic (Silverman Wide 1982; Silvermanand 1982; Muller 1982). Why are con- sumers left at the mercy of the drug industry?This essay examines the above issues about the drugindustry in Nigeria.We first document the magnitude ofthe drug industry and the major outlets to the public, afterwhich existing regulatory mechanisms are reviewed. Then,the reasons why regulatory mechanisms are ineffective aswell as the implications of an unregulated drug industry forhealth hazards and national health policy are discussed.In pursuit of these stated objectives, field work wascarried out in Plateau State. We conducted observation ofdrug promotional activities in ten markets as well asinformal interviews with hawkers, detail persons andofficials in reg' ;latory agencies who consented to beinterviewed.We took advantage of the annual meetings ofPlateau State Pharmaceutical Society of Nigeria (PSN)--heldin September, 1986--which provided an opportunity both tomeet difficult-to-track detail person and also to glean fromthe deliberations, the general perception of the drugproblem.Field work was supplemented by research ofpublished literature from other parts of Nigeria, and wewere able to confirm that the drug situation (supplies,marketing, usage) in Plateau State is by no means unique.The findings from the field work therefore, reflect thesituation elsewhere in Nigeria. 105 91THE DRUG INDUSTRY AND DISTRIBUTION IN NIGERIAIt is trite but true to state that accurate data on most aspects of Nigeria's social life are unavailable. What we have are estimates, what Dianna Melrose (1982) calls\"guesstimates.\"Data on drug production are no exception.Es_:mates of Nigeria's self sufficiency in drugs range from 5 to 10% of total needs (Muller 1982:91; Melrose 1982:29;Piachaud 1980).Stated differently, Nigeria is 90 to 95$dependent on imports for her drug needs, unlike other thirdworld countries like Brazil and Egypt who produce mostbasic drugs locally.The nature of even this small percentage of localmanufacture in Nigeria needs to be qualified to betterunderstand the true picture. Rather than lead to self reliance, this so-called local manufacture has, ironically,increased the dependency burden. This is because, in the words of a one-time Health Minister \"almost 1001% of theraw materials used in the so-called drug manufacture meantsimply local mixing and packaging\" (Anonymous 1982:2).Indeed: as Efobi (cited in Oculi 1981:159) has illustrated inthe case of aspirin, \"the only locally obtained raw material in the process for local manuiacture of aspirin tablets iswater\" the pump of which, not to mention the chemical fortreatment, might well have been imported. It is noted that the heavy reliance on imported raw materials is an essential feature of the structural disarticulation of Nigeria's nationaldevelopment and the major bane of the political economy of peripheral capitalism (NDP 1981:40; Thomas 1981; Amin 1978;Onimode 1983).Besides the foreign exchange requirements for raw material importation, this type of manufacture has no linkages with other sectors of the economy, for instance, petrochemicals.Furthermore, local drug manufacture hasbecome an avenue for multinational drug companies (MNDC)to repatriate profits. Peter Schurch, the marketing manager of Hoffman La Roche,is indiscreet about this fact:\"In many countries, you cannot take profits out but you cantake (profits) out in active substances (imported for drugmanufacture)\" (Muller 1982:96). Yet, Nigeria's health policies since independence, as elaborated below, haveessentially been limited to hospital construction andprocurement of drugs for medical care. Nigeria has1.1)0 92allocated huge amounts to health cire. The Fourth NationalDevelopment Plan clearly illustrates how the lion share ofthese allocations are religiously devoted to curative medicalcare; for example, during the 1974-80 period only 16% of thehealth budget was allocated to basic and preventive care(NDP 1981:272).Because of its population of about 100 million people,affluence (mostly through oil), and the low capacity of localmanufacture, Nigeria is the biggest drug market in Africa.The major MNDCs have business here and engage in acountervailing scramble for a share of the market. As Table1 shows, the Nigeria drug industry is dominated by Switzer-land, U.S., and Britain.As the turnover and figures inTable 2 indicate the drug industry in Nigeria have largeprofits even with declining turnover.The unethical promotional activities of drug companies,e.g. misrepresentation in several developing countries, havebeen reported by various authors (Silverman 1976; Melrose1982; Gustafson, and Wide 1981; Laff 1977; Piachaud 1980;Glucksberg and Jack 1982; Barnett et al. 1980). Could thesame be said by Nigeria?In the remainder of this section,we discuss major drug outlets in Nigeria as well as thepromotional activities.Drug outlets in Nigeria could be broadly categorizedInto:1) hospitals, dispensaries and other treatment centres,2) chemist shops and pharmacies, 3) itinerant and non legaldealers, and 4) medical representatives (detail persons).These various outlets differ both in the way they operateand in promotional activities. They, therefore, merit somedetailed discussion.Hospital and dispensaries.These are the most tradi-tional, and perhaps respected, drug outlets in Nigeria. Theirhigh status and association with drugs may be traced to theorigins of hospitals in Nigeria. Here, hospitals started as treatment centres for sick European traders (Schram 1971;Ityavyar 1986), in contrast to hospitals in the West (Fried-son 1963) where custodial rather than curative emphasis wasthe predominant philosophy.In keeping with the curative emphasis, hospitals in Nigeria have continu- J to be centresfor administering drugs.This is the conception of hospitalsarticulated in health policy documents and which has, at the107 93 TABLE 1MAJOR MULTINATIONAL DRUG figures published in the BusinessTimes same time, become incorporated into Nigerian languages.Hence, the word for hospitals in many Nigerian languages(like Ibo, ldoma, Tiv) is simply \"house of medicines.\"Beyond this legacy, drugs have become central to thepatient-practitioner encounter and Western (allopathic)medical practice in general.Hardly is there a consultationwhich does not end with a prescription. Whether public or private, hospitals and dispensaries often have the rightpersonnel and are centres where one is mostly likely toreceive the right prescription and consequently, the rightdrug (Alubo 1986c).Except for imposing sign posts which increasingly listthe array of services provided, hospitals in Nigeria do notadvertise.Drug advertisement is also subtle, such as theglossy drug posters and calendars found commonly in Nigeriahospitals.Free samples are also distributed to doctors andpharmacists who, rather than the consumers, are the targetsof drug promotions, perhaps because they are the ones whoinfluence drug pu-chase and distribution.Chemist shops and pharmacy. Chemist and pharmacystores are the most predominant businesses in urban Nigeria,second only to the beer business. In Jos, for example, there are hardly any streets without numerous medicinestores. Though grouped together for present purposes, thelegal provision for chemist and pharmacy shops differ.1 Theformer are restricted to common remedies (over-the-counter), and cannot deal in prescription (ethical) medicines;only pharmacies can carry prescription items. Both are forbidden by law to prescribe drugs.Chemists and pharmacies in Nigeria are, in practice,not restricted by legal provisions (discussed below) govern-ing drugs. Not only are prescription drugs such as antibio-tics (capsules) available over-the-counter, but both do infact engage in what Bode Ladejobi (quoted in Muller1982:91) has called \"counter-prescribing\". The role of the druggist long observed in Regionville by Koos, is a clearpattern:...was limited by law but his place in the commu-nity suffered no such limitations. Legally he could fillprescriptions and dispense patent11 0 96medicines and proprietories. By custom, however,he became something of a diagnostician andprescriber of therapy inhis own right (Koos1954:86).Because of this discrepancy between legally stipulated andactual roles, chemists and sometimes pharmacies are frequenttargets for raids by drug enforcement agencies.Both chemists and pharmacies engage in.advertisementsespecially in the print media. Many of their business namesare in themselves advertisements. Names like \"Health\", \"Progress\", \"Hospicare,\" \"Sauki ,\" ( Hausa for thrifty) are someof the self selling names in the Jos area. The primarybusiness targets of chemists and pharmacies are the consum-ing public.Itinerant and non legal dealers. This category is the most pervasive and can be found in market places, busterminals, in buses, train stations, in trains, busy streetsand other public places.From our field study of marketsaround Jos, there is an average of 15 hawkers in eachmarket.Most dealers in this category operate from, or areaffiliated with, chemists as commission agents for whamsuccess depends on being a good sales person. There is therefore a material stake in employing all the sales andsurvival gimmicks that can be mustered. Thus, advertise- ment is central to their operation.Drug hawkers operate on foot, bicycles, mopeds andvans.Whatever the means of getting around, which to alarge extent is a measure of success, a school bell, loudspeakers, bull horns and other forms of public adaresssystem are always in their possession. They also employ theservices of clowns (fiasco acrobatic dancers) for thepromotion of the wares.In general, drugs are hawked withexuberance and glee reminiscent of the hawking of colddrinks at football matches. Whether dancers are employedor not, the objective is to attract attention. The following is typical of their gimmicks:Yes. 0 yes!Most of you know me very well (hewas in a long distance bus), most of you don't ...Idon't need introduction any way (sic) in theworld.Yes,I am known all over the world. My111 97name is doctor-do-good, the world man ... I am the man doctors love to hate because Icure patients they have pronounced dead! And this iswhy I am with you this ..-:orning to introduce toyou medicine which will cure those of you thedoctors have pronounced dead, those of you thehospitals have rejected ( lgwe 1984) .Some will offer their seat in a crowded but or train, whileothers start by calling a range of afflictions--in our fieldstudy the more common ones are malaria, TB, gonorrhea,Wuro-Wuro belly (noisy stomach) and sexual impotence-- andthen calling out to the afflicted to come and be cured.2 Wefound in one market that ampicillin capsules were sold ascure for cough, Wuro-Wuro belly, gonorrhea, headache, andcolds.It was observed that when consulted this list stretches to infinity.The same merecine seller soldampicillin for waist pains. We did not find any hawker whoran out of \"the treatment\" for any condition, the only limitis,apparently, the availability of customers. Further, besides this limitless indication for a particular drug, thereare wild exaggerations of potency. Sometime ago TOP TABSAPC (a me-too-aspirin) was advertised on radio as the\"thing way pass magic,\" meaning that which surpasses magic!Other outlandish claims come from this merecine seller whoadvises:\"Just take a small tumbler shot of this medicineearly in the morning or in the night and I can assure you that no woman can give you gonorrhea ever in your life\".Indeed, as Murphy and Baba (1981:268) have noted\"Drug hawkers are becoming increasinglypopular as healers and are frequently consultedabout allsorts of complications sometimes withfatal results.Little check is made on theiractivities and stalls where they sell their waresare to be found in the village markets. Villagers hear about certain drugs and remedies throughradio advertisements such drugs are described aspanacea for allills and are sold indiscriminatelyby hawkers who are more often than not illite-rate.In several areas of Nigeria, particularly in the easternstates, injections are openly administered in the market(some times with pants on!) and, occasionally, injections are11 2 98poured into ogororo (locally brewed gin) and drunk for\"instant results.\"The objectives of these promotional activities, it goeswithout saying,is to make profits, even if packaged asbenevolence. The case of doctor-do-good is recalled. In an apparent moment of exuberance, this itinerant merecineseller lets his audience in on his secret:En, good morning brothers, sisters andfriends.Iam here be7ore you for no otherpurpose than your health.Your health is our business and we must justify our pay by preachingthe gospel of your health to (Olofintila 1983:3emphasis added).In addition to these hawkers who operate with cavalierabandon, there are also clandestine dealers who effectivelypractice medicine in both urban and rural Nigeria. These non legal practitioners might be employed as cleaners andattendants in hospitals where they probably acquire theirII expertise\", mostly in administering injections. Unlike the othe. outlets who operate openly, the idcntity and operationof this group are carefully guarded secrets divulged only toclients (Pearce 1980; Murphy and Baba 1981). This group ofclandestine medical practitioners, we note in passing, existin var:ing forms in other Third World countries as well (Besha 1986; Cunningham 1970; Melrose 1982).Detail persons. The activities of detail persons, calledmedical representatives in Nigeria, do not fit into any ofthe categories discussed above. Detail people seldom deal directly with consumers; instead, they operate throughbureaucratic health care organizations such as the ministryof health, teaching and other hospitals, and clinics. But unlike others, detail persons deal in large quantities throughcontracts awarded through bids by these different organiza-tions.In the pracess of these awards, pressure andinfluence are brought to bear. While technocrats are apt topoint to rationality in these awards, it is, however, knownthat some gratificationin the form of business lunches,clocks, pens, wallets, diaries, etc. are part of the game.The detail persons interviewed deny that money (bribes) isused.But they affirm that contract awards depend on acompany's reputation and public image. It does appear,113 99however, that these behind- the -scene maneuvers andknowledge of the personalities involved are as important as\"rationality.\"In one case, the Kano state governor tra-velled in 1983 to a 1, reign country to negotiate drug deals(Alhassan 1984:1).In spite of the claim of rationality of the bidding,system, public purchases of drugs often result in the supply(sometimes over supply) of expired and non-essential itemsand over invoicing (Alhassan 1984; Yudkin 1980; Glucksbergand Jack 1982).A typical case of this over supply was thesituationin which the University of Nigeria TeachingHospital Enugu found itself with four years of stock ofResochin(a brand of chioroquine antimalarial) (Ojukwu1984 : 1 ) .The scenario presented by the operations of theNigerian drug industry is the dialectics between privateprofit accumulation and the inherent public hazards of theprocess.The Nigerian situation also raises questions aboutthe pervasive diffusion of innovation--itself a brainchild ofthe modernization school--and the control of modernorganizations (in this case drug companies) within thepolitical economy of dependent capitalism.DRUG REGULATORY MECHANISMS IN NIGERIAThe history of drug regulation and that of privatemedical practice in general dates back to the colonialperiod.During this period, patients', rather than physi-cians', professional judgement allegedly dictated treatmentby private practitioners.Patients, for instance, demandedand received injection for a fee (Ityavyar 1986; Schram1971; Pearce 1980).As part of its parents patriae role ofprotecting the consuming public, the colonial state began toregulate and control private practice. In 1941 the colonial government instituted a commission to investigate privatepractice (mostly by doctors in government employment) andthe epidemic of injections. This committee found thattreatment was dictated more by economic than professionalconsiderations.These economic interests were particularlyenhanced by injection tours which frequently had disastrousconsequences.The committee found that all 35 of thoseinjected during one such tour died (Philipson cited inItyavyar 1986; Schram 1971:239, 254) . To check this blatant 1 1 .),. 100abuse, the committee recommended the restriction ofinjections to hospitals and dispensaries.Thereafter, regulation and control of medical practice(including drugs) became an integral part of crime controland other functions of the state. Subsequently, the necessary laws were enacted. The most comprehensive statement of Nigeria's drug law is CAP 152 of 1958. Briefly, this law states inter alias1.No person shall mix, compound, prepare or dispenseany drugs or poison unless hE is a registered andlicensed dispenser or a chemist or druggist. Such license must be validated annually and displayedconspicuously on business premises.2.Where the dispensing chemist or druggist have assis-tants, business must be conducted under his continuouspersonal supervision.3.All poison must be dispensed only on prescription bymedical practitioners, dentists, or veterinary surgeons;such prescription must be in writing. The druggist must keep records of all disposals of poisons specifyingname, data, quantity and purpose stated by purchaser.4.Patent and proprietary medicines must be sold only bya chemist, druggist or holder of patent licenses.5.Drug advertisements can only be directed at medical,dental and veterinary practitioners and/or the govern-ing body of hospitals, asylums and infirmaries.6.Violation of any of the above stipulations is punishablewith a fine of one hundred pounds or 2 years impri-sonment. Certainly, this is adequate legislation to safeguardagainst drug abuse and many of the promotional activitiesdiscussed above.But it takes more than legislative provi-sions to achieve the desired behaviour. To be sure, there isoften a hiatus between legislation and enforcement.However, to ensure some enforcement the state has thefollowing regulatory agencies: the Inspectorate unit, the1 i 5 101following regulatory agencies: the Inspectorate unit, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and the police.The Inspectorate unit.This unit insures that chemistsand pharmacies adhere to the legal provisions as stated intheir licenses.Officials of this unit complain of beinghandicapped by lack of funds and transportation, which theyblame for violations of the legal provisions.To inject some vigour into this unit, some states haveset up special task forces to police druggists and privatemedical care.Plateau State provides an illustration. Here, the special tat.k force on drug control was commissioned in1985.This task force, headed by a military officer,comprises 12 members drawn from the police, ministry ofinformation, the medical and pharmaceutical professions.The task force is empowered to search F remises of anydruggist, seize \"contraband\" items and hand over suspects tothe police.Such confiscated items are turned over to thegovernment for distribution to public hospitals. The PlateauState task force has carried out a number of such raids.The Food and Drug Administration. What is now the directorate of Food and Drug Administration started asGovernment Chemist.The FDA was established in 1974through Food and Drug decree no. 35 which made itobligatory for all food, drugs and cosmetics imported,produced and/or meant for sale and consumption in Nigeriato be inspected.According to this decree the purpose ofthe inspection is to ascertain character, value, potency andpurity of the ingredients of such food and drugs. The FDAalso ensures that food and drugs are properly labelled andare fit for human consumption.The FDA is an agency of the Federal Ministry ofHealth and has branches in each of the 19 states. Like the Inspectorate unit of the State ministry of health, the FDAtoo is handicapped by lack of technical staff. In the Plateau State office for example, there are only threetechnical officers and the office has no vehicle.The police.The police is a law enforcement agencyand its functions include drug control. In this regard, the role of the police is similar to the Inspectorate unit,ensuring that drug dealers operate within lawful limits. 102drug distribution effectively. Like the other regulatory agencies, it also uses problems of funding and shortage ofpersonnel as convenient excuses for its ineffectiveness. Andyet, the police has enough personnel and equipment tomount road blocks and hound motorists for \"vehicle parti-culars\", such as evidence of license fees and of insurance.Similarly,it is our contention that the Ministry of Healthdoes not lack the staff to carry out sanitary inspections nordoes the state lack the personnel to carry out tax drives.Tax drives, for instance, normally begin at dawn and areoccasions \".0 inflict physical and mental torture on victims.As Bonat and Ayu (1986:7) have obsErved, other methodsinclude \"tying up the poor defaulters with ropes; mercilessbeating...the seizing or auctioning of household furniturelike beds and domestic animals such as goats and chickens,stored food and whatever other valuable items that thepeasant may have.\"The colonial nature of \"sanitaryinspection,\" described by Onoge (1975:227) as an effective\"siege\", has remained.Further, under the current WarAgainst Indiscipline one could be fined up to N1000 (nowabout US$300) for not keeping domestic surroundings clean.This situation truly reflects the nature of peripheralcapitalism (Thomas 1984; Ngugi 1982; Horn 1985; Usman1982) and the state which emerges from this formation.Clearly, the state is overzealous in generating revenue foritself (tax clearance certificate was once demanded beforehospital treatment and pupil enrollment in former Westernand Lagos states respectively), and capital for privatebusinesses such as insurance companies. But the same statebecomes lackadaisical in protecting the people from druggingand other forms comerciogenic crimes.DRUG REGULATION: POLITICAL ECONOMYDETERMINANTS OF INEFFECTIVENESSIn the foregoing section, we saw the ineffectiveness ofthe drug regulatory and enforcement agencies in Nigeria.We shall argue that rather than the lack of funds and otherresources, the real reasons for this ineffectiveness arepolitical and structural, linked to the problems of controll-ing modern organization (in this case drug companies) underperipheral capitalism. 117 103The drugging of the Nigerian people is linked tomodernization, the chosen path of Nigeria's nationaldevelopment, and to the technologies associated with thischoice.The choice of modernization, clearly enunciated ingovernment policy documents (see for instance NDP 1974,1981 and Nnoli 1981), entails fostering and sustaining linkswith developed nations that are held up as models to bd emulated.These links are thought to avail the Third Worldof experts and technology (including drugs), all necessarypreconditions to becoming developed. Based on the inven- tory of preconditions, modernization promises a new dawn(Wallerstein 1979).Itis precisely the lure of a Euro-american type of development, without taking into accountthe different historical circumstances, that fosters whiteelephant projects and assembly technologies which are so common in Nigeria's industrialization (Abba et al. 1985; Onimode 1983).But transferred technology has not led totrue development; it has ironically structured and stunteddevelopment of the recipient country tying it more closelyto the economy of the donor.in the health care arena, modernization as we have detailed elsewhere (Alubo 1986b), takes the form of hospitalconstrucCon, training of doctors and other staff, andimportation of drugs and equipment for curative medicalcare (Ityavyar 1986; Erinosho 1982; NDP 1974, 1981). The Federal Government measures \"achievement\" in health care by growth of Western medical facilities and human resources (NDP 1981:293 and 279).It is within this wider paradigm of modernization thatdrugs and other modern technologies are imported to Nigeria.The relevance of these drugs to local morbidityand mortality problems are overlooked both by the developedcountries which sell, and occasionally donate them as \"aid\" and by Nigeria and other underdeveloped countries to whomsuch technology is transferred (Lail 1977; Piachaud 1980;Lancet Andrew Twaddle (1977:383; see also Bader 1977) put thecontradictions between the people's heal).\" needs on the one hand, and profit motive and images of development on the other thus:There is an ideological commitment whichleads the developed [countries] to believe the 104export of technology to be useful. On the other side is a desire on the part of the developingcountries to emulate the developed. They wantthe symbolic values which high technology carries,the image of development. Irrelevance to infectious disease problems and environmentalhazards are overlooked on both sides.It may thus be seen that modernization of healthservices and the transfer of technology it entails are partof the wider orientation to national development. But thedrugs and equipment necessary for Western medical practiceare not produced in Nigeria, but in developed countrieswhose social and epidemiological experiences differ fromthose of the Third World.Indeed, as Mike Muller (1982:65)has shown, only a minuscule \"3 percent of the funding forbiological research through the world is directed to diseasesthat afflict its poor nations.\" Herein lies a major reason far the inappropriateness of drugs imported into the ThirdWorld. Fundamentally, therefore, MNDCs in the Third Worldare spurred by the profit motive and not the healthproblems of the people, as our opening epigram illustrates.Convincing Third World countries to continue buying drugs,even if these provide no solution to the real healthproblems, is predicated on erroneous belief that health careis curative medicine.Through this conception, whichneglects the real health problems of hunger and squalour,medical care has been foisted on the people as health care.Maintenance of the drug market is also ensured througheconomic stakes in the drug industry. Many Nigerians,particularly since the indegenization decree which stipulatesa 40 to 60 equity participation for major businesses, haveinvested money in drug companies. Furthermore, people atthe lower level of the drug industry (like patent dealers,pharmacy shop owners, medical representatives) equally havea material stake in drugging. Medical representatives forexample are in the habit of setting up their own drugbusiness, the necessary contacts having been m 1de whiledetailing. Such businesses become the launch pads for drugdistributorship (directly from MNDCs) and supplies togovernment. Some detail persons are simultaneously engagedin detailing and running their own pharmacy shops. In this1 i b 105way, the drug industry reproduces itself and the neo-colonial political economy of which it is a part.A major target of MNDCs is the state. This is because under dependent capitalism the state is easily influencedinto bulk purchase contracts often times of unnecessary oreven expired items (Yudkin 1980; Glucksberg and Jack 1982;Ojukwu 1984).The role of the state as both intermediaryand outlet is facilitated by the close relations between thepublic and the private sector in which drugs and otherequipments are funnelled from the former. As an example, it can be cited the case of UNICEF drugs which were sentto Bauchi State in 1986 and were found later in publicmarkets.Indeed, as we have argued elsewhere (Alubo1986a:475), the medical profession uses the state to importdrugs which invariably helps to sustain private medical carebusiness.The medical profession is linked to drug com-panies in other ways through funding of journals, confer-ences, and medical education and research. It is in this light that Upjohn in 1983 instituted a prize of N1000 (thenUS$1400) for the best medical school graduate. According to Upjohn's Vice-president the prize \"symbolize(s) thecontributions made by Upjohn employees to health andhealth education in Nigeria\" (Nwakanma 1983:1). hi the final analysis, therefore, whether it is tagged public orprivate--itself a spurious demarcation (O'Connor 1973)--drugimports serve the same purpose of furthering capitalaccumulation and profits.Most medical care in Nigeria is concentrated in thecities,specificallyinstate capitals (NDP 1975:260), butstructural factors determining access are not limited to thegeographical location of facilities. In general, access tomedical services in Nigeria is determined by one's economicability and status in the public service. The post colonial state operates a superfluous policy in which access tomedical care is both a fringe benefit to its employees and aconstitutional right. Furthermore, these state employees arecharged with ensuring that no one (including the unem-ployed, peasants and the private sector) is neglected. Thefact that has consistently emerged, however, is that thisgeneral legal provision is pushed aside for status, power(including economic power) and privileges which determinewhether and what type of medical care one gets in contem-porary Nigeria (Alubo 1986c; Stock 1985; Onoge 1975). .1 Z. 106The majority of the people who do not have medicalcare as a job related benefit nor the ability to pay arediscriminated against.Hence, the druggist becomes aconvenient alternative for this neglected majority. As a result of this sustained deprivation, this neglected majorityhas become distrustful of the elite even when the latter isostensibly acting in the former's \"interest.\" This point is illustrated by the passage below in which a commonerrefused to be discouraged from purchasing \"fine finemericine\"from a hawker:Here they come again.Those who will not let one be.Educated man, just leave us alone tobuy what we want.When you are sick you donot delay in going to America for medicalattention (Olonfitila 1983:3).The itinerant druggist provides the only access to Western\"medical care\" for a majority of Nigerians. In another example of this drugging, it was found that within a year adrug store sold about 10 million tablets of Dapsone B.P. tooutlets other than leprosy clinics (Oculi 1981:157).Ironically, another important factor which influencesdrugging is shortage of medicines in the public hospitals. Astudy has shown that 60 to 70% of all prescriptions inpublic hospitals in Benue State are unavailable (Alubo 1986c;Igun 1979).In our circumstances where only a few appreci-ate the value of prescription, the general predisposition isto go to the druggist where, unlike public hospitals, thereare neither \"queues and insults,\" and drugs are available.There is then a compelling logic in avoiding the hospitals,after all, the druggist could always \"counter-prescribe.\" Sowhy waste time going to the hospitals for just a prescrip-tion which is available free elsewhere?CONCLUSIONSIn Nigeria's health sector there is little to show forthe pursuit of modernization. While the government has continued to measure in medical terms (number of hospitalbeds and medical staff) health achievements, the real healthindices such as caloric intake, days of disability, etc. areseldom mentioned.Improvements in other indices like lifeexpectancy at birth (40 years in 1965 and 47 in 1983 for121 107males and 43 and 50 for females in the same years) andinfant mortality (152 in 1965 and 113 in 1983) do not reflectmodernization nor correspond to the resources invested.Even as we lack the figures on drug related deaths andillnesses,it is plausible to conclude that given the factorswhich encourage self-medication and other forms ofdrugging, many Nigerians have been actual, even ifunrecorded, victims of drugging. In addition to these hazards created by the technology transferred, the moderni-zation policies followed in Nigeria divert resources from thereal health needs--nutrition, water, sanitation. In this regard the Chilean economist Jorge de Ahumeda has arguedthat every dollar spent in Latin America on physicians andhospitals cost a hundred lives. This thesis is equally applicable to Nigeria.The point here is that were themoney better spent, one hundred lives could be saved(Barnett and Muller 1974:165; Muller 1982:19).Some general implications flow from the modernizationpath to Nigeria's development generally and health develop-ment in particular.As this paper has illustrated, theresearch and development, and, consequently, the productionof drugs, are not geared towards Third World problems. Butas we have seen drugs are an essential component of healthcare delivery in Nigeria.Nigeria's health policies effectivelyaccept what MNDCs decide to produce and market in thename of drugs.Additionally, Nigeria has no control overthe price /s of drugs. To achieve a better control over drugprices the current tender (bidding) system should beabolished and the adoption of a national formulary should betaken seriously.As experiences from other Third Worldcountries have shown (Melrose 1981) the introduction of anational formulary eliminates the large expenditures foradvertisements and leads to lower costs. One can also suggest that its adoption may also reduce the abuse andmisuse of drugs. 1 108NOTESThe author is deeply indebted to Dr. Olufemi Adelakunfor useful suggestions and comments in earlier drafts, andto Clara N.

DRUGS AND UNDERDEVELOPMENT:A CASE STUDY OF KANO STATE, NIGERIA ROBERT STOCKKingston, OntarioCanada In world-wide terms, the ^',-ican market for thepowerful drug manufacturing giants is small-about four per cent in all.Despite this, with other markets beginning to wane...the African market has become a prime target for what iseuphemistically termed \"potential\" (New African1983 [Decemberl:63).Pharmaceuticals are among the most ubiquitous andwidely-used products of modern industry. Although the Third World market accounts for a comparatively small proportion of global pharmaceutical sales, the value of thismarket to the transnational drug manufacturers is immense.Not only does the concentration of three-quarters of theworld's population in the Third World indicate muchpotential for future market growth, but the inadequacy oflegal controls over pharmaceutical manufacturers anddistributors in most of these countries provides opportunities115 1 44.).:d 116for companies to experiment with new products, to dumpdrugs banned elsewhere as dangerous or of inferior quality,and to make excessive profits at the expense of Third Worldconsumers.Pharmaceutical products, like many modern innovationsintroduced into the Third World, have been a double-edgedsword.While pharmaceuticals have much potential foralleviating suffering and saving lives, they have beeninstrumental in the emergence of significant new social andmedical problems.Their impact, whether positive orharmful, is 'a consequence of the ways in which the productsare used, and ultimately the ways in which they arepromoted and distributed to consumers.In recent years, there has been considerable researchon issues concerned with the promotion, distribution andinappropriate use of drugs in the Third World. The mostcomprehensive' surveys are to be found in books by Melrose,Bitter Pills:Medicines and the Third World (Melrose 1982)and by Silverman, Prescriptions for Death: The Drugging ofthe Third World (Silverman et al. 1982).These studies examine the multinational pharmaceutical industry's tacticsin promoting their products in the Third World, and showhow exaggerated claims about the uses of the product andincomplete disclosure of pertinent cautionary informationabout inappropriate uses and side-effects jeopardize thehealth of consumers.The clearest examples of the phar-maceutical industry's culpability are to be found in thedumping in poorly-regulated Third World countries ofproducts which have been banned elsewhere (Made ley andAchola 1980).THE IMPACT OF PHARMACEUTICALSIN THE THIRD WORLD:DEVELOPMENT OR UNDERDEVELOPMENT?The study of social and economic change in the ThirdWorld is centered around two broadly-defined paradigms.The developmentalist paradigm, exemplified by modernizationtheory, was predominant during the 1960s and still persists,particularly in the form of various bottom-up approaches todevelopment.Modernization theory examined the assumedtransformation of societies from \"traditional\" to \"modern\",which Rostow (1960) had postulated as occurring in five130 117stages.The literature of modernization dispays a commonOptimism about the transformation of the Third World.A sub-set of the modernization literature has studiedthe diffusion of specific modern innovations such as newcrops and birth control technology. Innovation diffusion studies sought to relate patterns of spread, socially andspatially, to broader dimensions of development and thesocio-economic attributes of the adopting populations.However, there was little effort to critically examine thefull range of impacts of innovations which were assumed tobe inherently benefezial and progressive.S!nce the late 1960s, the underdevelopment paradigmhas been prevalent, especially in academic research.Whereas the former paradigm saw Western influences,including the impact of Western technological innovations,as elements of progress, the latter saw them as contributingto the disintegration of Third World societies and economies.The initial thrust of research within the underdevelop-ment paradigm came in the form of dependency theory.According to Andre Gunder Frank (1969) and other depen-dency theorists, the penetration of metropolitan economiclinkages, cultural influences and technology in the ThirdWorld fostered underdevelopment rather than progress.More recently, Marxist theories of underdevelopment havebecome increasingly prominent in the study of socio-economic change in the Third World periphery. The articulation of modes of production, inspired by Rey's studyof colonialism in central Africa (Rey 1971) has beenespecially emphasized in the Marxist underdevelopmentliterature.The capitalist mode of production and specificinnovations associated with capitalism are seen as beingimposed gradually and unevenly at the expense of indigenousmodes of production.'Vhereas social scientists situated in the developmentparadigm have focussed on patterns of diffusion and theindividual characteristics of adopters, researchers informedby underdevelopment theories asked questions about theideological, politeAl and economic origins of innovations andtheir impacts upon society (Blaikie 1978). The importanceof structural factors facilitating the diffusion process, ratherthan adopter characteristics, was also emphasized (Brown1 ji 118 1981).Such questions concerning the origins and societalimpacts of modern technologies introduced into the ThirdWorld are important because of their many influences on ways of life,the quality of life, and sometimes - in the case of pharmaceuticals, for example - the probability oflife itself.There are few innovations which have had, are having, and potentially have a global impact comparable to that ofmodern pharmaceutical products. Pharmaceuticals are the cornerstone upon which modern biomedicine has been built.Modern drugs, especially antiLiotics, have been instrumentalin controlling a variety of infectious diseases and therebysaving lives. The accelerated epidemiological transition fromhigher to lower rates of mortality in the majority of ThirdWorld countries is attributable in very large measure to the introduction of modern medicine (Omran 1977).The most dramatic gains in saving lives have been among infants and young children, who have benefitted not only from curativemedicine but also from preventative measures such as mass immunization.The broad masses of Third World poor,especially in underdeveloped peripheral areas, have not received the full benefits of immunization technology,despite its inexpensiveness and effectiveness. The ExpandedImmunization Program (EPI ), organized under the auspices ofUNICEF, is now organizing mass immunization programs to provide complete coverage for young children against themajor preventable causes of child mortality. While the short term result islikely to be accelerated populationgrowth, a reduction ininfant and child mortalityis a crucial precondition for the acceptance of sustained,voluntary fertility control (Demerath 1976).Detracting from these beneficial effects are the social, economic and medical costs of health-threatening drugs usedinappropriately. Medical \"side effects\", sometimes fatal, are associated with the use of some drugs; the cure can be worse than the sickness.illness may also be needlessly anddangerously prolonged when therapy involves the use of medicines which are ineffective, quite possibly because ofproduct misrepresentation. Pharmaceutical products usedindiscriminately and without regard for proper dosages andtreatment regimes may lose their efficacy for legitimatemedical purposes (Silverman and Lydecker 1981).Some 19 119medicines are addictive and bring severe social, economicand medical consequences for addicts and their families.There is an unnecessarily high risk that the drugs usedby Third World consumers will actually harm their health.The primary reason relates to the commonplace marketingpractices of the multinational drug industry - drug dumping,'exaggerated claims about indicated uses and minimalcautionary notes in advertisements and company literature,and the use of incentives for physicians and officials(Melrose 1982; Silverman et al. 1982; Yudkin 19814).The paucity of research and development expenditure pertainingto the diseases of underdeveloped countries is another wayin which the policies of the drug multinationals adverselyaffects the health of Third World people (Doyal 19814). Onlyone percent of approximately $5,000 million spent by theindustry on research and development is spent on ThirdWorld diseases (Taylor 1982).While many of the issues surrounding the politicaleconomy of drug promotion at a macro-scale are nowrelatively well understood, our knowledge about the patternsof distribution and utilization of modern pharmaceuticals inparticular Third World settings remains very sketchy. Whatare the various chains of distribution, starting with themultinational pharmaceutical companies and ending withconsumers?To what extent are there variations spatial, social and economic - in the availability and utilization ofmodern pharmaceuticals?How are patterns of availabilityaffected by such factors as drug control policies of thestate, the nature of the conventional health care system,advertising, and cultural perceptions about the nature ofillness and its appropriate treatment?The predominance of informal utilization (i.e.,self-medication) among Third World consumers is one reason forour relative ignorance about these issues. We also know little about the structure and functioning of the informal,unregistered and unregulated distribution networks for drugs,including various types of quacks and drug peddlers, whichare so important in Third World countries. The work of van der Geest provides useful insights into the workings ofthe unregulated informal health care system as distributorsof drugs in Cameroon (van der Geest 1982a; 1982b, 1985). 1:13 120While the basic structure and significance of informaldrug distribution systems in other Third World countries islikely to be comparable to that of Cameroon, research onthese issues is needed elsewhere in the Third World.Policies to safeguard public health by improved regulation ofdrug distribution must be based on a firm foundation ofknowledge about actual patterns and processes locally.The current alarm over the spread of the deadly andstill incurable disease AIDS provides a compelling reason tolearn much more about all systems of drug distribution inthe Third World.The reuse of contaminated hypodermicneedles has been implicated as a likely vehicle for thespread of AIDS and ARC (AIDS-related complex) in the so-called AIDS belt of Central Africa, where AIDS may afflict5% Of the population in certain areas (Riley 1986). If the connection between AIDS and contaminated needles is real,then upgrading the quality of conventional health careprograms in the Third World and effectively regulating theactivities of injection salesmen and other informal-sectorsources of medicines is absolutely essential.What follows is a case study of the growing utilizationof pharmaceutical products in Kano State, Nigeria. Itfocusses on the patterns of distribution of pharmaceuticals,seeks explanations for the growth in utilization, anddiscusses some of the economic, social and medical impacts.This is a preliminary study, reflecting the virtual absence ofofficial data, the covert nature of most illegal drug distribu-tion, and the reluctance of consumers to be candid abouttheir acquisition and utilization of drugs obtained fromillegal sources. Although the data are sketchy, they clearlyshow that pharmaceutical consumption is rapidly increasingin both urban and rural settings, that the state has hadlittle success either in ensuring an adequate supply of drugsfor its health care facilities or in controlling the prolifera-tion' of illegal drug sales, and that modern pharmaceuticalshave truly been a double-edged sword in their impact inKano State. THE NIGERIAN PHARMACEUTICAL EXPLOSIONWith a population estimated to be over 100 million, andwith a petroleum-dominated economy which provided anEP4 121average annual rate of growth in federal governmentrevenues of 26% between 1970 and 1980 (Watts 19814:403),Nigeria has clearly been the most lucrative and fastest-growing market in Africa for the transnational pharma-ceutical industry.Pharmaceutical imports into Nigeriaamounted to an average of $5,760,000 per year during the1960s (Table 1).Between 1980 and 1984, the mean value ofpharmaceutical imports into Nigeria had increased to$346,558,000 per year, including a high of $621,382,000 in1981.Thus, imports during the 1980s have been, onaverage, 60 times as great as those during the 1960s.Nigerian imports of pharmaceutical products have beenhigh in comparison to other Third World countries. Between1980 and 1984 Nigeria was the largest importer of pharma-ceuticals in the Third World, and ninth largest in the world.During this period, for example, Nigerian drug .sports were more than double those of Brazil, four times as great asIndia's and fifteen times as great as those of Bangladesh(United Nations 1985).Other large Third World countriessuch as Brazil, India and Egypt have much better-developedindigenous pharmaceutical industries, and so are lessdependent on imports.Nigeria's forty-fold increase in drug imports in onedecade is primarily due to a significant diffusion of theutilization of these products in Nigeria. Not only are more Nigerians using pharmaceuticals, but they also are usingthem more frequently and are tending to consume morespecialized and expensive products. Actual levels and patterns of pharmaceutical utilization vary within Nigeria,especially between urban and rural areas, between socialclasses, and between regions which are more and lessaffected by modern Western influences. Much of the expansion is attributable to the growth of the health caresystem since 1970, but itis even more a consequence ofconsumers' increased purchases of drugs from retail outlets,but formal and informal.However, this growth cannot beexplained without reference to the marketing strategies ofthe pharmaceutical industry, targeted to influence govern-ment officials, physicians, commercial agents, and consumers. 1 i b 122 TABLE 1NIGERIAN IMPORTS OF PHARMACEUTICAL Figures Source:Yearbook of International Trade Statistics New York:United Nations (volumes for 1962-1984) 123PHARMACEUTICAL DISTRIBUTION INKANO STATE, NIGERIAPharmaceutical products reach Kano State consumersthrough three types of channels, namely the health care system, licensed retailers of medicinal products, and variousunlicensed and often illegal distributors of pharmaceuticals.Kano is the most populous of the 19 states in Nigeria,withi 1981 total of 9,467,000 people (Kano State 1981a).Over 90%, of the population is of Hausa and Fulani ehnicity,and virtually all are Muslim. There is one major city, Kano,with approximately one million inhabitants; the remainder ofthe population lives in small towns of under 50,000 peopleand in rural areas.Kano State, especially the rural areas,was extremely neglected during colonial times. Disparities in development, both between urban and rural Kano State,and between Kano and the southern Nigerian states, are still considerable.The Health Care SystemMost of Kano State's Western health care system isgovernment-administered.At the bottom of the hierarchy offacilities are dispensaries, the great majority of which are operated by local government authorities and staffed byminimally-trained primary health care workers. Inpatient care and the more specialized health care services areF.rovided at general hospitals, constructed, staffed, andadministered by the state government. \"There are thirteen such general hospitals in Kano Ste- (eleven state-owned and two private), plus six specialized hospitals (e.g. infec-tious diseases, orthopedic, ps1 'liatric, and military) (KanoState of the health care systemremains poorly developed; it consists of nine Rural HealthCenters and 61Health Clinics constructed under theNigerian government's Basic Health Services initiative. Theyare staffed by fully-trained primary health care workers andnurses who are able to deal with a much broader spectrumof medical problems than dispensary attenuants.Although Kano State remains grossly underserved interms of health care with a total of only 204 doctors in1981 (one per 47,000), there has been considerable growth inrecent years in the size and complexity of the system. Withheal '.- services being orovided in inct;easinalv remote areas,1:3 7 1214and with a wider range of services provided, the demand forpharmaceuticals for this health care system continues togrow. The expansion of child vaccination programs in ruralareas using mobile teams of health workers represents butone aspect of this growth.The rapi growth of the system in recent years, thesevere decline in petroleum revenues since 1980 and the lackof political will and foresight have all contributed to thedeclining quality of public sector health care (Stock 1985).Chronic shortages of trained staff, essential equipment andall drugs are the most visible manifestations of the crisis.In addition to the public health care system, there is asmall but rapidly growing private-sector system. As of 1981, thirty of the 204 doctors had private practices in thecity of Kano.The number of private-sector physicians inKano approached 100 as of 1985.Licensed Retail OutletsPharmaceuticals are sold at licensed retail outlets oftwo types, namely pharmacies and patent medicine stores.The former are allowed to sell a full range of drugs, butmust employ a fully-trained pharmacist, while the latter arerestricted to selling a small number of commonly-usedpatent (non-prescription, over the counter) medicines.Patent medicine stores were first licensed in 1981 inKano State.Licensing was introduced in response to thegrowth of drug abuse, and the increasingly visible sale ofall kinds of drugs.Potentially harmful products were beingsold openly by petty traders and quack practitioners.Licensing was also seen Ps a device to encourage entre-preneurs to open medicine shops outside the city of Kano.Moreover,it was reasoned, these patent medicine storeswould relieve some of the pressure on the official healthcare system by providing an alternate source of medicine forrural people.In reality, it represented a tacit acknowledge-ment of the failure of the government health care system tofill public demand for care.The fee for obtaining a license, Naira 150 (approxi-mately $225US) was excessive for most of the previouslyunregulated drug sellers in Kano State. The fact that1314 125license holders were to have a minimum of a primary schooleducation also disqualified the majority of the former drugretailers, since most adults have no Western education. Theeducational restriction and excessive cost of a licenseensured the perpetuation of an illegal trade in pharma-ceutical products.The high cost of licensing also ensuredthat patent medicine retailers would not be content to sellonly common patent medicines. Most illegally sell a variety of more potent and dangerous, but also more profitable,drugs.Many also illegally administer injections. The licensing law has failed to restrict drug sales to license-holders, and has also failed to stop illegal drug sales bylicensed retailers.Table 2 shows the increase in patent medicine stores inKano State, especially since 1980. Whereas most of the early growth in patent medicine stores was in the city ofKano, more recent growth has been in rural. parts of thoistate.The increasing density of rural patent medicinestores is related to the licensing law which reserved licensesfor new urban medicine stores for retiring employees of theKano State Ministry of Health. While this may have diverted some retailers into rural areas, it has also providedan incentive for professional health workers to leave thechronically understaffed public service to set up retailbusinesses.Despite the increase in rural patent medicine stores,approximately two-thirds of licensed pharmaceutical outletsare still found in Metropolitan Kano. Most of the \"rural\"shops are being established in larger towns such as Hadejia,Dambatta and Birnin Kudu, rather than in truly rural areas.The concentration in the city of Kano and to a lesserextent in the larger towns reflects the distribution ofdemand and purchasing power. Urban consumers generallyare aware of a greater range of pharmaceutical products,and are more likely to be able to afford costly drugs.Patent medicine stores are to be found in all parts ofMetropolitan Kano.However, the greatest concentration isin the primarily migrant quarters such as Sabon Gari (one-third of the total of 334 shops) and Gwagwarwa-Brigade(one-fifth of the total) .There are lower concentrations inthe indigenous Hausa and Fulani neighborhoods, reflectingthe much shorter history in northern than in southern 1 `-4 rf 126 TABLE State 55 410 (+116*)Kano Municipal 50 150 334 266 (+72*)Rest of State 5 20 105 144 (+1.2*) Source:Unpublished data, Ministry of Health, Kano State. *Presumed to existRegistered in 1981 but unregistered as of July, ?982. 127Nigeria of mass education and reliance on Western medicine.Licensed pharmacies, which serve a much larger clienteleand sell a full range of pharmaceuticals, are concentrated inthe central business district and along major transportationarteries.Unlicensed and Illegal DistributorsThe 1981 licensing regulatiinels for the sale of pharma-ceutical products were designed to control the growingproblem of drug abus- by controlling the sources of supplyof potentially harmful drugs. However, the licensing regulations were bound to fail because of the unrealisticrequirements for holding a patent medicine store license.Moreover, the fact that the already established informaltrade in drugs was as much in antibiotics and amphetaminesas in aspirins was not recognized. The law restricting medicine stores to common patent drugs effectively elimin!.ated the possibility for the legal sale of the more potentpharmaceuticals outside Metropolitan Kano.Prior to 1981, there were no legal prohibitions toprevent shopkeepers and petty table traders from sellingmedicines.Whereas most of these traders sold only commonpatent medicines, others specialized in more patent, poten-tially dangerous drugs such as amphetamines and antibiotics.It was commonplace to find traders in markets, lorry parksand along the street, calling out \"kwaya!\" (pills) and\"kafsur!\" (capsules).Itinerant injection salesmen wereanother illicit source of drugs. Many larger centers had resident medicine sellers, often government health careworkers who engaged in so-called \"private practice\".Restricting the sale of pharmaceutical products merelyforced traders to be more careful in selling them. Never- theless, a bris' under-the-table trade has continued.Survey data for sampled localities in Hadejia Emirate,Kano State confirm that a variety of drugs were very widelyavailable in rural areas of the State, and show that the 1981attempt to regulate pharmaceutical sales had totally failed.At least one type of pharmaceutical product was available ineach of the 75 villages (Table 3), despite the fact that onlytwo of them had licensed patent medicine stores. Moreover, there had been significant diffusion of drug sources between1977, whena similar survey was conducted in the same141 128 TABLE 3AVAILABILITY OF SELECTED DRUGS FROMCOMMERCIAL SOURCES IN RURAL KANO STATE UnderOverPopulation 1,0001,000of Locality (n=44)(n=31)Total (n=75)Percent of Hadejia area, 1982.

Nevertheless, most ofthe trade in dangerous drugs remains literally hidden.Explaining the Growth in Pharmaceutical UseThe explosive increase in pharmaceutical imports intoNigeria between 1969 and 1981 encompassed significantgrowth in each of the three distribution networks.Although sectoral data are not available, the greatestproportional growth has seemingly occurred in thecommercial sectors, including both illegal and licenseddistributors.The growth in imports and utilization of themore expensive and potent drugs such as antibiotics andstimulants has almost certainly exceeded that of patentmedicines.The growth of the health care system, made possibleby increased petroleum revenues during the 1970s, representsa primary reason for the increase in pharmaceutical imports.Alllevels of government significantly increased levels offunding to the health care sector. New facilities were established at a rapid rate, and allocations for drugpurchases were substantially increased. Not only were theremore patients to be treated, but physicians and patientshave lobbied for increased drug purchases to improve thequality of health care.Much of the shortage of pharma-ceuticals has been attributable to the theft of drugs fromthe public health care sector for sale to traders or for the\"private practices\" of health workers. These linkages between the formal and informal health care sectors hasbeen examined by van der Geest in a study from Cameroon(van der Geest 1985). 130There have been three periods of substantial increasein drug imports.The first was immediately after the 1967-70 civil war, the second following the 1975 coup whichremoved General Yakubu Gowan's government, and the thirdfollowing the election of Shehu Shagari's civilian regime in1979.In the last two cases, new administrations sought toincrease their popularity by responding to public demandsfor better health care.The apparent benefits to the publicof increased drug imports have always been, at best,temporary. The benefits to the pharmaceutical industry, aswell as many well-placed politicians, civil servants, and health care workers have been much more tangible.Despite the increased pharmaceutical purchases for thehealth care system, complaints about chronic drug shortageshave grown steadily in both rural and urban areas, and the use of alternate sources of biomedicine has acceleratedrapidly.When the Shagari government was overthrown in1983 in a military coup led by Major-General MuhammedBuhari, one of Buhari's justifications was that \"our hospitalshave become mere consulting clinics, without drugs to treatpeople\".When Buhari's government was overthrown byMajor-General Ibrahim Babangida in 1985, the same line was repeated in Babangida's acceptance speech: \"Our hospitalshave become mere consulting clinics.\"The growth of the health care system has had asignificant demonstration effect, particularly in states likeKano State which previously had few health care facilities.Increasing numbers of people are becoming accustomed toWestern-type medicine and are using it along withand often in preference to traditional remedies. Injections remain the most valued form of Western medicine. This reflects the success of past mass campaigns against lethaldiseases such as smallpox and sleeping sickness, and theperceived value of injections as both a prevention and curefor venereal and other diseases. The Hausa believe the injection is particularly effective because the needlepenetrates the body to the source of the affliction (Lastn.d. ).Thus, injections are often specifically requested bypatients at health care facilities. Commercial drug dealers cater to this demand by selling injections to anyone willingto pay the price. 131Patients wanting to obtain biomedicine may be forcedto patronize the informal, licensed or unlicensed, healthcare system.Many remote parts of Kano State lackaccessible health care facilities. Elsewhere, patients seeking treatment at a health care facility are very likely to be toldthat drugs are not ;..,3ilable and mus' be purchased. Manysimply assumed that going to a health center would be awaste of time and go straight to the local medicine store ordrug hawker.The diffusion of drug utilization has been aided by themigration process, both of southern Nigerians to the Northand vice versa.People in the South have had a longer andmore intensive exposure to modern pharmaceuticals andcommonly make extensive use of commercial drug outlets.Southerners have played a key role in the spread of patentmedicine stores in Kano State; of 431 registered owners in1981, 64.7$ were from states other than Kano, including39.0$ from Imo State (Kano State 1982).Rural-urban migration, particularly the seasonal labormigration of northerners to large cities such as Lagos, hasbeen an important stimulus for increased drug use andabuse.Migrants to the city have the opportunity toexperiment with a range of drugs, obtained commercially,for the treatment of illness and for non-medical purposes.Stimulants such as amphetamines (roka or \"rockets\" inHausa) are often used by these laborrnirants to increasetheir capacity for heavy work, to lessen hunger, and to stayawake for long hours. They commonly develop an addictionto these substances, and so must find a way of sustainingtheir drug habit once they return to the village (Salamone1973).The non-medical use of pharmaceutical products is notconfined to migrant laborers. Peer pressure is an importantfactor in the growing non-medical use of drugs such asValium by young people.However, the use of drugs asstimulants is indirectly aided by the Muslim prohibition onalcohol; taking drugs is seen as a somewhat more acceptableform of indulgence among Nigerian Muslims (Salamone 1973).Further explanation for the ready acceptance ofWestern drugs by the Hause may be found in their eclecticapproach to the treatment of ill-health. The Hausa are145 132open-minded about the use of new and non-traditional formsof treatment, and say that the key test is the medicine'seffectiveness in bringing a cure. Moreover, there is a strong tradition of self-treatment. Increasingly, Western pharmaceuticals are being substituted for herbal remedies inself-treatment.Such self-treatment is likely to involve notonly the use of common patent medicines but also anti-biotics taken on a regular basis as a cure-all. In recent years, for example farar kafsur (\"white capsules\") have beenvery popular as a cure-all for everything from the preven-tion of venereal infection by prostitutes, to the protectionof newly-weaned toddlers, to the treatment of conjunctivitisby topical application of the capsule's contents.Certain entrepreneurial traditional healers in urbansettings have responded to the growing market for moderndrugs by preparing and bottling their own traditionalmedicines for commercial sale. The remedies of a small number of these healers are in great demand. However, thedistribution of commercial herbal medicines remains uncon-trolled and subject to abuse. The preparation of these bottled traditional remedies has helped to blur the distinc-tion between indigenous and Western medicines in the mindsof consumers.While factors such as political decision-making andgrowing public familiarity with pharmaceuticals are signifi- cant, no factor is more important than the role of thepharmaceutical industry in promoting the sale of its ownproducts.Patent medicines are heavily advertised using avariety of media, particularly radio, television, newspapers,billboards and loudspeaker vans. Other promotional tactics are directed at physicians and various incentives, bothfinancial and material, are offered to encourage thepurchase of particular brand-name pharmaceuticals.Extensive product promotion helps to stimulate publicdemand, and convinces physicians and official buying agentsto purchase expensive brand-name equivalents of genericproducts and drugs many of which are of marginal utility inthe Third World. 140 133CONCLUSION Itis dangerous to generalize about the impact in theThird World of technological innovations such as modernpharmaceuticals.There have been both positive andnegative impacts, rather than strictly positive ones asmodernization theory would suggest, or inherently negativeones as dependency theory would imply. Modern pharma- ceuticals have contributed significantly to the ongoingstruggle to control infectious diseases in the Third World,and have the potential to contribute much more. At thesame time, potent drugs pose a significant danger to health,especially when used without direction and for non-medicalpurposes.The effectiveness of modern pharmaceuticals, and therisks involved in their use, are affected by many factors.Thus,itis important to establish the context in whichutilization is taking place.Within the formal health caresystem, factors affecting the utility of pharmaceuticalproducts include the availability of the appropriate drug fora particular need, storage conditions which may be crucialto the product retaining its potency, the stage of illness atwhich treatment is sought, the quality of professionaldiagnosis and care, and the extent to which patients followInstructions in taking medicine. There are significant differences between dispensaries and similar low-orderfacilities staffed by poorly-trained and over-worked workersusing a few drugs, and hospitals which employ morequalified staff who dispense a wider range of medicineswhich are potentially dangerous when abused.While pharmaceuticals used in the formal health caresystem seem to represent a mixed blessing heavily dependenton the way in which they are used, drugs sold throughinadequately regulated commercial channels have had anoverwhelmingly negative impact. Profit margins rather than the health of consumers motivate entrepreneurs to selldrugs.Through the widespread uncontrolled sale ofantibiotics, for example, drug resistance has increased, andvarious products have been rendered medically ineffective.Commercial channels are the primary outlets for sub-standards, \"dumped\" drugs which are likely to be useless orharmful.Commercial channels, both licensed and illegal,1447 134supply addictive drugs which ultimately may have serious medical and social consequences for users and their families.While circumstances related to the utilization ofpharmaceuticals are very important, it is imperative as well to examine the broader political and economic context of the provision of drugs in Third World countries. The state plays a crucial role in regulating the volume and composi-tion of drug imports and the internal distribution of theseproducts (Grieve 1985).Since most of the formal healthcare system in Kano State is government-run, the ate is also the major purchaser of pharmaceutical products.Neither the Federal Nigerian government nor the Kano State government have shown sufficient foresight nor political will to establish any degree of control over pharmaceutical imports and distribution.The attempt by Kano State in1981 to license all drug sellers showed a recognition of theneed for better control over drug distribution. However, the law was bound to fail because of its thoroughlyunrealistic requirements for receiving a license, and the state government's lack of control over drug imports intoNigeria.At the federal level, there is still no legal framework for the operation of a Food and Drugs Admini-stration Unit in the Ministry of Health, more than a decade after its establishment.The lack of political will to bring about effectiveregulation can be attributed as much to the profits realizedfrom the drug trade as to bureaucratic disorganization.Government decision-makers and customs officials, health care workers and pharmaceutical manufacturers and distri-butors have a common interest in the profits associated withmaintaining a free flow of pharmaceuticals. Unfortunately, .the most profitable drugs are frequently not those most needed for public health benefits. !tis sub-standard products, often declared unfit for sale in other countries,and expensive luxury drugs which have nothing to do withbasic health care needs which are most likely to be profitable.Public demand for better health care, stimulated largely by promotions and material incentives from thepharmaceutical industry, are crucial in legitimating a drug trade which clearly shows the choice of profit over health (Yudkin 1980). 140 135The shared interests of state, professional andCommercial actors must not be interpreted in a deter-ministic, structuralist fashion. Certain Third World coun- tries, including Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Mozambique, havetaken strong action to control the supply of pharmaceuticalsby restricting imports to a short-list of brand-name drugs has also produced substan-tial saving.In turn, this ensures that more of the essentialpharmaceutical products can be obtained, and that thehealth benefits may be spread more widely. Despite the obvious health benefits of improved regulation (Blum et al.1981), as well as the promotion of basic drug programs bythe World Health Organization (WHO 1977) and otheragencies, there are still few examples of countries whichhave successfully challenged the hegemony of the pharma-ceutical industry and implemented policies which put healthfor many ahead of profit for a few. Nigeria is not one ofthem.

Primary health care that does not guarantee a regular supply ofmedicines loses its credibility. Mamdani and Walker (1985:1)remark that shortage of - curative - drugs weakens people'sconfidence in preventive health services and undermines themorale of primary health care workers. Nichter (1986:349) found that in South India health auxiliaries were notallowed to hand out any medicine. They felt that, as a result, both their status and people's receptivity to theirmedical advice were seriously reduced. In Cameroon, whereIcarried out research, modern medical treatment withoutdrug prescription was out of the question. Services that ran out of drugs, also soon ran out of patients.But what do we want to know about pharmaceuticals?What kind of research is most likely to enable us toformulate suggestions for meaningful change? Problem 141 01 t' ,,J. 142number one is problem identification. Are difficulties mainlyeconomic, pharmacological,political,technical, or infra-structural?Or a matter of customs and beliefs? Or do they have tc do with social relationships? The awkward answer is that probably all these possibilities need to betaken into account.In tnis paper Ishall demonstrate that the provisionand the use of pharmaceuticals are intricately linked upwith a confusing array of factors and circumstances. So- called modernization and economi' uevelopment mean inpractice that different groups it society enjoy extremely unequal access to medicines. Because itisvirtually impossible to deal with the whole gamut of relevantcontexts,Iwillrestrict myself to considering contextualforces which seem of particular political and economicimportance in the rapidly modernizing state of Cameroon.These include the survival imperative for this young state toincrease political cohesion among its population, the problemof over-bureaucratization leading to 'corruption', inter-twining relations between formal and informal sectors in theeconomy of health care, contrasts between public andprivate supply of medicines, the role of multi-nationalindustries, and the influence of WHO policy guidelines.A second, simultaneous, aim of this paper is methodo-logical:Ishall plead for more 'contextuality' in health careresearch, in particular in studies on the distribution and useof pharmaceuticals.Unfortunately the removal of peopleand things from their context for study has become all toopersistently typical of Western research, a development Iwill now turn to examine briefly. CONTEXTUALIZATIONSince the time long ago when the political adageDivide et impera first made its entry into human science, ithas managed to maintainits popularity.For more than three -enturies, we appear to have accepted that scientificprogrt s depends on ever increasing specialization ofresearch, an ever-finer demarcation of one's object of study.The development of Western science might perhaps becharacterized as a continuous yielding to the temptation of 55 1143simplifying reality by cutting it up and then reducing it toa basic principle.The advantage of such manipulations isthat 'reality' becomes so manageable, predictable andamenable to control. The drawback, of course, is that suchpartitioning changes the subject matter into somethingwhich exists only in the mind of the researcher. The resultof this approach has been a diversity of biological, chemical,psychological, sociological, etc. 'explanations' for differentaspects of subjects studied, without a way to integrate thesevarious partial explanations into an over-all view. Yet the embarrassing fact of our inability to understand the subject-matter as a whole has failed to spur scientists into adialogue, as might have been expected. To the contrary, they have preferred to practically ignore the work of otherdisciplines and to regard the theories and findings ofscientists in other fields as irrelevant to their own limitedwork.It has even become normal practice to speak 'as abiologist' ( chemist/ psychologist/sociologist/ etc. ) .I n this way we encourage ourselves to imagine that such things as abiological, chemical or sociological world actually exist.In their defense it should be said that practicingscientists have had no alternative. Popper (1961) rightly pointed out that a holistic method is a logical impossibility,because itleads to a regressio ad infinitum. Itis not possible to study a subject by taking all its relations intoaccount.Phillips (1977) rubs salt in the wound by assertingthat holism is both imperative and unworkable. While philosophers have found it perhaps easy to criticize scien-tism and historicism in scientific research, scientiststhemselves have seen no other choice than to carry on withtheir rigid specializations, undisturbed by work in otherdisciplines.Summarizing, there are two closely related aspects ofthis drift towards compartmentalization in scientificresearch.We need to consider,in the first place, the conscious sub-division of reality into an ever-increasingnumber of disciplines and specializations within disciplinesand in the second place, a less conscious dividing of subjectmatter into partial aspects often treated as if they werewhole.The rise of anthropology can perhaps be regarded asan attempt to correct the latter type of division, for1r 144anthropology attempts the contextualization of its subjectmatter.Anthropologists had hopes of arriving at contex-tualization by carrying out participant observation infieldwork and by viewing their study-object in its 'naturalcontext', or, as Geertz would say, in its \"semantic context.\"Ironically, the emphasis on direct observation only led many anthropologists to succumb to further partitioning of theirsubject matter, failing to link what happened before theireyes to macro-structures outside the communities in whichthey conducted their research. They continued to be hampered moreover by the methodological problem mentionedby Popper.As a net result, despite possible intentions tothe contra,-,anthropology has become just another disci-pline, joi....fg the segregated ranks of biology, chemistry,psychology, sociology, etc.Dissatisfaction with the progressive dissection ofreality and consequent estrangement from the world we'know' has recently led to a number of proposals totranscend old divisions.Wolf (1982:3), for example, hasmade the following appeal:...The world of human kind constitutes a manifold,a totality of interconnected processes, andinquiries that disassemble this totality into bitsand then fail to reassembleit falsify reality.Concepts like \"nation\", \"society\", and \"culture\"name bits and threaten to turn names into things.Only by unrisi-E-te.nciing these names as bundles ofrelationt---hips, and by placing them back into thefisid from which they were abst-acted, can wehope to avoid misleading inferences and increaseour share of understanding.This paper will attempt to illustrate the validity ofWolf's vision and concern, offering a rough sketch of theinterconnection of several processes that impioge on theaccessibility of pharmaceuticals in rural Cameroon. It is my wish to urge my fellow anthropologists to conduct researchon various levels of organization, to study linkages amonginternational, national,regional and local processes thataffect their object of study, and to embark on interdiscip-linary cooperation in fieldwork. Because the scope of this article does not allow for detailed description, its main thrust will be programmatic, pointing out the intercon- 145thrust will be programmatic, pointing out the intercon-nectedness of social processes and the need for a contextualapproach in studying these processes. DISTRIBUTION OF PHARMACEUTICALSIN SOUTHERN CAMEROONFieldwork took place in 1980in the Ntem Division of South Cameroon with brief follow-up visits in 1983.It was carried out at different levels, ascending from peripheralfamily and village life to divisional and national centers ofadministration. This meant that observations and interviewstook place not only in village houses and kiosks, at localmarkets and health centers, but also at hospitals andpharmacies, and in the offices of the Ministry of Health.(2)In all,six relevant contexts or 'linkages' of medicinedistribution were identified. These appear in brief outlinebelow.1.Health care, pharmaceuticals and state formationFrom a political point of view, health care can be seenas an eminent tool for establishing state influence withoutphysical force.Like education, health care can be regardedas a 'peaceful penetration' by the state apparatus on thelocal level, a means to promote the social cohesion neededfor a state to become viable. Godelier(1978)has pointed out that political power does not exist in the physical forceof those claiming to have power but in the acceptance ofthat power by those subjected to it.Power must beregarded as legitimate before we can call it such. If powercan be made to appear as a service rendered by rulers, thensubjects will consider it their duty to serve those who servethem (Godelier 1978:177).Weber(1947)would call suchdevotion struggling to subdue seriouscentrifugal forces. One would, therefore, expect its rulersto invest considerable effort in setting up an efficienthealth care system, thereby making central authorityacceptable to the people as an indispensable provider ofwelfare and health for all.There are several indicationsthat the state is indeed aware of the political potential of'health for all'.In government institutions, health care,15 1146initiating a far-reaching primary health care program andhas pledged priority to the extension of rural health care.In reality, however, the public health care system inrural areas is notoriously inefficient not only when com- pared to urban facilities, but also when compared to ruralhealth services provided by church-related private institu-tions.Instead of drumming up support for the beneficentstate, public rural health care has become a source of anti-propaganda.For the rural population, but also for healthworkers (Hours 1982), public medical services all too oftenhave provided proverbial examples of the state's failure tocater to its people's needs.The fact that this failurecontrasts sharply with the relative success of privateinstitutions in the field of medicine makes the negativedemonstration effect even more pronounced.Prominent in rural health care delivery is a chronicdeficiency of pharmaceuticals on hand. Rural health centersare short of medicines for a great deal of the year. Free distribution of drugs becomes worse than meaningless whengovernment health workers are forced to refer their patientswith prescriptions to a commercial pharmacy, one which maybe far away.(3)Securing necessary medication may entailthe loss of considerable time and money. The failure of thelinkage between the political domain and the provision ofrural health care is of immediate interest. To understand why, we need to weigh the perceived political importance ofdrug supply and health care against other factors in theprocess of state-building.Perhaps the first thing we need to realize is that thestate of Cameroon has not yet completely moved to thestage of legitimation of power by extending public welfare.It still relies on the threat of physical force. In addition in their state-building efforts, the Cameroon authorities areprimarily concerned with the potential resistance of urbanelements, especially among the ranks of the army and policeforce.The quality of health care for these groups isconspicuously higher than for the rural population. In fact, 50% of the national health budget goes to the centraladministration and to hospitals in Yaounde and Douala. Only 7% is spent on rural health care, whereas 71.5% of thepopulation is reported living in rural areas (1976 Census).Finally, we need to realize that until recently the Cameroon15;) 147government, by following a strictly centralist policy anddiscouraging local initiatives, has acted consistently toprevent the rise of political consciousness among the ruralpopulation.Penetration of state influence at the local levelhas been pursued mainly through the threat of coercion andby forestalling local self-reliance.Similar truths emerge when we view urban-ruralinequality in health care provision from a center peripheryperspective.Research revealed that the more remote ahealth center was, the fewer drugs it received. The most peripheral health center I visited received just over half thedrugs it should have; a center in a rural town of 5,000received 87%, the hospital in the divisional capital anestimated 90 to 100%, and the central hospitals of Yaoundeand Douala even more than 100%. Personnel in outlying health centers did not even know what medicines they wereentitled to receive, nor in what quantity. As a result, they were not aware that their allotment of drugs was incom-plete.Their remoteness, in a geographical, communicativeand bureaucratic sense, made it impossible for them to ameliorate the situation. 2.Pharmaceuticals and \"corruption\"Corruption --illegal private use of public means-constitutes an integral part of most, if not all, societies,including Cameroon.Corruption poses extra problems indeveloping countries, not because it occurs more frequently(which would be hard to prove in any case), but becausethese countries, with their restricted resources, can lesswell afford corruption than industrialized ones.Pharmaceuticals are scarce in Cameroon, (4) and, forthat reason, much sought after through corrupt means.Medicines meant for free distribution in public health institutions pass into private hands. This kind of corruptionis related to prevailing customs of gift-giving and to howtraditional loyalties, mainly kinship ones, prevail over obligations to the state.Another factor is the traditionalproprietary view of public office. The most important singleforce promoting corruption, however, is the overwhelmingposition of the state as the principle provider of goods,services and employment, coupled with the relative under-1 6 () 1148development of the private commercial sector. The educa- tion gap between office holders and most Jtizens, moreover,facilitates corrupt practices.Pharmaceuticals disappear on a large scale from thepublic health care system, thus crippling the entire service.A national investigation carried out for the Ministry ofHealth (MSP 1980) concluded that only about half of allmedicines destined for rural health centers arrived there ina state which allowed them to be actually used. The Minister of Health estimated that in 1979about 140$ ofstate-owned medicines 'disappeared'. My own observations point in the same direction: a massive disappearance of drugs essential for the functioning of official health care.It should further be noted that this deflection of medicinesfor private use occurs from the highest to the lowest levelin the distribution chain - although such practices at thetop are almost impossible to prove.The linkage of pharmaceutical supply and corruptpractices suggests a need for research into state bureau-cracy and economy. The concept of a soft versus a 'strong'state might provide another important entry into analysis ofthe problem of unreliable medical supplies. Sampson, who complains that anthropologists have largely neglectedbureaucracy and corruption in their research, supports theposition, maintained at the outset of this paper:The traditional social science division of labor canpartly explain the lack of anthropological researchon bureaucracy and corruption. Formal organiza-tion (even in their most corrupt forms) have beenconsidered the province of sociologists, politicalscientists and economists.Anthropologists areleft with the peripheral peoples, strange customs,deviant cases, and otherwise anomalous groups(Sampson1983:65-66).An important point put forward by Sampson (1983),and before him by Scott (1974),is that corrupt practices canboth lubricate the formal system and render it ineffective.In the case of pharmaceuticals in Cameroon, the scaleclearly tips toward the latter. 161 1493.Formal and informal supply of medicinesMy research in Cameroon disclosed a flourish' ginformal distribution of medicines, partly interwoven withthe formal supply system.It became clear that 'corruption'is often nothing more than the passing of a drug from theformal to the informal supply sector. The informal sector differs from the formal one in many ways. Providers of medicines in the informal sector have no -formal-pharmaceutical training.Their practices, though sociallyaccepted, are illegal.In fact, the medical consequences ofinformal practices often seem a reason for great concern.A further contrast is that activities in the informal sectorappear to be addressed much more immediately to thecondition of poor people than do those in the formal sector.More important than contrasts, however, are thelinkages between formal and informal drug distribution. Thetwo are closely intertwined and mutually dependent. This intertwining shows itself in both the 'wholesale' and the'retailing' of medicines.Drug vendors in the informalsector, for example, purchase their stock from authorizedpharmacies and from personnel working in the formal healthsector. (6)The transactions involve reciprocal interests.The pharmacist increases his turnover by selling medicinesto far-off villagers through unauthorized vendors. Health workers augment their income by selling medicines whichwere to be given to patients free of charge.The drug supply to patientsis characterized by a similar interconnection between the two sectors. By selling'free' medicines to patients in their homes, health workersbec.me informal distributors. Knowing no medicines areavailable A the health center, patients often buy medicinesbefore they visit the center and bring them along. Phar-macists sell prescription-medicines over-the-counter and thusfunction similarly to informal and unqualified vendors. (7)The formal,legal supply of medicines relies on andmakes use of informal, illegal distribution. The two cannotbe separated.Suggestions for the improvement of drugdistribution must take the existence of both sector= intoaccount.Formal and informal transactions with medicinesare not mutually exclusive, as is sometimes believed, !Jutsupport one another. 1504.Public versus private drug supplyPerhaps the most startling of my research findings wasthat the supply of medicines functions far better in theprivate than in the public sector. In the private sectorpatients pay for medicines. li.is in the interest of thosewho sell to maintain their stock, whether pharmacist,private health center or informal drug vendor. In public health institutions, however, where drugs are given free ofcharge, personnel have little vested interest in assuring aconstant supply of drugs on hand. The unavailability of drugs does not really represent any loss to them; even ifhealth services break down because of lack of drugs, thesituation will not affect their source of income. In fact, personnel in public institutions often derive material benefitfrom such drug shortages: drugs privately sold may add totheir income; drugs distributed among friends and relativesmay provide future advantages; drugs given to importantfigures may safeguard their own social and economicsecurity.A temporary collapse of the medical services,moreover, allows health workers to undertake addition&economic activities.A national investigation into the distribution ofpharmaceuticals cited lack of a commercial spirit in thepublic sector (from top to bottom) as the root cause ofoverall inefficiency.(8)It reported that when drug orderswere sent to the central pharmacy in the public sector,delivery took from eight months to more than two years,while orders to commercial suppliers were delivered in threeweeks (MSP 1980).In practice, the Cameroon health care system, designedto serve the poor by providing free services, has turned outto be all too expensive, failing to provide required servicesand obliging patients to resort to other institutions, at times with considerable loss of time, money and health.Ironically, public health care, with full state support, functions defectively, whereas private health care, withvirtually no state funding, functions satisfactorily (cf. Hours1982, 1985). 163 1515.Pharmaceuticals and MultinationalsDuring the past ten years numerous publications haveanalyzed and criticized the marketing of pharmaceuticals inthe Third World by multinationals. (9) A leading criticism has been that pharmaceutical companies act purely out ofcommercial motives while hiding behind a humane facade ofwishing to cure illness and relieving pain. Their profit- making is made all the easier by the weak position ofconsumers in developing countries. (10)All modern pharmaceutical products in Cameroon areimported; the country depends fully on the in*ernationaldrug industry for its supplies. Studying the shortage of medicines in rural health centers and the abundance ofdangerous and useless medicines in the informal sector, it isnot immediately clear how these problems are related to therole of drug multinationals.Reports from other developingcountries about the proliferation of non-essential (often aeuphemism for 'useless' )drugs and aggressive marketpractices by pharmaceutical industries do not seem to holdas true for Cameroon.Yet my research did not include asurvey among doctors, pharmacists and other drug pre-scribers about promotion activities by the pharmaceuticalindustry. Some caution is necessary, therefore. Elsewherecritics have extensively documented double standards inmarketing and revealed the exorbitant sums spent on drugpromotion in the Third World. One example is Tanzania where the drug industry spent L12,500 per doctor onpromoting its products, an amount far exceeding th a annualincome of most doctors (Mamdani & Walker 1985:41'1.With regard to Cameroon it should be noted that,because the Ministry of Health spends too much of itsbudget on expensive, non-essential drugs, it is not able topurchase7:sufficiency of medicines that are needed.Apparently irrational drug purchasing is owing, among otherthings, to the industry's ability to manipulate the Ministry'spolicy which advances the interests of individual policy-makers and the urban elite at the expense of the ruralpopulation.This at least, Ishould point out, was the situation in 1980. Since 1984 a restricted drug list has beenintroduced for the public sector. Nevertheless this measure seems likely to prove insufficient to restore the drug supplyin government health institutions to even minimal levels.1Gx) 152Evaluations from various other developing countries showthat exemption of the private sector from an essential drugsprogram leads to the failure of the entire program, forprescribers as well as users of pharmaceuticals continue toresort to non-essential drugs available in the private sector(Mamdani & Walker 1985:146).As we have already observed, the existence of aninformal sector forthe supply of medicines bears a directrelation to drug shortages in the formal sector. Some drugssold informally compensate for shortages in health centers,others enter the informal sector from those very healthcenters, thus aggravating their shortages. Moreover, such drugs are usually exempt from proper medical supervisiononce they pass into the informal system. As a result,valuable drugs may become worthless, even harmful, becausethey are misused.It may seem far-fetched to link these problems to themarketing policies of pharmaceutical firms. These firms have reiterated that they cannot be held responsible forwhat happens to their products in the countries of theThird World.They can only guarantee the safety of theirproducts and he accuracy and adequacy of the informationwhich they provide. (11)They assume that certain desig-nated drugs can indeed only be purchased with a doctor'sprescription and that delivery of pharmaceuticals to theprivate health care sector does not detract from the publicsector.This stance, however, pays no regard to thecomplexity of the health care situation in most developingcountries.No company can be sure what ..4i i I eventually happen with its products, certainly not in the Third World.There are clear indications that, up to 19814, the sale ofexpensive medicines to the government of Cameroon wasdetrimental to the supply of drugs needed in rural healthcare.Since 19814, when an essential drugs program wasimplemented, the sale of non-essential drugs through theprivate sector has continued to hamper attempts to achievean adequate,rug supply in public rural health centers.Moreover, how much are 'the safety of products andadequacy of information' claimed by the industry worth if these products are sold outside prescribed medical out ts?The policies of pharmaceutical companies may notconsciously be directed to promote a haphazard and165 153maladapted distribution of medicines in countries of theThird World, but many present problems in drug suppliescertainly derive from that policy. Multi-national companies consistently disregard the problems of drug procurement inthe Third World and fail to look for appropriate measures toprevent or to reduce the hazardous and wasteful use oftheir products.Recent attempts by developii g countries to improvetheir own public drug supply systems have been resisted bypharmaceutical companies when indicated measures threa-tened a reduction of their market.(12) One development ofparticular interest is the International Federation ofPharmaceutical Manufacturers Associations'(IFPMA)announcement that 40 to 50 companies are prepared tosupply cheap essential drugs to a selected number ofdeveloping countries, including Cameroon. It seems clear, however, that this offer was meant to buy time andforestall anymore radical changes to be possibly imposedupon the industry by the WHO and developing countriesthemselves.The IFPMA is still 'negotiating', six years afterthe initial offer.One reason for delay in implementation ofthe plan is, as a representative of the industry has said, the\"completely inadequate organization and systems forprocurement, distribution and storage of pharmaceuticals\" inthose developing countries (HAI 1982: 6). It is significant,of course, that pharmaceutical companies were never knownto be bothered by inadequate infrastructures as long as theycould sell all the products they wanted to sell.in conclusion, a linkage between the internationalpharmaceutical industry and health care in Cameroon villagesmay not be as directly visible as other linkages, but itcertainly is part of the contextual reality which concernsus.It should further be noted that the very unobtrusive-ness of the connection contributes to its efficacy! 6.Pharmaceuticals and WHO PolicyIn1977 the WHO published its first official reportabout a plan for the selection of essential drugs(WHO 1977).The basic idea of the plan was \"that the single mostimportant measure needed to cut costs and ensure thatdrugs are used effectively is to limit the number amilableI 6U 154to those 'most necessary for of the majorityof the population\" (Melrose 1982a:148). It is remarkable that this plan, so widely applauded, has hardly beenimplemented anywhere, at least not in an effective way. Its world-widesupport is not difficult to explain. Limitation of medicines to specific essential drugs would solve nume- rous health care problems, particularly in the Third World.It would enable governments with restricted budgets to buysufficient medicines to supply the entire health care system while appreciably reducing the risk of inappropriate druguse. Why then has this admirable WHO plan so rarely beenput into effective practice?By April 1982 (Melrose 1982a:148), 70 countries hadadopted restricted drug lists, but in almost all of them theselists couid easily be circumvented. Circumvention could be achieved, for example, by allowing \"unrestricted\" lists in theprivate sector or by leaving it entirely up to doctors whatdrugs to prescribe.Underlying reasons for reluctance toenforce restricted lists should be sought in other contextsof drug distribution, particularly those which have to dowith political pressure groups (see 1) and multi-nationalcompanies (see 5).Policy-makers in Cameroon are caughtbetween two groups with conflicting interests: on the one hand the established elite (commercial, medical, pharma-ceutical and political) to which they themselves belong, andon the other the non-organized, most rural, masses. For policy-makers then, the most attractive solution to thispredicament seems, for the time being, to be 'rhetoricalimplementation' of the WHO plan, a solution which has now been put into practice; with the approval of medical andpharmaceutical professional groups the Ministry of Healthhas drawn up a list of essential drugs. The result is a compromise which leaves physicians free to continueprescribing non-essential medicines, and pharmacists tocontinue buying - and selling - them. Sufficient appropriatemedicines are therefore unlikely to become available inCameroon villages in the near future. Summary and ConclusionsThis distribution and use of pharmaceuticals havenumerous linkages with national and international politicsand policies, with the marketing practices of multi-national 1 b 7 155firms, with the operational problems of bureaucracy, withurban-rural relationships and with various economic factors.Further linkages with the social, domestic and individualcognitive domain of drug consumers, not discussed above,are equally important.We have seen that effective public health care can bea powerful political binding agent for governments in arelatively early phase of state formation. An adequate drugsupply is generally regarded as one of the most prominentfeatures of an effective health care system. In Cameroon, however, the government does not accord a high priority toproviding satisfactory health care to the rural areas.Access to necessary medicines is extremely limited in ruralcommunijes.It seems that the government is moreconcerned with the political loyalty of the urban populationand of \"vociferous\" elements which pose a potential threatto its hegemony.For the rural population the maininducement to allegiance still seems to be negative: (the menace of) physical force in the event of disobedience.Another factor impeding equal access to pharmaceuti-cals is over-bureaucratization and subsequent corruption.Non-organized small farmers and wage labourers undergonumerous forms of petty oppression at the hands ofgovernment-paid officials and health care personnel whohave direct access to the medical resources that they need.Corrupt practices are closely linked with the existence- and intertwining - of a formal and informal sector of drugsupply.Pharmaceuticals unlawfully diverted from the free - formal supply-line become available again in the informalsector, but now at a price and usually without medicalsupervision.Rural patients are thus at a double disadvant-age:financial and medical.Bureaucratization in public health care is propelled bylack of incentive for efficient fulfillment of tasks. Various kinds of profit that accrue to health workers who performwell in private institutions are absent in public ones. The pursuit of private gain by government health workers ratherencourages inefficiency inpublic services.A shortage of drugs is the most acutely felt consequence for the generalpublic. t.) 156The role of the international pharmaceutical industry inthe unsatisfactory drug supply is not always easy topinpoint.My preliminary impression in Cameroon is thatthe industry's responsibility for inequality in drug access islargely a question of unsalutary neglect: the absence of anyconcern about the actual usage of its products. How can the industry claim in good faith that it guarantees the safety of its products while at the same time it isso blatantly indifferent to the widespread unsafe use ofpharmaceuticals?The question to what extent industryactively contributes to the present problem of unequal drugdistribution in Cameroon needs further research.WHO policy is another international force affectingdrug distribution in Cameroon. Developing countries have played an important role in drawing the WHO's attention totheir- health problems.Indeed the WHO's policy documenton essential drugs (WHO 1977) is a forward-going tangibleresult of concerted efforts to devise ways to alleviate theproblem of drug shortage.At the same time, however, mostdeveloping countries themselves effectively continue tothwart the WHO's 'prescription' for the realization of amore just and equal distribution of needed medicines. This apparent anomaly in national health policy can best beunderstood if we view drug distribution in a broad contextof political and economic interests. Refusal to implement a restricted drug list for both the public and private sectors,for example, seems to be the result of self-interestedpressure by doctors, pharmacists, the pharmaceuticalindustry, the urban affluent, and various other politicallypowerful groups.One of the most intriguing aspects of the unequal drugsupply problems not yet touched on in this paper is howrural villagers themselves often help to maintain a situationso detrimental to their well being. Of relevance here are popular notions about the use and efficacy of Westernpharmaceuticals, but also the priority given to family loyaltyover correct 'behavior' in public office. Mapping the linkage of these cognitive and domestic factors - the 'lowest' levels of social organization - to the higher levelsdescribed in this paper presents a formidable challenge forfurther research. 157Technological and economic development in Cameroonhas had an ambiguous impact on people's access to health.It has made people more dependent on externally producedpharmaceuticals but, at the same time, it has restricted theaccess to these pharmaceuticals considerably for a largeproportion of the country's population. It has been my purpose to sketch a few lines and Linkages to point out thecomplexity of factors that impede equal access to pharma-ceuticals.A second purpose was to encourage a contextualapproach to the study of drug distribution in Third Worldcountries.Interdisciplinary research on the context ofpharmaceuticals should enlist the services of medical,pharmacological, political and economic scientists andanthropologists.Viewing pharmaceuticals in a broad context does notonly deepen our understanding of problems in drug supply,but also provides important clues for the improvement ofdrug distribution.The example of Cameroon suggests that'technical' reforms will not achieve positive results if thewider contexts to which pharmaceuticals are linked do notchange.Policies for improvement of the situation should beas 'connected' and 'contextual' as the problems are. 158ACKNOWLEDGEMENTSMy research was financed by the University ofAmsterdam and the Netherlands Foundation for the Advance-ment of Tropical Research (WOTRO). A research permit wasgranted by the Cameroon authorities (DGRST, Jean-Claude, Nicolas, A. Bloch, G. Dijkemaand H. Kossen.Earlier versions of this paper were presented and discussedat workshops in Amsterdam, Wassenaar and London. I wish to thank all who gave their critical comments. Ialso want to thank the Cameroon authorities for allowing me to carryout such sensitive research. The critical tone of this paper,I should emphasize, is meant as a sincere attempt to providesuggestions for the improvement of health care in thecountry. NOTES1.The term 'pharmaceuticals'in this paper refers to modern products.One might legitimately ask whethertraditional medicines should not be included in anydiscussion of the political implications of unequalaccess to pharmaceuticals in Cameroon. The WHO (1978) has advocated the integration of traditionalmedicine in primary health care, a suggestion whichhas been widely applauded (e.g. Bannerman et al. 1983).An occasional note of objection, however, has alsobeen sounded (e.g. Velimirovic 1984). On the other hand practical follow-up of this idea of integration hasbeen almost universally neglected. The popularity of the idea should probably be understood as a sign ofrespect for traditional non-Western medical cultures,whereas the lack of concrete action to apply the ideaseems an indication that Western-educated medical andpolitical elites within developing countries have little 1 '11 159confidence in these very same medical cultures. In Cameroon some strongly support the idea of coopera-tion between Western and indigenous medicine (e.g.Lantum 1979) and the country has an institute fortraditional plant medicine research. Yet, no practical results have yet led to changes in the country'snational health policy.Outside the formal system ofhealth care, however, people continue to use traditionalmedications, either because for the treatment ofparticular ailments these are preferred to modern ones, or because modern drugs are not available. More precise information on the use of indigenous medicines,compared with modern ones, however, is lacking. It seems likely that such use is declining and that-perhaps valuabletraditional medical knowledge isdisappearing.2.Research results have previously been publishedelsewhere. See, for e;zample, van der Geest 1981, 1982,1985, 1986 and n.d.3.To alleviate this geographical problem the governmentencourages local communities to set up 'propharmacies',small medicine shops near public health centers. Thesepropharmacies, which have a non-profit character, haveby and large proven to be a dubious means of drugdistribution (van der Geest 1983).4.The Cameroon government spends 12$ of its healthbudget on medicines (1980). Most developing countriesspend considerably more.Information on this issue iscontradictory, but for many countries WHO reportsfigures as high as 40-60$ of the health budget(Melrose 1982a:207).5.Elsewhere (van der Geest 1982) Ihave discussed this problem more elaborately.6.This phenomenon has been observed in almost allcountries of the Third World. To mention a few examples:Mexico (De Walt 1977; Logan 1983), El Salvador (Ferguson 1981), Jamaica (Mitchell 1983),Brazil (Group for Defense 1984), Ethiopia (Kloos 1974),Mauritius (Sussman 1981), Thailand (Weisberg 1982),and the Philippines (Hardon n.d. ).1 I rii4., 1607.The intertwining of formal and informal drug supply inCameroon is discussed extensively in van der Geest1985.8.The lack of incentives and rewards as a debilitatingfactor in the public health sector of Cameroon is alsomentioned in two unpublished World Bank reports(P.wantang 1981 and 1983). Similar views are expressedby Ugalde and Homedes (n.d.) with regard to publichealth care in the Dominican Republic.9.Itis impossible to mention them all, but among themost important are Gish & Feller 1979; Melrose 1982a;Muller 1982; and Silverman et al. 1982. Health Action International (HAI), a consumers' organization, haspublished a considerably amount of evidence againstthe pharmaceutical industry.10.The consumer movement is a common phenomenon inWestern industrialized countries but not in the ThirdWorld.Only recently have Western-based consumeraction groups started to extend their activities todeveloping countries.A prominent example is HealthAction International (HAI) which has been particularlyactive defending Third World consumers againstexpensive, useless and dangerous pharmaceuticals. Anawkward problem, however, is that very little is knownabout the needs and wishes of Third World consumersthemselves.Much socio-medical research remainsnecessary to ascertain \"the interests of Third Worldconsumers\".11.The adequacy of information on drug indications andcounter indications has been challenged as well (see,for example, Silverman et al. 198') .12.The case of Bangladesh iswell known.When the government of that country implemented a new drugpolicy stressing banning the sale of expensive, non-essential drugs, pharmaceutical firms exerted consider-able pressure to have the policy repealed Republic of Cameroon.Unpublished FieldReport for the World Bank.1983The Private Sector in the Provision ofHealth Services in the United Republic ofCameroon.

FOOD AND NUTRITION INFANT FEEDING PRACTICES IN MEXICO MARIA TERESA CERQUEIRALUCRECIA EducationMinistry of Public Health, Mexico INTRODUCTIONDuring the last fifty years there has been a significantdecline in the practice of breast feeding, a traditional component of infant care.Diverse types of infant formulasbased on cow's milk have saturated the market, and bottlefeeding is replacing breast feeding. Many controversial discussions have taken place around this complex pheno-menon. Unfortunately, much more has been said than done.The nutritional value of breast milk and the importanceof breast feeding for the overall growth and development ofinfants are widely recognized. The disadvantages of bottle1691 61 170feeding are. also well known. The great potential for contamination of water used in bottle feeding and theresulting gastrointestinal diseases have been documented inmany countries.The possibilities of over-dilution offormulas, and its effects on undernutrition and highermorbidity and mortality rates have been also illustrated inthe Third World.The high cost of bottle feeding to thefamily and to society is another dimension that has raisedserious concerns. Today, it is clearly understood that bottlefeeding constitutes a high-risk practice, and that breastfeeding should be promoted for the great majority ofwomen, perhaps for as many as 95%, and that it should besustained as long as possible,at least for the first six months of life.Yet, many physicians, particularly pediatri-cians, and also many nutritionists, are still not convinced.Itis no wonder that policy makers have not pressed forlarge scale public campaigns on breast feeding. In themeantime,itis useful to continue collecting informationabout the factors which contribute to the decline of breastfeeding and to analyz a the socio-economic conditions thatdetermine life styles a id daily feeding practices of infants.Previous research had identified the following factorscontributing to the decline of breast feeding: 1) theincrease in number of women entering the labor force whichhas produced important transformations in family structure,particularly life styles and eating patterns. 2) The influenceof pediatric and medical advice in recommending infantfeeding formulas, a; 3 its effect on the early suspension ofbreast feeding.Several authors have documented thatphysicians, and health personnel in general, erroneouslycontributed to the misconception that formulas were superiorto breast feeding.However, it is now well known that thereduction in infant mortality during the first half of thiscentury from 150 to less than 20 per thousand live births inindustrial nations, was due to a combination of factors suchas socio-economic improvements in living conditions, sanitation, housing, water supplies, medical care, thebeginning of the child welfare movement and the educationof mothers in better child care and feeding practices.Improvements inliving conditions coincided with greatersafety of milk and infant formulas which made possiblebottle feeding.The studies of Elizabeth and John Newson(Aykroyd 1977) illustrate this point: 1 171It is clear that the necessary precondition ofany large scale decline in breast feeding is theavailability and cheapness of suitable artificial orsubstitute foods, feeding bottles, and the meansof sterilization.With higher material standards ofliving including running water, efficient sanita-tion, modern stoves,it requires little effort totake the necessary hygienic precautions, and in amore affluent society the total cost of artificialfeeding is no longer an important consideration.These conditions are in stark contrast with those foundin the Third World.3) Several studies have also indicatedthat, urban life styles, with different concepts of comfortand modernization, have also contributed to the decline ofbreast feeding.4) The influence of mass media communica-tions and advertisement, have also been cited as an impor-tant factor in the decline of breast feeding and 5) thepublicity and promotional strategies of the infant formulacompanies have assumed the greater responsibility in theshift from breast feeding to the use of infant formula.Most authors coincide in referring to the great economicinterests behind the decline of breast feeding in favour ofthe bottle (Bader 1976; Berg 1973; Garreau 1977; GrupoTercer Mundo 1980).There is also much controversy in regard to weaningpractices.Pediatricians and many nutritionists haveadvocated early introduction of solid foods, followingconcepts developed in sophisticated medical centers. It is common, for example, to advise mothers to feed infants withdiluted fruit juices as early as two weeks after birth, tostart fruit and cereal purees at the second month, andvegetables, egg yolk, and pureed meats afterwards. This trend is particularly prevalent in urban middle and upperclass groups with access to pediatric care, either private orinstitutional (Wade 197F,).In contrast, in rural and poorurban areas, solid foods are introduced to the child's dietlater, at about the age of eight months. In the 1950s and 1960s many health professionals thought that undernutritionand high frequency of diarrhoea were due to a laterintroduction of solid foods.These views contributed to thedecline in breast feeding and to a lack of confidence in thetraditional feeding practices (Sanjur 1970; Chavez et al.1975; Plank 1973; WHO 1981). The baby food companies 1 ski 3 172have also built on the advantages of this situation, as wellas working mothers' needs for quick and easy infant foods,to increase their volume of sales which has me7:..nt morepublicity and further undermining of the pi estige and valueof traditional weaning foods and habits.In Mexico the traditional weaning foods consist of cornproducts such as atole (a corn beverage made of cornmealor tortilla meal), of broths and juice of different vegetables,of beans and of available meat products. Since these practices coincided with low weight for age of infants andfrequent episodes of diarrhoea, once again a superficialcause-effect relationship was constructed and much of themedical advice and nutrition educational efforts wereoriented to changing these traditional infant feedingpractices in favor of Western sophisticated patterns (Brown1977; Berg 1977; Jelliffe 1971).Half a century of public health activities based onpartially erroneous \"professional\" advice has left its influ-ence in changing food practices and child care. Even todaywhen these concepts have been seriously questioned and areconsidered damaging to the growth and survival of infants,the medical and nutrition programs at leading universitiesand higher education medical institutions still persist inteaching them to new health professionals (Mata 1984) . RECENT TRENDS IN BREAST FEEDING PRACTICESIN MEXICOSeveral studies have documented a decline in breastfeeding in Mexico during the last twenty to thirty years(see Figure 1).From 1960 to 1966 the percentage of womenwho breast fed their babies during the first six monthsdecreased from 95% to 73% (Berg 1977),. In the early seventies a study of women in Mexico City who receivedmedical care at the Mexican Institute of Social Security(IMSS) reported that only 38% had breast fed their lastinfant for at least the first four months of life (Avila 1978).A similar study revealed that in Guadalajara (the thirdlargest city in Mexico) only 36% of women who receivedmedical care at the IMSS had breast fed their infant for atleast three months (Magana 1981). The reasons cited for not breast feeding were similar for both groups studied,184 100 80 60 40 20173 FIGURE 1CONTEMPORARY PATTERNS OF BREAST FEEDING IN MEXICO* 0 196019651970197519801985YEAR OF PUBLICATIONRural Urban *Frequency of breast feeding as reported by the studies cited,including the results from the National Survey of Food Habits,1983. 1 ,\"0 L,) 174many were c!....e to the advise given to mothers at the IMSS.In the two cities, respondents indicated that the work ofthe mother outside the home was one of the most importantfactors for not breast feeding or for its short duration. Itshould be mentioned that working mothers whc are affiliatedwith the IMSS enjoy three months of maternity leave,although leave is usually taken several weeks before thedelivery, thus shortening the post-partum time for breastfeeding.Other reasons reported in these studies for the declineof breast feeding were:lack or insufficiency of milk, andrejection by the baby.The authors also indicated that 75%of women that did not breast feed at all mentioned thathealth personnel at the IMSS recommended and distributedformula for bottle feeding.This information coincided withthe data from the IMSS according to which 75% of motherswere using formula.Similarly, a majority of women, whohad stopped breast feeding before the third month of life oftheir newborn, reported that they were encouraged andgiven the formula.Only recently, the IMSS has reportedlydiscontinued recommending bottle feeding.During the past decade, a study of women in marginalurban areas in Mexico City revealed that 55% of them hadbreast\\ fed their last infant for at least six months (Vega1977).Mariscal (1977) in a different study also reportedthat 60% of mothers from low income urban areas hadbreast fed for a period of six months. It is important to indicate that most residents in marginal urban areas areimmigrants from rural communities, and still maintain manyrural customs and traditions. Studies of changing foodhabits of migrant populations, show how quickly urbanizationand acculturation erodes appropriate traditional practicesand how easily they are abandoned (Cerqueira 1978 and1984).The results of the national survey of family planningand use of contrac-ptives at the end of the 1970s and early1980s shows that 22% of the women interviewed had notbreast fed their last child. Of the 77% of those who reported initiating the practice of breast feeding, only 53%in the urban areas and 35% in metropolitan areas (speci-fically Mexico City, Monterrey and Guadalajara) had breastfed for at least six months (Garcia 1981). ) U 175THE NATIONAL SURVEY ON INFANT FEEDING PRACTICESConsidering that infant feeding practices, particularlybreast feeding and weaning, are fundamental for theadequate growth and development of children, a survey ofthese practices on a national scale was undertaken. One ofthe purposes of the study was to establish a base line tofurther develop a surveillance system of changes in foodhabits and patterns. A sample of 9,300 women with childrenunder three years of age was invited to participate, 62%were from marginal urban areas and 38% from rural con-n.1-nities.Excluding the participants from Mexico City, 52% ofthe sample was urban and 48% rural. The sample was drawntaking into consideration the proportion of rural to urbanpopulations at the state and national level established bythe 1980 National Population Census. Of the 9,300 question-naires 7,622 (85%) were processed and analyzed.The majority of the participants, both in rural andurban areas, were between 20 and 30 years of age (seeTable 1).Approximately 10% of the women studied wereless than 19 years old and about 20% were over 35. In other words, about 30% of the pregnancies could beconsidered high risk pregnancies.The educational levels of participants is presented inTable 2.The majority of the participants reported thatthey work exclusively in domestic chores. Nonetheless, it was interesting to note that more than 32% of the partici-pants indicated having a remunerated job outside the homeand over 28% reported that, besides the paying job, theywere also responsible for the care of their households (Table3).The entry of women into the labor force is a fact oftV.Is century, a permanent characteristic of modern society.This phenomenon implies profound changes in the organiza-tion of the family and in eating patterns. As has been indicated above, previous studies have reported that thework of women outside the home was one of the basicreasons for the decline cif breast feeding; however, based onthe information collected in this survey, there must be otherfactors more important.This survey showed that 68% ruraland 40% urban respondents did not have employment outsidethe home.Later we will show that only 16% rural and 25%urban mothers claimed that work outside the home was an 176 TABLE 1Age of Respondents (in percentages)Age in Years RuralUrban15 to 19 9 1220 to 24 25 3025 to 29 23 2530 to 34 18 1635 to 39 15 1040 and 9 7TOTAL (4,716) 1')(''J(.) 177 TABLE 2Formal Years of School Compleed RuralUrbanNone 16101 to 3 37254 to 6 28367 to 10 41011 and more 26TOTAL 100101 (n) (2,906)(4,716) 178 TABLE 3Occupation of Interviewees (in percentages) Type of Work RuralUrbanHousehold chores 68 40Outside work 5 32Both 27 28TOTAL 100 100 15u 179important cause in their decision for not breast feeding,and/or weaning their infants at an early age (see Table 6).Studies in several Latin American countries indicatethat women in the labor force tend to have fewer childrenand enjoy some fringe benefits such as maternity leave andtime for breast feeding at work. This is an area that' requires careful examination for, in reality, not all workingmothers enjoy maternity benefits. Such is the case, for example, for women working in domestic services and inmany other occupations not covered by social securitybenefits. RECENT TRENDS IN BREAST FEEDING PATTERNSApproximately70%of the mothers indicated having aninfant between seven and thirty six months of age and 30%reported their youngest child was less than six months old.It is interesting to note that at the time of the survey only27%of the rural and 19% of the urban mothers indicatedthey were actually breast feeding (Table 4).A retrospective analysis of the early feeding practicesshows that32%and20%of the participants, in urban andrural areas respectively, had not breast fed their last child,which meant that those children were exclusively bottle fedfrom birth (Table 5).Approximately35%and42%of the mothers interviewed in rural and urban areas, respectively,indicated having initiated breast feeding and suspended itbefore the third month of the infants' life, complementingand substituting breast milk with formula and bottle feeding.Thus, more than a third of the participants interviewedwere considered to have practiced a mixed form of lactation.These results indicate that only 25%of the urban and 46', of the rural children received the protection, nutritionalcontent and benefits of breast feeding for at least threemonths.Furthermore, only 8% in urban areas and 22%inrural communities were breast fed for more than six months.By current nutritional standards this means that only one ofevery two rural children and one out of every four urbaninfants had adequate food and nutrition care and anoptimum mother-child relationship during the first months oflife.1 I 180 Table 4Age of Youngest Child of Whom Infant FeedingPractices are Described (in percentages) Age in Months RuralUrban0 to 3 7 94 to 6 22 257 to 12 22 2613 to 23 31 2824 17 12TOTAL (4,716) of Lactation(date of weaning)Exclusive breast feedingRuralUrbanTotal (3 to 6 months) 241721Exclusive breast feeding(7 22811Mixed lactation* 354238Exclusive 203230TOTAL 10199100 *Both bottle and breast feeding i.:om b to 3 months 182The mean age of weaning for the urban group was reported at 14.7 months (median 3.2);for the rural mothers it was at 7.6 months (median 6.2).Asshown in Table 6the main reasons given by the participants for abandoning breast feedinri were:lack of sufficient milk (19%), illness of themother (MU, rejection by the child (10%), medical advice (114%), work outside the home (22%),and lack of knowledge and confidence (21%).It can be seen that a significantnumber of mother gave work outside the home as the reason for abandoning breast feeding; however, it should also benoticed that only 143% of mothers whn reported having a ,, b outside the house did not breast feed. It may be possible that the decisive factor for failing to breast feed or for its termination was not the job itself but the tension andresponsibility of the double work load (one outside and one at home).It could also be argued that those mothers whoused the maternity leave before the delivery, found them-selves without leave time after the delivery for breastfeeding.Another factor that requires a careful analysis isthe conditions surrounding breast feeding at work. Some respondents indicated that some institutions had a policy of authorizing work breaks for mothers to breast feed but thatthere were no facilities near the work place to keep thebabies.In large cities such as Mexico City thlose conditionsmake impossible breast feeding as mothers cannot go back to the house to nourish their infants.Itisof interest to examine more closely those 57%respondents who were able to work and breast feed formore than three months.Their experience could be usefulto the others.On the other hand, those 22%who did riot have jobs outside the household and failed to breast feedtheir last child could very likely benefit from healtheducation programs.About25%of the rural and 20% of the urban mothersreported different causes for not breast feeding 3nd/or for having suspended lactation before the infant's third monthof life.The multiple reasons were grouped in: the category\"lack of confidence and knowledge\" (see Table 7). Con- sideing the larger number of participants in this category it will be very beneficial to study these attitudes and developeducational messages to help these mothers to positivelychange them. 183 TABLE 6Principal Reasons for the Abandonment ofBreast Feeding (in percentages) Reasons Indicated RuralUrbanTotalLack of milk 191919Mother's illness 171214Work outside the home 162522Rejection by infant 101110Medical advice 141414Lack of knowledge andconfidence 251921 TOTAL 101100100 184 TABLE 7List of the Most Frequent Responses in theCategory \"Lack of Knowledge and Confidence\"about Breast Feeding(ranked by frequency of responses) 1.My milk was not good2.The baby was still hungry or was not satisfied3.Ididn't have enough milk4.I didn't have any more milk5.Ididn't have any more milk because of a problemthat caused grief, sorrow or anger6.My breast hurt and bothered me7.I was afraid that my breasts would be ugly8.The baby cried and I thought he was still hungry9.I was pregnant with another child10.The baby got diarrhoea11.My breasts would get deformed12.I was given formula to bottle feed the baby13.My husband didn't want me to breast feed14.The bottle was easier for me to take out15.My husband didn't want me to be seen breastfeeding 185The participants who bottle fed their infants frombirth and those who stopped breast feeding before the thirdmonth used different types of formulas based on cow'swhole milk (powdered, evaporated or fresh) and formula.Table 8 shows mothers who used formula and the types ofmilk used by rural and urban groups. The frequent use ofwhole milk in the first months of life of the infant is ofgrave concern because recent studies have revealed thatcow's milk and formula are a poor source of essential fattyacids, particularly linolenic, which is an indispensableelement in the early sages of development. As has been mentioned earlier, in today's economic conditions, most lowincome mothers cannot afford to purchase the necessaryamount of milk or formula for the adequate growth anddevelopment of infants.Additionally, in Mexico, like inmany other Third World countries, the availability of cleanwater and the possibility of sterilization of the bottles isproblematic.The inability to read, interpret and follow theinstructions on the package label also raise questions aboutthe appropriateness of bottle feeding. In conclusion, it is most likely that a large percentage of Mexican children arefed over - diluted formulas mixed with non-potable water indirty bottles.In view of these realities, if the shift frombreast to bottle feeding continues at the present rate, itcan be predicted an increase in the numoer of undernou-rished children with diarrhoea or higher rates of morbidityand possibly mortality and, certainly, higher medical carecosts (Cunningham 1977; Larson 1978). WEANING PRACTICESFor purposes of this study we have classified weaningfoods in three categories:adequate, permitted and inade- quate.Adequate foods are those considered nutritional forinfant feeding.They are basically natural foods thatcomplement and enrich the infa.it's diet with a minimum ofprocessing and little,if any, artificial flavoring. Among adequate foods we include cereals such as cornmeal, rice,noodles in soups and stews, bread, tortilla, atole, and beansin soup and puree, different vegetables, fruits, juices, meats,eggs, fish, milk and cheese.Permitted foods are those that provide basic energybut due to a lack of variety, poor combination, or high 186 TABLE 8Types of Bottle Foods Used by Interviewees(in percentages) Type of Bottle Foods RuralUrbanFormulas 3852Whole powdered milk 3218Whole fresh milk 2321Evaporated milk 57Condensed milk 32 TOTAL 101100 Feu 187costs in relation to its nutritional value are considered lessdesirable for a good diet.In this category are includecfoods which are reported as the only food item in theinfant's diet.Here we include refined cereals, starchyfoods, canned fruit juices and beverages, commercial babyfoods, broths and the liquid from preparing vegetables,sweets and candies.Inadequate foods are those which maybe damaging the infant's health and those which are used inplace of more nourishing products. In the list we includesweets, candy, refined products, soft drinks, carbonated andalcoholic beverages, broth alone, tea, coffee, the use exclusively of commercial baby foods and those productscommonly classified as \"junk foods.\"In the urban areas about 21% of the interviewees and5% in the rural communities began the use of solid foods atwhat is considered to i3e an early age, or before the thirdmonth of life.At the opposite end, 50$ of the respondentsin urban areas and 64 in rural communities introducedfoods at a late age or after the child's eight month. Thus,only 30 and 33% of respondents in urban and rural areasrespectively indicated the introduction of solid foods at theproper time.Tables 9 and 10 present the age at weaning bythe adequacy of the foods used in rural and urban areasrespectively.The introduction of adequate foods at the proper timeis an important aspect of child nutrition. If foods are introduced too early, the possibilities of contamination andthe susceptibility of infection increases (diarrhoea is common episode that might follow). Early introduction ..0 solid foods has been associated with obesity later in life. On the other hand, if the introduction of solid foods is toolate, breast feeding may be insufficient to maintain adequatenutrition, growth and development. The results of the survey show that only 23$ of the participants in urbanareas and 21$ in rural communities introduced adequate andpermitted foods between the fourth and the eighth month ofage.The participants inter,,iewed reported that the veryfirst food that the infant tasted, besides milk (mother's orformula) were almost exclusively cereals: tortillas, noodles, different preparations of cornmeal, and bread to be followed 1 :...1E, Adequateness of Food and Age of Introductionto the Child's Diet:Rural Interviewees (in percentages) Age of Introduction Age of Introductionto the Child's Diet: Urban Participants (in percentage).

Thus, in order of importance andpreference, mothers selected high energy foods (see Figure2).That a large number of mothers weaned their infantswith broths, liquids from boiled vegetables, beans and meatssuggests that urban mothers still have strong rural hJbitsand fear the introduction of solid foods which can beexplained by the fact that many of the inhabitants of poorneighborhoods in the cities are rural migrants. It should be of concern to nutrition policy makers that so many mothersspend their meager resources buying commercial baby foodswhich most likely are insufficient to provide an adequatediet for the child.juices, soft drinks and candies were alsohigh on the list.All these foods are easy to prepare but!ack the organoleptic and sensory qualifies so important inthe early state of development. THE POLITICAL ECONOMY OF BOTTLE FEEDINGFinally, the most important factor because of itsinfluence both on the criteria of health professionals andmedical institutions' policies, as well as for the changingcultural and psychological attitudes of mothers towardsbreast feeding, were the promotional and advertisingactivities developed by the multinational formula corpora-tions ir. Latin America (Grupo Tercer Mundo 1980).Although in Mexico straightforward advertising offormulas is not permitted in the mass media, marketing andpromotional campaigns through health personnel and medicalinstitutions are a widespread practice. Television commer- cials advertising bottles and other baby equipment arefrequently aired.At the same time,international and institutional feeding programs have distributed largequantities of powdered milk and formula for bottle feedingof infants.ironically, they have done so in an attempt toalleviate the problem of undernutrition, especially infantmalnutrition.The widespread and aggressive advertising and salespromotion strategies used by multinational corporationsthrough health professions and institutions in Latin Americaas well as directly with their \"target populations\" have been FIGURE 2THE FIRST FOODS INFANT'S DIETTortilla:i::'i*E6ANoodles::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::=='; * ii050010(0150020002500 192well documented and in this regard, Mexico is no exception (Butz 1977; Berg 1977; Grupo Tercer Mundo 1980). The business dimension of infant formula is also of interest.In the decade of the seventies, there were four corporations in the formula market in Mexico. Liconsa, a public, nationally owned company, had only 8% of the sale in 1979. The other three companies were of private, foreign ownership (Nestle59%, Wyeth Vales 20% and Mead Johnson 13%). Nestle reported 97% of the sales of powdered milk and Liconsa 3%; of the evaporated milk Liconsa 28% (SINE -SAM 1980).Sales of baby milks and formula showed a 5% increase in utilities over sales operations with a net profit above investments of 24 points from 1975 to 1979. Between 1976 and 1977 there was an increase in volume of operations of powdered milk of 22%and for 1978 the increase was 28%.The increases for formula were 16% for 1977 and 19% for 1978.In 1980 a can of powdered whole milk cost about one third of the official minimum daily wage and a can of formula was equivalent of 40% of the official minimum dailywage.Thus, to provide bottle feeding for the infant,including utensils, fuel, etc., a family had to spent approxi- mately 40 to 50% of their salary.The estimated economic loss for the so-called \"develop-ing countries\" caused by the decline in breast feeding was calculated in close to the billions of dollars (Berg 1973).Considering that 30% of the participants in the present survey did not breast feed and that about 2 million childrenare born in Mexico each year, it can be concluded that Mexico spends approximately 60 million US dollars to bottle feed these 30% of the children for the first four months of life (the methodology used is described in FAO 1979).Furthermore, based on the results of this survey another 30% of the mothers interviewed did not breast feed more than six months.This figure adds 220 million US dollars tothe bottle feeding tag for children during the first year of life.The advertising business has also had its share of theresponsibility in the decline of breast feeding. As was mentioned, formulas are not permitted to be advertised on2u/i 193the radio or television; however, whole powdered milk,cereals, baby bottles and other utensils are freely publicizedin the media.According to a report on modern multina-tional advertising corporations, eight of the ten largest andmost important puulicity agencies, mainly of U.S. ownership,have operations in Mexico.The annual rate of growth ofoperations increased by 8$ i in the U.S.A. and 10%, in foreigncountries.In contrast, their investrwints .:ere 63 thousandmillion dollars in foreign countries and 62 in the UnitedStates.The report also states that between 30 and 51$ ofthe profits were generated in Latin America (UN 1979).According to the UN report (19751 3s the advertising businesses grow so do the privately owned media corpora-tions and together they control the content of news,information and also the programs that the general publiccan \"choose\" to view.Commercials have a persuasiveintention.Their impact has been to create life styles thatshape consumer decisions and preferences, but also to createsuperfici. I needs and conveniences including baby foods. CONCLUS CONSMexico reports high infant mortality rates due todiarrheal disease and although the rate decreased form 1970to 1979, the total number of lives lost represent over 40,000children per year that died from diarrhea (PAHO 1982). Thedirect relationship Letween the decline in breast feeding,the increase in bottle feeding and diarrhea in infancy hasbeen well established. Thus, it can be said that the declinein breast feeding, together with lack of sanitation, cleanwater and an adequate nutrition are the contributing factorsin the death of over 50,000 children each year in Mexico.A second feature identified as responsible for thedecline in breast feeding has been the changes in life stylesdue to a massive urbanization and modernization, parti-cularly related to women working outside the home and tothe influence of the media, radio, television and the press.Although the abandonment of breast feeding was primarilyconsidered an urban phenomenon, recent studies includingthe results of this survey, shc,..., that in rural cor nunitiesthere is also a significant decline in breast feeding. One ofthe culprits charged in relation to women entering the labor21.6 194force, was not so much because mothers worked as thatbottle feeding was viewed as one of the sophistications ofcity and modern life, especially associated with middle andupper class groups. Studies with groups of rural immigrantsto the cities show how readily the bottle feedilig trend hasbeen adopted and also how rural mothers have also beeninfluenced by this acculturation. Often breast feeding was considered old fashioned, a backward and vulgar practiceidentified with the poor and \"less educated\" rural popula-tions.Anthropologists have used the duration of breastfeeding as an inverse measure of acculturation particularlyin studies with rural and ethnic groups in Mexico and otherLatin American countries.It seems that bottle feeding wasma n uf act u red \" into a symbol of progress and wealth. In fact the salesmanship of bottle feeding has even been ableto convince mothers that it is \"easier\" and \"healthier\" thanbreast feeding.Of course, for this fact, they had the helpof many health professionals.Fah -e of lactation has been reported as a response tothe stress of modernization.The results of this surveyshow that an important percentage of the participantsreported (20$) a failure to initiate and or continue to breastfeed.It seems that the tension of a complex urbanenvironment affects mother& capacities to produce milk andbreast feed.Changing social attitudes regarding physical bodycontact -nd the \"revealing of breast\" also seemed toinfluerce the decision not to breast feed. Thus manyparticipants considered that breast feeding would damage theappearance of their breast.It is interesting to note that much time, effort and resources are invested in massages,exercises and other body treatments to beautify the breast-line as a sexual symbol, yet, it has not occurred to womenthat breast feeding is also a form of exercise, free ofcharge.It waL- particularly interesting to note that husbandswere reluctant for their wives to be seen breast feeding.Nursing in public, a common sight a decade ago, is rapidlydisappearing as a superficial sense of modesty increases.The \"modern, well-to-do white man's wife does not breast feed in public\" seems to be the unspoken message inimported television programs, movies and commercials.\"Blond, blue-eyed babies come from a bottle with formula\"could also be one of the unspoken messages. Perhaps a study of the semiology of social codes in relation to thiscould shed some light on the decline of breast feeding.A mistaken sense of convenience was also a factorreported by some of the participants interviewed. It wouldseem that the working mothers would be the most in needof fast-easy methods to feed the family. In this survey the percentage of working mothers was relatively small,nonetheless, it would seem obvious that breast feeding hadgreater advantages in terms of convenience as studies showthat bottle feeding takes at least three times more time andeffort than breast feeding (FAO 1979).In conclusion, a number of factors that have influencedbreast feeding practices in Mexico have been identified. Itisclear that several of these factors can be addressedthrough appropriate health education programs directed notonly to the mother but to the general population. Amother's attitudes toward breast feeding are not formedindependently but reflect those of her significant others andgeneral societal values.The survey results demonstrateclearly that complex intertwining of factors that are tied tothe process of modernization and development and its effecton the nutritional health of Mexico's infants.

The Pen American Health Organization noticed the emphasis onthese areas and wrote in a policy statement \"...nutritionspecialists have concentrated all their efforts almostexclusively in learning the physiological, biochemical, andbehavioral mechanisms related to malnutrition\" (OPS 1976:3). In contrast, the study of the socio-political causes ofmalnutrition has been given less attention, even if for sometime it has been acknowledged, and today is well accepted,that protein-caloric malnutrition is basically a problem ofpoverty.In1979the Institute of Nutrition for CentralAmerica and Panama (INCAP) celebrated the thirtiethanniversary of its foundation and issued a catalogue of itsscientific publications:the impressive list contains 2,11514 201 2 t 2 202titles, but the reader can search in vain for materialsregarding the political economy of malnutrition in CentralAmerica ( INCAP 1079).The politics of agricultural modernization and foodproduction began to receive attention in the seventies whenthe failures of land reform implementation became obvious(Sinha 1977; Hopkins et al. 1979; Rama 1979; Burbach and Flynn 1980; Montaiiezet al. 1983 and many more). However, the works of Lappeand Collins (1977) and George (1977) linked for the firsttime,in a systematic fashion, the growing literaturereporting the damaging results of agricultural modernizationfor the poor in the Third World and malnutrition. These authors also raised the issue of the impact of internationalagricultural trade on malnutrition. More recently, threebooks (Super and Wright 1985; Browne and Hadwiger 1986;Biswas and Pinstrup-Andersen 1985) include articles in whichthe relations between agricultural exports and malnutritionin the Third World are discussed.Traditionally, it has been assumed that the nutritionalstatus of a population is related to 1) the purchasing powerof individuals or families, 2) the availability of nutrients, 3)the cultural eating habits, and 4) the health and educationallevels of the population.It should be clarified that theconcept of availability in the way it is being used in thispaper implies more than the physical existence of nutrients,it means that the available nutrients are financially afford-able to the population.For example, in Cali (Colombia) formany years, because many poor people could not afford topay the price that producers alleged to be financiallyrequired, fresh milk was routinely dumped into the sewer-ages.Development economists have been particularlyconcerned with items 1) and 2), and have looked at theinfluences of price and income elasticity of demand onnutrition.Increasing productivity through modernization ofagriculture and a shift from subsistence crops to agriculturalcommodities has been considered by economists and aaricul-tural experts as the most expedite way to increase simul-taneously the availability of nutrients and the purchasingpower.In the words of Pinstrup-Andersen (1985:43), thecornrnerciatization of agriculture is \"a cornerstone of successful economic development in most developingcountries.\"!t was thought without much additional conside-213 203ration that reduction in protein-caloric malnutrition wouldfollow.The paradigm by Goldman and Overholt (1981) pre-sented in Figure 1synthesizes well this approach toagricultural development and modernization. According to the figure, technological agricultural development (TAD)affects positively farm and non-farm employment and incomethrough increased marketed supplies and increased output.At the same time, TAD increases domestic agricultural andfood supplies, and produces surpluses for exports. Followingthe principles of comparative advantages, foreign exchangeearned from exports can be traded for food imports, apolicy that has been fostered by the World Bank and otherinternational agencies from the industrial nations. Thus, domestic food supplies would increase further and priceswould decline (Pinstrup-Andersen 1985:44) . Lowerprices and higher incomes would affect positively food consumption,and a reduction of caloric-protein malnutrition would follow.While the logic of the model seems impressive, thereare sufficient case studies which question most of itspremises and raise serious questions about its validity formany regions of the world. With the information availableit is possible to build a tentative contrasting paradigm (seeFigure 2).It has been well documented that TAD has been appliedselectively, favoring large agricultural exploitations of cashcrops which very frequently are for exports ( Caliendo 1979;Posas 1979).In Latin America, for example, output ofexport crops has increased at times at the expense of thebest a'-able land, which previously had been dedicated totraditional food crops (Barraclough 1977). It has also decreased food consumption among farm families whoformerly utilized their production for themselves. The reduction of domestic supplies of traditional food cropsmight well have increased the prices of these foods andreduced their consumption among rural laborers and urbanpoor. That modernization of agri ulture could have negativeeffects on nutrition has been documented in Valle de Caucaby Taussig (1978).Also in Colombia, Sanders (1981:88)confirmed that the impact of agricultural modernization onnutrition is negligible.A 1979 report prepared by the U.S.Government Accounting Office (GAO 1979:1) outlined some ,I2.14 FIGURE 1EMPLOYMNT, INCOME, PRICE, AND CONSUMPTION EFFECTSOF AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION TECHNOLOGI CONSUMPTIONEFFECTS I MCCCLASTICITIESOF l'fwAmD404.1.(PoCtyPRICE EMPLOYMENT CrrEcit 8 INCOME - - - - - - --I 1Rooucr lowIr- -- - - EMPLOYMENT, INCOME, PRICE, ANDCONSUMPTION EFFECTS OF TECHNOLOGICAL AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT (TAD) CGmsumption E Price Effects Upper and MiddleClasses + Rural NageEarners ?

The rural poor may also be disadvantagedby a pattern of agricultural production forexports which displaces crops that had been usedfor local consumption.In this situation, the poormay be forced to participate in a centrally- controlled food marketing and processing systemwhich is likely to increase the cost of a staple diet... Therefore, the situation of the rural poorin many developing countries is one in which theysubsidize the diet of the more affluent, nationallyand internationally...In their research of export-oriented modern agri-businesses in Mexico, Rama and Vigorito (1979:243) foundabrupt reductions in many of the basic crops of importancefor the popular diet such as corn and wheat in all thestates covered by their study (Guanajuato, Michoacan,Queretaro, Sinaloa, Veracruz and Oaxaca). The declines coincided with the introduction of fruits and vegetables forexport by agribusinesses.For example, in Michoacan in1960 there were 92,000 hectares of wheat under cultivation,by 1975 wheat acreage had been reduces', to 27,000, beancultivation went from 54,000 hectares to 31,000, and corn, the main crop of the state, was reduced from 420,000hectares in 1965 to 338,000 ten years later. In the case of Mexico, it can be affirmed that food experts have caused a decline in the principal traditional crops ;Castillo andBarajas 1986:161).In sum, there is evidence to suggesi thatin some regions TAD has reduced the supply of traditionalcrops.This has produced a price increase with a negative impact on consumption of these crops.The employment and income effects of TAD do notseem to be as favorable as Figure 1 suggests. The alterna-tive model represents what has been documented in many studies:that the growth of large agribusiness is rapidlytransforming the agricultural labor force from self-employedpeasants to wage earners, or to say if differently, from217 207small landowners (frequently minifundistas) to proletarians(Burbach and Flynn ch. 7 and the references cited there;Barraclough 1974).The impact of this shift on nutritioncould be negative, for, according to Norse (1985:25), \"thelink between access to land and undernutrition is wellestablished \"Additionally, the rural labor force transformation hasproduced higher rates of rural unemployment:underemploy-ment or the impoverishment of 1977).Cardona (197E) has documented for Guatemala the relationbetween the exploitation of large landholdings for exportsand rural unemployment and large seasonal rural migrations.In Central America Winson (1978) noted that export-orientedagriculture produced the demise of the aparceros fromlivestock haciendas, drastic reductions of permanent-wageagricultural laborers in favor of temporary workers, andincreased the number of landless peasants. Frequently, agribusinesses moved by potential profits from export cropshave expanded their holdings by purchasing, at timesviolently (Zapata 1981), small holdings or by terminatingsharecropping arrangements and forcing tenants intounemployment/underemployment or wage labor. McCann(1976),a top executive of the United Fruit Company,explained in his candid account of his twenty-five yearswith the company, that in Central America United Fruitpurchased lands from poor peasants even when the companywas not considering incorporating the new land intoproduction.This policy was used to guarantee laborsupplies and to reduce the potential competition by futurecooperatives.In the meantime, production of subsistencecrops was reduced.It is correct to assume, as does Figure 1, that TADcreates non-farm employment in input services, marketingand servicls.We have not been able to find studies whichquantify the number of new jobs, but the case studies wehave cited suggest that in many countries the employmentbalance between displacement of peasants and new jobscreated by agricultural modernization is negative. In sum, in many countries modernization of agriculture is concent-rating wealth inless hands, thisis to say,stratifying societies which were already highly stratified.1 208Some new agricultural wage earners may receive higherincomes in their new jobs than what they were obtainingfrom their subsistence farming. However, this advantage may be counteracted by the higher prices of marketed foodproducts which are introduced in rural areas with the shiftfront traditional crops and subsistence farming to moderni-zation of cash crops for exports. Additionally, many new food products are imported, and despite the theory ofcomparative advantages--a point to which we will returnlater--by the time they reach the countryside, their pricesare, higher than traditional foods.The principle of comparative advantage that promotesagricultural exports--as logical as it, sounds--has also beenquestioned by some authors (Lappe and Collins 1977 partVII; Barkin and Suarez 1985). Leaving aside the very basicissue of political dependency that large food imports ofbasic staples implies for the importing countries, theargument has been made that all the foreign exchange earned by agricultural exports does not return to thecountry in basic foods.Instead, luxury items, industrialgoods and energy which might benefit only some segment ofthe population (many rural areas of the Third World do nothave electricity), processed foods, and agricultural inputs tobe used for the production of more export crops, are amongthe list of products which, with basic foods, are imported.Quite frequently, in the case of foreign agribusiness andlarge cash crop plantations owned by nationals, the foreignexchange earned by agricultural exploitations remainsoverseas and never , eturns to the country. Potential profitsfrom comparative advantage may be also lost by theoligopolistic nature of international trade of the mostimportant crops.International agricultural trade is characterized byanother negative trait.Seldom are exports from ThirdWorld countries essential for the industrial nations, whilefood imports by the Third World tend to be so, particularlyafter the cultivation of traditional food crops decreasesbecause of export crops.This means potential disruptionsof their Third World agricultural economies with changes inconsumers' preferences in industrial nations. It also implies that price increases will generally reduce demand becausethe exported food is not essential to advanced nations. As is well known, even the exportation of some non-food2 i b 209products for industrial use is potentially disruptive to ThirdWorld agricultural economies: some of these products areproduced by perennials (rubber tree, African palm; andsynthetic products could be introduced suddenly as substi-tutes.Furthermore, given the little political power ofpeasants in most countries of the Third World, trade profitsdo not trickle down to the laborers. What all this means is a progressive worsening of the terms of trade. For theThird World poor the comparative advantages of interna-tional trade may mean higher food prices . **hout increasesin income.In contrast, for the advanced ,...' :_-:ns it means acheap source of agricultural labor.Perhaps, mora important than the above observations,is the questioning of the principle itself of comparativeadvantages.If we take the example of sugar, one of themajor agricultural export crops for many Caribbean andLatin American countries,it will be difficult to prove thatthese countries have an advantage over the U.S. in itsproduction.Sugar (from cane, from sugar beets, andrecently from corn) can be produced as efficiently in theU.S. as in many of the countries from which the U.S.imports it.For many years sugar beet growers were paidby the U.S. government to keep their lands idle. Thereasons behind the U.S. importation of sugar from the ThirdWorld are political and not economic. The beneficiaries of the sugar trade are not the consumers nor the farmers inthe U.S. and even less the peasants of the Third World, but,most likely,a handful of U.S. import companies and thenational elites of the sugar producing developing countries.The U.S. government is also interested in preserving sugarimport quotas from Third World countries to maintain theirpolitical dependence.Undoubtedly, the econor'es and thegovernments of several countries would collapse at themoment the U.S. discontinues sugar imports from thesecountries.Another violation of economic principles, whichmakes us suspicious of the principle of comparative advant-ages, is the fact that sugar prices do not respond to factorsof production, but to assessments by the import companiesof how much U.S. consumers are willing to pay. In theearly 1970s, executives of sugar import companies wereprosecuted and found guilty of violating antitrust laws bycolluding in price fixing.In conclusion, there is someevidence to suggest that for some agricultural products andfor some countries, the principle of comparative advantage 2 2 0 210may not be grounded in economic theory, and that itsapplication could respond to political interests of industrialnations and to economic benefits obtained by agribusiness,Third World elites and importers. That this principle may not even be applicable to international trade among socialistnations can perhaps be inferred from the study of Cuba byBenjamin et al. (19814).Modernization of agriculture affects negativelymalnutritionin other indirect ways that we can onlymention in this paper.Itis well known that modern agriculture is based on heavy usage of chemicals and water.Field reports have documented the frequent episodes ofacute illness produced by these chemicals among the workersand their families.Given the synergetic relationshipbetween health and nutrition, one would expect nutritionallosses due to the illnesses produced by the use of chemicals. The chronic illnesses that are produced by the exposure to these cher.:icaIs throughout the years and by the drinking ofchemically contaminated water in cities and in the country-side is a problem whose magnitude we will know only in the future.It has been reported in the literature that in some regions the use of large amounts of water by agribusinesseshas depleted aquifers upon which small peasants dependedfor their crops. THE CASE OF CENTRAL AMERICASeveral studies have pointed out the severity ofmalnutrition in Central America (May and McLelland 1972;Teller and Bent 1978; Sandoval 1978). INCAP (1976:2) reported that in the region there was a \"permanent lowintake of food among large population groups (that could beas high as 50$ of the total population of the countries inCentral America) a situation that can be characterized asglobal malnutrition.\" There are some signs--the evidence isnot totally conclusive--that the conditions of malnutritionare not being resolved and that in some countries in CentralAmerica, protein-caloric malnutrition may be getting worse.In Honduras the comparison of two nutrition surveystaken in 1965 and 1975 suggests that malnutrition wasincreasing.According to the first survey, 764% of childrenunder five years of age had a weight/age inadequacy, the221 211percentage increased to 85 in 1975 (CONSUPLANE, 1976:29-32).A 1976 health sector assessment by the Agency forInternational Development in Nicaragua (AID 1976:185)reported that \"in recent studies carried out in Region 1( Leon-Chinandega and Region 7, Puerto Cabezas), the resultshave demonstrated an increase in the level of severemalnutrition (grade 3) to be as high as 4.4 of the samplepopulation.Thus, there is some indication that the nutri-'tional status of the population has worsened rather thanimproved since 1966.\"In El Salvador, comparisons between1965 and 1976 anthropometric measures are inconclusiveabout improvements in the nutritional status of the popula-tion.While there was an improvement in the height by ageof the children surveyed there was a deterioration in theweight for height measurement (AID 1978:149ff) .According to the summary of the report: \"The principal nutritionalproblem in the country is the lack of calories with at least20% of the entire population suffering marginal to severedeficiencies of calories and protein\" (Ibid.:152). In Guate- mala, there was no protein intake improvement between 1965and 1975, and the caloric intake worsened substantially, in1965 14$ of the population had less than 75% of thenecessary caloric intake, the number went up to 37% by1975 (AID 1977, Anex 5, Tables 2 and 3). In Panama, nutritional improvements might have been very minimal.Infant mortality is considered a reliable indirect measure-ment of the nutritional status of a population and forPanama the available information suggests that there was avery small reduction of infant mortality between 1962 and1970,it went down from 44 to 41/000, but post-neonatalinfant mortality remained unchanged at 19/000 (Panama,Ministerio 1976:43 45). Other indications thatnutrition improvements--if any--were minimal, can beinferred by the fact that between 1970 and 1973 theavailability of per capita calories and proteins went downfrom 3000 to 2422 kcals. and from 65.8 to 60.2 gms. respec-tively (Sandoval 1978:209). Furthermore, for some food items, the purchasing power of workers declined (see Table1).In Veragua, admittedly one of the poorest in thecountry, the 1975 levels of malnutrition were higher thanthe 1967 national average.A traditional explanat Dn for the lack of improvementin the nutritional status of a country is the worsening ofthe per capita food and agricultural production, this is in 212 TABLE 1A LABORER'S PURCHASING POWERBASED ON MINIMUM SALARYCITY Time Requiredto Purchase Food(minutes) Nov.1971 kinds) 1 lb. 23Bread 1 lb. 23 a.Standingsalaryforthelowestactivity for the City of Panama 1971 b.Standingsalaryforthelowestactivity for the City of Panama 1975 Source-Sandoval (1978:215) 24:3April1975 76 33 35 37 23 46 36 classified job= US$0.50/hours. classifiedjob= US$0.55/hour. 213 TABLE 2 PREVALENCE OF MALNUTRITION IN CHILDRFNLESS THAN 5 YEARS OLD IN PANAMA(Data derived from two studies) Level ofMalnutritionFirst 1975.

Rural stagnation and the population explosion--the argument explains--has an impact on per capita food supplies, prices go up and, as a result ofprice elasticities of demand, consumption decreases andmalnutrition increases.As we have discussed earlier, thesolution advanced is modernization of agricultural andinternational trade.Central America economies modernized and increasedinternational trade.Table 3 shows that between 1960-65and 19714-77 per capita agricultural and food productionincreased in all countries of the region with the exceptionof Honduras whose food and agricultural trade of balancewas also negative (see Table 4) .Why, then, if there was an increase in per capita food production and large agriculturaltrade, were there no improvements in the nutritional statusof the population, and in some countries there were obvious deteriorations?Perhaps the answer is that the paradigmpresented in Figure 2 is closer to the political and economicrealities than the one proposed in Figure 1. In effect, we have already mentioned studies which suggest the impove-rishment of the countryside in the region during the same period (Winson 1978).Table 5 also suggests that the shiftfrom traditional agriculture to exports was impactingnegatively the consumption of beef. A possible explanation for beef consumption decreases might be that Aodernizationof the cattle industry was not increasing production forlocal consumption but for exports where they could obtainhigher profits.Additionally, it is possible that moderniza-tion increased cost of production and placed out of the beefmarket low income groups.Since it is unlikely to assumethat the middle and upper classes in Central Americareduced their consumption of beef (most likely theyincreased it) we need to conclude that the poor were theones deprived of this important source of animal protein.This analysis can possibly be extended. to other products.That the principle of comparative advantages did not workin Central America is the logical conclusion to be derivedfrom the worsening of the nutritional status of thepopulation. 216 TABLE 4BALANCE OF TRADE IN FOOD AND AGRTCULTURAL PRODUCTSCENTRAL AMERICA 1972-1976 IN MILLION OF DOLLARS Costa Rica 1,236El Salvador 1,602Guatemala 8 Honduras -145Nicaragua 207 Book,1976: INCENTRAL AMERICAProductionProductionPer CapitaConsumptionThousands Tons Change %Consumption kg.

If left to take its own course, economic development is a process of circular and cumulative causation whichtends to award its favors to those who are already well endowed and even to thwart theefforts of those who happen to live in regllnsthat are lagging behind.Itis not surprising that industrial nations havepromoted international trade through their internationalbanking and assistance agencies, and that their economistshave perhaps twisted economic theory to produce principlesof doubtful validity such as that of economic advantages. If we apply Myrdal's insightful observation to nutrition wecould conclude by formulating the following hypothesis:international food and agricultural trade tends to award itfavors to those who are already well fed in the developedand underdeveloped countries and further increases themalnutrition of the Third World underfed. The testing of the hypothesis requires a quantitative study of the nutri-tional trade balance:the protein and caloric value of foodand non-food exports from the Third World should be measured. The potential nutritional value of non-foods suchas coffee, cotton, sisal, tobacco, etc. can be measured bycalculating the edible nutritional value of crops which could be produced in those lands dedicated to growing non-foodcrops.To obtain the nutritional balance of internationaltrade, the protein and caloric value of imported food alsoneeds to be measured.Likewise, the nutrition potential(additional calories and proteins) to be obtained throughimports destined for the increase agricultural outputs ofdomestic (not export) crops (such as fertilizers) should beincluded in the calculation(in other words, a ton of fertilizer has a nutritional value which is equivalent to the Barraclough, S.Barkin, D. and B.AID Agency for International Developmentwill help to clarify, perhapsmore than further ideologicalof one of the most basic human needs.

MELVILLECornwall Regional Hospital This note examines the roles of economic developmentand community health aids (CHA) in influencing changes innutritional status of young children in Western Jamaicaduring 1973-1984.We will focus the analysis in CornwallCounty (especially in the parishes of Hanover and St. James)since it has been the site for roost of the nutrition fieldsstudies conducted in Jamaica since 1969.In the early 1970s, malnutrition was a major pubikhealth problem among young children in Jamaica. For example, in 1970, Gurney et al. (1972) reported that theprevalence of second and third degree malnutrition in theGomez scale among children 0-47 months was 10.8 per cent.In addition, infant mortality rates decreased by only 13.6per thousand during 1960-1965 and 1966-1970 ( PAHO 1984).Moreover, malnutrition was the primary cause of over one-quarter of all deaths among children 2 years of age duringthe period 1968-1970 (Ashworth and Picou 1976). Similarly,during the same period ene-quarter of hospital admissions of225 226children under two was caused by malnutrition (Ibid.). In 1968-69 the cost of hospitalization of malnourished childrenwas high, they occupied 8% of all hospital beds (Cook 1971).Around 1970, the mean birth weight of Jamaican childrenwas lower than the 50th percentile of the Stuart andStevenson Standard (Grantham-McGregor et al. 1972).There was, therefore, an urgent need for a nationalnutrition programme.One of the responses was theestablishment in 1973 ca CHA programme in two westernparishes, namely Hanover and St. James. The programme was extended to 12 parishes in 1975, and by late 1978, 1190CHA's were employed.The CHAs are front line health workers with respon-sibility for screening and follow-up of children under fiveyears of age who are at risk of malnutrition. The CHAs make regular home visits and are actively involved innutrition education, growth monitoring and distribution offood supplements.They are also responsible for carryingout certain duties at the health clinic, such as weighing andcharting.These health workers received two months ofinitial training, which continued at monthly meetingsthereafter. They are supervised by public health nurses andsometimes district midwives.The introduction of the CHA programme in Hanoverresulted in a dramatic reduction in second and third degreemalnutrition levels from 10.975 to 5.9% in Eastern Hanoverafter one year, and a similar reduction from 13% to 6.6% inWestern Hanover a year later (see Table 1). Similarly, child mortality (1-48 months) also declined from 15.4 to 5.6 per1000 in Eastern Hanover after one year (Alderman, et al.1978).This trend continued in Western Hanover a yearlater with a reduction of child mortality from 13.3 to 5.7per th usand (Ibid.). During the same period, Marchione(1977) observed in the parish of St. James also a reductionin malnutritior, from 7.4$ in 1973 to 4.5% in 1975 (see Table1).Itis interesting to note that Alderman and hiscollaborators, and Marchione suggested different reasons forthe reduction of malnutr-ean in the Hanover and St. James.The former attributed the nutritional improvement inHanover--a parish which had not experienced economic27 227 TABLE 1 TRENDS IN MALNUTRITIC'J LEVELS(GOMEZ CLASSIFICATION)DURING 1973-1984, HANOVER AND ST. JAMES HANOVER ST. JAMESGomez II & III Gomez II & IIIYEAR (N) (N) a 1985)g(Melville 1984) 15/228improvement--to the impact of the CHA programme.Marchione felt that the nutritional improvements in St. James were due to self-reliant development, especially amongsubsistent farmers.Melville (1986) compared the CHAprogrammes in St. James and in Hanover and reported thelack of success in the first as compared to the other, andattributed the differences to the following factors: St. James did not have the input of the Cornell Medical Teamas did Hanover, the ratio of CHA to population (1:390 inHanover compared to 1:837 in St. James), the lack ofextensive out reach in St. James, and shortcomings in acontinuous supply of food supplements in St. James ascompare to the Hanover programme. In addition, the distribution of the CHAs in St. James was strongly influ-enced by politics, resulting in their uneven deployment.During the 1976-78 and in the early 1980's malnutritionremained constant at 6% in Hanover (Caribbean Food andNutrition Institute 1979; Thompson 1977; Ministry of Health1980-1984).On the other hand, malnutrition levelsincreased from 4.5$ to 9.3% in St.James during the period1975-1979 (CNFI 1979), remained unchanged at 8% in 1982(McLeod 1985) and increased again to 10.2%, by 1984(Melville et al. 1984).Moreover, the other three parishes(Trelawny, Westmoreland and St. Elizabeth) did not showany significant reduction in malnutrition levels during theperiod 1978-1984 (CNFI 1979; Melville et al. 1984).Marchione (1984) suggested that despite significantimprovements in the health care delivery during the 1970sas a result of the CHA programme, economic changesseemed to be the major factor influencing the nutritionalstatus of young children. Economic conditions improvedduring 1973-75 in most parishes (excluding Hanover) inJamaica and, thereafter, they deteriorated. In fact, during 1977, food prices increased by 40$ due to policies imposedby the International Monetary Fund (Lappe et al. 1981). During the early 1980s there was a substantial devaluationof the Jamaican dollar from US 1.78 in 1982 to 4.95. As a result, the consumer price increase escalated greatly,causing the price of basic food stuff such as flour, rice andcornmeal to increase dramatically during 1982-84. Most probably, the standard of living among the low incomegroups was seriously eroded. 239 229However, it should be noted that despite theseeconomic changes, Hanover has been able to maintain thelow levels of malnutrition achieved during the early 1970s. This is a significant achievement and shows that wellorganized community health projects can make a difference.Moreover, these findings support the hypothesis that thereis a nutritional threshold above which no further nutritional,benefits can accrue to the community from the work of theCHAs (Kielmann et al. 1980).Any further reduction inmalnutrition may have to be stimulated by economicdevelopment that is focused on the needy. We were unableto examine infant mortality rates during the period 1976-84 because of the very high percentage of infant deaths thatwere not registered (Desai et al. 1983). CONCLUSIONSItis quite evident, from the case of Hanover, thatcommunity nutrition programmes integrated into primarycare can be successful in alleviating malnutrition amongyoung children even in the absence of economic growth.Widespread coverage, regular home visits, growth monitoring,nutrition education and supplementation appear to be keyfactors that influence the success of these programmes.This finding should not exclude efforts to develop strategiesaimed at meeting the basic needs of the poor, in fact theyshould be fully integrated into primary health and nutritionprogrammes.The interferences of politics on communityoriented health programmes are very negative. This wasquite evident in the recruitment and development of CHAsin St. James.In conclusion, it should be emphasized thatthe use of appropriate technology in primary health careprogrammes, such as CHAs, may have far reaching implica-tions for national nutrition in developing countries. 240 1111 Alderman, M.1978230REFERENCESH. et al.Reduction of young child malnutrition andmortality in rural Jamaica.

This analysis is built upon the belief that environ-mental factors still play an important part in determiningthe likelihood of infant survival in developing countries, theimportation of medical technology notwithstanding. In fact, while the effectiveness of medical programs may beenhanced by environments that are clean and which havegood quality water supplies, filthy environments that lackbasic social amenities may reduce the effectiveness ofmedical programs on mortality rates.The phenomenal growth in the study of infant morta-lity could have been partially generated by ti..e. fact thatinfant mortality rates,noted to be sensitive to socioeconomicand environmental conditions, are usually regarded not onlyas indices of socioeconomic differentials, but also assensitive indicators of the availability and effectiveness ofthe types of medical and social services programs in asociety.At the aggregate level, higher rates are usuallyreported for less developed than for more developed regions.At the individual level, the probability of infant death isassociated with the social and economic class of parents,among other variables.Declines in infant mortality have usually been regardedas a major component of the demographic transition inboth more developed and less developed regions of the world(Frenzen and Hogan 1982). However, while declines in general mortality levels have been traditionally related toindustrialization and economic development, mortalitydeclines in less developed regions are often associated withthe rise and importation of modern medical technology. In many more developed countries, growth in real per capitaincome, improvements in agricultural and distributionaltechnology, improved sanitary conditions and increasededucational attainment usually precede or are accompaniedby remarkable declines in mortality. In fact, McKeown attributed the health improvements in Europe in the 18thcentury to improvements in public health sanitation systemsand improved agricultural techniques rather than to anymedical improvements.The development of the smallpox fac.,are controlled.tion of the impact of environmental variables on infantthat certain toilet and water facilities, observed in earlierfacilities while others are lacking some or ail of these facilities.Differentials in the availability of these social Ordinary Least Squares Regression technique, an investiga-tionis undertaken.

Unlike Using data on births and deaths and applying theThe quality of the environment in which an individual237 The next six sections of the paper present thetheoretical framework, the research setting, the data the specification and estimation of the model, a discussion offindings and summary and conclusion, in that order.THEORETICAL FRAMEWORKThe impact of sanitary conditions on the health of thepeople has been well documented. As earlier noted, improvements in health in the presently more developednations of the world have been largely credited to improvedsanitary conditions (Mckeown 1965). In many of the ''s2.4 6 238presently less devel' ped countries, an association has beenestablished between the level of infant and child mortalityand the post natal environmental conditions indexed, amongothers, by the quality of water supply, the types of toiletfacilities, and the nature of refuse disposal systems. It is established, for instance, that poor water and toiletsanitaticn are positively correlated with infant deaths(Gordon et al. 1964;Barrel and Rowland, 1979).The need for good quality water in an environmentwhere an infant is being nursed becomes appreciated if it isrealized that an infant cannot '.. adequately fed on breast milk alone for a long period c. ..i..te without food supple- ments that are normally prepared by water. in the absence of adequate water and modern sanitation facilities, waterused in preparing the food supplements may be contami-nated.Deterioration in water quality as a result of fecalcontamination is imminent in less developed countries withenvironments that are characterized by open gutters, dunghills, indiscriminate animal and human defecation as well asunorganized fecal disposal. During raft , watercollected for use or that in open wells k filled with recal and other dirtysediments.Such feces-contaminated % ater is usuallyassociated with high incidence of diseases such as diarrhea,cholera, typhoid, dysentery, and hepatitis that constitutesources of infant deaths in developing countries (Gordon etal.1964;Khan et al.1981).Lack of water, which is believed to encourage the development of poor sanitaryhabits, produces the same effect as the availability of poorquality water (Stein 19771.The established association between feces-cortaininatedwater and child morbidity tends to imply that the provisionof modern sanitary facilities, because of tht potentiality toenhance the hygienic conditions of the home and of thesurroundings, could facilitate a reduction, in the incidence ofchild morbidity and death.While this implication might notbe unrealistic,itis important to realize that adequatesanitary facilities tend to produce desired effects only ifthey are put into proper use (Gordon et al. 1964)and only if the total env:.-onments are themselves clean. It might be deduced, therefore, that improper use of sanitary facilitiesis responsible for 1;'tle or no recur 'ion in child morbidityand mortality after better waste disposal facilities andimproved quality water have been made available in some'24 239locales (Scrimshaw et al. 1968;Levine et al.1976;Cur lin et al.1977).With such a deduction, sanitary facilities per seonly tend to aid in the ma!ntenance of sanitary conditions,but do not serve as a perfect index of the true level ofhousehold sanitation (Stephens 1980.In addition to the sanitation facilities available theremight be the need to take into consideration the quality of usage of those facilities.Maternal education, on theassumption that higher educated mothers tend to makebetter use of sanitary facilities than their less educatedcounterparts, has in many works been used as an index ofthe quality of usage.In that respect, the quality of usagecan be accounted for in either of two ways.First, maternal education can simply be included as a controlvariable in the equation that relates sanitation facilities toinfant mortality. Second, as Stephens (1984) notes, an indexthat combines the quality of use of sanitation facilities withthe type of sanitation facilities available may be created;this index is assumed to provide a better measure of thelevel of household sanitation. Both approaches are adoptedin this study.Besides the availability and quality of use of water andtoilet facilities, other variables of environmental sanitationexamined in this study include types of refuse disposalsystems and the kitchen facilities available. Inadequate disposal A refuse or a pile up of refuse may, on decay,cause air pollution, which may constitute health hazards notonly to the infants, but also to the adults in the environ-ment. The presence of air pollution has been found to havea bear'ng on the health of infants and children; anincreased frequency and severity of lower respir atory tractinfections has been associated with prolonged exposure topolluted air (Douglas and Waller 1966).Cookers that produce a lot of smoke when burning could also be hazar-dous to the health of infants and adults. Besides polluting the air, the smoke from such cookers could cause a chokingatmosphere in the house.An inhalation of such gaseouselements by the infants could produce adverse effects oftheir health.Some other characteristics of the parents are alsoaccounted for in the examination of the relationshipbetween environmental factors and infant mortality. These -24 r 240characteristics include maternal occupation, age, andpaternal income.Occupational differentials, probablybecause they reflect differences in income, prestige andaccess to medical care,in addition to differences inavailable time for child care, have been found to interpretdifferentials in infant survival (Antonovsky and Berstein1977; Carvajal and Burgess 1978). Similarly, since incomedifferentials could interpret to differentials in infant mortality through a host of factors, they have beenaccounted for in this study.RESEARCH SETTINGIfe-Ife is one of the oldest towns in southwest Nigeria,located about 80 kilometers northeast of the Oyo statecapital, Ibadan, and about 230 kilometers northeast of Lagos,Nigeria's capital city.Ife-Ife is famous not only for itshistorical reputation as the cradle of the Yoruba race, butalso as the center of an ancient civilization and the homeof the renowned Ife museum. The 1963 census gave Ife'spopulation as 130,000.The town is presently divided into six wards: Iremo,More, flare, 'lode, Okerewe and Modakeke. The continuingdemand for autonomy by Modakeke has led to a series ofstrifes that have not only led to the loss of several lives,but have also affected the stability of the population.Ifeis primarily a commercial and an educationalcenter.It is, by no means, anindustrial center.There are a few medium-sized departmental stores and severalsmall-scale retail stores in the town. In addition to theretail stores and traders, there are several farmers, produc-tion workers and a few service workers in the town.Educationally, Ife consists of a few primary and se' nciaryschools, a technical school, a teacher training coiiege, aCollege of Arts and Sciences, and a university, the Univer-sity of Ife.In addition to attracting students from all partsof the country, these institutions of learning provideemployment for various categories of workers, notablyadministrative, clerical, secretarial and academic.In addition to the University of Ife health enter, mainly established to attend to the medic,' needs of itsstudents, the members of staff and their dependents, two24i 241hospitals under the University of Ife Teaching HospitalsComplexThe Seventh Day Adventist Hospital and the IfeState Hospital -- provide health care services to theinhabitants ofIfe.The services of these hospitals andthose of the University health center are supplemented bythose of a few private hospitals, clinics and two establishedmaternity centers.While the private hospitals and clinicsprovide all kinds of services to their patients, the maternitycenters specialize in providing ante and post natal care,services to mothers.THE DATAThis analysis is bzsed on data on births and infantdeaths collected through a two-part questionnaire admini-stered in follow-up home visits in Ile-Ife, Nigeria.The births and infant deaths are those that occurred in 1980 and1981 among three groups of mothers. The three groups are:1) mothers who received ante natal care and delivered ineither one of two maternity centers (Enuwa and Modakeke)or State Hospital, Ife; 2) mothers who received ante natalcare in any of the health establishments but failed todeliver in any of them; and 3) mothers who did not receiveante natal care and delivered at home.The records of the two maternity centers and of theState Hospital were used to determine the names and addresses of women in the town who received ante natalcare and either did or did not deliver in these establish-ments. From hospital and maternity centers' records, 1,000mothers who received ante natal care and delivered in thesehealth institutions in 1980, and 1,000 mothers who did notdeliver in the centers but who, by their ante natal carerecords, must have delivered at home in 1980, were selected.Having randomly selected the mothers from all mothers ineach category, the services of the community health nurses were employed to trace and interview them.Consequent upon the internal rifts between theModakeke segment of the town and the rest of Ife,a considerable out-migration of the population was experi-enced; hence, it became impossible to obtain more than halfof the desired sample size for each of the two groups ofwomen, using the 1980 records only. It therefore became imperative,in order to achieve a larger sample size, to .250 242extend our interview to randomly chosen mothers who hadbirths in 1981.The addition of the 1981 records led to aconsiderable improvement in the sample size even thoughthe target of 1,000 each of the two groups was stillunattainable.Of the over 1,000 selected mothers whodelivered in the hospital and the maternity centers, 634mothers were traceable, and of the over 1,000 mothersselected among those who had ante natal care but did notdeliver in any of the establishments, 839 were located.Women who neither re,_,eived ante natal care nordelivered in any of the est 'alishments were located througha two-stage sampling procedure. First, community nurses who lived in different parts of Ife were asked to conducthousehold interviews in selected neighborhoods similar insocioeconomic characteristics to those from which thematernity centers and hospital clientele came to determinethose who gave birth in 1980. A list of such mothers wascompiled.A sample of 1,000 mothers that would be paidfollow-up visits was drawn from the list through a randomselection procedure.Also resulting from internal distur-bances, some of the mothers left Ife before they could bereached.It then became desirable, in order to achieve afair sample size, to extend the survey to mothers who hadtheir deliveries in 1981.Despite the exercise, only 638 ofsuch mothers were successfully interviewed.The first part of the questionnaire deals with thesocioeconomic and cultural characteristics of the mother andof their households.Information was sought on thereproductive history of mothers, the socioeconomic andcultural characteristics of mothers and of other familymembers (e.g., income, education, type of economic activityand religion, among others), environmental factors (such assources of water supply, waste disposal facilities), and thenutritional habits of mothers before and after weaning. Thesecond part concentrates on the infant. For instance, questions were asked on the sex, date of birth deliverycondition, immunization, health history, feeding habits,weight at birth and cause of death (if dead at the time ofthe survey). 243METHODOLOGYThe ordinary least squares regression model has beenemployed to examine the relationship between infantmortality and environmental variables. In the estimation ofthe parameters of some of the equations that examine howdifferentials in environmental conditions could interpret todifferentials in infant mortality, other attributes of themother (age, education and occupation) and those of thefather (education and income) were controlled.In all, four sets of equations were estimated. The first equation relates infant mortality to allselected variables of the environment without taking into accountother attributes of the parents. The second equation controls some other parental attributes; thus we areafforded an opportunity to determine if the pattern ofassociation earlier observed between infant mortality andenvironmental factors change on controlling other parentalattributes.The third and fourth equations concentrate onthe impact on infant mortality of toilet and water sanita-tion,respectively.While equation three relates infantmortality to quality of toilet sanitation (the interaction oftypes of toilet facilities and maternal education), equationfour examines the relationship between infant mortality andthe quality of water sanitation (the interaction of maternaleducation and types of water facilities). In both equations,other variables of the environment as well as other parentalattributes are controlled.The independent variables are dummy variables whichassume the values one or zero. The general equation of the probability of infant death is specified as: g .-1Dij = ao +i . 1j = 1LIJ X it+i j 2 5 2 244 were Dij = the probability of infant death among women ingroup j of variable i; =intercept (constant term)bj=regression coefficientsXji-the jth category of independent variable i; i = 1, 2, ..., p (and p varies among the fourequations estimated).1, 2,..., g - 1(g is the number of cate-gories of each independent variable).error term.i=ij=Since a constant term is included in each equation,dummies corresponding to every level of an independentvariable were not included in the equations since doing sowould cause the moment matrix to be singular and thenormal equation would accordingly have no unique solution.One category each of the binary variable groupings hastherefore been omitted in the estimation of the parametersof the equations.Estimates of the parameters of the equations arepresented in Tables 1 to 4.The intercept is the standardcase defined by women in the excluded category for eachfactor.The b coefficients then represent the differencesbetween the probabilities of infant death among mothers atdesignated levels of the factors and those of the excludedlevels.B- coefficients that are significantly different fromzero according to a two-tailed test with a level of signifi-cance of .05 are asterisked.

Infants born to house- holds using wells experience the highest rate of mortality.The findings raise a fundamental issue -- it is not the merelaying of pipes in the households, but the regular supply ofdrinkable (chlorinated) water through them that is relevantto the health of the people.In Ife, as in many towns in Nigeria, effective water supplies through the pipes has beenlacking.There are usually days without piped water, andthe water is sometimes polluted probably because of leakagesin the pipes.In relation to that associated with the use of streamwater, the higher infant mortality associated with the use ofpiped water could be attributed to either, or both, of twofactors:1) water coming through the pipes is sometimespolluted and since mothers who use it believe that it is pure, the water is not usually treated before use; 2)households that depend mainly on piped water are forced touse other sources of water they are not used to duringshortage of piped water.This situation could enhancemorbidity among infants who get fed with different qualitywater supplies.With respect to wells, several of them aredug in unhygienic environments (especially, in areas close tosuck-aways or pit latrines) and are not properly treatedbefore use.During rains, water in same wells is filled withfecal and other contaminants and since the water may notbe treated before use, it poses a threat to the health of theinfants, thus explaining the relatively high infant mortalityassociated with the use of well water. Unlike wells, contaminants in streams are diluted through flow. Inaddition, households depending on stream water are probablyconscious through several campaign programs of theuncleanliness of water drawn from the streams; hence,stream water may be treated before use. That may explain the lower infant mortality associated with the use of eitherwell or piped water. The locational advantage of having thesource of water supply inside the dwelling house is negli-gible (see panel 2).Estimates in panel 3 of Table 1depict that the probabilities of infant death according to the different toilet 248types do not vary significantly at the 5 percent level.However, the higher probability or infant deaths associatedwith the use of flush toilet when compared with thatassociated with the use of the less hygienic pan toiletdeserves a comment.The irregular supply of piped waterinto households using flush toilets (which are located insidethe home) could lead to an accumulation of human wastes inwater closets; such accumulation of human waste tends tobecome a health hazard, either because it pollutes the air orbecause human waste might be spread by flies. Contrary to some earli2r findings (see for example, Iwugo 1981),households using pan toilets experience the least probabilityof infant death.Users of pan toilets might have evolvedover time ways of preventing the major sources of healthhazards, which are the excessive contamination of seats andthe spread by flies of human waste disposed in buckets.The adverse effects of pit latrines on the health of theinfants may be through the contamination of well water. Bya possible pollution of air and the spread of human wasteby flies, the disposal of human waste in bushes has thegreatest adverse effect on the survival of infants.The pattern of association between the probability ofinfant death and the various refuse disposal systems isdepicted by the estimates in panel 4 of Table 1. Except for \"dumping of refuse in open gutter,\" the estimates show noremarkable variations in the probabilities of infant mortalityacross the different refuse disposal systems. While the use of incinerators is associated with the least probability ofinfant deaths, dumping of refuse in open gutters constitutesthe greatest health hazard to the infants. Dumping of refuse in troughs generally inhibits a free flow of water,thus leading to the formation of stagnant waters that arebreeding pieces for various breeds of mosquitoes. Malaria fever, one of the major causes of infant deaths in tropicalregions, is associated with mosquito bites. That the use of dustbins poses greater (though not significant) healthhazards to the infants than the use of incinerators may beattributed to irregular collection of refuse that is kept industbins outside the house by the authorities concerned.Refuse kept in dustbins for a long period of time may decayand air pollution resulting from decayed refuse may behazardous to the health of the infants (see for example,Douglas and Waller 1966).The use of incinerators, even .. e) t.'1'1A+ 01' 249though it involves burning, does not generally lead to muchair pollution.The effects on infant deaths of the use of differentcooker faci::..iesin households were examined on theexpectation that the amount of smoke produced by a cookerfacility, and by implication the amount of air pollutionarising from its use, would be positively related to thedegree of health hazards its use poses. In that respect, the use of either firewood or kerosene stoves is expected toconstitute greater health hazard to the infants than the useof either the gas cooker or electric cooker that affords acleaner environment. However, a different patto.,--n emergesfrom the estimates displayed in panel 5 of Table 1. The use of kerosene stoves is associated with the highest probabilityof infant survival and the use of electric cookers and othersis associated with the least probability of infant survival.The comparatively lower probability of infant deathsassociated with the use of kerosene stove could be attri-buted to a steady supply of kerosene and the mothers' highadaptation to the use of kerosene stoves; such adaptationresults from many years of use. Unlike kerosene, the supply of either electricity or domestic gas was not regularat the time of the survey. Thus, mothers depending solelyon either electric cookers or gas stoves had to use theother cooker facilities with which they might not be veryfamiliar during power cuts or gas shortages, respectively.Improper usage of any of the other cooker facilities mightcreate situations that have adverse effects on the health ofthe infants.Compared to the probabilities of infan, deathassociated with the use of either the kerosene stove or gascooker, the higher probability of infant death associatedwith the use of firewood could be attributed to the unhy-gienic conditions arising from the use of firewood in thehouse.Although the size of the family was not controlled inthe equation, panel 6 of Table 1 shows a monotonic declinein the probabilities of infant mortality as the number ofrooms occupied by a family increases. Even though house density was employed in one of the earlier studies (Butz etal. 1982), and even though the size of the family was notcontrolled,itis believed that the possibility of crowdingdecreases as the number of rooms occupied by a family 2 5 Li\" 250increases.Crowding is known to have adverse effects onhealth and survival through increased contagion of respira-tory diseases (Gorosomov 1968) and through increasedcontact and fomite transfer of orally ingested pathogens(Butz et al. 1982).Itis generally presumed that the availability ofrefrigerators in the households could be an asset, sincerefrigerators facilitate the storage of food items for a longtime without their becoming spoiled or contaminated.Mothers who keep their babies' liquid foods in refrigeratorsare therefore assumed to have a better assurance ofuncontaminated foods than mothers who do not. Itis therefore not surprising to note that mothers in householdswith refrigerators experience lower probability for infantdeath than mothers in households without them (see panel 7of Table 1).An examination of Table 2 reveals that the patterns ofassociation observed between the probabilities of infantdeath and each of the variables were not altered when someparental attributes were controlled. Besides confirming the patterns of association earlier observed in Table 1, Table 2shows the relationship between infant deaths and someparental factors.Although the parental factors are merely included inthe equation in order to have \"pure\" effects of the variablesof the environment, we briefly discuss their relationship toinfant mortality.In panel 8 of Table 2, it is demonstratedthat the probabilities of infant death decrease with mother'sage.Older mothers tend to be more experienced in childcare activities than their younger counterparts. In addition, the probability of infant death is usually higher among firstbirths experienced by the very young mothers. These two factors might have contributed to the higher rates of infantdeath among the younger mothers.Unlike some earlier findings (Antonovsky and Berstein1977; Carvajal and Burgess 1978; Caldwell 1979; Butz et al.1982; Stephens 1984), which show an inverse associationbetween maternal education and infant/child mortality, thepresent study shows that more educated mothers experiencehigher rates of infant mortality than the lower educatedmothers.It is possible that higher educated mothers are25`1 251 TABLE 2Ordinary Least Squares Regression Results RelatingEnvironmental Factors and Some Maternal Attributes toInfant MortalityCoefficients Water Supply:Piped of Source of Water Supply:Inside of Dwelling House 0.00011Outside of the Dwelling House R.C. 3.Toilet Facilities:Bush 0.00073Pit *-0.08096Gas Cooker and Above R.C. 7.Possession of 252 Table 2 (Cont'd.) for Reference Category*Significant at the 57. level 26.1 253engaged in more time consuming occupations that competewith childbearing for their time. Mothers in such occupa- tions,in order to retain and attend to their jobs, areusually forced to employ relatively cheaper hr\"isemaids, someof whom are not capable of offering the infants the type ofcare they need at their tender age. This line of reasoning appears to be corroborated by the estimates in panel 11 ofTable 2.Except for the few mothers in professional andadministrative occupations, ni n-working mothers experiencelower rates of infant mortality than mothers who areengaged in such comparatively demanding occupations asclerkship or transport and crafts that are usually assumedby comparatively higher educated individuals.The father's income, rather than his occupation, hasbeen controlled in equation 2. Occupational differences arepresumed to interpret to differences in infant mortality through differences in incomes associated with suchoccupational differences.The estimates shown in panel 10of Table 2 depict a negative association between father'sincome and the probabilities of infant death.Panel 1of Table 3 shows the estimates of the qualityof toilet sanitation (the interaction of maternal educationand the types of toilet facilities). The other panels show estimates of other variables accounted for in the equationand for these other variables, the patterns of associationobserved between them and infant mortality in earlierequations are maintained.In order to avoid having emptycells, education and toilet facilities have each been reducedto three levels. On the basis of the frequency distributions,pit and ;pantoilets that have some characteristics incommon were grouped together. Also, since Table 2 shows no remarkable diffe:ence between the effects of secondaryand post-secondary education on the probability of infantdeath, the two educational categories were combined.Three features are notable in panel 1of Table 3. First, contrary to an earlier finding (Stephens 1984), lowereducated mothers appear to be better users of ail the toiletfacilities if quality of use is assumed to be reflected by theprobabilities of infant death.Again, the fact that highereducated mothers usually employ mother surrogates to caterfor their children may account for this pattern.

As earlier pointed out, the estimates might not reflect the impact ofusage habits of the educated mothers themsel /es, but theeffects of usage habits of the educated mothers' housemaids.SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONAn examination of the relationship between infantmortality and some variables of the environment in Ile-Ife,Nigeria, was cerr;ed out in the preceding analysis. Contraryto earlier findings, the analysis demonstrates, among others,that certain toilet and water facilities which are expected toincrease child survival chances appear to enhance infantdeaths once the effects of other parental attributes arecontrolled.For instance,it was discovered that motherswho depend solely on either piped water or flush toiletsexperience higher probabilities of infant death than motherswho respectively depend on either stream water or pantoilets.Also contrary to expectation, cooker facilities thatusually emit much smoke when burning and by implication Table 4257 TABLE 4OLS Regression Result Relating Quality of WaterSanitation, and Other Factors to Infant MortalityCoefficients 0.01960Incinerated -0.01193Dumped in Open Gutter in 4.Cooker *-0.08397Gas Cooker 0.02994Two 0.02665Three 0.00676Four and Above R.C. 6.Location of Source of Water Supply:Inside Dwelling HouseOutside of the Dwelling House 2 6ti0.00235R.C. 258Table14 Table 4 ofDelivery:Registered and Delivered in the Clinic-0.00557Registered and Delivered at Home 0.01014Did not Register and Delivered at Home R.C.INTERCEPT 0.03683R-SQUARE 0.05893 R.C.

With reference to refuse disposal systems, dumpingof refuse in open gutter constitutes the greatest healthhazard and if a distinction is broadly made between pre-secondary and post-primary educated mothers, educationappears to have a negative relationship with infant survival.The patterns of association between infant mortalityand variables of the environment raise some fundamentalissues.First, there is the need to provide social amenitiesthat are functional if we expect socioeconomic developmentto be associated with declines in infant mortality. With respect to water supplies, the provision of piped watershould not be regarded as synonymous with the mere layingdown of pipes through which water either never flows o.flows at irregular intervals.As a result of the irregularflow of water from the pipes, mothers who depend mainlyon piped water have to resort to the feeding of theirinfants with non-piped water; feeding of infants withdifferent quality water may constitute health hazards to theinfants.The irregular flow of water might have also aidedthe development of a situation in which the use of sup-posedly less hygienic pan toilets exert greater positiveimpact on infant survival than the use of flush toilets.During shortages of piped water, an accumulation of humanwaste in water closets of households using flush toilets isinevitable.Human waste so accumulated could imperil thehealth of the infants as well as that of the parents througheither the pollution of the house or through spreading byflies.It is to be noted also that pipes in ile-Ife, as inmany cities, are sometimes broken and are not repaired ontime.Water from broken pipes are likely to be contami-nated by surface waters and particles that enter the pipesthrough spots of breakages; in the absence of a treatmentof water from such pipes before use, morbidity and eventualdeath of the infants could be enhanced. The present studytends to show that the provision of non-functioning socialamenities may enhance rather than reduce infant mortality.Second, the need for a clean environment is demon-strated by our results.An unhygienic environment ischaracterized by an indiscriminate disposal of human wasteand other refuse around the house. Although its impact on infant mortality is not significantly different from those of26 263other toilet facilities, the disposal of human waste in thebush with its attendant pollution of the air and spread byflies constitutes the greatest health hazard to the infants.Individuals should therefore be educated on the danger ofdisposing human waste in the surrounding bushes. Similarly,the dumping of refuse in open gutters should be discouragedas this is found to significantly enhance infant mortality.Third, the fact that differences in the types ofenvironment the mothers live in may interpret to differencesin the survival probabilities of their children is demon-strated by this study. At the time of the study, the cost ofmedical cars was so low as to make it possible for parentsto give their infants the best medical care available in thearea.Yet, differences still persist along differences invariables of the environment, the most significant of whichis refuse disposal sys'ems.This finding therefore calls formeans of br.Jging the environmental gap among thedifferent sections of our cities.

'` THE IMPLICATIONS OF CULTURE CONTACTFOR THE DELIVERY OF HEALTH SERVICESAMONG NGAWBERE (PANAMA) KEITH V. BLETZERMichigan State University A number of countries in the Third World have adoptedpolicies which seek to increase tl,a availability of healthcare in areas of difficult access. Many of these policies base their substantive recommendations on the notion thatrural populations are in desperate need of cosmopolitanhealth services.A few countries (e.g., Nigeria, China,Mexico) consider the presence of traditional medical systemsamong the rural population of their nation-states andaccommodate their health care programs accordingly.Unfortunately, policy-making at the national level in othercountries does not consider the ramifications of ;.- lement-ing cosmopolitan medical services into an area where thelocal situationisat odds cross-culturally with the philo-sophy of cosmopolitan medicine.There is a body of research in anthropology (e.g., Paul1955; pointed to differ-ences in illness etiology between (cosmopolitan) providersand (local) consumers as the basis for the population's lowuse of cosmopolitan medicine. Very few of these studies, however, have examined the implications of culture contactfor health care delivery when considering the interactionbetween providers and consumers as a form of exchange.The framework for the following essay considers thedelivery of health services among Ngawbere of westernPanama as an exchange relationship between provider andconsumer and examines the effect of culture contact on thisrelationship. (1) CULTURE CONTACTNgawbere are an indigenous population inhabiting alarge tract of land in western Panzma; Figure 1 indicates the location of the Indigenous Reserve. For the most part, they have remained isolated from extensive culture contact(Young 1971; Young and Bort 1979). Ngawbere base their land ownership on bilateral descent and rely on fishing-hunting/horticulture for their livelihood. They traditionallypracticed polygyny (some still do), lived in dispersed settlements (many still do) and performed a number ofrituals which now are prohibited by the Mama Chi movement(Young 1976, 1978).Today the majority of youngerNgawbere are bilingual speakers of Spanish as well as t.ieirnative language nqawbere.Contact with the outside world has been sporadic sincethe time of European contact. The first opportunities for wage labor employment came through the cattle haciendasestablished in the savannahs along the Pacific coast,beginning in the 1600s.Relatively few Ngawbere left themountains to work, and those who did work did so incharacteristic Cashion; they worked for a brief period andthen returned to the mountains, sometimes taking with themcattle for raising at home (DAI 1623; ANP 1889). Few other opportuties came until this century, when some Ngawbere,began Lo seek employment on the coffee farms (ChiriquiProvince) and the sugar cane plantations (VeraguasProvince).The involvement of Ngawbere in wage labor hasincreased markedly since the 1970s (Bort and Young 1985;Bort 1983; Young 1985). 267 FIGURE 1Republic or Panama, showing location of Indigenous Reserve(Ngawbere Territory) Z W0 2 7t-ts-001.4 1.40 A. 268On the Atlantic side, there have been few opportu-nities for wage labor.It appears that some Ngawbere inBocas del Toro participated in commerce with the English-speaking Afro-Antillian fishermen who settled the coast inthe early 1800s; reports indicate that they traded mostlysarsaparilla, pigs, cattle and corn (ANP 1873; Body 1871;Roberts 1827).Evidently, the opportunity for commercediminished, and, with the establishment of the bananaplantations in western Bocas del Toro Province by theUnited Fruit Company in 1899, coastal Ngawbere shifted their efforts and took to growing bananas which they thensold to boats periodically sent by the banana companies(ANP 1901; Reid 1980).Since the 1940s, at least, Ngawberehave been e9iployed as laborers on the ....anana plantations ofthe Chiriqui Land Company(2) (Reid 1980).It is important to note that with the exception oft irCerro Colorado copper mine (Gjording 1982, 1983; Mordn 1982), no transnational corporation has actually penetratedNgawbere territory.Instead, Ngawbere remain insulated inthe mountains and avail themselves of wage labor as theyfeel inclined,a situation that has permitted them tomaintain some degree of self-autonomy. One of theprincipal reasons Ngawbere have been able to maintain self-autonomy is a kin-based exchange system that produces mostof the subsistence needs of Ngawbere society from theenvironment in which they live. NGAWBERE SOCIETYThe basic unit of subsistence in Ngawbere society isthe household (hu).The members of the household consti-tute the inhabitants of a single dwelling. They are respon-sible to themselves for the production of foodstuffs andshare in the preparation and consumption of what isproduced.The household also shares responsibility foranyone of its members, should he or she become ill.Itis the married couple acting as joint owners of ahouse (hu bunkon) who assume responsibility for householdmanagement. The husband-wife pair decide when it is timeto go to the forest to work subsistence plots or securefood, when it is time to procure protein, and who will feedand care for the household's animals, if they own some. 269The heads of households also decide whether they havesufficient food to spare if a family member visits thehousehold in order to ask for food.Since subsistence is so crucial to their livelihood,Ngawbere view subsistence-related social interaction withintheir own family group (ha mroko) as paramount. They emphasize in their social interactions with one another theprimacy of first seeking assistance from kinsmen beforerequesting help from someone who is not related eitherconsanguineally or affinally.Assistance between households in Ngawbere societyresolves into exchanges of foodstuffs, animals, materials,equipment, or labor and services. All exchanges assume reciprocity to some degree.Reciprocity is the balance of payment that occurs between two parties in kind or in valuefollowing the initiation of an exchange by one of the two.Sahlins (1965, 1968:81-83, 1972:93-196; 219-220) and Service(1966:14-21) identify 'generalized reciprocity' 'balancedreciprocity' the two basic types of reciprocity whichoccur in small-scale societies. The baiance of payment can be forthcoming concomitant with the exchange or shortlythereafter, and may represent a value equivalent to whatwas initially exchanged (balanced reciprocity). Otherwise, the balance of payment is left open to the discretion of thereceiver in the initial exchange; it may be part of an ongoing relationship with each person helping the otherwhenever possible (generalized reciprocity).Generalized reciprocity occurs in Ngawbere society innearly all forms of exchange and assumes \"an obligation tocirculate or give away (goods to another)\" (biandre), if possible when requested, or voluntarily, with the expectationof (eventual) return.The time, amount and conditions ofreturn are left open.The sense of obligation repeats itselfwhen the giver, at some future date, becomes the personpetitioning assistance.Balanced reciprocity in Ngawberesociety represents any direct \"equivalent exchange\"(kuitadre) whether in kind or in value. it occurs less frequently than generalized reciprocity in Ngawbere society.The basis of Ngawbere exchange relations is that Ngawbereexpect assistance when they need it, not because they canpurchase it.277 270Consumable nonreturnable materials, nonconsumablereturnable equipment and most foodstuffs are circulated onan ongoing basis between neighboring households. The circulation of such items assumes generalized reciprocity,and it occurs primarily with close kinsmen (cognaticrelatives).If there is an increase in supply or value, theperson securing something through the use of borrowedequip dent is obligated to provide a share of what wasobtained (Utiodre).The exchange of items which are equivalent in kindand/or in value assumes balanced reciprocity which, inNgawbere society, chiefly occurs with exchanges of domesticanimals, and, occasionally, either raw or cooked foodstuffs.It occurs between distant as well as close kinsmen andsometimes even between other unrelated Ngawbere. There has been a slight increase in recent years of sailing suchgoods as prepared food stuffs, firewood and lumber betweenunrelated households.Ngawbere describe the practice ofselling with the same term they use for an \"equivalentexchange\" -- only now money sometimes is one of the itemsexchanged.The exchange of labor and services among Ngawberetakes two forms. One is that of cooperative labor, and theother is that of the contract.Cooperative labor can entail pooling labor, as well asresources, L Ash as gasoline, fish line, boats, paddles, anchorrope or motors, for example, to procure protein by goingfishing.It also can entail performing some task, such astwo or more individuals constructing a house or making aboat, clearing a field using \"festive labor\" or assistinganother in raising an animal. Ngawbere refer toallcooperative labor as \"obligated to assist another in the roleof subordinate\" (ayudaire sibai). Generalized reciprocity is assumed in cooperative labor, since the partitipant whohelps out the petitioner can, at a later date, requestassistance.For example, this can occur when individualsrotate their labor by participating in each other's festivelabor project.The negotiation of a contract (kontrato) occurs whensomeone hires another person to perform some task or toconstruct something.It can mean securing firewood in97\") 271quantity; building a boat or house; weaving a fishnet;carving a paddle or axe handle; or performing some portionof the overall task, such as building only the roof of ahouse, or building the gunwales and refining the hull of aboat.Each of these tasks also can occur as a favor(especially among relatives), but what distinguishes contractlabor from cooperative labor in Ngawbere society is theexchange of cash. Hence, balanced reciprocity is assumed incontract labor, since the person petitioning the servicespays the other a sum deemed to be equivalent to the laborused to complete the project.Before discussing how the delivery of health services isimbedded in the system of exchange relations, the medicalresources that are available to Ngawbere are described. HEALTH CARE RESOURCESPractitionersThere are three types(3) of indigenous practitioners ofmedicine who reside provides simple treatments forminor health problems and serves as the initial contact inthe referral system between the northern Valiente Peninsulaand the cosmopolitan medical centers in Bocas del Toro andChariguinola, where non-Ngawbere physicians, dentists andnursas are available.The herbalist and the diviner(4)provide folk remedies of various kinds. They are located inthe larger homesteads along the northern Valiente Peninsulaand elsewhere within the Indigenous Reserve.Folk PractitionersThe healership of the herbalist and the diviner is 272regarded as a \"gift,\" which Ngawbere render as don whenspeaking Spanish.According to Ngawbere, these twopractitioners are born to their office. Their knowledge is considered special wisdom (ni ttiboto) which, it is believed,is acquired through the intervention of divine forces.Ngawbere say that the ability of the herbalist and thediviner to acquire special wisdom \"flows with the blood from(the fetches, prepares and in some form dispenses herbal medicine. He gives prepared medicine to someone who requests it, or hegives advice on an appropriate plant and indicates itslocation and how to prepare it at home. The knowledge which forms the basis for this service is a combination oflearned folk knowledge infused with a familiarity of thelocal forest environment. The folk knowledge is acquired byparticipating in formal oral dialogue (ha ketare) with otherpractitioners.Knowledge of the forest resolves into anawareness of the specific areas of the forest where theherbalist, his parents and his wife's family practice subsis-tence agriculture.The principal function of the diviner (dawnqin) inNgawbere society is to sanction familial and communal vigils(qiitaw) and the rite of abundance (miitaw). This he does during client visits to his home, or during his travels, inwhich people request his permission to hold the vigils orrites.The diviners who practice in the Valiente Peninsulaalso dispense botanical medicine. This can occur as a singular remedy or it can occur in combination with someother recommendation.For example, diviners frequentlyrecommend herbal remedies in conjunction with perform-ance of the familial vigil.The diviner, like the herbalist,learns his craft through participation in formal oral dialogue(ha ketare) and by becoming familiar with the local forestenvironment.More often than not, it is the diviner, ratherthan the herbalist, who assumes responsibility for memoriz-ing and performing the elaborate oral history articulated inthe dialogues between healers.Ngawbere who settled the Valiente Peninsula in the1800s relied on themselves for health care; before that timethe area was unpopulated. There were some families whose'2FA) 273senior members knew enough about indigenous medicine toprepare botanical remedies; sometimes neighboring house-holds consulted these men as herbalists. For more serious health problems, people traveled to Cricamola River toconsult with one of several diviners who lived there.Many decades later, a Cricamola diviner, upon request,formed a pact marriage with one of the kinswomen of apeninsular family which periodically brought him to the area.After some time, he began to train several young boys asnovate healers.Fcur of these today serve as residentdiviners in the larger homesteads of the Valiente Peninsula;the oldest was born in 1946.Cosmopolitan PractitionersThe earliest record of the availability of Westernmedicine in Bocas del Toro Province dates from the 1880s.As a frontier area, government control was lacking andpharmacies (la profesion de farmaceuticas) located in theMunicipality of Bocas del Toro competed with commercialstores which openly imported and sold medications without alicense;at least one man was reported to have beenpracticing medicine without formal training (ANP 189u). Given the insulation of Ngawbere society from the coastalsettlements, it is not known whether Ngawbere made use ofthese resources in any form or whether purchased medicinesomehow found its way into Ngawbere territory.With the advent of participation in wage labor on thebanana plantations, Ngawbere obtained a closer view of cosmopolitan medicine although they themselves may nothave actually made use of it. During Remon's administrationin the1950s,cosmopolitan medical teams visited isolatedareas participating in what were known as \"medical out-reach\" (giras medicas); some coastal settlements werevisited, including the Valiente Peninsula. During this same period, rural schools were established along the Bocas delToro coast; three communities received schools in thenorthern Valiente Peninsula.Beginning in1973,the Panamanian Ministry of Healthbegan to establish health posts (puestos de salud) in areasof difficult access throughout rural Panama; see Figure 2.Their goal was to bring cosmopolitan medical services within CARIBBEANSEA facilities on Ministerio de Salud 1979).Note depicting'health posts in theValiente Peninsula; the map shows three health posts in thecentral portion wherein there actually has been only a single health post. Five posts were staffed during fieldworkalong the northern Valiente Peninsula (1982-1985). An interview with the Ministry of Health in June 1983indicated that some27health posts were in operation in east-centralBocas del Toro Province; the map (above) that was publishedfour years earlier shows only 19. 275reach of all sectors of the national society (Engler 1983; LaForgla 1985).The local people refer to the health pest asla clinica, or simply klinikate in ngawbere.Several northern Valiente havereceived the required tobecome a health assistant(5) (ayudante de saIud). Five of these now staff the health posts located along the northernValiente Peninsula. They receive supplemental training fromtime to time through seminars held in Changuinola. In addition, the Ministry of Health provides training for womenwho already are serving as midwives (parteras) in theircommunities.The training lasts several weeks.The health assistants in the Valiente Peninsula areresponsible for administering vaccinations, attending torequests for medical assistance and organizing the commu-nity for/ such services as potable water (specific details inDireccion de Docencia e Investigaciones 1976:1-5). They open the health posts on an almost daily basis, and evenmake themselves available in the evening and on weekendswhen someone requests their services. They keep some supplies on hand in their homes, moreover, which theydispense as they receive requests. In this manner, they do not need to retrieve supplies from the health post whenthey receive requests (generally for accidents or otherwiseminor ailments) during hours they are not manning theposts.The Ministry of Health distributes supplies on afairly regular basis to the health posts in Ngawbereterritory.Some monies are available for gasoline foremergency trips to Bocas del Toro; at the recommendationof the health assistant, these trips (by boat) are taken incases of severe injury or serious illness. The monies areadministered by the community council (la junta comunal) inconjunction with the local health committee TEtT:a Jnit desalud) which is comprised of the health assistants staffingthe five posts in the northern Valiente Peninsula. 263 276RemediesThere are six kinds of remedial cart available toNgawbere.These are:1.folk remedies generated by the household2.commercial remedies secured locally by membersof the household3.folk remedies dispensed by .a local herbalist or diviner14.basic cosmopolitan remedies dispensed at the localhealth post by the health assistant5.folk remedies dispensed by distant diviner(s)6.advanced cosmopolitan remedies/referrals providedthrough the hospital.Although some of the smaller homesteads along thenorthern Valiente Peninsula have neither folk healers norhealth posts, the first four resources are available locally inthe larger peninsular communities. The last two resources require extensive travel either to the provincial capital orCricamola River.Folk RemediesThere are a number of remedial actions prescribed byNgawbere medicine which are used today in the ValientePeninsula.Many of the actions are common knowledge anddo not need the intervention of a healc in performingthem.Members of the family or the household can decideto initiate them in caring for someone who is ill.These actions include the following three.a.The ill person is restricted in activity (ia dabadrepowaine).He or she generally remains at homefor a period of convalescence, usually lastingseveral days.Subsistence work, fishing andtraveling during this period are not permitted.b.The ill person is restricted in diet (iia dabadrekuete).Restrictions on eating beaf, turtle, pork,chicken and most kinds of fish (except iqwai orkotain) are put into force for the duration of theillness.Condiments such as sugar and salt alsomay be prohibited.The simplest diet which is 277permitted is cooked yams (if in season) or cookedbananas (available year-round). The ill personhas his or her meals prepared on a separate firefrom that of the other members of the household.Ngawbere say that the sick individual \"is passingthrough (a period of)ill fortune\" (taw boine).c.Limitations (naka dabaneme ni bren konti). Ngawbereclaim that several events associated with certainphenomena in nature can make a person dangerouscompany for someone who isill during the firstfive days of the illness.These categories includesomeone who has been bitten by a snake, suffereda shark attack, a pregnant woman and the manwho impregnated her, or someone who hascontacted a corpse or attended a funeral withoutthoroughly washing.Ngawbere say theillness'has flaired up\" ;:ny persons hasvisited the ill individual.There are a number of other remedial actions whichonly the herbalist or the diviner can recommend. Theseprimarily include the use of forest medicine which is takenorally or rubbed on the body. According to Ngawbere healers, there are five sources of medicine which are foundin the forest. These include:plants (krire), vines (kiire),water (nOre), stones (Wore), and living creatures (ngire).Plants and vines by far are the most common materials usedfor preparing medicine in the northern Valiente Peninsula.Medicinal plants are not domesticated; most of the plantsand vines are found in fallowing fields, trees or alongstreams and forest trails, rather than on the lands used forcattle pasture or around the house.There are certain remedial actions which only thediviner can recommend.These include the all-night vigil(qiitaw), as already mentioned, as well as other specialremedies such as the nail point, leeching and ritual cleans-ing of the face.A special remedy, once it is sanctioned bythe diviner, can be performed only by certain individuals thefirstborn, an orphan, a twin or someone for whom thefather is unknown.Others are disallowed from performingthem. These persons generally are selected from within the26.5 family, if available; otherwise, someone eke who is close kinis requested to assist.Pressure point massage is a special remedy which onlythe diviner can perform.Italsois the only remedy reouiring that the diviner attend the sick individual. No others, neither the herbalist nor those who are not diviners,can recommend or perform pressure point massage.Cosmopolitan RemediesSeveral of the small consumer stores which are locatedin the northern Valiente Peninsula stock commercial healthremedies.The most popular remedies include Mejoral,aspirin, menticol and Alka Seltzer. The local populationalso has access to the commercial remedies sold in Bocas delToro, Chanquinola, Almirante and, more recently, ChiriquiGrande.These include a variety of pills, witch hazel,protein supplements, lotions and salves such as hierba-cura.Wage laborers and others known to be making trips outsidethe area are approached by Ngawbere with requests toobtain these remedies.Otherwise, cosmopolitan remedies aPe availab!e locallyfrom the health assistant.The basic purpose of the healthassistant is to provide a preliminary diagnosis of whateverhealth problem is presented at the health post or to whichhe has been summoned.He then assumes responsibility fordeciding whether it requires professional attention, in whichcase he recommends that the client seek help in Bocas delToro or Changuinola, or whether he has some basic remedyon hand which can treat the problem. The health assistant stocks various medications for colds and minor illnessesassociated with fever, vomiting and diarrhea; stomach painsand, more recently, certain gastrointestinal problems; anti-snake serum for some types of snakebite; antibiotics asampicillin for minor infections or infected insect bits; andan array of bandages, splints and a transport carrier for theinjured.The health assistant provides medications whichcan be taken orally and some ointments which are rubbedon the body.In addition, each health assistant has beentrained to administer injections and assumes responsibilityfor administering the vaccinations which are distributedthroughout the country.The Ministry of Health providesthe vaccinations as required by law for younger persons,2,G 279particularly the infant population. In emergency situations, the health assistant arranges transportation for seriouslyinjured or gravely ill individuals.(6)The services provided in the urban medical centers aremore extensive than what is available through the healthpost.These services include treatment for major physicaltrauma, such as broken bones, lacerations, burns, etc.Diagnostic services in the form of X-rays and laboratoryscreenings also are available. From the urban medical facilities, some clients are referred to medical facilities inPanama City or Chorrera, where special medical units handlesuch problems as polio, tuberculosis and cancer.Since there are no doctors or -dentists in private,practice in the Bocas del Toro Province or with the ChiriquiLand Company, the only available medical professionals workin the hospitals and medical centers which are located inthe western portion of the province rather than in theeastern area comprising Ngawbere territory. Whereas the paramedical personnel who staff these facilities have beentrained through the Ministry of Health, the physicians,nurses and dentists who staff the hospitals have receivedtraining elsewhere, generally through the University ofPanama Medical School, and hold licenses to practicevalidated by the Panamanian government. The professionalmedical personnel in western Bocas del Toro on the wholeare non-indigenous, in comparison to the para-professionalNgawbere who staff the health posts along the easterncoast.Thus,allcosmopolitan medical care is providedthrough the Ministry of Health, and medical professionalsare located only in the western half of the province.Medical Care CostAs many Ngawbere expect the healer to provide hisservices within the context of the give-away, some folkhealers do not set fees for their medical services. They provide herbal medicine and advice, as they are able, as apart of an ongoing exchange relationship; when they are inneed they expect to be assisted in return. A few folk healers, however, have set \"fees\" by which clients maycompensate them in cash.Those who have set fees fortheir services generally lack a reliable source of cash (forexample, a son performing wage labor). They prefer a 280certain amount for consultation and a separate amount foreach bottle of medicine or whatever particular remedialaction they may recommend. Clients pay when and if theyfeel a cure has occurred.The health assistants work within the payment forservices schedule formulated for them by the Ministry ofHealth.The cost of the services, including medications, isroughly comparable to the fees set by the folk healers.There are two programs through which Ngawbere availthemselves of the health post services. One is the occupa- tional health program, and the other is the rural healthprogram.Ngawbere men who arc working as wage laborers pay acompulsory premium as part of the government's occupa-tional health program (about 1.5% per month, regardless ofincome level).The rights for medical attention through theprogram extend to the worker's immediate family, whichincludes sppuse,/ children under sixteen and the worker'sparents (Diaz Merida 1983). The program does not coverthe parents of the spouse. Since family members usuallyremain in their homestead while the worker is elsewhere(for example, residing in Changuinola), itis the family rather than the worker who make frequent visits to therural health posts. The workers from the Valiente Peninsulawho recently wnrkcd in Chiriqui Grande paid bimonthlypremiums for the compulsory insurance. Similarly, those who work with the banana companies are covered under theprogram.A worker who loses or leaves his employmentloses his right to free services through the occupationalhealth program.Instead, those persons who have no visiblesources of income have a right to receive medical servicesthrough the Ministry's public health program.The rural health program, includioq the effortsinitiated in Bocas del Toro in 1973, is part of the publichealth program.Under this program, the Ministry uses asliding scale to determine the fee for clients. The scale is based on regional rather than individual income. For Ngawbere living in the Valiente Peninsula and elsewherealong the coast, the fee for consultation is 25 cents perconsultation apart from the cost of medications, injectionsor other treatments. The most expensive treatments are forsnakebite, averaging about $5-10 per serum injection. By :(,200 281way of comparison,the \"fees\" set by the snakebite curersvary from one curer to another, and they tend to beslightly more expensive than the Ministry of Healthsnakebite treatment and greater than the fees set by thehealers for other kinds of botanical medicine. Vaccinations at the health post are given free on a periodic basis toeveryone in the area; this generally is done for infants andyoung children not yet vaccinated. (7) HEALTH CARING AS EXCHANGEAmong Ngawbere, health caring is one kind of helpseeking among several.The care of someone who isillin Ngawbere societyremains the primary responsibility of the household in whichthe person is living, if the members are able to care for theperson adequately.Otherwise, the responsibility falls tosome other household whose head belongs to the family intowhich the ill person was horn. Health caring is an obliga- tion for those who stand in some close social relationshipwith the ill individual.Sometimes the ill person must relyupon himself,if the treatment needed is very minimal.Most of the time, the responsibility for health caring fallsupon one's spouse; one's parents, if alive, able-bodied andliving nearby; one's children, if older, living at home andlacking school commitments, or if living as neighbors; andone's siblings.Spouse's parents,nieces and nephews, cousins, even \"co-parents\" are other relations who may joinin to help in some way with health caring during an illness.Hence, dose cognates and lineal relatives, along with one'sspouse, assume the major responsibility for the health caringprocess, just as these social relations are the primary oneswith whom kinsmen interact for purposes of subsistence-related activities.As one of several kinds of assistance between house-holds, the basis for health caring is generalized reciprocity.Time and medical resources comprise the basis for exchangein the health caring process. Health caring originates within the ill person's household. What occurs frequently when an health problem is serious is that an exchange oftime and medical resources come in bulk from otherhouseholds comprising cognates, neighbors and even affines.211,f 282In this way the response to a health problem does notoverburden the household in which it occurs. Health care assistance is requested as needed, or it may be forthcomingvoluntarily simply because someone who stands in a socialrelationship with the illperson feels inclined to help out.There invariably exist sufficient relations with kin thatsomeone steps in to help out when an illness occurs, even ifthose who are the closest kin elect not to participate in thehealth caring process.The Cost of Medical CareThe provision of botanical medicine in essence is aform of circulating materials, namely, the actual plants thatare used and the knowledge that is needed to prepare themas medicine.The healers in Ngawbere society often keep asupply of plants in their homes for the more commonillnesses for which they receive requests. They also advisepeople on where to find the plants and how to prepare themto make medicine, in situations in which they are unable orunwilling to fetch the plants themselves. Recommending other kinds of remedial action is considered a form of give-away between the healer and a client; the healer is viewedas having better than average knowledge of Ngawberemedicine, which is not secret, but somethinn of benefit forall Ngawbere.Generalized reciprocity is assumed when the healer andthe person making the reauest are close relative, especiallyif the petitioner or someone in his family has a skill of hisown, such as carpentry.Otherwise, the folk healer prefersto conclude the transaction with a client through thepayment of cash at the time the medicine is dispensed or,sometime later, when the ill person is cured. Therefore,dispensing botanical medicine assumes generalized reciprocitybetween close relatives and balanced reciprocity if it occursbetween distant relatives or those who are non-family.In contrast, the dispensing of cosmopolitan medicine isperformed as a labor contract rather than as the circulationof medicine or as a (medical) give-away. The health assistant informs the client of the Ministry of Health feeschedule generally at the time consultation isinitiated. From the beginning, the client knows what is expected ofhim in terms of paying the health post for its services, just2J0 283as occurs in paying the contractee at the completion of alabor contract. MINIMIZIt4G THE COST OF MEDICAL CAREThere are several means that Ngawbere use to circum-vent or minimize the cost of medical services. Two of the ways constitute tactics used by the consumers of theservices, and the third is an option given to the consumerby the provider.All three means share in common thebasic expectation inherent in help-seeking in Ngawberesociety:Ngawbere expect to receive help when they needit,rather than receive help onlyif the; are able topurchase it.The first tactic is that of paying an amount under the\"established fee.\"It frequently includes non-payment of thefee.The client usually proclaims hardship es the timeapproaches for payment or at the time the request formedical assistance is made.The client may promise to givesomething at a later date generally with the intent ofpaying the amount as completely as possible. The client alternatively may give a little of what he owes and indicatethat his circumstances do not appear to be improving. He is saying in effect that he is unable to make full paymenteven at alater date.Clients occasionally petition thepractitioner to provide the services as a favor (a give-awayi, calling attention to their social relationship by usingthe healer's family name,if in fact they are family, or,if not,a kin term referring to their affinal relationship.Petitioning for medical services to be given free occurs bothwith the folk healers and the health assistants.The second tactic is receiving monetary assistance fromanother household which either \"loans\" or \"gives-away\" partor allthat is needed t^ pay for the services received.Frequently, a sibling or lineal relative is approached andrequested to assist the petitioner in paying for medicalexpenses.The request for assistance also can includepetitioning another household outright to purchase therequired medications, if someone in that household is in thewage labor force.Elderly Ngawbere occasionally areapproached by someone younger and asked to identify plantswhich have been recommended by the healers. Generally,,2. 284they receive something other than cash in gratitude fromthe young, or they receive nothing more than the opportu-nity to help out.The request to another householdsometimes entails requesting leftover medicine, similar towhat the practitioner has recommended, that is known to beavailable in a neighboring household, since it was acquiredfor an earlier illness resembling the current one. There were no instances recorded during fieldwork, and no onecould recall an instance,in which people sold cattle in order to obtain the money needed for medical services.Borrowing money or requesting a favor by far were themore common practices.Requests to other households aremade, therefore, with the expectation of receiving a favor,that is, the household approached is expected to assist aspart of the system of general reciprocity without thought ofcompensation.Ngawbere recently have instituted the practice ofborrowing social security identification cards in order tosecure services at the health post. The household being approached takes into account their obligation to assistothers in the family.They, therefore, readily loan thecards.People are able to use the cards since the Ministry'sintake records require only a person's social securitynumber, not the name of the person receiving the service.Similarly, if the request to another household is to borrowmoney or purchase medication outside the community orprovide money for gasoline to visit a distant healer, thosewho are working consider their obligation to help out familymembers who may not enjoy access to cash or find them-selves unable to travel far outside the community. Hence, the request to purchase an outside medication also is honored fairly regularly.The final means of minimizing medical costs is an alternative posed by the practitioner. This customarily occurs in instances in which the practitiOner of indigenousmedicine expresses interest in some favor that a client mayperform for him (that is, balanced reciprocity). The healermay mention that the client or a relative of the clientpossesses certain skills, such as carpentry, or has access tocertain materials, such as that enjoyed by wage laborers.Sometimes he may show an interest in certain naturalmaterials, such as firewood or bamboo and palm thatchingfor roof repairs, especially if his own farm lands do not 2.14,,..., i%_: 285have these materials.The diviners in the northern ValientePeninsula, for example, do not request money from thosewho have helped to build or repair their homes. Thus, there is some variability in the assumption ,3f reciprocity inrequesting the services of a folk healer. Unless one is close family,in which case generalized reciprocity is assumed, receiving medicine from the folk healer impliespayment of some kind for his services (balanced reciprocity).The possibility of exchanging some favor for medicalassistance does not occur in the transaction between ahealth assistant and his client. The health assistants perform major tasks on their awn rather than expect thosereceiving their services to help them out. This is because they receive a small stipend from the government andcannot expect to invite clients to help them under the guiseof a lack of personal funds or their need for a favor.Both the folk healers and the health assistants, on theother hand, expect to receive transportation when they arerequested to visit someone who is ill. This occurs when the illindividuallives some distance from the practitioner'sresidence and boat travel is required. The practitioners rarely if ever provide their own money for gasoline for seatravel to see someone who is ili. The healers, it should be noted, travel more extensively than the health assistants.Each health assistant restricts his activities to the immedi-ate area, since the more distant areas already are coveredby other health assistants. The healers,in contrast, sometimes travel as far as Rio Cana to the east or theChiriqui Lagoon area to the west. Several healers, more- over, make periodic trips to the banana plantations in orderto provide botanical medicine to the workers and, if present, their families.Their visits coincide with pay week. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONDispensing botanical medicine traditionally was a formof give-away wherein someone who was experienced withforest plants shared that knowledge, w'nen asked, by givingadvice or securing medicinal plants on behalf of someonewho was ill.Healers were people with extensive empiricalknowledge of the forest; some were prepared in the healerrole from the time of birth (the diviners), whereas others2H3 286simply accrued experience on their own (the herbalists).Requests to the healers were met by circulating theknowledge of medicinal plants (where to find them and howto prepare them, etc. ),since medicine never has been asecret domain of Ngawbere culture. Some healers secured the plant(s) themselves, which they then gave to a house- hold with instructions on how to prepare the medicine.\"Giving away\" isstill the basis Par the delivery of indi-genous medicine.Ngawbere frequently speak of the role ofthe healer in terms of \"giving for (the good of) others\" (nibien ie).Ngawbere exchange relationships have been complicatedthrough culture contact.More than in the past, Ngawberemake use of exchanges that rely on balanced reciprocity.With the introduction of cash into Ngawbere society and a growing dependence on money, alternative kinds of exchangehave been generated in order to accommodate new materialgoods such as boats with outboard motors, social securityidentification cares,store clothes and even cash itself.There also has been a general increase in the use ofcontract labor; in the past, Ngawbere relied principally oncooperative labor to meet their subsistence needs. Balancedreciprocity forms the basis now for more kinds of exchangethan in the past, although by no means has the principle ofgeneralized reciprocity been replaced as the basis ofNgawbere help seeking.The introduction of the health assistant who workswith the government fee schedule and the setting of fees bysome folk healers are one response to the growing depen-dence on cash in Ngawbere society. The payment of money for medical assistance, however, is more lax than in projectsnegotiatied as true labor contracts. The amount actually received by each type of practitioner, in practice, therefore,does not correspond to the amounts they should be receivirgover a period of time according to their respective freeschedules.There has been little change in the basic medicalknowledge that is used within the household for homeremedies, although there are indications that the youngergeneration knows less of the prescribed (Ngawbere) use offorest plants than their parents and grandparents. The 287prescription of prohibited actions continues in connectionwith illness and often is initiated from within the household.The sense of self-autonomy that has characterizedNgawbere society for centuries continues on, and theminimization of medical case costs in response to thegrowing dependence on cash suggests that Ngawbere willcontinue to maintain their self-autonomy as much aspossible. No doubt the exchange relations that characterizehealth caring will keep pace with the increased use ofalternative forms of exchange. Although the practice of help seeking within Ngawbere society will grow morecomplicated, its basis in generalized reciprocity will remain.

Prior to President Lazaro Cardenas' term in office, when theimmense land reform redistribution scheme was pushed intoeffect, revolutionary zeal was accompanied by very littleother than rhetoric and the floundering of a newly estab-lished system of government. However, since the 1930's, Mexico has been a leader in Latin America in implementingprograms of development designed to push the nation int)becoming a fully modernized country with a populace nolonger subject to the disheartening and demeaning forces ofinequality.Mexico has had great success in its drive formodernization, however, a large number of its people stillsuffer from malnutrition and preventable diseases.This paper examines the role of technological develop-ment in population development as related to health andnutrition standards. The population under examination livesin a distinct section of the rapidly urbanizing small city ofTula de Allende, Hidalgo, Mexico. They comprise what perhaps may be most appropriately termed the semi-urban,peasant class.The construction of two high-technologyindustries on the outskirts of the city has had enormousinfluence on changing the demographic structure of Tula aswell as providing the major impetus for urbanization andmodernization of what was, fifteen years ago, a sleepy,small industrial, agricultural-based district capital. The attempt is made here to assess the economic, social and,particularly, health status ramifications on the population inquestion by comparing the impact on the high-technologyindustries with information available from other regionaleconomic development assessments as well as studies ofindustrialization and its effects on a population's healthbeliefs and practices. 297GENERAL BACKGROUNDThe city of Tula de Allende is located 80 km. north-west of Mexico City in the arid Mezquital Valley of thestate of Hidalgo.In 1972, the population of the citynumbered 38,685 inhabitants. Estimates give the present population of the city to be at or near 60,000 inhabitants.The increase is due primarily to the influx of Mexicannationals who have immigrated to Tula to work in the oilrefinery and thermoelectric plant, both of which beganoperations in the early 1970's.The specific population group under examination hereare the residents of the colonia El Tesorc, generallyconsidered to be the most economically deprived section ofthe city.The colonia is situated on the flanks of thepromontory upon which the ancient Toltac civilization builttheir capital city of Tolan, which thrived from approximately900 to 1200 A.D.A primary source of income for theapproximately 2,000 residents of the colonic is the manufac-ture and sale of mementos, archaeological reproductions andfake antiquities as well as genuine artifacts to the manytourists ..ho come to visit the archaeological site. Other occupations include working as plasterers, brick-layers,laborers and household servants for the wealthier families ofTula.The community- specific data that is utilized here toanalyze the health care patterns of the colonia residents,specifically in response to the introduction of a sophisti--;ated industrialization, is derived from a five-month periodof field study conducted in 1983 and 19814.The Colonia El Tesoro:The colonia was founded in the late 1930's as part ofthe revolutionary ideal of land redistribution finally initiatedby President Lazaro CarJenas (Fink ler 1973). The area wasdivided into lots which were primarily intended to inutilized as housing construction plots rather than agricul-tural land.The neighborhood occupies three sides of aplateau which extends back into a valley that is notincluded as part of the !lido property. The terrain is dry and barren which, compounded with the steepness of theincline, makes the property virtually useless for agricultural3o5 298purposes. The original colonizers, or loteros, secured a lotby demonstrating need.As families have grown and the lotshave all been awarded, the number of houses on each lothas increased so that there are now at least two or threehouses occupying a space originally intended for one familyand their livestock.Living conditions are crowded; there is an average offive persons to each twc-room house. Water is piped across the Tula River which di:Ides the colonia from the rest ofthe city.The water pump is frequently out of commissionwhereupon the colonia residents must utilize the publicwater fountains in the center of the city for all their household, sanitation and drinking purposes. Virtually everyfamily keeps a barrel or two full of water, often left uncovered, as insurance in case of a pump breakdown.Housing construction materials initially includelaminated sheets of aluminum, loose sheets of cardboard andwood and brush supports until a family has accumulatedenough money to invest in building a concrete blockstructure with cement floors and an aluminum sheet roof.Water spigots were put in each lot early in the 1970's. Of the approximately 350 houses, a handful have indoorplumbing. Each lot and the houses built on it usually sharea common latrine and washing facilities.The Tula River, which flows around the base of ElTesoro essentially comprising a geographical and culturalbarrier from the rest of the city, is a repository for sewagefrom Mexico City as well as from Tula. The oil refinery also uses it as a repository for much of its waste. Alive ten years ago, the river is now dead. It is still used for agricultural irrigation purposes for small eiido plots furtherdownstream.A primary school was constructed in the colonia sixyears ago.Itlistsits attendance at over two hundredstudents.Attendance fluctuates greatly and is oftendependent upon financial resources, e.g. ,whether there is an event planned wherein the student had to purchase acostume, a notebook and pencils are needed, a child isneeded at home to care for younger siblings while themother goes out to work, etc. Only a small minority of theadult residents have completed the first six grades of3 'G 299schooling.With the exception of two individuals, no onehas gone on to complete high school.The colonia residents have traditionally occupied thelowest positions in the occupation sphere. The original founders were caraqadores, bearers of marke. produce.Their children have worked as periodically hired laborersand household servants.Only in the past ten years hasthere been a significant shift to other occupational levels,namely that of artisan production. It is a more rewarding profession in terms of income if one is able to maintain asteady working schedule.While an jido, El Tesoro is strictly non-agricultural.Although the classical model of peasantry is one defined bythe concept of agricultural self-sufficiency, the residents arepeasants in the sense that, as an economic and social unit,they are subordinant to a dominant economy (Stavenhagen1978:32).And indeed, they share the dominant characte-ristic of poverty and its implications with the rural peasan-try of their country. Lewis (1967)hds described the under- developed economy as one divided into the \"capitalist\"sector and the \"subsistence\" sector, which only minimallyinteract.The subsistence sector, with which the El Tesoroinhabitant., would be identified, perform the function ofproviding the capitalist sector with a cheap and undemand-ing source of labor.Certainly this is true in the case ofthe colonia, whose residents are considered lucky when theyare able to find work with the capitalist sector at whateverwage it is willing to pay. Thus, they are subordinant to thegreater society and economic system and can be consideredas peasants.Although in a semi-urban, non-agricultural setting, theEl Tesoro residents are very similar to other Mestizopeasant communities in social and economic characteristics,particuiary in reference to their position relative to thenation.In regard to health practices, beliefs and circum-stances,El Tesoro can be likened to many of the othercommunities in Latin America that are undergoing moderni-zation and urbanization processes.Health/Disease CharacteristicsHistorical:There are no data specific for Tula de3P? 300Allende. However the reports of medical doctors working innearby Towns during their obligatory years of repayment tothe state illustrate the conditions that existed in the 19140'sprior to the industria!ization of the area. In each case, the water used for human consumption was found to be contam-inated as a result of drainage of sewage into the river orground water wells.The most frequent infirmitiesencountered was quitefrequent as was the incidence of malnutrition attributedprimarily to the quality of foods eaten enhances susceptibility to the parasitic and infectiousdiseases most commonly suffered in communities such as ElTesoro (Arteaga 19714).A case can be made for the highincidence of infectious diseases in these communities as adirect association with a concomitant high level of malnut-rition.Present:There are numerous reports demonstratingthat health conditions have not much improved since the19140's.As an example, malnutrition has been attributed tothe underlying cause of death in fifty-two percent of alldeaths :of one- to four-year olds in Latin America (Berg andMuscat 1972:187).Population growth rate as a total in Mexico for the last 70 years has been at 3.3 percent,although there is a downward trend in birth and death rateswhich are still consistently high (Behm, Gutierrez andRequena 1972:13).The extreme population growth has hadan effect on health characteristics. Providing adequate nutrition, housing, sanitary facilities, etc., is an even-moredifficult task, especially when not enough jobs can becreated to accommodate the burgeoning working class (LBJReport 1982:12).These factors are essentially the same asthose that were dominant influences in the poor healthconditions of the rural poor almost half a century ago.Ina study of health and nutritional status of a\"working class\" urban community of southern Mexico, verysimilar toEl Tesoro in social and economic features,Graedon (1976:1451) notes that nearly two-thirds of theillnesses suffered relate to respiratory and gastro-intestinalproblems, the inevitable companions of chronic undernutri-3u8 301tion.The study area, the colonia of San Jacinto on theoutskirts of Oaxaca, shares many of the same physical andenvironmental conditions with El Tesoro. Refuse is dis- carded wherever possible, as there are no officiallysanctioned, constructed or maintained refuse collectionareas.In San Jacinto, it is usually thrown into a nearbyravine, in El Tesoro it is tossed down the embankment intothe river below.In neither locale are there sufficientsewage disposal systems.Human waste is a major contam-inant of the water source.There is a lack of running water making cleanliness and sanitary procedures virtuallyimpossible to be achieved on a daily basis. Employment is erratic in both city colonies, average educational level ofadults is much below the first six years of schooling andschool attendance is unreliable (Graedon 1976).Graedon conducted a survey of the households todocument morbidity rates.In one out of ten householdswith infants and one out of twenty with preschool children,the youngest members were reported to have been sickrepeatedly, an average of one in three days. Many of the diseases are seasonally related; the highest frequencies ofgastro-intestinal disturbances occur during the rainy seasonwhen the water supply is more likely to be contaminatedthrough run-off.Conversely, the respiratory illnesses aremore severe in number during the dry, cool part of the yearwhen the mucous membranes of the respiratory tract are ingreater danger of infection (Graedon 1976:151).These seasonal conditions prevail in Tula and have a similar effecton the sector of the populace already at greater health riskbecause of their socioeconomic status.Diet in the colonia of El Tesoro consists of the staplesof tortillas and beans supplemented by a variety of vege-tables, fruits and animal protein. Seasonality also enters into the health picture here as many of the vegetables andfruits are from a wild food source, the hillsides surroundingthe city.The animal protein available include chicken,pork, or the rare piece of beef, although its consumption isdirectly related to the family's socioeconomic status.Essentially, as in San Jacinto (Graedon 1976:206),the majority of energy in the diet is derived from carbohydratesrather than from protein or fat. A clinical assessment of 109 children from San Jacinto revealed that over one half ofthe children exhibited one symptom of poor nutritional3(19..,,t:. 302status (Graedon 1976:293).The implications based on thesimilarity of social and economic structures as well as environmental and seasonal factors are that El Tesoroinhabitants suffer a like degree of malnutrition and inci-dence of disease.The availability of food and its consumption are two distinct aspects of a community's diet and are directly related to a population's nutritional status. Cravioto (1958) has suggested that the cultural practice of not supplement-ing food intake sufficiently during the later stages ofbreast-feeding and during weaning is an integral factor inthe high incidence of infant malnutrition in Mexico. De Waltand Pelto (1977:84) noted that in the small city ofNopalcingo, Hidalgo, conceptions about food qualities variedwidely as did consumption practices. Differences were related to economic status as well as to variation inaccessibility to information.However, it was found thatregardless of the food beliefs held by the female head ofthe household, family members were not fed more of thefoods that were considered highly nutritious (De Walt andPelto 1977:87).Even though cultural factors such aspreparing corn by soaking it in a lime solution which addscalcium and releases greater amounts of niacin (Squibb et al.1959) are influential in determining the adequacy of a population's diet, the factor of economic status is extremelyimportant (Azurdia et al.1963; Arriaga and Davis 1969; feature of the El Tesoro dietary statusis that dietary adequacy corresponds directly to the level offamily income (LBJ Report 1982:30). As a peasant popula- tion existing on the fringe of the working class, El Tesororesidents have little opportunity to provide for themselvesand their families a consistently nutritionally adequate diet.Health Beliefs:Although in a semi-urban setting, the populace of ElTesoro have maintained many of the elements of traditionalmedical folk belief, as they have other social structuressuch as firm familial ties, a strong compadrazqo system anda professed religious devotion. 303The hot-cold dichotomy is an integral feature inMexican peasant folk belief and many of the illnesses orhealth conditions perceived by the peasant society are directly related to it (Logan 1973).The hot-cold dichotomy is deeply entrenched in the Mexican peasant's conception ofthe forces that act upon his/her body to create certainconditions and ultimately on the steps that must be taken tocorrect those conditions (Madsen 1961).Aire, perceived as winds or bad air, can cause.paralysis, seizures, vomiting episodes, chills, fever and anumber of other conditions (Ingham 1970).Persons are particularly vulnerable to aire when something disrupts thehot-cold balance within their body or immediate environ-ment.The kind of cure sought often addresses the causerather than the symptom, with the rationalization thatremoval of the cause will restore harmony, thus eliminatingthe symptom (Adams and Rubel 1967:348) .Mal de 212 can be more appropriately translated asforceful eye or gaze, rather than utilizing its literal translation of bad eye.Individuals within the communityare noted for their oj2 fuerte, or strong eye. The personsthat fall prey to it are usually notably weak in some way.Either they are young children with little resistance or commonly adults who have recovered from a long andserious illness. The symptoms include dizziness, weakness,often diarrhea, loss of appetite and a tendency to indulge incrying spells.The forceful gaze is considered to be onethat derives its strength from heat (Ingham 1970:80).Another illness, although not so common in this areaof Mexico anymore, is susto, or fright. It is suffered after a particularly traumatic event often associated with super-natural visions.While older adults in El Tesoro spoke ofsusto as a phenomenon that had occurred in their lives, theyounger and middle aged members made reference to it in ajoking manner, indicating that one had to be slightlyimbalanced or too \"boncho,\" too much like an Indian, toseriously believe that one could see the Devil's spirit.Treatment of mild cases of aire and mal de gio, alongwith a variety of other ailments, is conducted in the home,usually by the female head of the household. Treatment involves repeating those procedures seen in previous visits 304to the curer and includes cleansing the patient withnaturally scented purl! branches or a fresh eijg. Cleansing refers to a withdrawal of the disruptive force within thebody through the action of wiping the branch of egg over the patient's body. A prayer is usually incanted during theritual.Often a votive candle is purchased and lit in frontof the individual's patron saint.The transition from a system of folk medicine practicesto a modernized system of professional, Westernized medicalcare becomes apparent when the patient cannot be cared forat home with the standard remedies. In the past, the next step would have been to take the patient to the local curer,curandero. With increasing modernization involving indust-rialization, population growth, greater communication outletsand accessibility plus improved educational levels, a modernmedical system with its physicians, nurses and otherpersonnel has been integrated into the city of Tula andprovides the colonia residents with anet!,ar option of healthcare.The existence of a modern medical care system doesnot imply a population-wide disregard of the traditionalcurer.It was found that in the city of Bogota, Colombia,the poorer sector of the society tended to diversify his/herutilization of non-medical and medical services, shifting from folk to modern medicine with ease in accordance withwhat they felt their requirements were (Press 1971).McClain (1977) noted that in the modernizing community ofAjijic, Jalisco, those individuals who were more traditionallyoriented participated in a more flexible manner in the healthsystems available than did those individuals who wereconsidered to be more modern-ciented. While the author makes no mention of socioeconomic variables, a graveomission in an analysis of health care practices, it may bepostulated that those individuals mere traditionally orientedcomposed the peasant stratum of society. By inference, thisgroup had less financial resources and consequently utilizedthe health services in a manner to best accommodate theirbudgetary constraints.The curandero principally utilized by the El Tesoroinhabitants has remained steadfast in his approach throughhis thirty plus years of practice. He has a strong religious focus and demands that his patients profess a similar 305devoutness.His curing procedures involve the use ofcleansing with puril branches blessed with holy water and a\"laying-on-of-the-hands\" wherein he moves his hands gentlyover the patient's body, chanting a prayer while in a trance.Since the curandero is of advanced age and finds it difficultto maintain his stamina, his two disciples take care of themajority of cases.They also follow the ritual of fallinginto a trance, reciting prayers and cleansing the patient'sbody with their hands and with branches. Medication prescribed is bottled on the premises, or directions aregiven so that an individual can make his/her own. Pharma- ceuticals are not utilized.There are no set fees for service; patients rare asked to pay what they feel they canafford.Colonia residents often prescribe their own medicationor consuit. with one of the three local pharmacies beforepurchase of a drug designed to aiieviate symptoms such assore throat pain, nausea, fever, etc. A standard cure for acase of sire is the inhalation of ether fumes, a capsule ofwhich can be purchased at the pharmacy. Although birth control pills are readily available without prescription, amore common means of artificial birth control practiced bythe El Tesoro residents is the injection of an abortant, alsoavailable at the pharmacy without prescription. Several members of El Tesoro have learned to give injections and doso for a small fee.In the utilization of the pharmacy for avariety of medicinal and health purposes, the El Tesoropopulace have demonstrated a dual approach to the medicalsystem, much in the same way as has been demonstrated byother urbanizing populations (Press 1969).However, complete utilization of the modern medicalsystem is prohibited by the high expense of medical andhospital services.The direct relationship between socio-economic status and physical utilization has been established(Hyman1970:387)and this phenomenon certainly holds truein the l.I Tesoro case.Financial factors are elemental butso too are cultural characteristics wherein the physician andthe patient fail to establish a rapport (Hyman 1970:388),the patient feels as if he/she is being ridiculed or subjected toabuse by the modern medical practitioner and they fear theimpersonality and alienation of the hospital situation wheredeath seems to be the only conceivable final outcome(Madsen1961:20;Elliot1972).Nonetheless, the El Tesoro3113 306inhabitants turn to a physician in times of necessity whenno other effective cure has been found and they have somehope of being able to pay the fee. As Woods and Graves (1973) point out, the transition from traditional to modernmedicine is apparent in almost all areas of Mexico. El Tesoro is no exception.What remains to be discussed arethe mechanisms for transition and the influence of an industrial development program on the health situation ofthe El Tesoro urban peasantry. REGIONAL DEVELOPMENTMexico has maintained a program of economic growthand development since the revolutionary ideals began to beimplemented fifty years ago (LBJ Report 1982:12). As a developing nation, it is shifting from an agricultural to anindustrial focus and from a rural to urban population.Mexico's policy of strong investment in manufacturingactivities combined with that of promoting large scaleagricultural programs whereby the small landowner receiveslittle or no incentive has tended to emphasize the rural tourban shift.Still the rural population comprises a largesector of the populace; in 1976 it was estimated at thirty-seven pe.-cent of the total (LBJ Report 1982:17). The government expenditures in industrialization and massiveagricultural cooperatives have, in effect, resulted in theneglect of the rural unemployed and underemployed ( Kongas1972:1).In an effort to draw these people and other small,fledgling industrial sectors into the national marketeconomy, specialized programs aimed at hitting a certainlevel of the population have been implemented. Thispopulation level is comprised of those who previously existedon a peasant level of subsistence but have found itincreasingly difficult to do so in a structure requiring capital, technical:-kills and participation in the greatersociety Markin 1975:277).Economic development isclosely allied with those programs designed to improve social conditions. Itis generally recognized that the Mexican health structure hasfocused on the urban sector and ignored many of theprimary employment and subsistence problems that are such'314 307a pervasive feature of the rural poor (Canedo 1974) . Within the developing nation, the prevailing theory has been thatone of the products of industrialization and modernization isthe transition of lower classes into the lower middle andmiddle classes, an upward mobility trend. Mobility may notbe characterized so much by an overall increase in incomebut rather by enhanced opportunities for achieving certainhuman rights by having greater accessibility to health carefacilities, the educational structure and the communicationnetwork (Sjoberg 1967).The state of Hidalgo, Mexico, has been no exception.Indeed, in its proximity to Mexico City, It has functioned ina satellite relationship of dependence on the city furtherincreasing economic deprivation of the area's inhabitants(Canabal and Martinez 1973). Resources are exploited, e.g.,agricultural land, cement production. and are exported intothe capital city with an exchange for material goods, e.g.,television sets, clothing, toys, etc., that help to comprisethe peasant's perception of the outside world and furthersiphon off his/her scarce material resources in a mannerthat prohibits any investment in human resources (Kongas1972:2).Prior to 1972, Tula's major industry was cementproduction.The region remains as one of the primarycement producing areas of the republic. The cement factories have had a history of upheaval and revolutionconcomitant with national political movement. The factoriestoday are two distinctly different philosophically-orientedindustries.Cementos Cruz Azul is a cooperative ownedjointly by all of its Mexican employees. Housing, health care facilities and schooling are part of the benefit struc-ture.Cementos Tolteca is a British-owned firm with a strictcapitalist orientation.Most of its higher administration areforeigners while Mexicans are hired to occupy lower echelonpositions.Salary is higher across position at CementosTolteca than Cruz Azul, but the firm maintains a policy ofproviding housing for only upper level employees. Schoolingis not provided; Mexican workers send their children to thelocal schools, the foreign workers send theirs to privateschools.Both factories have however maintained similaremployment practices wherein positions are handed down 308through the family and the Mexican employee network offamilial kinship and comoadrazqo system have provided thelabor force.As far as other industrial occupations available in Tula,in 1972 the city of Tula had 46 :ndustrial establishmentsincluding food processing, textiles and machine repair thatemployed 1,000 workers.Another 1,000 were employed inthe cement factories (Lazama Escalante 1977) .The popula- tion of the city numbered nearly 40,000. There were only two individuals from E Tesoro employed on a permanentbasis at the cement factories, ineffect negating any possibility that this sector could be full-time working classparticipants in cement production.The cement factories are located to the south of thecity in an arid scrub region that characterizes much of theMezquital Valley.A number of features made this zone anattractive site for the placement of a thermoelectric plantto service Mexico City and an oil refinery, the largest inMexico to date.The area is not irrigated and was conse-quently largely unsuitable for agricultural purposes. Therewas a large, uninhabited expanse of land thereby eliminatingany problems of population displacement. The Tula River flows right through the city, providing a water source. Thecity of Tula itself had a significant degree of unemploymentand could provide the working population. Tula's proximity to Mexico City only enhanced the feasibility of the project(Lazama Escalante 1977).A major intention of the project as with other regionaldevelopment programs was to instigate industrial growth soas to improve social and economic conditions of the generalpopulace, health being a major element (Barkin 1975). i he hope was expressed that many of the chronic under andunemployed of Tula and its environs would secure jobs inthe new industrial zone and contribute to an increased flowof capital in the area. Many of those persons considered aschronic under or unemployed are the residents of El Tesoro.A similar program of industrialization to revive andrevitalize the regional economy was undertaken in southernHidalgo nearly thirty years ago. The program involved theconstruction of three manufacturing plants, one to buildboxcars and the other two to assemble automobiles. Its goal 309was to create5,000industrial jobs and to become a magnetfor attracting private industries to the area. It has sincebeen openly declared an economic and social failure (Kongas1972).Another regional development program sponsored bythe Mexican federal government was the TepalcatepecCommission which had similar goals of bringing the subsis-tence-oriented population into the mainstream of theMexican economy although it differed in that its primaryconcern was agricultural production. Methods involved the exploitation of the Tepalcatepec river basin, located in thestates of Michoacan and Jalisco about 200 miles west ofMexico City, in order to make available over two and a halftimes more acreage suitable for cultivation. The project canbe deemed successful if analyzed in terms of cost-benefitanalysis in that it yielded a thirteen percent return on thegovernment's capital investment. However, the target population, the rur-,I poor, have not been the recipients ofthe increased per capita income and in fact, the project mayhave served to further the disparity of social and economiccharacteristics between the lower and upper classes (Barkin1975).A similar regional development program, the ChontalpaPlan, with a much greater investment on the part of theMexican government, was undertaken to improve theagricultural production in the hot, humid region of Tabasco.It,as with the Tepalcatepec Commission, was designed tocreate more cultivatable land to modernize agriculturalprocedures while producing crops that would reap moreeconomic benefits than the traditional subsistence crops.Again, the program was successful in terms of increasedagricultural production.However, a study of nutritionalstatus of the population undertaken prior to the inceptionof the project, compared to the results from a studyundertaken thirteen years later, demonstrated that thepeasant nutritional status remained the same as did theirfinancial resources and position in society (Hernandez et al.1974).While these regional development programs outlinedabove differ from the Tula case in a number of ways, thesimilarity of approach, intent and method can be utilized toevaluate the effect of the high-technology industrialization317 310on the conditions and patterns of the El Tesoro inhabitants.Itis proposed that the industrialization and populationgrowth of the area contributed further to cementing thebroad gap of inequality between socioeconomic classes,specifically in terms or health status.DISCUSSIONThere are principally two schools of thought regardingthe most effective means of enhancing a population's health status by providing an adequate diet. One is that it is necessary to nave economic adjustment wherein people canafford to purchase the necessary foods (Hernandez et al.1974).Economic adjustment implies a host of otherconditions including improved housing and sanitary facili- ties, educational opportunities and ability to utilize medicalservices previously unavailable as a function of being unableto pay for them.Economic status also implies, to a great extent, socialstatus or an individual's position within the greater societyand the resources and opportunities that characterize thatposition.Behm et al. (1972:14), in discussing the unsatis-factory levels of health in Latin America, express the beliefthat \"...health is a dialectical, biological and social process which is the result of the integration of the individual andthe environment influenced Dy the relations of production ina given society and expressed in levels of well-being andphysical, mental and social efficiency\". Polgar's (1962) review of the literature on health in relationship to socialscience studies, makes a clear case for the correlationbetween socioeconomic conditions and health status.The second school of thought promoted as the best-method of improving a population's nutritional and thereforehealth status is that of cultural education whereby thetarget population learns to modify its food consumptionhabits so as to optimize dietary status (Chavez and Ramirez1963).While this opinion is expressed in terms of nutritionintake in their publication, it can be applied to consider thegeneral health status.Education infers a cultural pheno-menon, re-educating food habits so that they more closelyresemble those prevailing that are con idered to be adequatein providing the necessary nutritional components for a satisfactory diet.With respect to health practices, educa- 311tion signifies acculturation or changing existing habits tothose utilized by the culture at better health status.Gonzales and Behar (1966) discuss the effect of education onLatino perception of good health and its requirements.They argue that, because of increased education, the Latinohas come to conceive of food as a substance with nutritivequalities in varying magnitudes and characteristics. Health then, is directly related to the kinds of food one eats andhow much of it.Conversely, the authors state that amongstthe less acculturated indigenous population, \"...food wassomething one ate without too much concern as long as onewas healthy, but which was withheld when one became ill\"Gonzales and Behar 1966:77). In other words, the nutritivequalities of food are not recognized, only its role inmaintaining a harmonious balance within the body (Gonzalesand Scrimshaw 1957).This argument implies that even ifaccessibility to food and by inference, other health main-tenance factors had no limitations, the degree of accultura-tion would be a principal element in determining a popula-tion's health status.The argument seems fairly circuitous if one acknow-ledges that level of acculturation is virtually always highlyresponsive to economic status which in turn is directlyrelated to social position.As Hernandez et al. (1974:283)note, policies aimed at improving a population's healthstatus are more effective if they utilize both approaches ofincreasing socioeconomic conditions and accultural oreducational directives in combination. In analyzing thedevelopment process in South Asia countries, Gunnar Myrdal(1968) stresses that health is not a factor to be consideredin isolation from those other vital interacting variables oflevel of income, mode of living, dietary characteristics, etc.Any development program that has as one of its objectivesan elevation in health conditions cannot succeed unless ittakes into account the full range of interdependent factorsand makes appropriate policies to deal with them in amanner best suited to optimizing health conditions.A comprehensive, well-planned program appears not tohave yet been attempted in a large-scale regional develop-ment effort, which leaves some doubt as to what would bethe best approach to the matter. Indeed, the preponderanceof failures inregional development schemes in terms ofminimizing economic, social and political inequalities serves 31?.to illustrate the singular focus that many of these projectshad.With regard to the industrialization of the Tula deAllende economy and its objective of integrating the populace into a sophisticated and profitable technologically-oriented society with concomitant social and human rightbenefits, it is useful to discuss the failings of one of these projects in order to evaluate the Tula effort and its effect on the El Tesoro population.The Chontalpa Plan, as mentioned previously, was a key regional development program initiated in 1958 (Hernan-dez et al. 1974). The program was designed to improve theagricultural production of one of Mexico's most tropicalareas. Although the approach was purely economical, it wasassumed that the economic benefits would result in a number of other benefits, including an improvement in health conditions, particularly nutritional status.It was wen recognized that the area was characterized by a system of economic and social inequality, much as is the rest of the nation (LBJ Report 1982). Laborers who worked in agricultural production and self-subsistingpeasants were on the low end of the scale. Even amidst a rich, fertile agricultural zone, they were accustomed to suffering from the stresses of poverty including malnutritionand sickness.In order to evaluate the effectiveness of thedevelopment program in terms of integrating the poor into the economic system and reaping its benefits, dietetic andclinical analyses were undertaken in two different commu- nities. One analysis was conducted prior to the initiation ofthe program.A follow-up study was done thirteen years later, providing a reliable gauge of evaluating nutritionalchange as a result of development.Results showed population had increased as a conse- quence of immigration in search of greater job opportuni-ties, a depressed death rate and an increased birth rate. There was an apparent greater availability of food, whichwas attributed to the permanent rise in population. A Health Center had been established and there was a drop in the incidence and severity of the sanitation-related diseasessuch as diarrhea and parasites. More schools and businessesto serve the increased number and varied needs of thepopulations were established. Educational levels were greatly improved and greater consumption of capital goods 3211. 313was in marked evidence.Living conditions, generally, wereimproved with the implementation of electricity, financialaccess to better construction materials and communityresources to take care of such hygiene-threatening condi-tions as a stagnant swamp.While the above improvements seem to make for apicture of overwhelming success, a closer examination ofdietary patterns reveals that changes in nutritional :statuswherein overall food consumption increased, as well asriboflavin and vitamin A content were restricted to acertain segment of the population. Those persons who had displayed unsatisfactory nutrition levels prior to theproject's inception continued to do so. These personscomprised nearly one-third of the total population and were,of course, not the immigrants who came to work on theproject having the considerable skills to do su or themerchants and other professionals who serviced the needs ofa growing population.Instead, they were those who hadoriginally been the most econoldically and socially disadvan-taged.The gap of inequality, instead of merging closertogether, had spread even further.Hernandez et al. (1974:290) do not attempt to isolate asingular causal factor, but instead raise three questions asto why the economically and socially deprived remained inthe shadow of a regional economic development program.The three questions are: 1) Does the population sector notknow how to take advantage of development? 2) Were they denied any per capita increase as a result of the expandeddemographic base?3) Were they prevented from anyparticipation in the development scheme? The authors agreethat the most likely explanation is a combination of all three factors.There is a distinct parallelism of contributing factorsto the El Tesoro situation.Certainly, the demographic baseexpanded considerably with a jump from nearly 140,000 in1972 to 60,000 in 1980.The installation and operation oftwo highly sophisticated industries required a large numberof skilled workers.The majority immigrated from otherplaces, e.g., Veracruz, where they had gained previousworking experience.Even those positions that required nospecifically trained skills were in construction and involveduse of heavy machinery and equipment. The vast majority 32-1- .9.314of the peasant population, by virtue of education and classassociation, have had no similar work experience or evenaccessibility to it.Consequently, El Tesoro residents lostany opportunity of obtaining employment in either thePEMEX refinery or the thermoelectric plant to a newlyimmigrated populace that had the necessary skills andexperience.In accordance with Mexico's official organization of ahealth care delivery system, a clinic was built in Tula andstaffed by PEMEX to serve the employees of the federallyowned and operated refinery. Other health facilities alreadyestablished in Tula included a hospital run under theauspices of the Institute of Social Security, a privatelyowned clinic used primarily for childbirth as well as threeor four private physicians.To meet the demands of alarger population, a number of other physicians haveestablished practices as have private clinics and pharmacies.Certainly, these services and an increase in general percapita income have aided to improve health conditions forthe general population of Tula. However, the residents of El Tesoro, because of their unemployability, are not coveredby any means of social security and therefore are noteligible to be treated at any of these facilities. Plus, a low cash income prohibits them from utilizing private services inanything other but emergency circumstances.Ostensibly, any Mexican not covered by Social Securityin some ray is eligible to receive health care benefits fromthe Ministry of Health Assistance which is responsible fornearly eighty percent of the population (LBJ Report1982:54).Although it is responsible for the majority of thenation's population, in reality the Ministry of Health cannotrealistically provide adequate services as its resources areSeverely limited through a maldistribution of medicalpersonnel, equipment and funding. In an analysis of the development progress in Mexico and its results in health,the University of Texas Lyndon B. Johnson School of PublicAffairs Report to the Agency for International Development,gave the estimate that nearly one-third of the Mexicanpopulation cannot, through inaccessibility or ineligibility orcultural barriers, receive health care benefits from anygovernment health organization or private physicians (LBJReport1982:59). 315Even though the El Tesoro inhabitants are in the midstof a rapidly urbanizing setting marked by a high techno-logy-oriented economic system, they are still barred fromentering the system and becoming recipients of badly neededsocial services and benefits. Consequently, while suchprojects as improving water sanitation or instituting school-wide innoculation programs may be undertaken as a by-product of community-wide urbanization, the populationsector, most at risk because of the nutritional status andleast able to receive full advantage of these programs,remains in the semi-isolated position that they were in priorto industrialization.In comparison, the gap becomes evenmore demarcated and the pervasive strain of inequalitybecomes more mired in the financial, social and political development of the city.A decrease in infant mortality rates, while significant inits own right, does not proclaim a population's emergencefrom one beset by primary health care problems to onecharacterized by the chronic disease sufferers of a well-feddeveloped nation's population. The failure of fertility and malnutrition rates to drop indicate a lack of the dissolutionof the strong basis of inequality that is so important indetermining level of education, employment opportunities,chance for social mobility and health features (Teller et al.1979).In addition, the strength of cultural beliefs withrespect to appropriateness of patterns of health careutilization and dietary characteristics is an elemental factorin a population's health status and is intrinsically related tosocial and economic levels. As Benyouseff and Wessen (1974:301) demonstrate, poverty can be a deterrent to theutilization of health services in at least four ways:1)inadequate financial resources to pay for services renderedand/or medication plus transportation fees and other costsincurred while visiting the physician or health care facility;2) social factors that prohibit the individual from feelingcomfortable in seeking institutionalized health care or thatdeem the utilization appropriate; 3) logistic barriers whereinfacilities are just not accessible and; 4) attitudinal factorswherein an individua. s conception of his/her health and thefactors that are related toit do not allow him/her theability to utilize health care facilities and/or services.33 316Gould(1960, 1965)discusses the implications oftechnological change in the utilization of Western healthsystems and the medical beliefs of a village in northernIndia. Much of hin discussion revolves around the peasant's flexibility in adapting to certain features of the \"newmedicine\" while maintaining many of the features of thefolk or \"village medicine.\" A principal issue raised is thedirect relationship between economic abundance and thetendency to resort to Western medicine. Those deterrents described by Benyouseff and Wessen (1974)are entirely fitting in this Indian case as in the El Tesoro situation.Flexibility is often a function of economic adaptability andmobility wherein educational levels, exposure to modernized system or urbanization and technological capabilities are allcontributing factors.While industrialization proceeds, as inthe introduction of the refinery and the thermoelectric plantill Tula, itis apparent that a number of cultural characte-ristics are related to health change. For example, diversityof foods consumed and variety of the methods of prepara- tion increase as a result of urbanization (Chassy et al.1967).So, too does acceptance of modern medical techni-ques (Wolff1965).However, the dominating principle, asdemonstrated by the failure of the regional economicdevelopment programs, in integrating the peasant into theeconomic mainstream and consequently elevating theconditions that are related to health, is the denial of whatthe peasant actually is in relation to the larger society.The relationship is historically and presently largelydetermined by economic factors and the whole social realmof resource availability and utilization that is intrinsicallytied to the economic foundations. CONCLUSIONThere are numerous published arguments on health improvement programs and their effectiVeness. The main theme appears to be in pointing out how and where theyfail.Sai (1963:213)states that the fundamental problem inimproving health and nutrition standards in developingcountries is the inadequacy of human resources. He makes a plea for aid to be given by developed nations to thoseless developed.Conversely, Brown (1966)cites a common failure to be the propensity for importing inappropriateWestern medical models replete with highly specialized and321 317expensive procedures, facil.ties and methods. The auLhor deMes such an approach and cautions that the process ofhealth is a long and arduous one. Taylor and Hall (1967) delve into the complexities of the problem, noting thatthere is no problem in international health as important oras poorly understood as the finely woven interrelationshipbetween health, population growth and economic growth.These interrelating factors are often ignored in the formula-tion of development programs in favor of focusing onincreased production, utilizing the economic premise thatelevated cash incomes will generate better health/nutritionalconditions (Fleuret and Fleuret 1980).It is all too apparent, both in the published literatureand in observation of such cases as El Tesoro, that thepeasant population, the group most susceptible to poorhealth conditions, has received very little benefit from theindustrialization/modernization processes that held as theiraim an integration of the disadvantaged sector into themainstream of the economy. Thiesenhusen (1980:129) states,11... what is important in the economic pattern that has emerged is that in Latin America today there is still little upward mobility in the system, if by that is meant opportu-nity for those at the bottom of the socioeconomic structureto rise to responsible positions in strata above them. And because of the astounding rate of population growth sinceWorld War II there are probably more poor and illiterate inLatin America now than at mid-century.\" The population under examination here only supports such dire forecasting.The impact of the introduction of two high-technologyoriented industries into the area has only resulted in afurther disparity of inequality between the social classes ofTula, Hidalgo.El Tesoro residents have not been assimi-lated into the economic system and have not been able toimprove health conditions through accessibility to healthcare services, greater financial resources or significantimprovements in environmental conditions. Perhaps most disheartening is that they have become more aware of themodern system of medical care and the benefits it can have,but yet are resigned to having little accessibility to it. 325 318REFERENCESAdams, R. and A.

INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY :THE CASE OF THE MICROCOMPUTER IN THETHIRD WORLD. COLONIAL PLOT ORAPPROPRIA\",:. TECHNOLOGY? WILLIAM E. BERTRANDTulane University The issue of economic and cultural dependency as aresult of the transfer of new technologies from the deve-loped to the developing world is an old anl much discussedone.Central to the arguments on both sides is the ideathat the complex technology developed in the Northcountries creates more difficulties than solutions for theSouth countries that adopt it. The opposite tenet deals with the need to rtk e capital intensive research availablei.o the Third World nations in the form of new products ofpotential benefit to their growth and development. The answer most often posited is one which throws the respon-sibility of the country in question, i.e. let the locals decidewhat is really good for them. In much the same spirit of generating community participation In many social welfareinterventions, this method is only as :nod as the community325333 326of host country experts that are recruited to approve or disapprove the introduction of the new technology.Unfortunately, no judge, jury or other absolute standardexists to help adjudicate the selective impact of differenttechnologies.Our focus in this article is directed towardsdeveloping a conceptual framework and suggesting a methodology by which such an evaluation can be carried out.The technology in question is the microcomputer,which meets the criteria of capital intensive technology.Due to the relatively recent arrival of the microcom-puter in the developing world and to certain inherentdifficulties with the evaluation of technology diffusion, theobservations that we present are currently limited to case studying.Several authors have commented on the case study as an appropriate methodology for the evaluation ofnew technologies, since the controlled observation of largerrandom samples is difficult and appropriate observationalmethodologies are lacking (Rice 1984;Johnston1984). Rogers (1983) observed that only three percent of innova-tion/diffusion research reports reviewed were concerned with the consequences of innovation and attributed the small amount of impact oriented studies to three issues:1.That diffusion/ innovation research funding agencies hada vested interest in promoting the innovation withlittls concern for the impact. 2.That normal survey techniques were inappropriate for measuring consequences of interventions. 3.That consequences per se are difficult to measure as opposed to a rate of innovation (pp. 378-379).If these observations hold for all of innovation/diffus-ion research, they are particularly true in the case of the microcomputer with only a few years of experience in thedeveloping countries to guide us. THE MICROCOMPUTER'S POTENTIALAs the nations of the world become more economically interdependent the r aed for technology to generate, analyze,and communicate in:ormation of all sorts is more critical. 327For less developed nations the problem of data analysis andinformation processing has always been crucial. Even the most basic fiscal and personnel data needed for the manage-ment of the nation state is not available. In more advanced developing nations complex data management tasks such asnational census or survey activities have been a virtual impossibility without massive technical and economic'assistance.The advent of the large and costly computer allowedsome of the more wealthy institutions in the developingworld to purchase and to use information processingequipment with the attendant problems of high-pricedmaintenance and personnel that went along with it. With the appearance of the microcomputer the problems of initialcost and the issue of training and maintenance have begunto take a back seat to the perceived value of thesemachines in the developing world. The first benefits were obvious in the area of financial and project management(Ingle, Berge, and Hamilton 1985).Here the routine jobs of accounting, project planning and management were greitlyfacilitated by having low cost and accessible informationprocessing power. Another documented impact of microcom-puter technology in the Third World has been in the designand execution of various kinds of studies and surveys (Bertrand1985).While the research, development, and managementfunctions of the technology seem to have an important placein overall assessment of the utility of the microcomputer inthe Third World, there are new applications which hold even greater promise. In the area of education the combination ofmicrocomputer technology and optical disks promise to makemassive amounts of information available to any user at very low costs.Interactive software combined with videohas the potential to make certain training functions very inexpensive.Software for the diagnosis of routine medicalproblems by paraprofessionals is available and will soon be tested (Auvert et al. 1986).The list of potential applica- tions is enormous and advocates of this new technology are enthusiastic about the transfer of capital and technologyfrom the First to the Third World nations.While the author must count himself among theproponents of this spread of techno:Jy, it is time to take a t 328slightly more aseptic view of its potential and to lay thegroundwork for user oriented evaluation of its impact. If such an evaluation proves to be negative, then thesenegative implications and findings need to be known beforemajor investments are made. Given the recent collapse ofthe consumer microcomputer market in the developedcountries and their tradition of dumping overproduction inthe poor nations, the possible risk of unwise investments isparticularly great at the current time. THE CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORKThe nature of the spread of technology--includingtractors, drugs, managerial systems, etc. -has been a muchdocumented and researched question over the years. Most of that research has been directed towards the study of hownew technologies are adopted and to what extent theyimprove the quality of life or productivity (Rogers 1983).With respect to the developing world there are two tradi-tions of looking at the transfer of technology. One mirrorsthe more classical developed national approach of innovationadoption focusing on the characteristics of individuals andsocieties as they adopt new technology, and, as a secondorder activity, the impact of the innovation itself. The second approach is a more politicized position which holdsthat the transfer of technology, particularly high tech items,is simply a sophisticated form of colonialism and thatdeveloping countries should avoid it at all costs. While this position and its many variants has a certain face validity,there is little evidence to suggest that many countries useit to guide policy.There it, much more evidence to suggestthat developed countries may not make their most advancedtechnology available to the developing world for a varietyof reasons. The kindest interpretation of this trend may bethe enlightened self-interest approach which Europe hasincreasingly adopted.For the purpose of our presentationhere we assume that any model involving multinationalbusiness and the transfer of technology from capitalist orsocialist North nations to the South will be at best underthe terms of enlightened self interest. This by definition puts the South countries at a disadvantage because of theirlack of capital resources, a particular problem in theproduction and utilization of microelectr --'c and informationtechnology. 3 J0 329The idea of treating information and informationprocessing equipment as a new technology does not consti-tute an innovative approach to the study of the developingworld (Soedjatmoko 1985).There have been many dis-cussions of both the positive and negative implications ofcommunication technology in general, and recently thesediscussions have drifted over to the world of microcom7puters and their spread to developing countries (Darrow andSaxenian1985).What is still missing is a set of models andmethodologies to evaluate the impact of informationtechnologies of which the microcomputer is but one case.The value statement which best reflects our startingpoint is taken from Soedjatmoko (1985).He refers to development as a process \"...Which is essentially a learningprocess....which succeeds when a society as a whole at alllevels learns to make optimal use of its resources throughthe application of science and technology towards improvingthe daily lives of its citizens in ways that are consonantwith their basic values and aspirations\" (p.16).The microcomputer is an appropriate technology therefore, if itsuse improves the daily lives of Third World citizens,according to their own criteria, and with a minimum ofunintended consequences.The net effect should be a positive one but we must be particulary careful as potentialevaluators in guarding the idea of cultural relativism as weconsider unanticipated consequences from a given innovation(Goss 1979).Without getting into the morass of defining aglobal quality of life indicator, itis acceptable to look at health and health service delivery as our point of departure.There are massive differences between the North and Southcountries in terms of objective measures of morbidity andmortality.The solutions to many of the problems areknown but the resources are not available to deliverservices or care.If we can see a major positive impact inthe health sector,itisat least a working argument forother interventions involving the microcomputer. While the ultimate impact should be on morbidity and mortality thereare several health intervention strategies where requests arewell enough known in the short term so that we can assumethat effective process indicators will be translated intoimpact. 309 330Thus a general model posited for an evaluation of theimpact of microcomputers on productivity of the healthsector in a given country would look like the followingmodel. INDIVIDUAL AND INSTITUTIONAL CASE STUDIES:REASONS FOR OPTIMISMAs we have indicated earlier, the general observationsof a case study presented by the proponents of an innova-tion tend to focus on the positive side of the adoption andof its impact.The case studies that we present here arecertainly in that category.While they are notable for theirpreliminary success we also observe the possibility for anumber of points of conflict and of potential negativeeffects.An evaluation which shows, greater than expectednegative results might cause the leaders of certain develop-ing nations to reconsider carefully increased adoption anduse of the new technology.While there are few indicationsthat this is happening with the introduction of the micro-computer, the potential for positive or negative results issufficiently high that we should begin to consider theframework and methodology needed to measure it. The following individual and ins'itutional case studies areintended to provide the qualitative framework for theformalization of an objective evaluation design.As per Figure 1there are at least two levels wherethe microcomputer, as an information technology, can beimportant in increasing productivity. The first is at the individual level where capital intensively trained pro-fessionals are often trapped by resource and bureaucraticconstraints, unable to effectively use their advancedtraining.At this individual level the established correlatesof education, socioeconomic status and individual modernity,or to use Roger's term, cosmopoliteness, are predictive ofwho first adopts the microcomputer whatever the impact ofthis adoption might be.Our first case is at this individual level. It i3 the case of a young medical professional returning to theministry of health of a Central African country after3.:io Different Areas ofApplicationFIGURE 1Evaluation Model of Impact of Microcomputer inHealth Sector in Developing Countries Correlates o: lnnovativeness Interveningin Use of Micro-Computer Variablein the Health Field (Independent Variables)Consequences of Innovations (Old Dependent (New Dependent Variable)Variable) - Health Planning,Surveillance - Hospital Administration- Family Planning - Nutrition, PrimaryHealth Care Vaccination Control- Vector Control- Environmental Health Adopted (1938:376)Individual 1.Education Institutional 4.Improved of life Dysfunctional, Indirect orLatent Consequences 1.Greater expense 2.Need for more capital 3.Less equitable distribution ofincome, or other resources 4.Concentration of power 332obtaining a Master's degree in the United States. While in the States, he was trained in mainframe computer methodsand felt for a number of reasons that such was inappro- priate technology for his country. This was in the early 1980's.Upon returning to his country he found, like manycapable energetic professionals, that with no support staff and no equipment to work with, he was spending most of his time doing trivial administrative tasks. When he did have the opportunity to put his analytical powers to work, the quality and quantity of the data available was so poor that he lost confidence in the results. Furthermore, his colleagues felt that he was bringing foreign ideas back tohis home country. Since the methods and techniques he hadlearned were to a certain extent technology and dataoriented, and these technologies were not available in the local environment, the critiques directed toward him were somewhat justified.In 1985 through the auspices of an internationally financed project in primary health care a microcomputer with attendant software was made available to the young professional.Given the similarity of the new equipmentwith what he had been trained on, he immediately picked up the essentials of how to work with the machine and beganto use it to assist in the routine technical tasks associatedwith his job. These tasks included simple word processing,financial reporting and budget development using spread-sheets.He reported that the initial increase in productivitycreated a certain amount of resentment in some of hiscolleagues who felt he was making them look bad.At the end of several months another project providedequipment to put in place within the Ministry of Health.Moving into the area of management he began to develop a number of data bases that were important to the country'shealth sector activities.Shortly he developed around thissingle microcomputer the first complete census of health personnel in the country since independence. This major task was undertaken and completed without special financialresources and in a record period of time. Whn at the timeof the interview this process of microcomputerization of theyoung professional's activity had only been going on for aperiod of eighteen months, his prior skepticism about theutility of compziting equipment in the Third World hadcompletely vanished.He felt that due to the presence of3/i() 333the microcomputer he had personally been able to make adifference in the activities of his unit. By virtue of his ability to provide needed information to his superiors forplanning and budgeting he thought that his own career andjob satisfaction had been improved. By the same token many of his critical colleagues seemed to accept theexplanation that he had been aided by a machine and fe cless threatened thanif the young professional or someexpatriate team had achieved such accomplishments withoutthe help of what they perceived to be an impersonalmachine.By decreasing the time and cost of data collection andprocessing at the Ministry of Health and by providingneeded data for the planning and execution of nationalprograms it became clear to a number of observers that themarginal extra cost of four to five thousand dollars hadvastly increased the productivity of a single professionalwho already represented the investment of 45 plus thousanddollar s for his master's degree and an unknown but signifi-cant amount for his medical training. In the short term he was unable to identify any negative aspects of the tech-nology intervention with the possible exception of thenormal dangers of becoming visible in a bureaucracy, andsuffering the attacks of those whose turf was threatened.How much of this professional's performance is due to hisspecial case or to personal characteristics is of courseimpossible to ascertain at this moment. itis equally uncertain as to the longer-term effects of what he s c'7,tingand whether these effects will continue to be evaluated aspositive.The immediate results however, are positiveenough to suggest that an experimental trial be set upwhere a certain number of young professionals in developingcountries be given access to microcomputing equipment andtraining, and their performance compared with that of theircolleagues who do not have such access. The hypotheses would be that their productivity would be increased to suchan extent that this would be one of the most cost produc-tive interventions possible in terms of providing theequivalent of more highly trained personnel to the develop-ing countries. 341 334DEVELOPING A NATIONAL HEALTH PLANNING MODELThe first case served to emphasize the more traditional benefits of introducing microcomputers into an individual level information intensive environment, i.e.relying on greatly increased data processing speed and c.apability. There is another similar set of economics which are best illustrated by a second example. In this case the microcom- puter was used as the catalyst for the introduction of a planning cell at the Ministry of Health and Human Affairs in the Sahel, one of the lower income areas in the world. When the microcomputerwas first suggested as a possibletool to be utilized within the Ministry, there was almost universal opposition there. The technology was consideredto be too sophisticated, complex, and difficult to maintain in the harsh desert environment to be helpful in the context of a resource poor ministry.The proponents of the use of microcomputers argued that it was precisely due to the lack of resources available to the Ministry thatit was imperative that the bestdecisions possible be made regarding the allocation of scarce resources.The results in the first eighteen months of project activity have been major and again almost com- pletely positive.The first step in understanding what to develop into an information system for the microcomputer is the informa-tion audit.This is the design activity that occurs prior to making decisions about what should be programmed into the computer.When this information auditwas conducted at the MinistryHealth there were a number of ratherstartling findings.There was no full listing of personnelcurrently employed by the Ministry, nor was an inventory of capital equipment, suchas vehicles, available.Tho reason :nadequate records were kept was a lack, of resources andmanpower necessary to maintain them. However, the potential for waste and mismanagement due to the lack of up-to-date knowledge was enormous.As a part of the information audit, an inventory of forms currently utilizedin the collection of data in thefield was developed.This listing indicated thatover 100 different pieces of paperwere being filled out at some stagein the public health service system. The result of the342 335proliferation of paper was that ..n extraordinary amount ofduplication was taking place. In addition, it was estimated that up to VA of the time of primary health care personnelwas spent filling out forms.Another similar problem was that the informationcollected on the numerous forms at all levels of the Ministry was not utilized in an efficient manner. The majordifficulty was the lag time between the collection of dataand its being consolidated and presented to anyone whomight have access to resources needed to bring about someaction.This was particularly evident in 'Le telex/cablebased epidemic reporting system in the Mi .. ywhere the information arrived to central collection points in a rathertimely fashion, but was never collated quickly enough inorder to make decisions regarding the presence or absenceof an epidemic.When this system was finally put into asimple base on the microcomputer it was discovered that anepidemic had been underway during the last few months butdue to the slow processing of data no one had noticed intime to take any corrective action.The example cited represents a rather classic situ tionwhich might be considered typical of traditional approachesto a series of problems for which information is collectedand needs to be utilized.The necessity of organizing andsystematizing information required for efficient use of themicrocomputer can itself be the basis for major reformswithin a ministry.For example, the simple step of theenumeration of the number and type cf different datacollection instruments and forms use,, by the primary healthcare system provided an important tool for rationalizing adata based management program. If such demands can beinstalled as part of the impersonal and supposedly objet iverequirements of computerizing and updating an informationsystem, then so much the better.It was the need to analyze and organize the types andquantity of data to be introduced into a computerizedsystem which first produced positive results in the institu-tional structure of the Mi:-.:stry of I-1,i!alth. These positive results were initiated by a demand for more information:firstly in the area of record ke-oing for personnel manage-ment, secondly to develop logistic control, and finally, toprocess quickly within the Ministry special study data.343 336One of the first requirement for institutional planningis a sound idea of the resources actually under the controlof decision makers.Therefore, when the initial informationaudit revealed that the Ministry of Health did not have acomplete listing of its own personnel and equipment it was decided to prepare a list as a prerequisite for developing an action plan. Two data bases were designed, developed, andultimately put into service on the microcomputers. One of these listed and tracked personnel in the Ministry and theother did the same with the Ministry transport system.Both of these applications were developed in a second orderdata base manager,Knowledgeman, and were immediatelyput into service by the Ministry of Health personnel.Report began to be generated on a regular basis for theconsumption of higher level officials with positive results.The Secretary General of the Ministry saw the advantage ofhaving this data available at his fingertips. He had the planning cell, where all of the microcomputer based dataprocessing had taken place, put under the direct control ofhis office.This was an important step for the projectwhich was designed to develop a planning and managementcapacity for the Ministry.Planning information was thenavailable at the highest level of routine decision making.Expatriate project personnel began to be consulted as to thetype of information that should be utilized; and the imageof the planning cell improved within the institution. It should be noted at this point that the initial activity citedhere has been due to the presence of an expatriate projectteam brought in with the explicit purpose of introducingmicrocomputer driven planning. The argument can be made that only with this capital intensive push could such a thinghappen and that it will fall apart as soon as the expatriatesleave.While this is an empirical question which can onlyreallya answered with time and observations, there aresome indication that the local staff are completely able touse and manage the equipment. The time logged by local professionals on the microcomputers has increased consider-able and their enthusiasm for training and further exposureto the equipment has improved as they see the applicationsbeing developed.The second funcCon of the microcomputer in thisenvironment, which added as much or more to the overallinstitutionalization of information based planning, was in thedomain of data processing for small surveys. The traditional3 337approach, before the advent of the microcomputer, was thata census or a study would be introduced and data collectedby field teams.At this point the physical information inthe form of completed questionnaires or sometimes encodeddata would be taken to a mainframe computer where thedata was analyzed, written up and brought back to theMinistry in the form of a report. In the smallest and poorest of countries this took place outside the nation'sboundaries while in the larser countries at the CensusBureau or National Finance Ministry where there was usuallya computer with available data processing. As a result, datawas almost always delayed for these special studies whichgenerally had a very poor reputation except as academicexercises.Two examples from this country case n-oved theexception to this rule and provided further evidence of theutility of microcomputers.The first involved a prestigiousUnited States based agency which conducted a nationwidenutritional surveillance survey with the express purpose oftesting if drought conditions prevalent in the country at thetime were antecedent to the declaration of a nutritionalemergency.The data for this survey were returned to theUnited States for processing and due to competing priori-ties, were not returned in report form for several months.The Minister of Health in the meantime received numerousrequests regarding the data and as the presence of a faminebecame more obvious, he began to ask the internal Ministryof Health microcomputer staff if something could be done.A report was finished inless than two weeks and theresults presented in preliminary form to the Minister. This was accomplished by utilizing the combination of softwaremade available for nutritional standard calculation by theCenters for Disease Control in the United States andcommercially available statistical processing packages. The Minister's pride at having the ability to do this within hisown organization combined with a real need for theinformation resulted in a very positive evaluation as to theimportance of the microcomputer in the organization.A second example of the same nature involved theexecution of a national morbidity and mortality survey forthe Minister as the first national effort to establish somebase line parameters for progress in improving health. Thisis always a major data collecting exercise involving survey345 338work over a large geographic area and later the analysis ofdata in a timely and appropriate manner.While many of these studies had been undertaken in more advanced developing countries vei y few had produced results in less than eighteen months from survey start and some required longer periods before a final analysis was' available. The study cited here was in and out of the field and had prepared a preliminary report which was subsequently accepted and distributed by the Ministry in less than six months.Data processing was managed on hard disk equipped microcomputers and resulted in some major changes in Ministry policy almost immeciiatety.The reinforcement provided by the two related small study examples cited began to move the Ministry of Healthtowards accepting the technology and the idea of using microcomputers as the basis for decision making within the institution.Within eighteen months the environment hadchanged from one where the use of microcomputers was considered too %..ull,F.-Aicated a technology, to one where the Minister was interested in having access to his own microcomputer for information management within his office. The technology had clearly served as a tool by which it became the timely use of data for decision making within the environment of the Ministry.The introduction of computerized data processing in the environment of an information poor Ministry of Public Health served to stimulate the demand for more information. It also provided a catalyst for a snore systematic approach to the organization of data within the Ministry. There are, however, some less than desirable attributes to this parti- cular blending process which need to be mentioned. The control of information in any formal organization is often perceived to be tantamount to the control of power.It is, therefore, quite logical that when information is made more accessible, some middle and top level managers feel threa- tened.This was the case in this exper:ence and some care should be taken to ameliorate and work through this problem.By the same token thereare sume people who are truly computerphobic and one encounters real blocks in the attempt to train these individuals. While our own experience is that it is possible to overcome this problem, 342 339in most cases it will create stresses in the functioning ofthe new system.The presence of expatriate trainers or change agents inthis environment has the effect of exacerbating some ofthese problems and making others less difficult. For example, fears about what will be done with collectedinformation are compounded with expatriates in charge.However, training is usually easier to accept from indivi-duals who are not personally involved in the work placedynamics and this includes expatriates. On the balance,however, the above problems are inheres It in any changeoriented process and the introductio of microcomputet driven information systems is only a slightly more exagge-rated example of the generic case.As both of these case studies indicate it is possible tosee major improvements in process by the introduction of amicrocomputer.While these are admittedly examples thatwere notable for their success, and there are undoubtedlymany computers lying unused in offices in the Third World,the major questions to be addressed on the issue are thefollowing:1) Are the benefits from this technology greaterthan the possible costs? and 2) How might one go aboutmaximizing that difference? INDICATORS FOR INSTITUTIONAL AND INDIVIDUALMEASUREMENT OF MICROCOMPUTER IMPACT ONPRODUCTIVITYThis next stage in developing our evaluative frameworkinvolves specification of indicators and an evaluationmethodology.Since most of the indicators are genericenough to be used in both institutional and individualsituations it is these more general guidelines that we firstpresent.There are few, if any, circumstances in which micro-computer based information systems have been installed forover a two-year period, making long-term evaluationsimpossible at this time. The measures that we suggest herewill make possible such long-term impact studies, as thetime and experience related to applications increases.3,4,? 340While the criteria of indicators are relatively well established, some creativity needs to be exercised indeveloping new non-obtrusive measures of the technology'simpact.We would suggest the following as a start in that direction:1.Amount of time saved in processing routinely collectedinformation.Time is the oldest and perhaps the best indicatorof improved performance.If one can do the same or abetter job in a decreased period of time it is almostalways a positive event.Here we would need to listall prior routinely collected data and classify it as to the time required to process and compile information,both before and after the introduction of the micro-computer based information system.2.Amount of time saved in processing special studies.This isa subset of the above and would betreated in the same manner. Special studies are a part of every large organization and the time needed to process them is critical to their utility. Take a sample of special studies before and after the installation of a microcomputer capability.Compare the time requiredfrom project inception to final report production.3.Increase in number of requests for information fromdata sources.An indicator for data from the statistical orinformation processing unit. The number of requestscould be monitored before and after the introductionof the microcomputer activity.4.Increase in the number of decisions that can be tracedto data generated by the new system.As 4) increases, 5) should increase as well. Themethodology used would require tracking the individualrequesting the data, and following up several months(4-6) later to discover if a decision resulted from theuse of the information. 34J 3415.Increase in the level of support due to the ability topresent well organized and up to date information.This may be better placed in the long-termcategory, however, because it refers to a budget increase for the data processing unit in order to meetdemand.This is easily quantifiable and obtainablebefore and after the introduction of the microcomputer.6.Increase in use of microcomputers to analyze andprocess data at all levels of an institution.Again a simple log system would show the amountof time us'by each unit or individual requestingservice....e time should go up and could then be usedas a correlate of change which migI-,t take place in thesub unit.The elements of the above could be incorporated in anencounter sheet for the use of information services. Thissheet would identify:the initiating person and departmentof the request, the type of request, if the request is relatedto routinely collected data or to a special study, the type ofoutput requested, the person processing the data within theunit, the amount of time required to process it, what levelof analysis was required, what level of presentation wasrequired and other identifying data using data, time, orother criteria.It would also be useful to note the back-ground characteristics of the individual requesting theinformation such as position, age, education and in parti-cular if the individual had been exposed to prior informa-tion-related or microcomputer training, so that we canassess at what level the addition of microcomputers providesthe benefit.In general, the increase in the amount of informationavailable to make a given decision will improve the qualityof that decision.If the decision maker has received veryadvanced training, then by improving his/her personalproductivity you have increased the potential for action.Health in the developing world is one of the areas wherecapital intensive professionals are used in many administra-tive tasks without sufficient logistic support. it is there-fore reasonable to suspect that if use of the microcomputercan improve the productivity of these professionals or make 31,1 342the task such that a lower level person can do it with equalproficiency, then other parameters for positive evaluationhave been set.Here we might suggest the following kindsof individual level observations.There has been little research on the role of theindividual profession&I in a resource scarce environment.Many well trained individuals upon returning to theircountry move into higher levels of administration fairlyquickly. Since they often lack the support structure neededto effectively apply their skills to problems solving theyrepresent an optimal target for the introduction of themicrocomputer.The whole philosophy of putting thecomputer's power at the service of the individual isconsistent with the concept of drastically increasingproductivity among that group of individuals that representa truly scarce resource for many developing countries. In order to adequately measure this productivity certain of theparameters set earlier for institutions obviously apply. Timesavings noted in accomplishing routine tasks may be moreimportant to the highly trained professional or technician interms of making more c.f his/her specialized skill availableto the employer organization. In the areas of scientific and social research the microcomputer may make productivitypossible for the first time at all levels for certain indivi-duals.This would be translated into the improved quantityand quality of research, particularly applied and operational,and would also produce more requests for data.Other individual parameters are important to monitor.Clearly the cost of equipment and training and its relationto our hypothesized productivity increase need to beconsidered.While in theory the proliferation of microcom-puter equipment should result in a areater and more openuse and availability of information the potential for thereverse to happen is present. Will certain individuals takeadvantage of the availability of information processingpower to try to control bureaucratic resources?Finally, at the individual level we are confronted withthe confounding elements of individual innovation andadoption of new technology.Here the literature is clearthat the characteristics of the first round of adopters arequite different from those of later users of the sametechnology.In designing our interventions and experiments 343this factor needs to be controlled in order to measure the technology's impact. OTHER DESIGN CONSIDERATIONSWhile the full development of study protocols goes . beyond the purposes of this paper the direction should beclear.Process or so-called formative evaluation needs tomove forward at both the organizational and the institu-tional levels.The designs suggested are of a longitudinal nature based upon organizational management informationsystems for institutions and formal organizations. Here indicators such as those suggested would be monitoredbefore the introduction of the technology and then at several points during the life cycle of the technologyintroduction.Since the indicators are general measures of organizational efficiency it is appropriate to include them as part of a more generalized management audit activity. As the number of observations increases, with time there shouldbe data sufficient to judge the utility of the intervention.Less easy to measure will be the possible negative effects ofmicrocomputer introduction. Perhaps external observers should be used to periodically review differe n..,rganizationand individual changes presumed to be caused by theintroduction of the new technology.With individual process improvements we are concep- tually closer to impact evaluation. Here the impact of increased investment in training, etc., is measured by theimprovement in productivity in the organization. More classic summative quasi-experimental designs would seem also appropriate here. A group of individuals could be chosen at random at different levels of the Ministry and randomlyassigned to groups given or not given access to microcom- puters.Observations would be generated by the monitoringof normal management information and individual measures of productivity.Summaries of productivity would then bekept and compared between the control and experimentalgroup at pre-established periods. Once these measures of process are established, it should then be possible to move to the next stage of evaluation, that of evaluating theimpact on the populations served of improved informationsystems driven by the microcomputer. Impact evaluations would be based on the objectives of the organization served35J.. 3414by the microcomputer system. In the case of healthministries this would be an increased rate of improvement invital health indices for the population.Measurement of impact is the point of marriagebetween the management information system and the highlycomplex models and information needed to evaluate theimpact of these interventions. Using the health field as anexample, we find that it is true that general solutions tomost public health problems in developing countries areknown at the individuallevel(i.e., vaccine preventablediseases are controlled with vaccination programs). Yet,there have been millions of dollars spent without muchresult in an attempt to delineate the relative impact ofcompetitive interventions ( i . e . , does an agricultural interven-tion improve nutritional status faster than a family planningprogram?).This is due primarily to the tremendouscomplexity of the models that, at the societal level, affecthealth status and the quality of life.Most of the traditional experimental models utilized todate in impact evaluations of health and social serviceinterventions have, therefore, resulted in inconclusive resultsor often no results tt.can be attributed directly to theintervention.The exceptions to this rule are those inter-ventions, such as vaccination programs, where the physicalevent,if properly carried out, has an immediate andirreversible effect.Yet,itcould be argued that the inability to public health researchers to attribute specificpositive impacts to given programs may be as much due toproblems with field methodology and design issues as withthe programs themselves.The microcomputer appears to have the raw informa-tion processing ability to allow us to do in this area ofhuman enterprise what the microscope did for the biologist.It may offer the capacity to collect enough informationwhich would allow us to see, in the statistical sense, howthe conglomerate of variables that affects human quality oflife will behave, for what may be the first time. This will be accomplished through an increase in the number ofobservations and an increase in the standardization of fieldmethods.The microcomputer both limits the introduction ofvariance into our models and gives us the added power ofgreatly increased observations for causal analysis. The 345result of this combination of events will be twofold. First,1a better and more timely measurement of the .,npact of newinterventions and technologies. If this comes to pass then there should be a correspondingly great improvement in thereal amount of resources devoted to actual service deliveryand resultant changes in positive impact on the population.This change in formulating and developing strategies for the'utilization of scarce resources in an environment where theper capita resources available for health and social servicesshow signs of decreasing could create conditions for a majorinjection of resources.This possibility, at the very least,must be closely evaluated and studied on a pilot basis tounderstand better its potential impact.In a world which shows no signs of making vastresources available for improvement in the quality of life ofa major part of the world's population, the possibility ofgreater efficiencies is one that must be pursued. As mentioned earlier, there is a decided positive bias to ourpresentation here because we have observed the potential ofthis technology as it has helped to solve problems in theThird World.Questions regarding if such equipment can bemade to function under harsh environmental circumstancesand if sufficient number of persons can be found to betrained are not covered here since we believe the answersbased upon our experience to be positive. What needs to happen at this point is that others should analyze, critiqueand develop hard evaluative frameworks. We present thesecurrent thoughts only as broad guidelines.The application of information technology to theproblems of development needs to be quickly evaluated withdirect reference to the needs of the developing world. If we are able to do this quickly and objectively the potentialfor increasing the quality of life in the Third World isenormous. 353 346REFERENCESAuvert, B., F. V. Aegerter, L. T. Huang Du, P.
