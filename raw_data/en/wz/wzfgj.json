This subdivision may not be interpreted to prevent the State Bar of California from filing a request with the Supreme Court of California to suspend a member of the bar pursuant to this section. (2) A suspension of, or refusal to renew, a license or issuance of a temporary license pursuant to this section does not constitute denial or discipline of a licensee for purposes of any reporting requirements to the National Practitioner Data Bank and shall not be reported to the National Practitioner Data Bank or the Healthcare Integrity and Protection Data Bank. (3) Upon release from the certified list, the suspension or revocation of the applicant's or licensee's license shall be purged from the state governmental licensing entity's Internet Web site or other publication within three business days.

The petition shall include affidavits that demonstrate, to the satisfaction of the department, both of the following: (1) The permittee has engaged in acts or omissions constituting a violation of this code or has been convicted of a crime substantially related to the permitted activity. (2) Permitting the permittee to operate, or to continue to operate without restrictions, would endanger the public health, safety, or welfare. (b) No interim order provided for in this section shall be issued without notice to the permittee, unless it appears from the petition and supporting documents that serious injury would result to the public before the matter could be heard on notice. (c) Except as provided in subdivision (b), the permittee shall be given at least 15 days' notice of the hearing on the petition for an interim order. The notice shall include documents submitted to the department in support of the petition. If the order was initially issued without notice as provided in subdivis ion (b), the permittee shall be entitled to a hearing on the petition within 20 days of the issuance of the interim order without notice. The permittee shall be given notice of the hearing within two days after issuance of the initial interim order, and shall receive all documents in support of the petition. The failure of the department to provide a hearing within 20 days following issuance of the interim order without notice, unless the permittee waives his or her right to the hearing, shall result in the dissolution of the interim order by operation of law. (d) At the hearing on the petition for an interim order, the permittee may do the following: (1) Be represented by counsel. 665 (2) Have a record made of the proceedings, copies of which shall be available to the permittee upon payment of costs computed in accordance with the provisions for transcript costs for judicial review contained in Section 11523 of the Government Code.

(f) The department shall file an accusation within 15 days of the issuance of an interim order. In the case of an interim order issued without notice, the time shall run from the date of the order issued after the noticed hearing.

Violation of the interim order is established upon proof that the permittee was on notice of the interim order and its terms, and that the order was in effect at the time of the violation. The finding of a violation of an interim order made at the hearing on the accusation shall be reviewed as a part of any review of a final decision of the department. (2) If the interim order issued by the department provides for anything less than a complete suspension of the permittee and the permittee violates the interim order prior to the hearing on 667 the accusation provided for in subdivision (f), the department may, upon notice to the permittee and proof of violation, modify or expand the interim order. (j) A plea or verdict of guilty or a conviction after a plea of nolo contendere is deemed to be a conviction within the meaning of this section. A certified record of the conviction shall be conclusive evidence of the fact that the conviction occurred. The department may take action under this section notwithstanding the fact that an appeal of the conviction may be taken. (k) The interim orders provided for by this section shall be in addition to, and not a limitation on, the authori ty to seek injunctive relief provided in any other provision of law. 11106.7.

(4) An order of abatement or a fine assessment issued pursuant to a citation shall inform the permittee that if the permittee desires a hearing to contest the finding of a violation, that hearing shall be requested by written notice to the department within 30 days of the date of issuance of the citation or assessment. Hearings shall be held pursuant to Chapter 5 (commencing with Se ction 11500) of Part 1 of Division 3 of Title 2 of the Government Code. (5) In addition to requesting a hearing, the permittee may, within 10 days after service of the citation, request in writing an opportunity for an informal conference with the department regarding the citation. At the conclusion of the informal conference, the department may affirm, modify, or dismiss the citation, including any fine levied or order of abatement issued. The decision shall be deemed to be a final order with regard to the citation issued, including the fine levied and the order of abatement. However, the permittee does not waive its right to request a hearing to contest a citation by requesting an informal conference. If the citation is dismissed after the informal confe rence, the request for a hearing on the matter of the citation shall be deemed to be withdrawn. If the citation, including any fine levied or order of abatement, is modified, the citation originally issued shall be considered withdrawn and a new citation i ssued. If a hearing is requested for a subsequent citation, it shall be requested within 30 days of service of that subsequent citation. (6) Failure of a permittee to pay a fine within 30 days of the date of assessment or comply with an order of abatement within the fixed time, unless the citation is being appealed, may result in disciplinary action being taken by the department. If a citation is not contested and a fine is not paid, the full amount of the assessed fine shall be added to the renewal of the permit. A 669 permit shall not be renewed without payment of the renewal fee and fine. (c) The system may contain the following provisions: (1) A citation may be issued without the assessment of an administrative fine. (2) Assessment of administrative fines may be limited to only particular violations of the law or department regulations. (d) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, if a fine is paid to satisfy an assessment based on the finding of a violation, payment of the fine shall be represented as satisfactory resolution of the matter for purposes of public disclosure. (e) Administrative fines collected pursuant to this section shall be deposited in the General Fund. (f) The sanctions authorized under this section shall be separate from, and in addition to, any other administrative, civil, or criminal remedies; however, a criminal action may not be initiated for a specific offense if a citation has been issued pursuant to this section for that offense, and a citation may not be issued pursuant to this section for a specific offense if a criminal action for that offense has been filed. (g) Nothing in this section shall be deemed to prevent the department from serving and prosecuting an accusation to suspend or revoke a permit if grounds for that suspension or revocation exist. 11107.
