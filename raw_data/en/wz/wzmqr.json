CooneyAAEP News March 2018 III From the President: Make time to mentor By Margo L. Macpherson, DVM, MS, DACT January meetings of two of our leadership groups\u2014the Continuing Education (CE) Steering Committee and the board of directors\u2014yielded exciting opportunities to improve the clinical practice and personal health of our members. The CE Steering Committee finalized educational plans for 2018 and discussed educa-tional projections through 2021. Under the guidance of our CE Consultant Dr. Ed Kanara and AAEP staff liaison Carey Ross, the group formulated a three-year planning grid for present and future AAEP educational events. With a three-year template, the steering committee can identify important topics to include in future programming. The grid is used in combination with member requests from the CE Needs Analysis Survey to ensure AAEP educational program-ming is current and useful to our members. Some exciting educational prospects coming up include our Summer Focus Conference and Labs, which will feature both an ambulatory practice and a lameness imaging track composed of two classroom days and an optional wet labs day; and a pair of immersive 360\u00b0 meetings devoted to back and pelvic dysfunction and the problem mare that bookend our summer CE schedule. Visit the website for more information.At the board meeting, directors examined progress of 2017 goals and drafted goals for each of our five strategic pillars in 2018 (see article on page V). A central theme that emerged from our discussions was the immediate need to formalize a mentoring program for equine veteri-narians. This concept was supported from data gathered by our newly formed Young Professionals Task Force, chaired by Dr. Katie Garrett. The task force is charged with determining the needs and wants of AAEP members under 35 years of age. This target group was selected as the demographic most critical to growth of the AAEP but also the group with the highest attrition rate in the first five years after graduation. Surveys were sent to approxi-mately 1,900 members in this demographic, of whom 200 (11%) responded. Survey respondents expressed a strong desire for mentorship. Our young members are seeking professional mentorship from experienced individuals in a supportive and non-judgmental manner. They are looking for timely responses and advice about practice/professional growth without micromanagement. While mentorship within a practice is considered conceptually desirable, the respon-dents also expressed a need for unbiased and objective resources (i.e., non-practice members), particularly for conflict resolution.Coupled with professional mentorship was an expressed desire for \"life coach\" mentorship. Among the identified mentoring opportunities were advice regarding management of student debt, family and work-life balance, working hours and emotional support. Comments from respondents indicated a communication gap between generations that likely contributes to early attrition from practice. A representative comment was, \"...change is slower than it should be. Issues like student debt, family and work-life balance, and gender issues are huge, and not enough is being done to tackle these.\" The respondent continued, \"These topics should be a wake-up call and provide some great direction for areas to focus on: Why gender equality in business is good business; how to be a better boss and make more money at the same time; emotional intelligence; conflict management; how to coach new vets; financial skills for new vets; why standing up for racism and sexism is good business and builds loyalty.\" The telling comments demonstrate opportunity for our members that is bi-directional. Our young professionals are seeking help and guidance so they can have sustain-able futures as equine veterinarians. In turn, this same group of professionals offers insight into how practices can grow and change to support a new brand of equine veterinarians. Practice owners and seasoned employers have the wisdom and experience to teach young veteri-narians how to succeed in equine practice. Through their own passion and joy for equine veterinary practice, this valued senior group empowers generations of veterinari-ans to come. This is a win-win situation. The Young Professionals Task Force has been charged with drafting a mentoring plan to present at the June board meeting. It is likely that mentoring will be layered and not a one-size-fits-all template. Member comments will strengthen the finished product, so I encourage you to pass along your thoughts to me (macphersonm@ufl.edu) or Dr. Garrett (kgarrett@roodandriddle.com). Through the collective wisdom of the membership, we can create an environment that provides all equine veteri-narians an opportunity to achieve career satisfaction and success. Dr. Margo Macpherson ASSOCIATIONIf you've watched the news or scrolled through Facebook in the last few months, you are likely aware that an unprecedented conversation about sexual harassment and sexual assault is occurring in all sectors of society. It is difficult to know the full extent of the problem, as many incidences of harassment and assault go unreported, but an ABC News/Washington Post poll conducted in October 2017 found that more than half of all American women\u201454%\u2014have experienced \"unwanted and inap-propriate sexual advances\" at some point in their lives. Men also are victims of sexual harassment and assault. In 2017, 16.5% of sexual harassment cases filed with the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission were made by men. No profession is immune from sexual harassment, including veterinary medicine, and the global discussion started by the #MeToo movement inspired many of our own colleagues to begin sharing their stories. The private Facebook group Women in Equine Practice, managed by Dr. Mary Beth Whitcomb, offered one outlet for female veterinarians to discuss their experiences. The outpouring of responses within this group, which is not affiliated with the AAEP and is composed of graduated female veterinarians, indicated that sexual harassment and assault within equine practice are not isolated occurrences. Several veterinarians who participate in this Facebook group\u2014myself included\u2014felt that a survey to measure the incidence of harassment and assault experienced by females in equine practice would be beneficial to under-standing the severity of the problem. The survey, designed by Drs. Melanie Barham and Colleen Best, was conducted online in October through Facebook and received 441 responses. The survey results were first shared during the 2017 AAEP Convention's Business News Hour and Lifestyle/Wellness session by Drs. Lisa Kivett and Betsy Charles, with additional statistics posted in the Women in Equine Practice Facebook group last month. As you will see from the following findings, the respondents to the Women in Equine Practice survey tell us that sexual assault and sexual harassment affect a significant number of veteri-narians. r\u0001 \u0015\u0014\u0006\u0001SFQPSUFE\u0001CFJOH\u0001TFYVBMMZ\u0001IBSBTTFE\u0001PS\u0001BTTBVMUFE\u0001JO\u0001 equine practice a coworker. r\u0001 \u0017\u0018\u0006\u0001SFQPSUFE\u0001CFJOH\u0001TFYVBMMZ\u0001IBSBTTFE\u0001PS\u0001BTTBVMUFE\u0001JO\u0001 equine practice by a client. It is also important to note that while most of the survey respondents were female, a small number of men took the survey and reported that they, too, had been victims. I shared the results of this survey with the AAEP board of directors during its January 27 meeting, generating much discussion and concern. The board appreciated the openness of all the respondents in sharing their experienc-es, which is helping to bring much-needed attention to this problem. In determining the appropriate role for the AAEP, the board believes that initially our association can be most effective by putting resources into the hands of members. This may include guidance for practices about developing a sexual harassment policy and providing training to employees. It will also certainly include general guidance for those who have been victims of harassment or abuse. The AAEP board of directors recognizes that changing a culture is not easy or swift, but increasing awareness is the first step. Look for a series of sexual harassment resources on the AAEP website, in EVE and in the Spur e-newsletter throughout 2018. In the meantime, I urge you to evaluate the cultures of your own practices in the context of sexual harassment and abuse. Please let me know if you have additional ideas to affect positive change. My email is amyvmdmba@gmail.com. Note: To be added to the Women in Equine Practice Facebook group, send Dr. Whitcomb a direct Facebook friend request as well as a private message through Facebook stating your desire to join the group along with confirmation that you are a veterinarian. ASSOCIATION IV AAEP News March 2018 Shining a light on sexual harassment in equine practice By Amy L. Grice, VMD, MBA Dr. Amy Grice HIGHLIGHTS: More than a third of survey respondents reported being sexually harassed/assaulted by a superior or coworker, and two-thirds by a client. AAEP board committed to increasing awareness of the issue. First steps to include dissemination of resources to assist individuals and practices. Dr. Grice, of Virginia City, Mont., is a member of the AAEP board of directors and works as a business consultant to equine practices.AAEP News March 2018 V ASSOCIATION AAEP board focuses on strategic priorities for the year ahead By David Foley, AAEP Executive Director The AAEP board of directors convened Jan. 28 for its winter board meeting. All directors were present. The session began with the AAEP Foundation board meeting, at which proposed reformation of the Equine Research Coordination Group and the Research Summit were discussed from a conceptual standpoint. The board was generally supportive of reestablishing AAEP's leadership role in equine research provided satisfactory resolution of expected logistical and operational impacts.Following the Foundation meeting, Dr. Amy Grice presented an overview of the results of the AVMA-AAEP Economic Study. The board formed a task force chaired by Dr. Grice to distill key survey findings and recommend areas for AAEP action. During a discussion of telehealth, the board decided to continue working with the AVMA on this issue while separately developing an educational white paper as a resource for AAEP members.Focus then shifted to the AAEP's strategic plan and devel-opment of a 2018 operating plan in the five goal areas: Enhancing member value Establish a task force to develop an AAEP action plan concerning results of the AVMA-AAEP Economic Study; establish a task force to develop an AAEP mentorship program; develop a plan for AAEP leadership training opportunities for members; investigate feasibility of developing certification programs for members; and explore feasibility of forward booking in equine practice. Communications/technology Use technology to create customized communications based on member preferences. Continuing education Develop a more strategic plan for student education; conduct market research relative to non-member or former member attendance at AAEP CE opportunities; and continue to develop and execute AAEP's experiential learning strategy. Wellness Collaborate with AVMA to increase member resources; designate \"heart health\" as a specific education focus in 2018; and promote addiction education, including at a designated convention session. Promoting the profession Continue to promote dentistry, wellness exams and vacci-nations; develop additional wellness educational resources; expand promotion of individual members doing good works in their communities; and collect data on most-used client education brochures and related printing costs.Following strategic plan deliberations, discussion turned to workgroup recommendations. Specific actions taken included:r\u0001 1SFTFSWBUJPO\u0001PG\u0001UIF\u0001\u0012\u0011\u000eZFBS\u0001NFNCFSTIJQ\u0001DSJUFSJB\u0001GPS\u0001 board eligibility.

The board did not disapprove of further consideration of the concept; however, the board supports continued development of educational tools and resources for members, while ascertaining practicality of this certification concept. Following workgroup recommendations, discussion turned to other association and industry issues. During this portion, the board approved a staff proposal to rebrand and reconstitute the annual Foundation Celebration into a closing reception with entertainment. The board also heard updates on alleged bisphosphonate use in juvenile horses and formation of a task force to develop AAEP recommendations; the need to review position statements published in the membership directory; results of a sexual harassment survey conducted by the Women in Equine Practice Facebook group; and drug compounding regulation in the trade show. The meeting concluded with a few items of routine board business. The next meeting will be held in conjunction with the Summer Focus Conference and Labs in Raleigh, N.C. in June.David Foley The AAEP is accepting nominations until June 1 for its annual awards program.

Touch Point: Use client profiles to understand differences in service needs A client's age, gender, number of horses owned and type of horses owned all should affect the way vet-erinarians approach relationship and communication issues, according to AAEP market research. The client who owns English sport horses values different things in veterinary service than the client with a single pleasure horse. The savvy and insightful veterinarian tailors his or her approach with each client based on the client's individual needs and demographic profile. One size truly does not fit all.The AAEP Touch program offers 13 different client profiles to help you better understand the individual needs of your future clients. You can view all profiles at touch.aaep.org/8-one-size-does-not-fit-all.Although the top priorities for relationship attributes and services are consistent across all demographic groups, paying attention to the subtle differences between each client type can yield the blueprint for customizing your approach within your equine practice.

AAEP News March 2018 VII More than 25 veterinarians, students, technicians and a farrier convened on Costa Rica's Osa Peninsula Jan. 6-13 for the 8th Equitarian Workshop. Participants expanded their knowledge of working equid healthcare, adminis-tered much-needed veterinary care, and instructed owners on best practices to keep their equids producing the income stream imperative for family sustenance. Leadership development grants from the AAEP Foundation enabled two AAEP student members and a pair of recent graduates to attend the workshop, which consisted of two days in the classroom and four days in the field applying knowledge and skills to the various conditions that afflict the region's working equids. In all, 278 horses, mules and donkeys received physical exams, vaccinations, anthelmintic and medical attention. Among the procedures were 25 castrations and several lameness cases that benefited from spinal manipulative therapies. The patients also provided participants the opportunity to identify and treat tropical diseases, including vampire bat bites, nasal conidiobolus, orange face mites, photosensitization, advanced cell carcinomas, girth galls and large withers sores. \"This trip provided valuable lessons to take back to my veterinary students,\" said Foundation grant recipient Dr. Hillary Carroll. \"Among them is that financial constraint is not always synonymous with euthanasia, and whether it's a working horse in Costa Rica or an Olympic jumper, that shouldn't change your level of compassion or concern.\" The 2019 Equitarian Workshop will return to the Osa Peninsula Jan. 19-26.

The heart of an equine veterinarian By Jamie L. Pribyl, DVM As equine veterinarians, our primary focus is the health of the horse. Unfortunately, we often put the well-being of our patients, clients and practice above our own. That's why the AAEP strives to support the health of equine vet-erinarians by providing resources to its members that help us be healthier in many areas of our lives, from work-life balance to the physical and emotional challenges of the profession. To emphasize the importance of physical health, the AAEP hosted a health fair during the 2017 Annual Convention. The nurses performing the screenings noted a general trend toward high blood pressure in attendees. Since elevated blood pressure is a risk factor for heart disease, the AAEP Wellness Subcommittee will be making heart health an educational focus for our membership in 2018. Heart disease is the No. 1 killer of men and women in the United States and a major cause of disability. By far, the most common form of heart disease is coronary artery disease, which results from the build-up of plaque in the coronary arteries and can lead to a heart attack. While family history can increase your risk for heart disease, lifestyle plays a major role. As equine veterinarians, are we more or less at risk? Major contributing factors to the development of heart disease include physical inactivity, an unhealthy diet, obesity, stress, tobacco use and excess alcohol consump- tion. Equine veterinarians certainly don't suffer from inactivity. Working with horses requires physical strength and flexi-bility. However, being physically strong doesn't equal being physically fit. Cardiovascular exercise is essential for a strong heart. While I know a few hardcore colleagues who make running or biking a part of their daily routine, I'm sure many of us struggle to fit exercise into our schedule. When it comes to diet, our group likely has some room for improvement. I have a friend who prides himself on knowing which gas station has the best \"roller dogs,\" and another who lives on Diet Coke and Twizzlers. Hitting the drive-through or grabbing a gas station lunch is quick and easy when you are on the road all day, but it is not the healthiest choice. Finally, it is difficult to live a low-stress lifestyle as an equine veterinarian. Long days, night emergencies, chal-lenging cases, difficult patients, demanding clients and management duties all contribute to emotional and physical stress\u2014not to mention balancing the demands of work with those at home. Of course, some of us are better at handling stress than others, but it is still lurking in the background. Simply being human puts us at risk of heart disease, and the lifestyle of an equine veterinarian presents obstacles to heart-healthy living. We already know what we should do to be heart healthy: exercise regularly, maintain a healthy weight, eat well, don't drink too much, avoid tobacco and decrease stress. Unfortunately, putting these recommenda-tions into action isn't always easy. In 2018, let's challenge each other to live a more heart-healthy lifestyle.

Dr. Jamie Pribyl HIGHLIGHTS: High blood pressure common in health screenings of convention attendees. High blood pressure is a risk factor for heart disease, the leading cause of death in the U.S. Physical fitness, healthy diet and reduced stress are integral to heart health.Back and pelvic injuries and abnormalities are significant causes of poor performance for the sport horse. Isolating the specific problem in these two areas can be very chal-lenging, even for the most experienced practitioner. During the AAEP's 360\u00b0 Back Pain & Pelvic Dysfunction, small-group training through labs and lectures will fully immerse you in the thoracolumbar spine and the sacropel-vic region. You'll refine your imaging techniques and gain an increased understanding of the rehabilitation methods essential to a successful athletic return for the injured horse. Daily wet labs using cadavers and live horses will equip you to structures On the final day, you will put your newly acquired skills to the test by working up unknown clinical cases on live horses. You will leave the meeting confident in your ability to implement the newly acquired knowledge and skills immediately in your practice.

Dr. Rebecca Stinson XII AAEP News March 2018 Highlights of recent clinically relevant papers Furosemide and EIPH This study by Heather Knych and colleagues in the USAaimed to investigate the ef cacy of two in the reduction of exercise-induced pulmonaryhaemorrhage (EIPH) severity in racehorses. Fifteen Thoroughbreds in training with an unknown EIPH history were recruited into the study and randomly assignedto one of three treatment protocols to be administered priorto a mock 5 furlong race: 5 mL of 0.9% NaCl i.v. 4 h prior toracing; 250 mg of 4 h prior to racing; or250 mg furosemide i.v. 24 h prior to racing. Each group wassubjected to each treatment protocol with a 2-weekminimum wash-out period in between. One hour after racinghorses underwent airway endoscopy and were assigned anEIPH grade (0 -4) by a clinician blinded to the treatment protocol. Video footage of the endoscopic examinationswere later viewed and graded by three further clinicians. Ablind bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was performed on eachhorse immediately after endoscopic examination. EIPH grades were signi cantly lower in the 4-h furosemide group compared to the 24-h furosemide group. BAL redblood cell (RBC) counts were signi cantly higher in the saline- treated group when compared to the 4-h furosemide group.Although there was no signi cant difference between RBC counts of the saline and 24-h furosemide groups, this was alsothe case 4-h furosemide and 24-h furosemidetreatment groups. Administering furosemide 4 h prior to racing appears to be more effective at reducing EIPH severity than ifadministered 24 h prior to racing. Large colon resection outcomes In this retrospective cohort study Lynn Pezzanite and EileenHackett compared survival and complications in horsesundergoing large resection with either sutured end-to-endor stapled functional end-to-end anastomoses. Data were retrieved from the medical records of 26 horses undergoing colectomy (14 horses with sutured end-to-end and 12 horses with stapled functional end-to-endanastomoses) over a 14-year period. Records were evaluatedfor signalment, medical and surgical treatments, and survivalto hospital discharge. Long-term follow-up was obtainedthrough owner contact. Continuous variables werecompared with Mann -Whitney tests. Fisher 's exact testing was used to compare survival to hospital discharge. Survival time was compared by constructing Kaplan -Meier survival curves and performing log-rank curve comparison testing. The mean age of horses undergoing colectomy was 13 years. The reason for colectomy was prophylaxis (n =12) or salvage (n =14). The mean surgical time was 169 min. The mean hospitalisation time was 9 days, which did not differ with anastomosis type. Nine of 12 horses undergoing stapled functional end-to-end anastomosis and 12 of 14 horses undergoing sutured end-to-end anastomosis survived to hospital discharge. These ndings show no differences in short- and long-term survival outcomes between sutured end-to-end or stapled functional end-to-end anastomoses in horses \u20acullerian hormone concentrations In this study Harutaka Murase colleagues in Japan andthe USA compared serum anti-M \u20acullerian hormone (AMH) concentrations versusother ovarian abnormalities. Anti-M \u20acullerian hormone (AMH) has recently been reported as a useful diagnostic marker for equine granulosa celltumours (GCTs). In this serum AMH and immunoreactive (ir)-inhibinconcentrations in mares known to have GCT with mares thathad ovarian abnormalities other than GCT in order todetermine more useful diagnostic criteria. Mares withsuspected GCT were subsequently divided into those withGCT con rmed by histopathology, and mares with other abnormal ovaries (AO) with no GCT and with evidence ofnormal fertility on follow-up. Median concentrations of AMHwere 72.6 ng/mL in GCT and 0.70 ng/mL were 2.36 ng/mL in GCTversus 0.93 ng/mL in AO mares. The cutoff values based onreceiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis were4.70 ng/mL for AMH and 1.65 ng/mL for ir-inhibin, which wereslightly higher than the traditional values based on the normalreference range. The sensitivity, speci city, accuracy, and area under the ROC curve of AMH were higher than those ofir-inhibin. In this study the authors demonstrated the diagnostic criterion of serum AMH concentration for equine GCT andcon rmed that AMH a more useful for diagnosis of equine GCT than ir-inhibin. Repository radiographs and performance In this retrospective cohort study Myra Barrett and colleaguesin the USA investigated potential associations betweenrepository radiographic ndings and subsequent performance of Quarter Horses competing in cutting events. Repository radiographic ndings from radiographs obtained at the time of sale for 343 client-owned horses werecompared with objective measures of performance,including the likelihood of competing; the likelihood ofearning money as a 3-year-old, as a 4-year-old, and as a 3-and 4-year-old combined; and the amount of money earnedas a 3-year-old, as a 4-year-old, and as a 3- and 4-year-oldcombined. The presence of mild osteophytes involving the distal aspect of the tarsal joint was signi cantly associated with lower mean earnings as a 4-year-old. The presence of osteophytes on the dorsoproximal aspect of the middle phalanx of the hindlimbs was signi cantly associated with an increased odds of earning money as a 4-year-old. Radiographic lesions of the medial femoral condyle of the stifle joint were not signi cantly associated with subsequent performance. The authors concluded that most abnormalities identi ed on repository radiographs were not signi cantly associated with subsequent performance. The signi cant association between mild tarsal osteophytosis and earnings was unexpected. Results of this study indicated the need for further investigation of the relationship between radiographic \u00a92018 EVJ 10.1111/eve.12889ndings and performance outcome in Western performance horses. Auriculopalpebral nerve blocks In this study Hannah Visser and colleagues in the USA comparedSchirmer tear test I (STTI) values collected in normal horses withand without an auriculopalpebral nerve block. Schirmer tear test I values were measured in 20 clinically normal horses (38 eyes) with a median age of 12 years.Within 24 -48 h, at the same time of day, tear measurements were collected again after administration of an auriculopalpebral nerve block. Each block was performed aminimum of 5 min prior to each STTI. A repeated-measures model was used to analyse differences between STTI values in eyes with and without nerve blocks incorporating within horse correlation between eyes. The mixed-model included xed factors of treatment and eye and a random intercept for each horse. An unstructured covariance structure was used. On average, STTI values measured in eyes after auriculopalpebral nerve blocks were 0.55 mm/min greater than those without nerve blocks. This difference was not statistically signi cant (P =0.5268), and therefore the authors concluded that there was no effect of auriculopalpebral nerve block on STTI values in normal horses. Blood coagulation parameters This prospective study by Catriona Mackenzie andcolleagues in the UK aimed to compare coagulationparameters of blood collected by direct jugular venipunctureand through an indwelling intravenous catheter (IVC). Fifty- ve horses admitted to a referral hospital over a 5- month period in 2015 were included; all of which had a 14-gauge polyurethane IVC placed in their jugular vein. Horsesunderwent paired blood sampling using both techniques,with 10 mL of blood being drawn and discarded from theIVC prior to sample collection. Whole blood prothrombintime, fresh plasma prothrombin time, activated partialthromboplastin time, stored plasma antithrombin activity,brinogen concentration and D-dimer concentration were then measured accordingly. Bland -Altman analysis showed that all parameters excluding antithrombin and D-dimers had good agreement between the two sampling techniques. The sensitivity and speci city of IVC sampling when compared to direct venipuncture was high. The poor agreement between direct venipuncture and IVC sampling for antithrombin and D-dimer measurement supports the use of venipuncture when these particular parameters are being measured. These ndings show that blood sampling through an IVC is an acceptable technique when assessing most coagulation parameters. Biolms of Candida spp. in the eye This study by Raimunda S ^amia Nogueira Brilhante and colleagues in Brazil aimed to assess the bio lm-forming ability ofCandida spp. from the ocular conjunctiva of horses and to investigate the antifungal susceptibility of these bio lms.The bio lm-forming ability of 15 strains was assessed by crystal violet staining, which reveals the fungal biomass adhered to the polystyrene plates, and scanning electron microscopy. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of amphotericin B, fluconazole, itraconazole and caspofungin were determined against strains in planktonic form. The antifungal susceptibility of mature bio lms was then evaluated by exposing them to 10 9MIC and 50 9MIC of the tested drugs, followed by the assessment of their metabolic activity, using the oxidoreduction indicator XTT. Results were analysed ANOVA and post-test, and P-values below 5% led to signi cant conclusions. Eight strains produced bio lms and were classi ed as strong (1/15), moderate (3/15) and weak (4/15) producers, according to the amount of crystal violet retained by the adhered fungal biomass. Bio lm metabolic activity of one C. tropicalis did not decrease after exposure to the tested antifungals, while bio lm metabolic activity of ve strains was reduced by amphotericin B, but not the other drugs. One C. parapsilosis sensu stricto and one C. glabrata showed signi cant reduction in bio lm metabolic activity after exposure to fluconazole, itraconazole, and caspofungin, but not amphotericin B. These results demonstrate that Candida from the ocular conjunctiva of horses can be a risk to animal health as they are capable of forming bio lms, which are commonly involved in fungal keratitis. S.

Muir, K. C. Smith, K. E. Potter, T. R. Leaman\u00a7and R. K. W. Smith* Department of Clinical Science and Services;Department of Pathology and Pathogen Biology, Royal Veterinary College, Hat eld, Hertfordshire, UK; A yearling Thoroughbred colt was presented for investigationof neck stiffness and episodes of intermittent neck painwithout neurological signs. Osteochondrosis (OCD) of thecervical articular process and computed osteochondral fragment the left fourth caudalcervical articular process was removed arthroscopicallyfollowing a cut down approach to the joint capsule of theaffected APJ. Surgical removal resulted in resolution ofclinical signs at 4 weeks. However, subsequently the horsewas markedly ataxic 6 weeks post surgery after being foundcast in its stable. Cervical stenotic myelopathy wasconsidered the most likely cause based on clinical andradiographic signs and the horse was subjected toeuthanasia due to a poor prognosis for racing. Post-mortemexamination identi ed atypical cartilage within several cervical APJs with histological changes consistent withOCD. This case report supports OCD of the APJs as a causeof neck pain and con rms the clinical practicality and short-term effectiveness of arthroscopic fragment removal.Surgical treatment for cervical OCD should be consideredin horses without neurological signs, although caseselection is important and the underlying pathology remainsa risk factor for the development of subsequent neurologicalsigns. Introduction The equine cervical articular process joints (APJs) are paireddiarthrodial articulations between the cranial and caudalarticular processes of the second to seventh cervicalvertebrae. The cranial articular process of each caudalvertebra forms the ventral abaxial portion of the joint and thecaudal articular process of the adjacent cranial vertebraforms the dorsal axial portion. The joint itself lies in an obliqueplane, is oval in shape and has a large joint capsule toaccommodate neck movement (Claridge et al. 2010). Pathology of the APJs can cause neck pain, abnormal headcarriage and forelimb lameness (Ricardi and Dyson 2011) and enlarged APJs can causedorsolateral compression of the spinal cord, contributing tocervical spondylomyelopathy (Moore et al. 1994). Osteochondrosis (OCD) of the APJs has been reported (Powers et al. 1986; Stewart et al. 1991; Trostle et al. 1993) and has been con rmed in a small number of horses at post- mortem examination (Beck et al. 2002; Janes et al. 2015).Arthroscopic treatment of OCD is widely performed in the joints of the equine appendicular skeleton and procedures such as debridement of abnormal cartilage and removal of OCD fragments are commonplace. Recently, arthroscopic evaluation of the APJs has been described with three clinical cases of APJ arthropathy evaluated arthroscopically and with debridement of brillated cartilage performed in one case (Pepe et al. 2014). This case report describes the diagnosis, treatment and outcome of a case of APJ OCD: a surgical technique for the successful removal of an OCD fragment from the C4 -C5 APJ is described. Case history A 12-month-old Thoroughbred colt was presented to theRoyal Veterinary College Equine Referral Hospital with a 4-month history of intermittent neck stiffness and abnormalhead carriage. The referring veterinary surgeon had initiallyexamined the horse after it was found with a low headcarriage and an apparent inability or unwillingness to lift thehead. No external swelling, palpable pain, lameness or ataxiawere appreciated but the yearling was noted to move with astiff gait. The horse had been turned out in a group and notraumatic event had been witnessed. The horse was con ned to a stable for 4 weeks and received 14 days of meloxicam (0.6 mg/kg bwt, per os, s.i.d.). Neck mobility and comfort improved; however, 24 h following resumption of turnout with companions the colt displayed the same clinical signs andwas again con ned to the stable. Repeated conservative management again resulted in clinical improvement, although a stiff gait and reduced neck mobility remained. The colt had been clinically normal for the 5 months preceding the initial event with no other known medical history. Clinical ndings The colt was well grown with a body condition score of 5/9(Henneke et al. 1983) and body mass of 428 kg. Clinical examination of the cardiovascular, respiratory andgastrointestinal systems was normal. The horse had normalhead carriage at rest but lateral flexion of the neck was considered reduced bilaterally. Palpation of the neck wasnot resented and there were no neck swellings, muscleatrophy, muscle tremor or focal sweating. Neurologicalevaluation (Furr and Reed 2015) revealed a normalmentation with no cranial nerve de cits. Gait evaluation or ataxia, howeverthe horse walked with a stiff gait and an extended neck. Thegait de cit was not exacerbated by walking whilst blindfolded, walking up and down hill, circling or backing.Signs were considered consistent with neck pain with noevidence of spinal cord or central neurological disease. Diagnostic imaging Digital radiography (Fuji D-EVO Plus)1of the cervical spine was performed under routine sedation, including lateral projections (Butler et al. 2008) and left 45 -55\u00b0ventral to right dorsal and right 45 -55\u00b0ventral to left dorsal projections (Withers et al. 2009). The caudodorsal margin of the left C4 - C5 APJ was irregular in contour with an ill-de ned radiolucency within the articular process ( Fig 1a ). A single triangular shaped bone fragment was visible on oblique projections located adjacent to the left caudal articular process of C4 ( Fig APJs C6 -C7 articulations were bilaterally enlarged and sclerotic, with apparent reduction in size of the intervertebral foraminae. Intravertebral ratios were 52%, 51%, 50%, 53% and 50% (for C3-C7 respectively), supportive of cervical stenoticmyelopathy in an ataxic horse (Moore et al. 1994), but their signi cance in horses lacking neurological de cits is unknown. Intervertebral sagittal ratios were all normal (Hahn et al. 2008). Computed tomography (CT; GE Lightspeed Pro 16)2was performed immediately preoperatively in right lateral recumbency under general anaesthesia, with the cervical spine imaged from the caudal skull to the level of the C5 -C6 APJs. A single, well-de ned, but irregularly shaped bone fragment was located adjacent to the caudodorsal margin of the left caudal articular process of C4 ( Fig 2 ). There was an oval shaped lucency extending from the articular surface of this APJ axially, measuring 7.5 96.597 mm, with a faint and rim ( Fig 2b ). Smoothly marginated periarticular osteophytes surrounded the lateral margins of the left and right APJs of C4 -C5.

Surgical bwt/h for duration of CTimaging and switched to inhalational iso fluorane in air and oxygen for the duration of surgery, which was completedunder the same anaesthetic procedure. After CT, the horsewas transferred to theatre and positioned in right lateralrecumbency with a 5 L fluid bag placed beneath the mid neck to maintain slight lateral flexion of the cervical spine (Pepe et al. 2014). Following aseptic skin preparation and sterile draping of the surgical eld, the left C4 -C5 APJ was identi ed by ultrasonographic 12 MHz linear transducer (Mylab 5) 3encased in a sterile sleeve. An 8 cm craniodorsal-caudoventral skin incision was made over the C4-C5 APJ. The subcutaneous fascia was sharply incised bres of serratus ventralis cervicis and longissimus atlantis were bluntly divided to reveal the caudodorsal margin of the APJ (Sisson 1975; Berg et al. 2003). The joint capsule was palpable as a fluid bulge forming a cranial and lateral out- pouching from the bony margins of the joint. Self-retaining Inge retractors were placed to maintain access to the joint, which was distended with approximately 5 mL saline via a 19 gauge needle. An arthroscope sleeve and blunt conical obturator were inserted through a stab incision made into the caudodorsal joint capsule with a number 11 blade. A 4 mm diameter 30 \u00b0forward facing arthroscope4was inserted into the caudodorsal recess of the joint. A 4 cm long OCDfragment was visualised at the caudodorsal margin of the caudal fourth cervical articular process ( Fig 3 ). The fragment was easily visualised and found to be highly mobile. It was removed in two main parts using 3 mm Ferris Smith rongeurs through an instrument portal created 2 cm cranial to the arthroscope portal ( Fig 4 ). A subchondral bone defect was evident within the caudal articular surface of C4, with some irregularity of the joint surface. This defect and the fragment bed were debrided using a curette and mechanical resector 5 and the joint was lavaged. The joint capsule was closed in asimple interrupted pattern and the muscle layers were closedin two layers using size 3 metric poliglecaprone 25. Steelstaples were placed in the skin and a gauze stent was suturedover the incision using size 3.5 metric mono lament nylon. An unassisted anaesthetic recovery was graded as good (4/5)(Young and Taylor 1993). Total anaesthetic time was 190 minand total surgery time was 95 min.Post-surgical management and outcome Post-operative radiographs con rmed removal days post operatively. A tapering course ofphenylbutazone was provided for 10 days post-operatively.The stent dressing remained dry and was removed after 48 h.Mild local swelling developed around the surgical site on thesecond post-operative day, and had resolved by day 5 postsurgery when the horse was discharged to continue box rest.At 4 weeks after surgery the horse was re-examined by the C4F C5 C4 Fig 3: Intraoperative arthroscopic of the left articular process 4: Osteochondrosis fragment, post arthroscopic removal.

At 6 weeks post surgery, the horse was found cast in thestable and on standing was noted to be markedly ataxic/paretic in all 4 limbs. The horse was re-examined at the RoyalVeterinary College (R.J.P.) at 9 weeks post surgery. On initialexamination a nonpainful scar was palpable in themusculature at the surgical site. Ataxia and paresis,accompanied by dysmetria, was graded 3/5 in all four limbs(Furr and Reed 2015). A clinical diagnosis of a cervicalstenotic myelopathy was made on the basis of these clinicalsigns, the history and the known cervical vertebralabnormalities. Euthanasia was elected by the owner due tothe likely poor prognosis for a future racing career. Post-mortem ndings The articular cartilage overlying the caudal rim leftcaudal articular process of C4 was pitted andmicroscopically corresponded to a proliferation of brous connective tissue, consistent with repair at the site of surgicalremoval of the bone fragment ( Fig 5a ). In addition, this articular process was enlarged with an irregular joint surface and lipping of the dorsocranial border of the joint ( Fig 5b ). The articular cartilage overlying the left caudal articular process of C3 had indentations that corresponded to multiple, up to 2 91 mm, rectangular areas of apparent abnormal cartilage differentiation ( Fig 6 ) consistent with osteochondrosis dissecans. The APJs of the C6 -C7 vertebrae were enlarged and irregular, as noted radiographically. There was neither clear evidence of gross compression of the cervical spinal cord nor histological evidence of spinal cord compression. Discussion In this case, presenting signs of neck stiffness and pain wereattributed to changes in the cervical APJs, identi ed radiographically and by CT. Permanent resolution of signswith the chance of a future racing career was consideredpossible with surgical removal of the large, osteochondroticfragment identi ed within the left C4 -C5 APJ and removal of this fragment resolved the neck pain and clinical signs of neck stiffness in the short term. An APJ OCD fragment has been previously reported as a source of neck pain in a single horse (Beck et al. 2002). In the case presented here, in addition to the bone fragment, imaging and post-mortem examination revealed further OCD lesions affecting multiple APJs. OCD and secondary degenerative joint disease is sometimes associated with cervical stenotic myelopathy: Janes et al. (2015) reported OCD lesions to be signi cantly more common in horses diagnosed with cervical vertebral malformation (CVM)compared to clinically normal horses, but in other studies,OCD has been inconsistently associated with CVM (Reedet al. 1987; Stewart et al. 1991; Beck et al. 2002). This yearling was considered at increased risk of type 1 CVM due to thecervical pathology identi ed on clinical investigation, and questionably, the relative spinal canal stenosis, but showedno neurological signs prior to surgery. We hypothesise thatonce neck pain had resolved, increased neck comfort andmobility might have resulted in progression of cervicalinstability contributing to spinal cord compression. Trauma associated with becoming cast might also have contributed or been causal: indeed, acute onset ataxia in formerly normal mature horses is not uncommon in horses with radiographical features consistent with longer-term CVM (R.J. Piercy, personal observation). Cervical cord compression was not con rmed histopathologically, which might be due to the short duration of neurological signs or to functional, rather than pathological spinal cord de cits. Similarly, Olsen et al. (2014) reported 5 of 12 ataxic horses with suspected cervical spondylomyelopathy to have no identi able histopathological changes of the spinal cord. We do not believe that the surgical procedure caused ataxia directly as no ataxia was observed for 6 weeks post surgery and removal of a small, loose fragment from the margin of the APJ was highly unlikely to affect cervical stability. Nonmusculoskeletal causes of ataxia were considered unlikely, primarily due to the directtemporal relationship between becoming cast and the subsequent ataxia but also because no histological signs of an infectious or toxic cause were identi ed at post-mortem examination.

However, enlargement of the APJs is not consistently associated with these clinical signs, particularly in the caudal APJs (Moore et al. 1994; Down and Henson 2009) and the condition is often considered incidental. Conservative management of neck pain had been unsuccessful, prompting consideration of surgical options. The fragment was deemed surgically accessible based on a combination of thorough imaging and information gained from previous anatomical and surgical reports (Claridge et al. 2010; Pepe et al. 2014). Interpretation of neck radiographs is challenging due to complex anatomy, superimposition of structures and dif culty obtaining orthogonal radiographic views (Dimock and Puchalski 2010). Tomographic imaging facilitated surgical planning as it precisely located the OCD fragment in all planes and con rmed it to be intra-articular and suf ciently remote from the location of the associated spinal nerve and its branches. The C4 -C5 articulation is one of the more accessible of the cervical APJs as access is neither obstructed by the shoulder muscles (C6 -C7) nor restricted by the smaller articular space of the C2 -C3 or C3 - C4 Extrapolating from OCD fragment removalfrom joints of the appendicular skeleton, surgical removal was reasonably expected to resolve pain associated with the presence of this fragment. Whilst intra-articular, anti- inflammatory medication of APJs (usually with ultrasoundguidance) is a common procedure in horses with various signs that localise to the neck (Mattoon et al. 2004; Birmingham et al. 2010), in this case we considered that this treatment would be unlikely to result in long-term resolution necessary for a racing career. Intrasynovial analgesia of the relevant APJ in this case might have provided further support for expected resolution of signs with surgical removal of the OCD fragment. Importantly, in this case, absence of neurological signs was a critical factor in the decision to operate. Vertebral interbody fusion is a consideration for horses presented for neck stiffness but would be more expensive, invasive and require much longer convalescence with potentially, a greater risk of associated morbidities than arthroscopy (Moore et al. 1993; Walmsley 2005). As found by Pepe et al. (2014), transcutaneous ultrasound provided a practical method of identifying surgical landmarks. Dissection was centred over the caudodorsal joint margin to avoid the ventral intervertebral foramen and fth cervical spinal nerve. In this case, a cut down approach was made to the APJ, rather than approaching the joint through stab incisions (Pepe et al. 2014). Although the surgical incision was larger, this enabled increased manoeuvrability of both the arthroscope and surgical instruments, facilitating fragment removal and debridement of the fragment bed. The mean normal volume of the C4 -C5 APJ is only 2.8 mL (Claridge et al. 2010) but a large joint capsule enabled greater distension of the joint and gave suf cient space for evaluation of the dorsolateral joint margin ( Fig 3a ). A wider surgical approach also allowed egress fluid to escape the soft tissues, reducing potential compression of the local spinal nerve by extravasation into the surrounding tissues. Closure of the joint capsule was performed to prevent leakage of synovial fluid from the joint, but may not have been necessary. No incisional complications were encountered. In summary, arthroscopy of the fourth -fth cervical APJ is feasible and removal of an OCD fragment was performed in a single horse following accurate localisation using CT imaging. Although certain OCD lesions may be treatable arthroscopically, clinicians should be aware that horses commonly have multiple defects in the cervical APJs, and that some of these might limit the long-term prognosis as apparently in this case. For this reason, arthroscopic treatment of APJ OCD should be performed only after thorough neurological evaluation, accurate diagnostic imaging, careful appraisal of the surgical and career goals for the horse and with informed owner consent.

Vasey Goulburn interference; a case of chronic haematoma formationsecondary to repeated hindlimb interference injuries Physicalexamination, radiography and ultrasonographic investigationsidenti ed a rm, encapsulated soft tissue mass on the medial aspect of the left mid-metatarsal region. After surgical removal, histopathological examination con rmed a chronic haematoma. The horse responded well to surgical management of the condition. To the authors 'knowledge, this is the rst report of surgical intervention to resolve the common problem of repetitive interference injuries in Standardbred racehorses. Introduction Similar to Thoroughbred (TB) racing (Jeffcott et al. 1982; Hernandez and Hawkins 2001; Wilsher et al. 2006), musculoskeletal injuries (MSI) and lameness are the mostimportant causes of suboptimal performance, reduced training days and racehorse wastage in Standardbred (SB) racehorses (Vigre et al. 2002; Richard et al. 2010; Bertuglia et al. 2014). Common diagnoses of MSI in SB horses include carpal and fetlock arthropathies (Vigre et al. 2002; Johnston and ligament desmitis and super cial digital flexor tendinopathies (Johnston Nickels 2011; Bertuglia et al. 2014), and proximal palmar/plantar rst phalanx fragments (Carmalt et al. 2014). Interference injuries are less frequently reported as a cause of lameness; however, in post-race examination of poorly performing SB racehorses, the mostcommon abnormal clinical nding has been fresh injuries to the limb (Knight and Evans 2000). Interference may occur between the forelimbs, the hindlimbs and ipsilateral limbs, and in pacers between diagonal limbs. It has been suggested that interference injuries are the result of gait abnormalities and poor limb conformation (Knight and Evans 2000). In the same study, lameness was recorded as a separate abnormality detected on post-race examination of SB horses that had performed poorly, therefore the association between limb injuries and lameness is unclear. In the authors 'experience, swellings typically associated with interference injuries are seromas or haematomas, which most frequently occur on the medial aspect of the mid-metatarsal region, the proximal medial metacarpus and the distal medial physis of Case history and clinical ndings A 4-year-old SB mare had been referred to Goulburn ValleyEquine Hospital for further investigation and treatment of asoft tissue swelling on the medial aspect of the left mid- metatarsal region and left hindlimb lameness. The mass had initially been noted 4 months prior to presentation. The trainer reported the mass had formed following an interference injury during training. At the time the injury occurred, the horse had been wearing protective distal limb boots on all 4 limbs. The medial aspect of the left hindlimb boot had been lacerated and upon its removal there was heat and mild swelling on palpation of the medial metatarsal region. The horse was immediately rested for 7 days and treated with nonsteroidal anti-in flammatory drugs until returning to training. The mass had fluctuated in size and consistency, generally increasing in size with fluid-like areas on palpation when the horse was in work and decreasing when the horse was restricted to box rest for periods of up to 2 weeks. In total, the horse was in intermittent exercise for approximately 3 months. The horse was eventually taken out of training because the mass had remained large and become rm. The referring veterinary surgeon had attempted to drain the fluid 4 days prior to referral and had reported a small amount of dark, haemorrhagic discharge, however the swelling remained. On presentation the mare was bright, alert and responsive with vital parameters within normal limits. Physical examination identi ed a smooth, rm, approximately 8 93 cm soft tissue mass on the medial aspect of the left metatarsus overlyingthe second and third metatarsal bones, which appeared to involve the subcutaneous tissues ( Fig 1 ). There were also multiple small super cial abrasions over the left and right medial metatarsophalangeal joints and third metatarsal bones. Full limb flexion did not elicit a pain response, although palpation of the swelling was resented. Palpation of the suspensory ligament and flexor tendons proximal or distal to the swelling demonstrated no signi cant abnormalities. The mare was lame grade 2/5 (AAEP) left hind at trot in a straight line on a hard surface. Full flexion of the left hindlimb did not affect the degree of lameness. Due to signs consistent with local in flammation, the pain response elicited by the horse upon palpation of the swelling, and the clinical history, performing diagnostic anaesthesia was not deemed necessary. Diagnosis Radiographic examination of the left metatarsal regionshowed a homogenous mass of soft tissue opacity within thesubcutaneous tissue on a dorsoplantar view. There were nosigni cant bony abnormalities detected ( Fig 2 ). Results of ultrasonographic evaluation were consistent with thickenedsubcutaneous tissue (1.5 cm thick including skin) overlying a \u00a92016 organised layer of tissue (approximately1 cm thick), which extended along the body and theproximal aspect of the medial branch of the suspensoryligament. The mass was surrounded by a brous capsule(0.4 cm thick) and there was no evidence of involvement of the underlying soft tissue structures. Based on the clinical observations and diagnostic imaging, the mass was tentatively diagnosed as a chronic, subcutaneous haematoma. Treatment and outcome Surgical removal was indicated because of the size andlocation of the mass, and the lack of response toconservative usingisoflurane in 100% oxygen. The horse was positioned in left lateral recumbency and a tourniquet was placed proximal to the tarsus on the left hindlimb. The surgical site was aseptically prepared and draped. A 20 cm curvilinear incision was made over the caudal border of the mass on the medial aspect of the left metatarsus. The skin and subcutaneous layers were separated from the capsule of the mass using both sharp and blunt dissection, and the resultant skin flap was re flected dorsally. The mass had a thick capsule that was adhered to the subcutaneous tissue and to the periosteum at the dorsomedial aspect of the third metatarsal bone. The medial plantar vein was identi ed and separated from the capsule and 4 small branches of the vessel were ligated with No. 2-0 polydioxanone suture as they coursed towards the mass. The mass was removed in its Fig 1: Photograph of the distal hindlimbs of the horse. The mass is localised on the medial aspect of the mid-metatarsus of the lefthindlimb.

The skinflap was trimmed to remove redundant tissue and allow better apposition of the skin edges. The subcutaneous tissuewas closed with a simple continuous pattern interrupted in 3locations using No. 2-0 polydioxanone suture, and the skinincision was closed using No. 1 polydioxanone suture in asimple interrupted pattern ( Fig 3 ). The distal limb was bandaged with a double-layer cotton wool bandage and the horse recovered uneventfully. The excised mass, which was approximately 10 9490.4 cm, was submitted for histopathological examination ( Fig 4 ). Follow-up bandage change 72 h after surgery identi ed a small amount of haemorrhagic discharge on the dressing but the surgical site was clean and dry with minimal swelling. The horse was discharged from the hospital 3 days post-surgery. The horse was sound at walk at discharge from the hospital. In total, the horse received a 5-day course of procaine penicillin (22,000 iu/kg bwt) and mg/kg bwt) post-operatively. The duration of antimicrobial medication was based on the perceived risk factors for infection in the surgical area. These included attempted drainage by the referring veterinary surgeon prior to referral, clipping of the limb more than 24 h prior to surgery, the possibility of the mass having an infected or contaminated component, and post-operatively due to the presence of serosanguinous discharge seen at the rst bandage change. The owner reported that the surgical site had remained clean and dry at the rst bandage change following discharge from the hospital allowing discontinuation of further antimicrobial therapy. Discharge instructions included box rest with a distal limb bandage in place for 4 weeks to minimise movement of the limb and to provide even pressure over the surgerysite in an effort to prevent dead space and reformation of the mass. After the initial 4 weeks of box rest, small paddock turnout was allowed for 8 weeks prior to re- evaluation.Histopathological examination After routine tissue processing, standard haematoxylin andeosin staining was performed for examination. Thehistopathological diagnosis was that of a chronic, organisinghaematoma with evidence of granulation tissue. There wasno evidence of atypical or neoplastic cell proliferation, or ofan active bacterial infection.

There wasno evidence of residual heat or pain on palpation of thearea; however, there was mild, diffuse thickening the medialaspect of the distal metatarsus. At the time, the horse wascon ned to a small paddock and was expected to make a gradual return to training over the following 12 weeks. Discussion This report describes surgical management of a large, chronichaematoma most likely caused by a repetitive interferenceinjury in a SB racehorse. The diagnosis was con rmed by the appearance of the mass at surgery and histopathologicalexamination. To our knowledge, this is the rst report of surgical excision to resolve a chronic haematoma secondaryto repeated trauma in a SB racehorse. In this case, the differential diagnoses included an organised abscess, soft tissue tumour such as a brosarcoma (Story et al. 2005), a benign soft tissue tumour or giant cell tumour of soft parts (Schaffer et al. 2013), a hamartoma (Saifzadeh et al. 2006), or signi cant pathology associated with the second metatarsal bone or suspensory ligament and subsequent secondary swelling of the overlying soft tissues. The majority of interference injuries, in the authors ' experience, respond to drainage, rest, bandaging and anti- inflammatory medication. However, in some cases, an indwelling Penrose drain may be necessary to facilitate resolution of the haematoma. In more chronic cases, when the haematoma is organised, resection of the entire encapsulated haematoma is required to prevent repeated interference and return the horse to racing soundness. In this case, surgical intervention was necessary because the horse failed to respond to conservative management. The horse responded positively to surgical resection of the haematomawith routine antimicrobial and anti-in flammatory treatment, alongside speci c bandaging and restricted exercise management to obtain the best possible post-operative functional and cosmetic appearance. The cosmetic appearance of the limb on follow-up examination was somewhat disappointing. However, due to the size and chronic nature of the original injury, some residual thickening of the surgical site was expected despite the prolonged period of bandaging and box rest. In this case, the horse 's soundness and lack of sensitivity associated with palpation of the limb were of more clinical signi cance and permitted a return to training. Repeat ultrasonography of the suspensory ligament was not deemed necessary due to the horse 's comfort levels and lack of abnormal ndings at initial presentation. Given the histopathological ndings, which ruled out the presence of active bacterial infection, thecourse of antimicrobial medication could have beenreduced to perioperative administration only, although theresults were not available in the immediate post-operativeperiod. Perioperative use of antimicrobial medication wouldhave suf ciently addressed the issue of skin contamination prior to surgery. In the absence of other clinical signsconsistent with infection, the serosanguinous discharge notedat the rst bandage change was probably in flammatory in nature and due to the presence of dead space at thesurgical site.The positive response to treatment in this case indicates that the haematoma was the predominant cause of the horse 's lameness at the time of presentation; however, the authors appreciate that in many circumstances, the formation of a haematoma or seroma may be secondary to a pre-existing lameness causing gait abnormality. Standardbred racehorses have a unique pacing gait, for which there is no evidence to suggest a predisposition to injury in comparison with other athletic equine disciplines. Interference injuries are likely to be under-reported due to the variable presentation and effect they may have on a horse 's soundness. In our practice, these are a relatively common complaint and the vast majority are managed conservatively. In cases of repeated trauma to the same region, the haematoma is larger and therefore more likely to cause further interference. As the haematoma becomes more chronic and organised, drainage of any free fluid from the cavity will not resolve the soft tissue abnormality. This cycle of events can lead to loss of use of the horse for racing purposes unless surgical intervention is carried out. This case report describes a surgical treatment option for those cases, which are nonresponsive to the routine conservative treatment of interference injuries, as a means to return the horse to training and racing. Surgical extirpation of the haematoma was successfully performed and remains a valid option for management of similar injuries in the future.

Brief Summary (For Full Prescribing Information, see package insert) CAUTION: Federal (USA) law restricts this drug to use by or on the order of a licensed veterinarian. DESCRIPTION: Clodronate disodium is (dichloromethylene) salt and is manufactured from the tetrahydrate form. INDICATION: For the control of clinical signs associated with navicular syndrome in horses. CONTRAINDICATIONS: Horses with hypersensitivity to clodronate disodium should not receive OSPHOS. WARNINGS: Do not use in horses intended for human consumption. HUMAN WARNINGS: Not for human use. Keep this and all drugs out of the reach of children. Consult a physician in case of acci-dental human exposure. PRECAUTIONS: As a class, bisphosphonates may be associ- ated with gastrointestinal and renal toxicity. Sensitivity to drug associated adverse reactions varies with the individual patient. Renal and gastrointestinal adverse reactions may be associated with plasma concentrations of the drug. Bisphosphonates are excreted by the kidney; therefore, conditions causing renal im-pairment may increase plasma bisphosphonate concentrations resulting in an increased risk for adverse reactions. Concurrent administration of other potentially nephrotoxic drugs should be approached with caution and renal function should be mon-itored. Use of bisphosphonates in patients with conditions or diseases affecting renal function is not recommended. Administration of bisphosphonates has been associated with abdominal pain (colic), discomfort, and agitation in horses. Clinical signs usually occur shortly after drug administration and may be associated with alterations in intestinal motility. In horses treated with OSPHOS these clinical signs usually began within 2 hours of treatment. Horses should be monitored for at least 2 hours following administration of OSPHOS. Bisphosphonates affect plasma concentrations of some min- erals and electrolytes such as calcium, magnesium and po-tassium, immediately post-treatment, with effects lasting up to several hours. Caution should be used when administering bisphosphonates to horses with conditions affecting mineral or electrolyte homeostasis (e.g. hyperkalemic periodic paralysis, hypocalcemia, etc.). The safe use of OSPHOS has not been evaluated in horses less than 4 years of age. The effect of bisphosphonates on the skel-eton of growing horses has not been studied; however, bisphos-phonates inhibit osteoclast activity which impacts bone turnover and may affect bone growth. Bisphosphonates should not be used in pregnant or lactating mares, or mares intended for breeding. The safe use of OSPHOS has not been evaluated in breeding horses or pregnant or lac-tating mares. Bisphosphonates are incorporated into the bone matrix, from where they are gradually released over periods of months to years. The extent of bisphosphonate incorporation into adult bone, and hence, the amount available for release back into the systemic circulation, is directly related to the to-tal dose and duration of bisphosphonate use. Bisphosphonates have been shown to cause fetal developmental abnormalities in laboratory animals. The uptake of bisphosphonates into fetal bone may be greater than into maternal bone creating a possible risk for skeletal or other abnormalities in the fetus. Many drugs, including bisphosphonates, may be excreted in milk and may be absorbed by nursing animals. Increased bone fragility has been observed in animals treated with bisphosphonates at high doses or for long periods of time. Bisphosphonates inhibit bone resorption and decrease bone turnover which may lead to an inability to repair micro damage within the bone. In humans, atypical femur fractures have been reported in patients on long term bisphosphonate therapy; how-ever, a causal relationship has not been established. ADVERSE REACTIONS: The most common adverse reactions reported in the eld study were clinical signs of discomfort or nervousness, colic and/or pawing. Other signs reported were lip licking, yawning, head shaking, injection site swelling, and hives/pruritus. Distributed by: Dechra Veterinary Products 866-933-2472 \u00a9 Dechra Ltd.

L. Pye*, N. M. Collins and A. R. Adkins Scone Equine Hospital, Scone, standing surgery Summary This case report is the rst published description of a minimally invasive transurethral endoscopic-guided approach to repair multiple bladder tears in a standing mare. The mare was diagnosed with a ruptured bladder 48 h post-partum based on clinical signs, transabdominal ultrasonography, serum and peritoneal fluid analysis, and and epidural anaesthesia and with cystoscopic were sutured using an articulating endoscopic suturing device. The device was placed transurethrally and a simple continuous pattern of 2-0 braided lactomer used to close two full-thickness tears. The surgery time was 50 min and no complications were encountered. Cystoscopy 60 days post-operatively con rmed complete healing of the tears and no evidence of urolithiasis. Introduction Urinary bladder rupture in mares occurs most commonlyfollowing parturition (Nyrop et al. 1984; Jones et al. 1996). Clinical signs of uroperitoneum in post-partum mares are nonspeci c and may be delayed by 3 -5 days after the initial injury (Walesby et al. 2002; Jenei 2012). Uroperitoneum can be diagnosed through a combination of serum haematology and biochemistry, peritoneal fluid analysis, cystoscopy and transcutaneous abdominal ultrasonography (Jenei 2012). Singular bladder tears <5 cm in length have been managed conservatively by bladder decompression and urine drainage from the abdomen (Walesby et al. 2002). However, spontaneous healing of large or multiple bladder tears may be impaired by complications such as peritonitis, which can be exacerbated by the use of indwelling urinary catheters and abdominal drains (Gibson et al. 1992; Walesby et al. 2002). Surgical repair of large or multiple tears is recommended to avoid the prolonged hospitalisation and treatment associated with conservative management, and there are several methods described. The traditional ventral celiotomy approach requires full traction on the bladder to expose defects, which may be problematic if the tear is associated with excessive tissue damage (Nyrop et al. 1984). Furthermore, exteriorisation of the bladder and closure of a defect that is located in the caudal part of the bladder may pose technical dif culty (Rodgerson et al. 1999; Schott and Woodie 2012). In addition, horses suffering bladder rupture and uroperitoneum are generally acknowledged to have an increased risk of complications during general anaesthesia (Rijkenhuizen et al. 2008). Standing surgical approaches have been developed to avoid the risks of general anaesthesia and attempt toprovide better surgical access to the bladder (Rodgerson et al. 1999; Higuchi et al. 2002; Stephen et al. 2009). In standing mares, the bladder can be everted into the vagina for visualisation and repair of defects via an incision in either the urethra or the vaginal wall, or via a urethral sphincterotomy (Rodgerson et al. 1999; Higuchi et al. 2002). However, these procedures may not be feasible for repairing a defect in the caudal part or neck of the bladder, and the urethral sphincterotomy approach has been associated by some authors with post-operative urine dribbling and urine pooling (White 1977; Higuchi et al. 2002). More recently, laparoscopic techniques have been developed for the repair of bladder tears in standing and recumbent horses (Rijkenhuizen et al. 2008; Tuohy et al. 2009; Hendrickson and Lee 2012). Although less invasive than open surgery, laparoscopy is associated with technique-speci c challenges. Furthermore, in a post-partum mare prior to uterine involution, the enlarged uterus may interfere with visualisation of the bladder and attempts to surgically repair the tear via a laparoscopic approach. Minimally invasive techniques are increasingly being adopted in veterinary surgery; with reduced trauma to soft tissue, decreased post-operative pain and shorter convalescence being cited as key advantages. This report describes a minimally invasive transurethral endoscopic-guided approach to repair multiple bladder tears successfully in a standing mare. Case details Case history and clinical ndings A 6-year-old Thoroughbred mare was presented to SconeEquine Hospital 's Clovelly Intensive Care Unit for evaluation of dull demeanour 2 days after foaling uneventfully. On admission the mare displayed dull mentation, mild tachycardia (52 beats/min) and tachypnoea (34 breaths/ min). She had injected oral mucous membranes and an increased skin tent. Diagnosis Haematological and biochemical analysis of blood obtainedprior to 78 g/L large volume of anechoic within the abdominal cavity by transcutaneous abdominalultrasonography. Abdominocentesis yielded a sample of paleyellow fluid creatinine concentration of 2672 lmol/L (rr: 161 -237lmol/L) and a 6.8910 9cells/L (rr: 0.0 -7.59109cells/L). Cystoscopy con rmed the diagnosis of bladder rupture. Three defects in the bladder mucosa were visualised, all of which were cranial to the ureteral ori ces. The rst was a full- thickness linear tear at the cranioventral apex of the bladder, approximately 2 cm in length. Urine could be seen draining from the bladder into the peritoneal cavity via this tear. The second tear (4 cm long) was located more caudally than the rst, in the left dorsolateral aspect of the bladder ( Fig 1 ) and a transurethral 5 mm laparoscopic needle driver could be passed through this defect. The tissue at the margins of both of these tears was swollen and erythematous. The third tear was located ventrally and immediately cranial to the trigone area of the bladder. The third tear was the shortest (1.5-2 cm) and most super cial of the three, involving only the urothelial and submucosal layers of the bladder wall. Based on the clinical signs, serum and peritoneal fluid biochemistry, ultrasonography and cystoscopy, a diagnosis of uroperitoneum due to rupture of the urinary bladder was made. Treatment Preoperative medical management A 14 gauge over-the-wire polyurethane catheter1was placed in each jugular vein. Intravenous fluid therapy was initiated with 30 L 0.9% sodium chloride solution2at 20 mL/kg bwt for 1 h (bwt/h), followed by 10 mL/kg bwt/h for 4 h. A 28 French blunt-tipped trocar catheter (Argle)3was inserted into the peritoneal cavity just right of ventral midline and 40 Lpale yellow fluid was drained. A 24 French Foley urinary catheter 4was placed transurethrally into the bladder with only a small volume of urine obtained. Perioperative therapywas initiated with benzylpenicillin sodium (BenPen mg/kg per os q. 24 h).Surgical technique Surgery was performed 5 h after admission. The mare wasrestrained in standing stocks and sedated bwt morphine sulfate to 10 mL with sterile saline (0.9% sodium chloride) solution. During the procedure, 0.9% sodium chloride solution was administered i.v. at a rate of 5 mL/kg bwt/h. In preparation for surgery, faeces were manually evacuated from the rectum and the mare 's tail was tied dorsally. The vulva, perineal region chlorhexidine gluconate 4% solution10 and the tail gate of the stocks was draped. The operating surgeon was positioned behind the mare and controlled the long handled instruments. A 10 mmdiameter bre optic videoendoscope (Hopkins Forward - Oblique Telescope) 11was inserted transurethrally into the bladder. One surgical assistant stood at the right hand side of the operating surgeon, holding the endoscope in place within the bladder lumen. A second surgical assistant stood to the left of the operating surgeon and controlled the direction of the flexible endoscope to keep the surgical site within the endoscopic eld of view and maintain insuf flation of the bladder with air injected through the biopsy channel of the flexible endoscope. A 43 cm articulating endoscopic suturing device (SILS Stitch)3was passed into the bladder via the urethra. The longitudinal tear at the left dorsal aspect of the caudalbladder was sutured rst. Beginning at the cranial aspect of the tear, suture material was passed through both wound edges, and then the suture was anchored by passing the needle through a small preformed overhand loop that had been created on the end of the suture strand prior to introducing the suture into the bladder. The wound edges (which were not debrided) were apposed from the cranial to the caudal aspect of the tear in a simple continuous pattern using a 2-0 braided lactomer (Polysorb) 3. This required the articulating arm of the device to be used at a 60 -75\u00b0angle and its tip to be rotated to create triangulation for ease of needle placement. An intracorporeal knot was tied at the caudal end of the continuous suture line with the aid of 45 cm 5 mm straight needle holders11(Fig 2 ). Suture ends were cut using 45 cm 5 mm laparoscopic scissors10. The second defect on the cranioventral floor of the bladder was repaired in the same manner as the rst, although 43 cm 5 mm laparoscopic needle drivers were used to grasp and lift the bladder for ease of needle placement ( Fig 3 ). The third defect was considered too super cial to require suturing. Total surgical time was 50 min. Post-operative care Six hours post-operatively, the mare displayed mildtachycardia (48 beats/min) and dull mentation. The day aftersurgery, her heart rate was 40 beats/min, her demeanour hadimproved and she showed normal maternal behaviourtoward her foal. No unproductive straining during micturitionwas observed in the 6 day post-operative hospitalisationperiod. The abdominal drain was removed 24 h post-surgeryas transabdominal ultrasonography identi ed no free fluid Fig 1: Endoscopic view of the second tear located in the dorsolateral aspect of the bladder. \u00a92016 EVJ Ltd128 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / MARCH 2018had accumulated in the peritoneal cavity. The urinarycatheter was maintained for 3 days post-operatively.Intravenous fluids were continued for 3 days at 1 l/h to maintain adequate hydration. Benzyl penicillin, gentamicinand flunixin meglumine were administered at the dose rates mentioned previously for 6 days. Outcome Serum urea, creatinine and electrolytes values had returnedto reference ranges 12 h post-operatively. Abdominalultrasonography was performed on Day 1, Day 2 and Day 4post-operatively and no free fluid had accumulated in the peritoneum. No post-operative complications wereencountered and the mare was discharged from hospital6 days after admission. Cystoscopy was repeated 60 days post-operatively and the bladder was holding approximately 3 L of urine. The tearshad healed completely, no suture material was visible in thelumen and no urinary calculi had formed. The only evidenceof the bladder tears that could be seen was a 2 93c m area of erythematous mucosa in the cranioventral apex of the bladder ( Fig 4 ). The mare had been bred 19 days after discharge from hospital, and had retained her pregnancy at the 45 day post-ovulatory pregnancy scan. Discussion Traditionally, a double layer closure of the bladder with acontinuous inverting suture pattern is preferred, and thesuture should not penetrate the lumen of the bladdermucosa, as it may potentiate the formation of cystic calculi(Schott and Woodie 2012). The recommendation in theequine veterinary literature to avoid suture material in thelumen of the bladder arises from the use of nonabsorbablesuture materials (Kaminski et al. 1978; Edwards et al. 1995). Kaminski et al. (1978) reported that calculi formed in the alkaline urine of rabbits when experimentally createdcystotomies were sutured with nonabsorbable materials.Edwards et al. (1995) described the formation of a urolith when nonabsorbable staples were used to repair a rupturedbladder in a foal. In contrast, bladder repair has beenperformed in mature horses using absorbable suture materialplaced through the full thickness of the bladder withoutany reported post-operative urinary calculi formation (Higuchiet al. 2002; Stephen al. 2009). Furthermore, in human urological surgery, absorbable suture materials are routinelyused to suture bladder mucosa and therefore are exposed tourine in the lumen of the bladder. However, epithelialisationand subsequent absorption of the intraluminal suture portionstypically and Vourganti 2012). The absorbable suture material used in this case was selected as it holds tensile strength for 21 days, by which time the bladder should have regained the majority of its prewounding strength (Bellah 1989), and is completely absorbed by hydrolysis in 60 days. Although urinary calculi have been diagnosed 10 months post-operatively following bladder rupture repair with nonabsorbable stables (Edwardset al. 1995), we believe that the formation of calculi was very unlikely in this case as cystoscopy at 60 days post-operatively con rmed healing of the defects and no evidence of suture material within the lumen of the bladder. Fig 2: The continuous suture pattern was ended with an intracorporeal knot at the caudal end of the tear. The knot wastied with the aid of 45 cm 5 mm straight needle holders. Fig 3: Repairing the cranioventral bladder tear using the Sils-Stitch suturing device with endoscopic guidance. Fig 4: Cystoscopy 60 days post-surgery showing the healed tearat the dorsolateral aspect of the bladder. \u00a92016 EVJ VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / MARCH 2018Atrioventricular conduction disturbances have been reported to occur in foals and mature horses anaesthetised for urinary bladder rupture repair (Rijkenhuizen et al. 2008; Haga et al. 2011). Although this mare had normal cardiac rhythm on auscultation, not all cardiac abnormalitiesassociated with hyperkalaemia are detectable byauscultation. Therefore, in light of her preoperative serumelectrolyte disturbances it may have been prudent toperform an electrocardiogram in order to assess her cardiacfunction more thoroughly prior to administering sedation. Single layer closure of bladder tears had comparable mechanical strength to a double layer closure in a study inclinically healthy neonatal calves (Boure et al. 2005). However, a double layer closure is most commonlyrecommended for cystorrhaphy in large animals, and theauthors are unaware of a study comparing the burstingstrength of single and double layer patterns in mature horseswith bladder tears. The repair described in this case reportlacked a second, inverting suture layer, and therefore aurinary catheter was left in place for 3 days post-operativelyas a precaution, to limit distension of the bladder and avoidexcessive pressure on the suture lines. Broad spectrumintravenous antibiotics were administered for 6 days followingsurgery to minimise the possibility of retrograde infection. Theconcurrent use of an aminoglycoside and a nonsteroidalanti-in flammatory drug is generally not recommended in a horse with azotaemia, but was considered justi able in this case as the mare 's azotaemia resolved quickly (within 12 h after surgery). To reduce further the risk of renal compromise,i.v.fluids had been administered for 3 days post-operatively to maintain adequate circulatory volume and tissue perfusion. The standing transurethral endoscopic-guided technique offers a novel, minimally-invasive alternative for repair of bladder rupture in mares. The main bene ts of the standing transurethral endoscopic-guided approach over exploratory laparotomy are the avoidance of general anaesthesia, the absence of any incision into the peritoneal cavity and excellent surgical access to bladder tears, which may have otherwise been challenging to reach. The conventional laparoscopic approach provides improved surgical access to the bladder compared to laparotomy, but still necessitates placing traction on the intrapelvic bladder to manoeuvre it into a more cranial abdominal position for intracorporeal suturing (Rijkenhuizen et al. 2008). Furthermore, laparoscopic surgery is associated with uncommon but serious complications includinginadvertent puncture of the bowel or spleen, and laceration ofthe circum flex iliac artery during cannula placement (Hendrickson 2009). The technique described in this case reporteliminates these risks and also may afford improved access tocaudally located tears, allowing them to be sutured withoutplacing traction on potentially weakened, friable bladdertissue. The advantages of this technique over conservativemanagement of bladder tears include a comparatively shortconvalescence (6 days in hospital), avoidance of prolongedantibiotic therapy and lack of complications such as peritonitisand cystitis from indwelling urinary culty maintaining insuf flation of the bladder was encountered in this case, affording excellent visualisation ofthe tears. However, it may be more challenging to maintaininsuf flation with large tears due to loss of air into the abdominal cavity and an increase in intra-abdominal pressure.Investigation into the potential use (Glycomer) 3for transurethral endoscopic-guided intraluminal closure of bladder tears is warranted. Barbed suture resulted in a bladder repair that was equal in bursting strength to standard suture materials in a recent equine cadaveric study (Ruzickova et al. 2016). The use of a knotless, barbed suture in an automated laparoscopic suturing device could potentially improve ease of suture placement and reduce operative time. However, the absorption pro le of Glycomer3is approximately 30 -40 days longer than Polysorb3, which may increase the risk of urinary calculi formation. The disadvantages of the transurethral endoscopic- guided approach include the cost and availability of the specialised equipment and the need to develop pro ciency in laparoscopic suturing; however, these are not insurmountable problems as we strive to reduce the morbidity in our patients. In summary, standing transurethral endoscopic-guided intraluminal closure of bladder tears may be considered a viable surgical approach in mares.

Surg. anaemia and bilateral uveitis associated withleptospirosis in a 6-year-old Quarter Horse gelding K. M. Delph*, E. Sharpe, L. A. Beardand A. J. Rankin Department of Clinical Sciences; andDepartment of Ophthalmology, Kansas State was presented forbilateral uveitis resulting in vision loss as well as icterus.Anaemia autoagglutination was consistent with agglutination test (MAT) titres were elevated to multiple serovars supportive of a diagnosis of leptospirosis. Treatments included broad spectrum antibiotics and aggressive anti- inflammatory medications. While the horse was hospitalised, the development of bilateral corneal ulcers precluded the use of topical ophthalmic anti-in flammatories for a number of days. The corneal ulceration resolved, vision returned in both eyes and the immune-mediated haemolytic anaemia resolved. After 9 days of hospitalisation, oral minocycline was administered for 2 weeks at home as well as low dose oral flunixin meglumine and topical ophthalmic diclofenac and atropine. This case represents the rst published case of haemolytic anaemia associated with leptospirosis in a horse. Introduction Leptospirosis in horses in North America is most commonlyassociated with Leptospira interrogans is considered to be a host-adapted serovarin horses by some (Barwick et al. 1998); however, others believe it to be pathogenic. Host-adapted leptospiralserovars are characterised by lack of clinical disease, minimalantibody response and persistence of leptospires in theproximal renal tubules of maintenance hosts which allows forcontamination of the environment to infect both incidentaland host-adapted species. Leptospires penetrate mucousmembranes or abraded skin and cause pathology byinducing endothelial damage (Adler and de la Pena-Moctezuma 2010). Diseases associated with leptospirosis inhorses include reproductive failure (abortion andhydrallantois), equine recurrent uveitis (ERU), renal failure,respiratory disease and fetal hepatic disease (Divers 2015). Tothe authors 'knowledge there are no case reports in the literature describing haemolytic anaemia in horses due to leptospirosis. Case history A 6-year-old Quarter Horse gelding weighing 477 kgpresented to the Kansas State University Veterinary HealthCenter (KSU-VHC) with bilateral severe uveitis, inappetanceand icterus. The horse was purchased approximately 1 month prior to presentation and past medical and vaccination history were unknown. A mild cough and serous nasal discharge were noted 2 weeks prior to presentation. Five days prior to presentation, bilateral blepharedoema andocular opacities were seen by the owner. Two days prior to presentation, vision loss was noticed by the owner. The referring veterinarian prescribed flunixin meglumine (Banamine 11.1 mg/kg bwt i.v.) to decrease crystalline free acid (Excede2, 6.6 mg/kg bwt i.m.) for a potential infectious aetiology the day before presentation. Topical ophthalmic medications prescribed included atropine ophthalmic ointment 1%3(q. 12 h in both eyes) to decrease intraocular pain and neomycin, polymyxin B sulfates and dexamethasone suspension4(q. 4 h in both eyes) to decrease intraocular inflammation. The referring veterinarian also noted icterus of the sclera and oral mucous membranes at that time. The horse was referred for further evaluation. Clinical ndings Physical examination revealed a bright horse with obviousvision impairment walking into the hospital. Vital parameterswere within normal limits. Icterus was noted examination, botheyes were open and appeared comfortable. The menaceresponse was inconsistent in the right eye and absent in the lefteye. Both direct and consensual pupillary light re flexes were absent bilaterally due to the administration of topical ophthalmic atropine. Palpebral re flexes were present bilaterally. Intraocular pressures (TonoVet rebound tonometer) 5 were mildly decreased in both eyes (8 and 9 mmHg,respectively; reference range 10 -34 mmHg). Visualisation of the pupils was partially obstructed by brin in the anterior chamber, but both pupils were miotic (the left pupil was moremiotic than the right). Fluorescein stain was negative in botheyes, but there were areas of epithelial roughening noted inboth corneas. Mild generalised corneal oedema and 1 + aqueous flare (reference grade trace to 4 +) were present bilaterally. A large brin clot lled 75% of the anterior chamber of the right eye and a large brinohaemorrhagic clot lled 75% of the anterior chamber of the left eye. The lens and retina were not able to be examined due to the presence of brin clots in the anterior chamber of each eye. Initial blood work revealed multiple abnormalities (Table 1 ). Mild anaemia with autoagglutination dehydration whichindicated that the haematocrit would be signi cantly lower once the horse was hydrated. Total white blood cell anddifferential counts were within normal limits; however,hyper brinogenaemia indicated signi cant in flammation. Serum biochemistry revealed elevated total, direct and indirect bilirubin, most likely due to haemolysis. Sorbitol dehydrogenase was elevated indicating acute hepatic insult, but all other liver enzymes were within normal limits. Azotaemia was not present. Diagnostics Based on physical examination and initial blood workndings, further diagnostics were utilised in order to identify a systemic source of in flammation that would cause severe bilateral anterior uveitis and IMHA. Differentials for acute anterior uveitis with coli , septicaemia, such as that associated with Salmonella infection, systemic immune-mediated response, such as IMHA and much less likely Borrelia burgdorferi due to the geographic area not being endemic for Lyme disease and Rhodococcus equi based on his age (Neil et al. 2010; Hollingsworth 2011; Priest et al. 2012). Differentials for IMHA included primary IMHA or secondary to infectious aetiologies including equine infectious anaemia, Clostridium perfringen, and leptospirosis as described in other species (Decker et al. 1970; Smith and Armstrong 1975; Solmazgul et al. 2005; Nassiri et al. 2011), drugs (penicillin or trimethoprim sulfonamide), (Weiss and Moritz2003; Aleman ultrasoundrevealed mild comet tails present cranioventrally bilaterallyand abdominal ultrasound revealed no abnormalities. Rectalpalpation revealed mildly enlarged ileac lymph nodes.Urinalysis revealed highly concentrated urine (urine speci c gravity 1.035) consistent with mild dehydration. Trace protein,trace haem consistent with haemoglobinuria and severebilirubinuria were found on urine dipstick analysis. Sedimentexamination was grossly discoloured by the bilirubinuria, butwas otherwise within normal limits. Cytological examination ofperitoneal fluid revealed a high protein transudate. Serum was submitted for equine infectious M protein titre and leptospirosismicroscopic agglutination test (MAT). Urine was submitted for Leptospira species polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Finally, whole blood was submitted for red blood cell surface immunoglobulin testing by direct immuno fluorescence using flow cytometry to con rm IMHA. antimicrobials i.v. q. 24 h]) were initiated as systemic infection was the working diagnosis causing bilateral anterior uveitis and immune-mediated haemolytic anaemia. Dexamethasone7 (0.04 mg/kg 24 h) was administered in order toameliorate the immune response associated with haemolyticanaemia. Flunixin meglumine (Banamine 11.1 mg/kg bwt was administered as an anti-in flammatory for both systemic and ophthalmic in medications included: diclofenac polymyxin B sulfates and dexamethasone suspension4(q. 4 h in both eyes) and atropine ophthalmic ointment 1%3(q. 12 h in both eyes). The horse was hospitalised and immediately began eating and drinking when directed towards food and water in the stall. The horse developed a mild fever that evening (101.9 \u00b0F, 38.8 \u00b0C), despite administration of nonsteroidal anti- inflammatory medication. The next day the haematocrit declined to 24% once the horse was rehydrated and remained stable throughout the day. Axially located super cial corneal ulcers (size: 8 -994-5 mm) were noted bilaterally the morning after presentation. The aqueous flare and brin clots were the same as the day of presentation. Because of the super cial corneal ulcers, topical ophthalmic anti-in flammatory medications were discontinued and neopolybac ophthalmic ointment (Vetropolycin9q. 6 h in both eyes) and an ophthalmic antifungal ointment (compounded itraconazole 1% ophthalmic ointment with dimethyl sulfoxide/DMSO10q. 6 h in both eyes) were initiated to prevent infection of the corneal ulcers. Itraconazole-DMSO ophthalmic ointment has been proven to be useful for keratomycosis and is nonirritating, especially at the frequency used (Ball et al. 1997a,b; Utter et al. 2010). Atropine ophthalmic ointment 1%3(q.12 h in both eyes) was continued. Over the second to fourth day of hospitalisation, the haematocrit continued to be stable and thedexamethasone 7dose was decreased (0.02 mg/kg bwt i.v. on Day 2, 0.01 mg/kg bwt i.v. on Days 3 and 4) and then discontinued. A positive menace response was noted in the right eye on Day 3 and the left eye on Day 4 as the brin clots in the anterior chambers resolved. The corneal ulcers were starting to heal and by Day 4, ophthalmic diclofenac sodium ophthalmic solution 0.1%8(q. 8 h in both eyes) was reinstituted while continuing ophthalmic antibiotic and antifungal medications. On the fth day of hospitalisation, leptospirosis titres were available. All serovars were ( <1:100) (Table 2 ). Urine PCR was positive for leptospires and with the elevated MAT titres and clinical disease, a diagnosis of leptospirosis was con rmed. The Streptococcus equi M protein titre was not pursued and equine infectious anaemia AGID was negative. Red blood cell surface immunoglobulin testing was found to be within normal limits ( Table 3 ). AfterTABLE 1: Blood work abnormalities on Days 0 and 5 Day 0 Day 5Reference interval Haematocrit ( 910/C02L/L) 0.31 0.23 gentamicin (GentaVed)6and ceftiofur sodium (Naxcel)2 discontinued. Outcome On Day 5, recheck blood work ( Table 1 ) revealed decreasing hyper brinogenaemia. Total and indirect bilirubin were normal consistent with resolution of haemolysis. Direct bilirubin, sorbitol dehydrogenase and gamma-glutamyl consistent with cholestatic hepatic dysfunction but further work-up was not performed due to nancial constraints of the owner. The horse had a nonproductive cough without any nasal discharge. Thoracic auscultation was unremarkable and thoracic ultrasound again only revealed mild comet tails cranioventrally bilaterally. The horse continued to show improvement in the anterior uveitis, vision, haematocrit and fever throughout hospitalisation. The patient was discharged on Day 9 with nodiscomfort, healed corneal ulcers, no aqueous flare and small brin clots in each anterior chamber. Minocycline hydrochloride 11(4 bwt per os q. 24 h), diclofenac sodium ophthalmic solution 0.1%8(q. 8 h in both eyes) and atropine ophthalmic ointment 1%3(q. 24 h in both eyes) were prescribed. Recheck leptospirosis titres were performed by the referring veterinarian 2 weeks after discharge and all were decreased from initial titres ( Table 2 ). Ophthalmic examination by the referring veterinarian at that time was within normal limits and ophthalmic medications were discontinued. Discussion This is the rst published case report of a horse with leptospirosis with de nitive evidence of haemolysis. Even in other species such as cattle and sheep, it is relatively unknown how leptospires cause haemolysis (Thompson 1986; Thompson and to cause haemolysis et al. 1981; Adler and de la Pena-Moctezuma 2010; Aleman 2015). Phospholipase activity has also been purported to cause IMHA as evidenced by spherocytes and agglutination in dogs and humans with snake bite envenomation (Weiss and Moritz 2003). In lambs with haemolytic anaemia attributed to leptospirosis, cold-reacting IgM antibodies have been implicated (Smith and Armstrong 1975; Carlson 2015a). In this case because of autoagglutination, a presumptive diagnosis of IMHA was made; however, red blood cell surface antibody testing via flow cytometry was found to be within normal limits. This perhaps was a false negative result due to the stable haematocrit and possible previous lysis of all immunoglobulin- coated red blood cells, due to degradation of the sample because testing was delayed over a weekend, or due to complement-associated IMHA as has been previously described in horses (McGuire et al. 1969). Immune- mediated haemolytic anaemia can be associated with systemic infection, such as leptospirosis in this case, through the theory of molecular mimicry where there is antibody cross-reaction between epitopes present on infectious agents and autoantigens, as expressed on red blood cells (Nassiri et Tizard anaemia associated with leptospirosis infection has been previously reported in other species including cattle, sheep and man (Decker et al. 1970; Smith and Armstrong 1975; Solmazgul et al. 2005; Nassiri et al. 2011). Hepatic disease is often implicated with leptospirosis, although not de nitively proven (Barsoum et al. 1978; Hathaway et al. 1981). Cholestatic hepatic dysfunction was diagnosed in this case during treatment which could be potentially attributed to leptospirosis; however, further testing was not performed to rule out other causes of cholestatic hepatic dysfunction. Unfortunately, follow-up blood work was not available due to nancial constraints of the owner, so it is unknown if these changes resolved with the course of treatment. Leptospirosis has been associated with acute renal dysfunction in young horses (Hogan et al. 1996; Frazer 1999; Frellstedt and Slovis 2009) and pulmonary haemorrhage with pneumonia in young horses (Broux et al. 2012) and adults (Hamond et al. 2012), but is more commonly associated with ERU (Dwyer et al. 1995; Gilger et al. 2008; Gilger 2010; Divers 2015) and reproductive failure (Bernard et al. 1993; Pinna et al. 2013; Hamond et al. 2014; Divers 2015). In this case, the clinical signs of initial nasal discharge and persistent mild cough could potentially be attributed to leptospirosis-induced interstitial pneumonia. However, diagnostics were not performed to de nitively determine the cause of respiratory signs such as testing for viral/bacterial pathogens or airway sampling. Other possible diagnostic tests to determine thecause of al. 2014). It was not performed due to concerns for complications such as causing more in flammation (Featherstone and Heinrich 2013). By testing aqueous humoursamples, more recent publications have determined that notonly but also agglutination test blood cell surface immunoglobulin testing RBC surface Ig Day 0 Reference interval MARCH 2018In this case, MAT titres at presentation were diagnostic for leptospirosis due to their signi cant elevation and consistent clinical signs; however, multiple serovars were signi cantly elevated precluding any interpretation for serovar. agglutination test titres are serogroup speci c, but signi cant cross reactivity can occur between serovars making interpretation for the infecting serovardifcult (Adler and de la Pena-Moctezuma 2010). Cross- reactivity is also consistent with acute infection and iscommon with serovar Pomona infection (Divers 2015). Follow-up MAT revealed improvement in all titres with treatment.Serovars Bratislava and Pomona were still elevated indicatingthat one of those serovars was possibly the infecting serovar,most likely serovar Pomona as it is a known pathogen in thehorse (Timoney et al. 2011; Divers 2015). Urine culture was not undertaken but could have potentially identi ed the infecting serovar (Adler and de la Pena-Moctezuma 2010; Verma et al. 2013). In this case, it is unknown what risk factors or exposureled to infection. Presumably, the horse was exposed at thenew property; but because the titres were elevated onpresentation, infection likely occurred at least 5 -6 days previously (Yan et al. 2010). Recommended treatment for leptospirosis in horses is penicillin, oxytetracycline, or enro floxacin al. and Slovis 2009; Divers 2015). Exactduration of recommended treatment is unknown. In dogswith leptospirosis, a treatment period of 2 weeks isrecommended (Sykes et al. 2011). Duration of shedding after infection is unknown in horses. In experimental infection ofhorses with serovar Pomona type Kennewicki, urinaryshedding was detected up to 30 days post-infection (Yanet al. 2010). In broodmares that aborted and were treated with 5 days of oxytetracycline, shedding was found up to105 days after infection (Bernard et al. 1993). In this case, follow-up urinary PCR was not performed, but with prolonged treatment with tetracyclines, it was presumed to clear the renal tubules of infection. Because of the zoonotic nature of this disease and potential for shedding leptospires into the environment, the patient was housed in isolation and caretakers wore personal protective equipment. Instructions for isolation at home and wearing protective equipment including gloves were made to the owner upon discharge. This report demonstrates a unique case presentation of leptospirosis in an adult horse with acute bilateral anterior uveitis, haemolytic anaemia, potential respiratory and hepatic involvement, but without evidence of renal failure.

Do not use in humans. Store EQUIOXX Tablets out of the reach of dogs, children, and other pets in a secured location in order to prevent accidental ingestion or overdose. Consult a physician in case of accidental human exposure.Horses should undergo a thorough history and physical examination before initiation of NSAID therapy. Appropriate laboratory tests should be conducted to establish hematological and serum biochemical baseline data before and periodically during administration of any NSAID. NSAIDs may inhibit the prostaglandins that maintain normal homeostatic function. Such anti-prostaglandin effects may result in clinically significant disease in patients with underlying or pre-existing disease that has not been previously diagnosed. Treatment with EQUIOXX should be terminated if signs such as inappetance, colic, abnormal feces, or lethargy are observed. As a class, cyclooxygenase inhibitory NSAIDs may be associated with gastrointestinal, renal, and hepatic toxicity. Sensitivity to drug-associated adverse events varies with the individual patient. Horses that have experienced adverse reactions from one NSAID may experience adverse reactions from another NSAID. Patients at greatest risk for adverse events are those that are dehydrated, on diuretic therapy, or those with existing renal, cardiovascular, and/or hepatic dysfunction. The majority of patients with drug-related adverse reactions recover when the signs are recognized, drug administration is stopped, and veterinary care is initiated.Concurrent administration of potentially nephrotoxic drugs should be carefully approached or avoided. Since many NSAIDs possess the potential to produce gastrointestinal ulcerations and/or gastrointestinal perforation, concomitant use of EQUIOXX with other anti-inflammatory drugs, such as NSAIDs or corticosteroids, should be avoided. The concomitant use of protein bound drugs with EQUIOXX has not been studied in horses. The influence of concomitant drugs that may inhibit the metabolism of EQUIOXX has not been evaluated. Drug compatibility should be monitored in patients requiring adjunctive therapy. The safe use of EQUIOXX in horses less than one year of age, horses used for breeding, or in pregnant or lactating mares has not been evaluated.

C. Gilger Department of Clinical Sciences, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, North Carolina, USA. Corresponding author email: brian_gilger@ncsu.edu In this issue, Delph et al. (2018) describe an interesting case of a young Quarter Horse gelding with leptospirosis, haemolyticanaemia and uveitis. Although, haemolysis has beenassociated leptospirosis the rst report of leptospiral-associated haemolysis in the horse. In most animals, disease associatedwith leptospiral infections is usually subclinical when infectedwith host-adapted serovar known tobe host-adapted is bratislava, and while acute disease has been reported in horses manifested by abortion, renal, respiratory or hepatic disease, it is most common to have subclinical disease with acute infection of leptospirosis in horses, even with infections of non-host-adapted serovars such as Pomona (Divers et al. 1992). However, in dogs, development of acute renal disease and hepatic dysfunction are the most frequent clinical diseases associated with acute leptospirosis (Langston and Heuter 2003). When acute uveitis has been identi ed in a horse, especially when it is bilateral uveitis, a thorough search for asystemic cause should be performed. The authors of thisreport (Delph et al. 2018) appropriately considered endemic systemic diseases such as Streptococcus equi (Hollingsworth 2011). With this report, in the future, we will alsoneed to consider immune-mediated haemolytic anaemia(IMHA) and leptospirosis as potential causes of acute uveitisin horses. The acute uveitis observed in this horse (Delph et al. 2018) was probably associated directly with haemolysis of the presumed IMHA. The IMHA-associated bleeding, endothelial disease, and breakdown of the blood ocular barrier likely culminated in the development of bilateral active uveitis. In this horse (Delph et al. 2018), once the IMHA was effectively treated, the uveitis appeared to resolve rapidly even prior to speci c treatment for leptospirosis (5 days after admission), further providing evidence of the association between the IMHA and acute uveitis. Leptospirosis has long been associated with development of equine recurrent uveitis, a disease syndrome characterised by multiple recurrent episodes of uveitis separated by periods of quiescence of in flammation (Deeg 2016; Gilger 2016). The horse in this report (Delph et al. 2018) had severe bilateral uveitis, but by de nition, it did not have ERU; but instead it had developed acute onset uveitis of only 5 days 'duration. It is important to understand that the uveitis observed in this horse may or may not be directly associated with leptospirosis.Serum titres alone are not suf cient to determine the role of leptospirosis in uveitis (Gilger et al. 2008; Gerding and Gilger 2016). To determine de nitively if the uveitis is associated with leptospirosis, the authors would have had to test ocular leptospiral microscopic agglutination test titres and leptospiral polymerase chain reaction (PCR) on ocular fluids to determine if there is local ocular antibody production or presence of leptospiral DNA, respectively (De Groot-Mijnes et al. 2006; Gilger et al. 2008; Gerding and Gilger 2016). To determine if there is a local ocular antibody response to the leptospiral antigens, a 4-times higher -Whitmer coef cient, or C-value) would need to be measured and this positive C-value would further implicate leptospira as the direct cause for the uveitis (De Groot-Mijnes et al. 2006; Gerding and Gilger 2016). Leptospirosis is thought to cause recurrent uveitis in horses in a similar manner to the pathogenesis of recurrent uveitis in man, where there is documented immune-mediated inflammation (Rathinam 2005; Verma et al. 2010). Studies performed in the 1950s discovered that ERU does not develop until approximately 1 year after the acute leptospiral infection (Roberts 1958). Recent studies have suggested that leptospiral- associated ERU is probably an immune mediated disease in which in ltrating lymphocytes primed against the leptospiral antigens react instead against self-antigens, in the mimicry 'autoimmune reaction (Deeg et al. 2008; Verma et al. 2010). That is, the in ltrating lymphocytes react against self-antigen epitopes similar to the inciting antigens. This cross reaction between leptospiral antigens and ocular tissues has been documented in the horse retina and cornea (Lucchesi and Parma 1999; Verma et al. 2005, 2010; Deeg 2008). The horse of this study (Delph et al. 2018) had instead an acute uveitis that probably did not have sufcient time to develop immune-mediated disease. Some studies have reported a positive culture of leptospiral organisms from equine eyes with acute uveitis (Polle et al. 2014); although cultures of ocular fluids were not done in this report (Delph et al. 2018), the rapid resolution of the uveitis after treatment suggests that intraocular leptospires were not present in this horse. It would be very important, however, that the horse be monitored for the next 12 -18 months to determine if classic ERU will develop. How many horses develop ERU after a rst bout of uveitis is unknown. There are multiple factors that are likely to play a role on whether or not an ocular immune-mediated disease develops, including the type of inciting antigen (e.g. Leptospira ), severity of initial ocular damage, genetic predisposition of the horse, and environmental factors (i.e. level of stress, nutritional status etc.) (Kulbrock et al. 2013; Fritz et al. 2014). As we learn more about the genetic predisposition of horses for ERU, we will be better able to predict (and thus closely monitor) the development of ERU in individual horses. \u00a92016 EVJ Ltd137 10.1111/eve.12693Another factor to consider in this case (Delph et al. 2018) is that the horse may have been shedding leptospiral organisms in the urine, as suggested by the positive urine leptospiral PCR (and could have been con rmed by a leptospiral culture). If this horse is shedding leptospires, could this be spread to another horse in the hospital and/or barn, and is this horse a risk for zoonosis (Talpada et al. 2003; Hamond et al. 2013)? Should this horse be isolated and monitored for leptospiral urine shedding by repeat PCR or culture? Furthermore, should other horses in contact or exposed to this horse at the hospital or local farm be evaluated or at least have a serum titre collected for leptospira? With the recent marketing of a Leptospira pomona vaccine in the USA, should other horses in the farm be vaccinated? These are questions that cannot de nitively be answered at this time, however, because the horse in this report was recently purchased (1 month or less) prior to becoming ill, it does seem prudent to at least consider vaccinating the other horses at the stable (Wollanke et al. 2004; Rohrbach et al. 2005). Assessment of the farm is also important -is the farm at-risk for leptospirosis? At-risk farms may develop where horseshave frequent contact with leptospiral host-adapted species(e.g. cattle, wildlife, rodents, deer) and where there is standingwater or access to a pond in the pastures (Michna andCampbell 1970; Talpada et al. 2003). Additional information on the clinical features and pathogenesis of leptospirosis in horses is needed to better address these questions. Leptospirosis in the horse is a challenging disease to understand -its role in the pathogenesis of uveitis, ERU, renal disease and haemolysis is not completely understood. In many ways, this disease is typical of the old adage \"the more you study something, the more confusing it gets. \"This does not mean we should give up studying this disease, but we must proceed with the understanding that leptospirosis is a complex, yet interesting disease.

Malalana The Philip Leverhulme Equine Hospital, University of Liverpool, Neston, UK Corresponding author email: f.malalana@liverpool.ac.uk Background Uveitis is a common cause of ocular pain and blindness inhorses (Gilger and Deeg 2011). Leptospira has commonly been implicated in the pathophysiology of uveitis but theexact mechanisms by which Leptospira may trigger the disease are not completely clear. Possible explanations include persistent infection of the ocular media or immunological cross-reaction between Verma al. 2010; Polle et al. 2014). Exposure to Leptospira in horses is common but serum antibody titres do not correlate well with signs of uveitis. Calculation of the Goldmann coef (aqueous antibody titre)provides a better indication of Leptospira involvement, with values >4 supporting the diagnosis of Leptospira -associated uveitis (Gilger 2018). PICO question Are adult horses with uveitis in the UK more likely to haveevidence of leptospirosis compared with adult horses in theUK without evidence of leptospirosis? Search method Medline was searched the following terms: Equine *OR horse *AND leptospir *AND United Kingdom Ireland; Equine *OR horse *AND leptospir *AND uveitis. The search results were evaluated and three articles were considered relevant to the question. Quality of evidence Hathaway et al. (1981) investigated the prevalence of antibodies to a variety of Leptospira serovars in 500 horses intended for export using the microscopic agglutination test(MAT). When a titre of 1:100 was used as reference, they detected 173 positive horses (prevalence 34.6%). They compared these results with those obtained from horses with uveitis for which a blood sample had been submitted for diagnostic purposes; 34 such samples were analysed of which 26 were seropositive (76.5%). Statistical analysis showed a signi cant difference in prevalence between controls and uveitis-affected horses (P <0.025) indicating that horses with uveitis were more likely to be seropositive compared with clinically normal horses in the UK. Limitations of this study are the low number of uveitis cases (34), and the reliance in serum antibody titres alone for the diagnosis of leptospiral- associated uveitis. It is also important to note that the authors did not examine any of the horses in the study and the classi cation was based solely on the information included on the laboratory submission form.In a similar study, Matthews et al. (1987) determined the seroreactivity to 20 Leptospira antigens in 138 horses without ocular disease and 27 horses with uveitis. When a titre of 1:100 was used as reference, the prevalence of positive cases was 9.4% (13/138) for controls and 11.1% (3/27) for the uveitis-affected horses. These authors found no statistically signi cant difference in seroprevalence between these two populations. This study is also limited by the low number of cases and the use of serum antibody titres alone. A recent study by Malalana et al. (2017) also compared seroprevalence to Leptospira between horses without ocular disease and horses with uveitis. The authors obtained eyes, blood and aqueous humour samples from horses subjected to euthanasia for unrelated reasons (controls) and horses that had an eye enucleated for signs of uveitis (cases). Histopathology of all the eyes was performed to con rm uveitis or absence of disease in each case. A titre of 1:100 was also used. In this study, there was no statistical difference in seroprevalence between controls (18/43, 41.9%) and cases (19/29, 65.5%). Only six of the aqueous samples had detectable antibodies against Leptospira and all belonged to uveitis-affected animals; of these, only two had a C-value >4 suggesting a prevalence of Leptospira -associated uveitis of only 6.7% among the uveitis cases. This study is the rst one in the UK to use aqueous humour analysis as well as serology, however, it still has a relatively small number ofcases. Conclusions When using a C-value >4 as evidence of Leptospira - associated uveitis, the study by Malalana et al. (2017) suggests that Leptospira does indeed cause some cases of uveitis in the UK; however, this number appears small compared with other areas of the world. As to whether horses with uveitis in the UK are more likely to be seropositive to Leptospira than controls, the results are con flictive between studies. Combining the three studies (Table 1 ), there is a statistically signi cant difference in seroprevalence between cases and controls ( v2=19.75, P<0.01), but the de nition of case and control in some of these studies makes this interpretation questionable.

Groover*, A. A. Wooldridge and F. J. Caldwell J. T. Vaughan Large Animal Teaching Hospital, Auburn University, Alabama, USA. article is the rst in a three part review series examining glucocorticoid use in treatment of medical conditions and musculoskeletal disorders of the horse. This article provides a review of the structure and function of corticosteroids together with a summary of the available literature pertaining to the pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics and indications for use of, and adverse effects associated with, glucocorticoids currently available for use by equine veterinarians. Introduction Therapeutic corticosteroid use in horses was rst reported in the literature as an effective means of treatingmusculoskeletal disorders via intra-articular (i.a.) orintrasynovial injection (Wheat 1955), and since that timecorticosteroids have been employed to treat a widevariety of disorders of the respiratory, gastrointestinal,musculoskeletal, neurologic, dermatologic, ophthalmic andimmune systems in horses (Sojka et 2004; Ferguson et al. 2009). Corticosteroids were rst identi ed in the 1920s and by the 1940s their bene cial effects had been demonstrated following administration to people with rheumatoid arthritis(Liljebrand 1950). The discovery of corticosteroids wasconsidered a signi cant enough achievement to warrant receipt of the 1950 Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine (Liljebrand 1950), and this signi cance has been proven over the past 75 years as corticosteroids have become one of the most widely used classes of drugs in both human and veterinary medicine (Ferguson et al. 2009; Boothe and Mealey 2012). Endogenous corticosteroids are synthesised in the adrenal cortex from cholesterol and can be divided into three functional groups: the mineralocorticoids, which are produced in the outer zona glomerulosa and in fluence salt and water balance in the body; the glucocorticoids, which are produced in the middle zona fasciculata and have effects on intermediary metabolism; and the androgenic steroids, which are produced in the inner zona reticularis and comprise the sex steroids (Harkins et al. 1993; Ferguson et al. 2009). Mineralocorticoids are rarely used therapeutically inhorses (Ferguson et al. 2009). Historically, synthetic anabolic steroids derived from androgenic hormones such as stanazolol, nandrolone and boldenone, have been used widely in horses both therapeutically to aid recovery from debilitating conditions, and as part of training regimens to optimise performance (Snow 1993). Their use has recently decreased, however, due to increasing restrictions put in place by international drug regulatory authorities and performance horse organisations. Glucocorticoids by contrast, have a wide application in equine medicine, andtherefore this review series will hereafter focus on glucocorticoid use in horses. Despite the widespread use of glucocorticoids in equine practice, standardised protocols based on pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic studies and clinical trials in horses are lacking, with use reported to be frequently based on extrapolation from human data, clinical experience and anecdotal reports (Ferguson et al. 2009). As such, this review series will attempt to summarise the available literature in order to aid in informed decision-making when prescribing glucocorticoid therapy in horses. It should be noted that use of glucocorticoids is prohibited or restricted by many horse organisations worldwide in order to maximise equality within competition elds and protect the safety of horse and rider (Waterman and Durenburger 2015), and clinicians should therefore consult with governing regulatory authorities with regards to restrictions on their use prior to prescribing these medications to horses used for competition or intended for human consumption. Additionally, the range of glucocorticoids registered for use in horses, and the routes of administration for which they are approved, varies widely between countries. As such, clinicians should consult their national veterinary drug register prior to administering any glucocorticoid to a horse and then proceed accordingly within their national legal framework for the administration of veterinary pharmaceuticals. Chemical structure All therapeutic glucocorticoids consist of a 21-carbon, 4-ringsteroid skeleton, similar to that of cortisol ( Fig 1 ). Alterations in this chemical structure are responsible for the differencesdemonstrated between individual synthetic glucocorticoids intheir anti-in flammatory action, relative afnity for glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid receptors, and degree of protein binding ( Fig 1 ) (Ferguson et al. flammatory ef cacy of all synthetic glucocorticoids, if de ned by their ability to suppress the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPAA), is roughly equivalent in horses; however, their anti-in flammatory potency (i.e. the plasma concentration at which maximal adrenal suppression is achieved) differs greatly between individual preparations (Toutain 2012; Bentz 2015) ( Tables 1 and 2). Synthetic glucocorticoids also differ in their relative glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid receptor selectivity in accordance with alterations to their chemical structure, with mineralocorticoid activity, and subsequent in fluence of the medication on body salt and water balance, completely supressed by some synthetic glucocorticoids ( Table 1 ). Addition of a double bond between C1 and C2 potency remains unchanged Fluorination the C9 (as in and enhances both and methylation in dexamethasone betamethasone), or hydroxylation (as in triamcinolone), at (Boothe and Mealey 2012; Toutain 2012). Glucocorticoids can be administered as the base drug alone, or in the form of an ester or an ester salt. Esteri cation of the steroid at C21 affects relative lipid and water solubility and the rate of release of active drug from the basecompound. This in turn, has important implications for the disposition (absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion) and duration of action of the glucocorticoid within the horse following administration (Ferguson et al. 2009; Toutain 2012). The majority of glucocorticoid esters are administered as prodrug formulations, in which the ester must be hydrolysed in order to become biologically active (Bentz 2015). The exceptions to this rule are beclomethasone monopropionate (formed followinglocal hydrolysis of beclomethasone dipropionate), which are active in the lungs following administration via a metered dose inhaler without hydrolysis to their glucocorticoid base HS 1: Chemical structure of cortisol and common synthetic glucocorticoids. The carbon atoms in the steroid skeleton of glucocorticoids are denoted by a C and their numerical position in the skeleton i.e. C1, C2, C3 etc. TABLE 1: Glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid potencies, duration of action and equivalent anti-in 1 1 12 hHydrocortisone 20 1 1 8 -12 h Prednisolone 5 4 0.8 12 -36 h Methylprednisolone 4 5 0.5 12 -36 h Triamcinolone 4 5 0 12 -36 h Triamcinolone acetonide \u00a7- 30-50 0 24 h Betamethasone 0.6 25 h Dexamethasone 0.75 30 / AE / MARCH 2018occurs mainly in the liver making them suitable for i.v. or i.m.administration, while hydrolysis of other esters (e.g. acetates)occurs in different body fluids such as synovial fluid, making them suitable for local administration (Toutain 2012). Estersare additionally hydrolysed rapidly in the lumen of thegastrointestinal tract by pancreatic esterase and absorbedinto the circulation as the free active moiety; therefore thesame medication administered to a horse may beconsidered long-acting when given parenterally and short-acting when given orally, e.g. prednisolone acetate (Toutain2012). Sodium succinate and sodium phosphate ester saltsare highly water soluble, providing a rapid onset of actionand metabolism when administered i.v. or i.m. Acetate anddiacetate esters are moderately soluble and provide a slowrelease of base drug over days to weeks, and acetonide anddipropionate esters are poorly soluble and provide a veryslow release of drug over several weeks followingadministration, therefore these esters are appropriate forsubcutaneous, i.m. or i.a. injection when an extendedduration of action of the glucocorticoid is desired (Fergusonet al. 2009; Bentz 2015). Metabolism and mechanism of action Metabolism Cortisol, and to a lesser degree, corticosterone, are the mainactive endogenous glucocorticoids in horses (Ferguson et al. 2009). The mechanism of action of the syntheticglucocorticoids mimic that of their endogenous counterpartsand they also undergo similar metabolism and elimination ascortisol and corticosterone, with the exception of thedifferences generated by alterations to the chemicalstructure of the basic steroid molecule, as outlined above. Cortisol is produced in horses at rest at an average rate of 0.46 /C60.08 mg/kg bwt/day (Toutain et al. 1988a), regulated by the HPAA. Adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) release from the pituitary gland is stimulated by the actions of corticotropin-releasing hormone, central nervous system input and stress (vasopressin) (Ferguson et al. 2009). Adrenocorticotrophic hormone in turn stimulates the pulsatile release of cortisol from the adrenal glands. Negative feedback occurs at both the hypothalamic and pituitary levels, resulting in decreased synthesis and release of corticotropin-releasing hormone, vasopressin and ACTH when concentrations of cortisol are high ( Fig 2 ). The release of cortisol follows a circadian rhythm in unstressed horses, withpeak concentrations detected between 06.00 h and 09.00 h, and nadirs detected between 17.00 h and 23.00 h (Toutain et al. 1988a,b; Irvine and Alexander 1994; Cordero et al. 2012). This circadian rhythm can be obliterated, however, by exposure of horses to minor stressors, such as a slight change in environment (Irvine and Alexander 1994). Cortisol release is pulsatile in horses, with minute to minute variations in plasma cortisol concentration reported (Toutain 2012). Following its release from the adrenal cortex, cortisol undergoes extra- adrenal metabolism and is converted from its active form (cortisol) to its inactive form (cortisone) via the action of the 11-bhydroxysteroid dehydrogenase system (Ferguson et al. 2009). Cortisol is >90% bound to plasma proteins, with the majority tightly bound to corticosteroid-binding-protein (CBG), ana2-globulin produced in the liver (Ferguson et al. 2009). The remainder is either loosely bound to albumin or circulating free in the plasma. Free cortisol is the active moiety according to the free-hormone hypothesis (Ferguson et al. 2009); however, it is also possible that CBG is able to interact with cell membranes and facilitate entry of cortisol into cells (Gayrard et al. 1996). Synthetic corticosteroids are largely bound to albumin, but prednisolone is also capable of binding with CBG (Alvinerie et al. 1988) and as a consequence cannot be used to conduct adrenal suppression tests in horses, as plasma cortisol concentrations decrease following i.v. administration of prednisolone due tothe displacement of cortisol from CBG rather than as a consequence of adrenal suppression alone. An equilibrium exists between the fractions of free and bound drug within the circulation of horses administered glucocorticoids, as withTABLE 2: Anti-in flammatory potency, receptor binding af and receptor binding (T 1/2) of inhaled glucocorticoids relative to binding T The hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. Negative and positive feedback on this axis occurs in response toconcentrations of endogenous and exogenous corticosteroids inthe body. Negative feedback is denoted by a dashed line,positive feedback is denoted by a solid line. \u00a92016 EVJ EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / MARCH protein-bound drugs, with this equilibrium re-establishedeach time a glucocorticoid molecule enters a cell (Bertone2004). Cortisol is eliminated via oxidation and reduction followed by conjugation to inactive water-soluble derivatives, whichare then eliminated through the kidneys. The majority ofglucocorticoid metabolism occurs in the liver, although renalmetabolism also occurs (Boothe and Mealey 2012). A smallproportion of is excreted unchanged as cortisol inthe urine (Chrousos 2015). Analysis of post-competition urinesamples from 254 horses revealed their geometric mean urinecortisol concentration to be 48 lg/l, with an international threshold for medication control testing consequently set at1 mg/l, approximately 20 times higher than the mean urinecortisol concentration (Popot et al. 1997). Genomic mechanisms of action Alterations in gene expression are the primary way in whichglucocorticoids exert their effect, with resultant clinicalchanges observed on a cellular, tissue, or whole animal levelhours to days after drug administration (Ferguson et al. 2009; Chrousos 2015). Glucocorticoids are lipophilic molecules ofsmall molecular weight, and as such are able to easily crosscell membranes (Stahn et al. 2007). Once within the cytoplasm, they bind to cytosolic glucocorticoid receptors (cGCR) and subsequently migrate to the nucleus (Chrousos 2015). Within the nucleus, activated glucocorticoid/cGCR complexes bind to glucocorticoid receptor elements (GREs) (Stahn et al. 2007). Binding with positive GREs results in transactivation (i.e. induced synthesis) of many regulatory proteins, and conversely binding with negative GREs results in transrepression (i.e. inhibited synthesis) of regulatory proteins (Stahn et al. 2007). These genomic effects are vital in producing the anti-in flammatory effects of glucocorticoids through transactivation of factor- a (Ferguson et al. 2009). Glucocorticoids also interfere with cytokine signalling through the induction of mitogen activated protein kinase phosphatase 1 and inhibition of transcription of nuclear factor j-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (Boothe and Mealey 2012). Nongenomic mechanisms of action Some anti-in flammatory, immunosuppressive and anti -allergic effects of glucocorticoids are observed to occur rapidlyfollowing administration (Stahn et al. 2007). These rapid effects occur via nongenomic mechanisms. Threenongenomic mechanisms of action of glucocorticoids nonspeci membrane-bound receptors; and nongenomic interactions with the cGCR 2007). Physiological effects of glucocorticoids Endogenous glucocorticoids play a pivotal role in maintaininghomeostasis and the function of vital organs through directcellular and permissive effects on intermediary metabolism(Chrousos 2015). The effects of glucocorticoids oncarbohydrate and fat metabolism are promotion ofgluconeogenesis, glycogen synthesis, and lipogenesis, andinhibition of lipolysis and peripheral glucose uptake. Glucocorticoids have catabolic and anti -anabolic effects in the skeletal muscle, skin, connective tissue, peripheral fat, bone, and lymphoid tissue (Chrousos 2015). They also contribute to water and salt balance both through direct effects of cortisol on renal blood flow and through binding to mineralocorticoid receptors (Boothe and Mealey 2012). At therapeutic doses, glucocorticoids are potent endogenous anti-in flammatory and immunosuppressive agents, and it is induction of these effects that is most often the goal of synthetic glucocorticoid administration in equine cases. The anti-in flammatory action of glucocorticoids is multifocal and results from transcription/transrepression of over 2000 genes involved in the in flammatory response (Boothe and Mealey 2012). A key anti-in flammatory mechanism of glucocorticoids is the induction of lipocortin, which inhibits phospholipase 2, the enzyme responsible for induction of the arachidonic acid cascade, and ultimately the production of the mediators thromboxanes, leukotrienes and prostaglandins. only inhibit the cyclooxygenase pathway of the arachidonic acid cascade and subsequent production of prostaglandins and thromboxanes (Bentz 2015). Glucocorticoids also interfere with cytokine signalling and the resultant clinical effects seen include reductions in brin deposition, oedema formation, leucocyte migration, phagocytic activity Mealey 2012). Hydrocortisone 10and 100 mg/l) has been shown to supress interferon- c production by equine peripheral blood mononuclear cells in vitro (McCandless et al. 2013). Potential adverse effects of glucocorticoids Effects on the haematopoietic and immune systems Glucocorticoids in fluence the concentration of circulating erythrocytes and leucocytes, as well as the response oflymphocytes to and mitogens (Magnuson et been shown to induce neutrophilia, lymphopenia horses and Targowski 1975; Burguez et al. 1983; Lane et al. 1990). Neutrophilia occurs due to increased release from bone marrow, demargination and decreased destruction, and lymphopenia and eosinopenia occur due to cell redistribution and induced apoptosis (Boothe and Mealey 2012). Glucocorticoids are potent immunosuppressive agents, a property that can be used to clinical advantage in treatment of immune-mediated diseases, but also constitutes a potential adverse effect of glucocorticoid administration as it increases the patient 's susceptibility to infection, can exacerbate existing latent or subclinical infections (Tumaset al. 1994), and can suppress their response to intended immunostimulation (Slack et al. 2000; Ferguson et al. 2009). This immunosuppression is dose-dependent and generally only occurs in animals treated with high doses of glucocorticoids for prolonged periods of time (Ferguson et al. 2009). Administration of 1 mg/kg bwt dexamethasone i.v. once daily to horses for 9 days induced immunosuppression, as demonstrated by a reduction in the response to one way mixed-lymphocyte reaction and intradermal inoculation of \u00a92016 / MARCH 2018phytohaemagglutinin (Tumas et al. 1994). Conversely, low hydrocortisone therapy (hydrocortisone sodium succinate 1.3 mg/kg glucocorticoid potencies of dexamethasone and hydrocortisone) did not impair the innate immune response of neonatal foals (Hart et al. 2011). Horses treated with dexamethasone (0.2 mg/kg bwt i.m. for 8 weeks) failed to mount protective IgGa and IgGb responses following administration of inactivated vaccines (single doses administered during Weeks 1 and 3 of dexamethasone treatment), indicating that vaccination of horses concurrently on glucocorticoids using inactivated vaccine products may be ineffective (Slack et al. 2000). Effects on the integumentary system Glucocorticoids have catabolic effects on the integumentarysystem, which may result in the formation of thin skin thateasily bruises due to increased capillary fragility in animalsfollowing chronic systemic glucocorticoid administration(Ferguson et al. 2009); this effect is not commonly documented in horses. Impaired wound healing may alsoresult, as glucocorticoids inhibit broblast proliferation, capillary budding and epithelialisation (Tobin and Nugent1980). Effects on the musculoskeletal system Prolonged systemic administration of glucocorticoids mayresult in muscle catabolism, muscle atrophy and generalisedweakness (Glade and Krook 1982; Glade et al. 1982; Cohen and Carter 1992; Harkins et al. 1993). Prolonged systemic administration of anti-in flammatory doses of dexamethasone (Group 1: 0.005 mg/kg bwt i.m. daily for or 11 months;Group 2: 0.05 mg/kg bwt i.m. daily for 5 or 11 months) tofoals in an experimental model caused multiple abnormalitiesof cartilage formation, chondronecrosis, osteochondritisdissecans lesion formation (Glade osteolysis, osteopetrosis, osteonecrosis, diminished bone resorption andinhibition of new bone formation (Glade and Krook 1982). Administration of i.a. glucocorticoids has historically been associated with development of 'steroid arthropathy ',a condition characterised by joint instability, narrowing of thejoint space, crepitation and osteonecrosis (Tobin and Nugent1980; Harkins et al. 1993; Goodrich and Nixon 2006) and with increased incidence of injuries in racing Thoroughbreds (Krookand Maylin 1988). More recent evidence suggests that thesendings represent advancement of osteoarthritis or the presence of undiagnosed underlying pathology in thetreated joint and are independent of glucocorticoidadministration (Goodrich and Nixon 2006; Whitton et al. 2014; Bentz 2015). Some horses will experience 'post-injection flare' or pain in the treated joint following i.a. glucocorticoid injection, which is reportedly self-limiting and responsive to nonsteroidal anti-in flammatory drugs (Goodrich and Nixon 2006). Laminitis is a reported complication of glucocorticoid administration in horses (Bailey and Elliott 2007); however, there is as yet no scienti c evidence proving a clear causative link between the two (Cornelisse and Robinson2013). The clinical incidence of laminitis reported in horsesthat receive glucocorticoids is very low -e.g. cases (McCluskey and Kavenagh 2004) and 3/2000 The most frequently reported inciting agent istriamcinolone acetonide, with published cases of laminitisoccurring in horses that received cumulative doses well above the recommended dose rate (Cohen and Carter 1992; Ryu et al. 2004; Dutton 2007). Proposed mechanisms of glucocorticoid-associated laminitis include enhanced vasoconstriction of lamellar veins secondary to the action of steroids themselves and their secondary metabolic effects such as increased circulating insulin (Keen et al. 2013) or glucose (French et al. 2000); potentiation of underlying disease states (e.g. insulin resistance in horses with metabolic syndrome); and catabolic effects on the integumentary system, including decreased collagen production in the lamellar basement membrane and connective tissue, diminished keratin production in the hoof wall, and diminished growth from the coronary band (Bailey and Elliott 2007; Bailey 2010). Effects on the alimentary tract Glucocorticoids inhibit mucosal prostaglandin synthesis,mucus production and gastric mucosal cell growth andrenewal, and stimulate secretion of pepsin, gastric acid andtrypsin in the stomach (Boothe and Mealey 2012). Thischange in the balance of gastric mucosal protective andaggressive factors increases the risk of gastric ulcerdevelopment in man and small animals receivingglucocorticoids (Boothe and Mealey 2012; Filaretova et al. 2014). Reports of gastric ulcer development followingglucocorticoid administration in horses are lacking. A reviewof risk factors associated with the development of equinegastric ulcer syndrome in Thoroughbred racehorses did notnd any association between previous corticosteroid administration and gastric ulceration (Murray et al. 1996). Despite this, however, caution should be exercised when administering glucocorticoids to horses with active gastric ulceration, as these changes in gastric metabolism may inhibit ulcer healing. Glucocorticoids promote glycogen deposition in the liver, hepatomegaly micronodular cirrhosis (Ferguson et al. 2009; Boothe and Mealey 2012). hepatopathy, diagnosed of serum biochemical, ultrasonographic and/or histopathological ndings, was reported in 2 horses following administration of large cumulative doses of triamcinolone acetonide (412 mg i.m. over a 6 week period and 200 mg i.m. over a 10 day period) (Cohen and Carter 1992; Ryu et al. 2004). In both cases the hepatopathy resolved following cessation of corticosteroids and initiation of supportive care. Effects on the HPAA Suppression of the HPAA has been demonstrated followingadministration of parenteral dexamethasone (MacHarg et al. 1985; Rush 1998a,b; Soma et al. 2005), oral prednisolone (Peroni et al. 2002), i.a. methylprednisolone (Menendez et al. 2012) and triamcinolone (Chen et al. 1992); and inhaled fluticasone propionate (Laan et al. 2004) and beclomethasone dipropionate (Rush et al. 1998a,b) to horses. This suppression lasts from days to weeks depending on the potency of the steroid, its disposition following administration and the duration of treatment (Harkins et al. 1993). Adrenal exhaustion, characterised by persistent low endogenous cortisol concentrations and lack of response to an ACTH stimulation test, has been reported following administration of glucocorticoids in the clinical setting (Kirk 1974; Tobin and Nugent 1980; Cohen and Carter 1992). These horses develop \u00a92016 EVJ Ltd145 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / MARCH 2018clinical signs referable to a failure of the normal constitutivefunctions of cortisol e.g. weight loss, ill-thrift, depression and apoor hair coat. Using the lowest dose and longest dosageinterval possible to manage clinical signs of disease should bethe goal of glucocorticoid therapy in order to reduce the riskof signi cant adrenal suppression (Ferguson et al. 2009). Effects on the developing fetus Multiple adverse effects of glucocorticoid administrationduring early to mid-gestation on the fetus have been reportedin man and sheep, such as fetal growth retardation,decreased birth weights, and altered insulin-glucose dynamicsduring the neonatal period (Li et al. 2012; Long et al. 2012). Similar evidence in horses is lacking. Anecdotal reports dohowever, exist of cleft palate formation in foals followingadministration of glucocorticoids to their dams (Tobin andNugent 1980) and a recent report demonstrated adrenalsuppression in two foals born to mares treated withdexamethasone sodium phosphate (100 mg i.m. daily for3 days) during late gestation (Ousey et al. 2011). It is therefore recommended that glucocorticoids be used with caution in pregnant mares. Horses appear to be less sensitive than other large animals to administration of glucocorticoids during late gestation, with induction of parturition reported with only variable success following administration of repeated high doses of dexamethasone (100 mg i.m. daily for 3 -6 days) (Alm et al. 1974, 1975; Jeffcott and Rossdale 1977). Commonly used glucorticoids highly activity ( Table 1 ). Dexamethasone can be administered via the i.v., i.m. or oral route in horses, has ahigh volume of distribution into tissues (Soma et al. 2005) and is used frequently to treat a wide array of in flammatory and immune-mediated conditions in the horse as diverse asimmune mediated haemolytic anaemia (Mair et al. 1990), idiopathic eosinophilic pneumonia (Bell et al. 2008) and chronic diarrhoea (Mair 1993). Dexamethasone formulationsvary in their duration of action in accordance with theirstructure, as previously discussed, with dexamethasone solutionand dexamethasone sodium phosphate commerciallyavailable as short acting products for i.v. or i.m. injection and combination dexamethasone for i.m. injection. Anti-in flammatory activity, as determined by suppression of endogenous plasma cortisol concentrations, occurred within 1 h of administration of a single bolus of dexamethasone (0.05 mg/kg bwt i.v.) (Soma et bwt i.v. and 0.05 mg/kg bwt i.m.) (Soma et al. 2013) and within 4 h of oral administration of dexamethasone sodium phosphate (0.05 mg/kg bwt per os) (Soma (0.03 mg/kg bwt i.m.) (Ekstrand et al. 2015) to horses. This activity persisted for 72 h, 96 h and 140 h for dexamethasone sodium phosphate, dexamethasone and dexamethasone 1-21-isonicotinate respectively. The oral availability of dexamethasone displays marked individual variation between horses, with bioavailabilities of 28 -88% reported (Cunningham et al. 1996; Grady et al. 2010). Mean bioavailability of dexamethasonesolution (0.05 mg/kg bwt per os) in one study was 31% in fed horses and 42% in fasted horses (Grady et al. 2010), whereas the bioavailability of dexamethasone powder (0.05 mg/kg bwt per os) was signi cantly higher at 60 -66% (Cunningham et al. 1996; Grady et al. 2010). Prednisone Prednisone is a glucocorticoid prodrug, widely used in peopleand small animals for treatment of in flammatory and allergic diseases (Peroni et al. 2002; Boothe and Mealey 2012). Following gastrointestinal absorption, it requires conversion toits active metabolite prednisolone in the liver via the action ofthe 11- bhydroxysteroid dehydrogenase system (Ferguson et al. 2009). Prednisone was historically used in horses for treatment of recurrent airway obstruction (RAO) anddermatologic diseases (Peroni et al. 2002); however, studies on its effects in horses diagnosed with RAO (2.2 mg/kg bwt peros daily for 14 days and 10 days respectively) showed itsclinical ef cacy to be limited (Jackson et al. 2000; Robinson et al. 2002). Peroni et al. (2002) determined that prednisone (2.2 mg/kg bwt per os) has very poor oral bioavailability in the horse, and potentially low conversion to its active metabolite by the liver, so its use in horses is no longer recommended. Prednisolone Prednisolone is a moderately potent glucocorticoid withminimal mineralocorticoid activity ( Table 1 ). As one of only two glucocorticoids commercially available for oraladministration to horses, prednisolone has been used widelyin the treatment of a myriad of equine in flammatory and immune-mediated diseases such as pemphigus vulgaris(Win and (Sloet van 2013), purpurahaemorrhagica (Kaese et 2005), RAO (Leclere et al. 2010) and in ltrative bowel disease (Barr 2006). Orally administered prednisolone has >50% bioavailability in both liquid and tablet forms and its anti-in flammatory action has been demonstrated to extend for 12 -24 h following a single 2.2 mg/kg bwt oral dose (Peroni et al. 2002). Prednisolone sodium succinate is recommended for the treatment of central nervous system trauma and shock in small animals (Boothe and Mealey 2012). It is a prodrug of prednisolonethat is immediately hydrolysed and has a rapid onset of action following i.v. or i.m. administration in horses (Toutain et al. 1984). Clinical reports of its use in horses are lacking in the literature; however, a commercial product is available that is labelled for treatment of allergic, in flammatory and 'other stress 'conditions of prodrug is 2 ). Beclomethasone dipropionate at 3.75 mg q. 12 h for 14 days(Ammann et al. 1998) or 1.32 mg q. 12 h for 7 days (Rush et al. 1998a,b, 2000) has been shown to improve pulmonary function indices and clinical signs in RAO-affected horses. Beclomethasone dipropionate inhalant administration (1.32 mg q. 12 h for 7 days) induces a similar degree of suppression of endogenous cortisol production in horses as that which occurs following dexamethasone \u00a92016 EVJ Ltd146 mg/kg bwt i.v. q. 24 h for 7 days),indicating a potential for systemic adverse effects despite itslocal application (Rush et al. 1998a,b). This adrenal suppression may be due to systemic absorption of active drug across the pulmonary epithelium or secondary to ingestion of a proportion of the aerosolised medication and its subsequent conversion to beclomethasone 17- monopropionate and absorption in the small intestines (Rush et al. 1999). Fluticasone propionate Fluticasone propionate is a potent glucocorticoidadministered to horses via the use of a facemask andmetered dose inhaler in order to treat in flammatory respiratory diseases such as RAO ( Table 2 ) (Mazaan and Ceresia 18 times is less systemic absorptionfollowing inhalation than beclomethasone dipropionate (Laanet al. 2004), and is therefore the rst-line choice for local anti- inflammatory treatment of equine respiratory disorders. Fluticasone propionate has very poor oral availability in horsesand is ineffective following administration as an intranasalspray (Laan et al. 2004), but has been shown to markedly improve pulmonary function, bronchoalveolar lavage neutrophil concentration and clinical signs of RAO following administration via a metered dose inhaler and subsequent local absorption in the lungs (1.98 mg q. 12 h for 14 days, then 1.1 mg q. 24 h for 7 days, then 1.1 mg q. 48 h for 7 days (Couetil et al. 2005); 2.0 mg q. 12 h for 21 days (Giguere et al. 2002); 1.5 mg q. 12 h for 7 days (Laan et al. 2004); 2.0 mg single dose (Laan et al. 2006)). Daily treatment of horses diagnosed with RAO with inhaled fluticasone propionate for a period of 11 months (2.0 -3.0 mg q. 12 -24 h for 5 months, then 2.0 mg q. 24 h for 6 months) did not result in development of any adverse clinical effects or alterations in immune system competency compared to a control population (Dauvillier et al. 2011). Methylprednisolone Methylprednisolone is a corticosteroid with moderateglucocorticoid potency and duration of action ( Table 1 ). Methylprednisolone is most frequently used in equine practicein the form of methylprednisolone acetate, a long-actingglucocorticoid for i.a. injection (Goodrich and Nixon 2006;Bentz 2015). Methylprednisolone acetate has been shown toreduce pain and inhibit in flammation in equine joints (Goodrich and Nixon 2006; Labens et al. 2007) and was the most frequently used i.a. steroid in treatment of low motionjoints in one survey of over 800 equine veterinarians (Ferrisand McCue 2010). Several detrimental effects ofmethylprednisolone acetate on equine joints have, however,also been reported. These include chondrocyte necrosis,reduced mechanical integrity of articular cartilage followingin vivo injection (100 mg every 14 days for four treatments) (Murray et al. 1998), and decreased production of, and increased degradation of, proteoglycan by equinechondrocytes in vitro (Doyle et al. 2005; Byron et al. 2008). Betamethasone Betamethasone is a potent glucocorticoid with virtually nomineralocorticoid activity ( Table 1 ). Betamethasone may be administered via i.a. injection to horses in the form of a short-acting sodium phosphate ester-salt, a long-acting acetateester or a combination product containing the two (Goodrich and Nixon 2006; Bentz 2015). Clinical resolution of lameness was observed in 68% of horses with traumatic arthritis of the fetlock following a single i.a. administration of betamethasone (6 mg betamethasone acetate +6m g betamethasone sodium phosphate) in combination with hyaluronic acid (20 mg) (Lindholm et al. 2002). An in vitro investigation of the effects of anti-in flammatory agents on cartilage utilising cultured equine chondrocytes demonstrated a negative effect of betamethasone on proteoglycan synthesis at high concentrations (0.1 -100 mg/l); however, this inhibition of proteoglycan synthesis was not present at lower concentrations (0.001 -0.05 mg/l) (Frean et al. 2002), and betamethasone administration was not associated with detrimental effects on the joint in an in vivo carpal bone chip model (9.75 mg betamethasone sodium phosphate +30 mg betamethasone acetate injected twice 35 days apart) (Foland et al. 1994). These ndings may support the use of low dose betamethasone in treatment of sterile synovitis in the horse (Frean et al. 2002). Triamcinolone acetonide Triamcinolone acetonide is a potent glucocorticoid with anintermediate duration of action (Soma et al. 2011) ( Table 1 ). Triamcinolone acetonide is a more potent derivative oftriamcinolone, making it suitable for low volume i.a.administration (Lerner et al. 1985; Abraham et al. 2006; Bentz 2015). Parenteral triamcinolone acetonide has been used in the past for treatment of systemic diseases such as RAO (Lapointe et al. 1993) and allergic dermatitis in horses (Cohen and Carter 1992); however, due to anecdotal links between administration of high doses of triamcinolone acetonide and the development of laminitis, triamcinolone acetonide is now most frequently administered to horses in the form of i.a. injections for treatment of joint pain and in flammation (Goodrich and Nixon 2006; Bentz 2015). Triamcinolone acetonide has been proven to reduce pain and inflammation associated with joint disease in vivo (Frisbie et al. 1997; Schoonover et al. 2005) and to have protective effects against cartilage degradation induced by toxicants and in flammatory mediators in vitro (Sandler et al. 2004; Bolt et al. 2008; Garvican et al. 2010) and was the most frequently used i.a. glucocorticoid in treatment of high motion joints in one survey of over 800 equine veterinarians (Ferris et al. 2011). Conclusion Glucocorticoids are an important class of medicationsavailable for veterinarians to employ in the treatment of awide variety of in flammatory and immune-mediated diseases of the horse. While glucocorticoids have many bene cial effects, they can also be associated with several adverseeffects in horses, especially when used at high doses or forprolonged periods. Judicious use of these medicationstailored to the individual patient and clinical scenario istherefore essential. The following two articles in this series willprovide a summary of the available literature pertaining tothe use of glucocorticoids in treatment of medical conditionsand musculoskeletal disorders of the horse.

There is a dearth of information on indications and ef cacy of FMT for the treatment of gastrointestinal disorders in the horse; however, based on evidence in man and other veterinary species, and anecdotal reports in horses, FMT may be a useful treatment for selected cases of acute and chronic diarrhoea and in flammatory bowel disease (IBD) in the horse. In the absence of evidence, expert opinion is offered on case selection and FMT procedure. More research is needed to explore the ef cacy, indications and optimal preparation, storage and delivery of FMT to horses. Introduction Microbes are crucial to the life of the horse; as a hindgutfermenter, the horse is largely dependent on microbialproduction of volatile short-chain fatty acids for energy. Themicrobiota also plays an important role in the developmentof the mammalian immune system and maintenanceof intestinal health by enhancing the intestinal epithelialbarrier (Van den Abbeele et al. 2011; Kamada et al. 2013). New sequencing technologies have advanced ourunderstanding of the complexity, diversity and richness ofthe equine intestinal and faecal microbiota (Shepherd et al. 2012; Dougal et al. 2013; Schoster et al. 2013; Costa et al. 2015a). The intestinal microbiota of horses has recently been described and is dominated by a few main phyla, particularlyFirmicutes. This phylum includes the vast Clostridia class thatcontains, in addition to a small number of pathogens, variousgenera associated with gut health (e.g. Lachnospiraceae,Rumincoccaceae and Faecalibacterium). Whilst there is likelya core of genera or species conserved among most or allhorses, there are marked differences in composition, even atthe class level among intestinal compartments and increasingdiversity towards the distal gut (Costa et al. 2015a). Even among horses subjected to similar diet and husbandrypractices, the intestinal microbiota shows a high degree ofindividual variation (Dougal et al. 2013; Schoster et al. 2013). Studies in horses have demonstrated alterations in the faecalmicrobiota, some even at the phylum level, in disease statesincluding colitis (Costa et al. 2012), post partum colic (Weese et al. 2015), chronic laminitis (Steelman et al. 2012) andfollowing antimicrobial administration in healthy horses (Harlow et al. 2013; Costa et al. 2015b). For example, in horses with undifferentiated colitis, Bacteroidetes was the most abundant phylum compared with Firmicutes in healthy control horses (Costa et al. 2012); meanwhile, orally-administered trimethoprim sulfadiazine (TMS) in healthy horses resulted in a drastic decrease in the members of the Verrucomicrobia phylum (Costa et al. 2015b). Whilst data implicating alterations of the microbiota as causes of disease are currently much stronger in other species, recent equine studies have provided support to the concept that 'dysbiosis 'could be an important inciting cause of various types of disease. With advanced sequencing technologies emerging, one potentially important and yet underexplored area of study involves the therapeutic manipulation of the gastrointestinal (GI) microbiota in equine cases. The concept of faecal microbiota transplant dates back to use of orally-administered faecal suspensions as a remedyfor food poisoning in man during the Dong-jin dynasty in the 4th century in China (Zhang et al. 2012). The earliest written reference to FMT or 'transfaunation 'in veterinary medicine is attributed to the 17th century Italian anatomist Fabricius Aquapendente who observed that cud taken directly from a healthy animal and placed in the mouth of an animal that had lost its capacity to ruminate would result in restoration of rumination and health (Borody et al. 2004). Rumen transfaunation remains a common treatment for a range of GI disorders in cattle (DePeters and George 2014). Whilst there are no peer-reviewed studies of FMT in horses, equine practitioners have a history of providing nasogastric (NG) administration of 'faecal tea 'from healthy horses to horses with diarrhoea with anecdotal reports of success (Feary and Hassel 2006). Additionally, there is a multitude of commercial over-the-counter probiotic products for horses used clinically in the prevention and treatment of a variety of GI disorders, attempting to provide a more 'rened 'approach to microbiota replacement. While generally regarded as safe, efcacy data are limited and a recent review of probiotic use in horses highlights the need for blinded, placebo- controlled ef cacy trials to investigate their health bene ts (Schoster et al. 2014). It was suggested that research emphasis should be placed on investigating the clinical outcomes related to administration of probiotic products that contain the bacterial species most abundant in the intestinal microbiota of healthy horses, species that tend to be different than those found in commercial probiotics (Schoster et al. 2014). \u00a92016 10.1111/eve.12559The surge in interest and research on FMT follows reports of notable clinical success in treating recurrent CDI in man (Gough et al. 2011; Kassam et al. 2013; Cammarota et al. 2014). The only randomised-controlled trial (RCT) evaluating FMT was terminated prematurely as the procedure proved to be considerably more effective in treating recurrent CDI than antibiotics alone (van Nood et al. 2013). A total of 15 of 16 patients who underwent FMT were cured; 13 patients after just one duodenal infusion of donor faeces compared with 4 of 13 patients who received the standard vancomycin treatment. Those successfully cured with FMT demonstrated increased microbiota diversity similar to that of the donor following treatment (van Nood et al. 2013). Although this trial included only a small number of patients, it generated tremendous interest in FMT in both the scienti c community and popular press. With the success of FMT in treatingrecurrent CDI and emerging evidence of ef cacy in other inflammatory GI conditions, such as severe CDI in immunocompromised patients (Kelly et al. 2014), severe CDI refractory to conventional medical therapy (Zainah et al. 2015) and ulcerative colitis (Colman and Rubin 2014), itsutility in treating other GI and non-GI disorders, is beingactively investigated (Aroniadis and Brandt 2013). However,treatment for CDI is currently the only approved use of FMT inman. The purpose of this paper is to review the currentliterature on FMT and transfaunation in man and animals,propose some initial guidelines for its application in equinemedicine and outline areas for future study. Potential mechanisms of action of faecalmicrobiota transplant to treat Clostridium dif cile infection Recent evidence indicates that the microorganisms thatmake up the intestinal microbiota are integrally involved inhost homeostasis and alterations have been associated witha variety of disease processes in man, including many notpreviously associated with the gut or an infectious aetiology(e.g. chronic fatigue syndrome, autoimmune andneurological disorders, 2013; Smits et al. 2013). Much attention has been paid recently to thepotential impacts of the microbiota on allergic andinflammatory conditions beyond the gut as mounting evidence clearly illustrates the role of the gut microbiota insystemic in flammation and immune tolerance (Van den Abbeele et al. 2011; Kamada et al. 2013). Studies in germ- free mice demonstrate that intestinal microbiota plays a vital role in physiological intestinal peristalsis, intestinal epithelial cell functions, development of the gut-associated immune system, systemic immunity, nutrition and metabolism (Frick and Autenrieth 2013). The GI microbiota produces antimicrobial products, competes directly for nutrients with pathogens, inhibits or inactivates bacterial toxins and produces bacteriocins and short-chain fatty acids that inhibit growth of pathogens and pathobionts (Kamada et al. 2013). The microbiota has also been shown to modify virulencefactor expression of pathogens and facilitate host barrierfunction through upregulation of mucus production,antimicrobial molecules and secretion of IgA (Kamada et al. 2013). Disruption of existing microbial communities has been implicated in the pathophysiology of CDI and may be animportant factor in acute, undifferentiated and antibiotic- induced colitis in horses. Clostridium dif cile is a normal inhabitant of the large intestine of a small percentage of healthy horses and man (Schoster et al. 2012; Petrof and Khortus individuals, toxigenic strains ofC. dif cile do not produce disease, likely through inhibitory effects of the protective commensal microbiota. However, alteration of this complex balance can result in an environment where C. dif cile can proliferate, produce toxins and cause disease. Antimicrobial administration has a profound and prolonged impact on the normal intestinal microbiota in horses and man (Jakobsson et al. 2010; Stevens et al. 2011; Harlow et al. 2013; Modi et al. 2014; Costa et al. 2015b) and has been suggested as a risk factor for CDI in both species (B /C23averud et al. 1997; Barr et al. 2013; Petrof and Khortus 2014). High throughput sequencing demonstrated that TMS administered per os to healthy horses had a greater effect than procaine penicillin intramuscularly (i.m.) or ceftiofur i.m. on the intestinal microbiota, with impacts on the faecal microbiota community structure persisting 25 days after the end of treatment (study endpoint) for all antibiotic-treated horses (Costa et al. 2015b). Other risk factors for CDI in horses include stressors such as transportation, hospitalisation, presurgical fasting, medical, or surgical treatment of GI or other disorders (B /C23averud et al. 1997). In man, a similar range of factors is associated with increased risk of CDI, including a recent focus on the potential role ofproton pump inhibitors (PPIs), a class of medication also commonly used in horses, as a risk factor (Barletta and Sclar 2014). Clostridium dif cile causes infection by production of toxins that destroy the intestinal epithelium leading to severe inflammation and secretory diarrhoea (Rupnik et al. 2009). When conventional treatment (e.g. cessation of the inciting antimicrobial and use of antibiotics against C. dif cile) fails, FMT may be an effective means of restoring the normal intestinal microbiota and treating CDI, particularly recurrent CDI. Potential mechanisms of action of FMT include competition for limited resources, direct elimination of C. dif cile, interference with its pathogenicity by microbial products that neutralise toxins, restoration of secondary bile acid metabolism in colon and induction of immune- mediated resistance (Britton and Young 2014; Petrof and Khortus 2014). Some studies indicate that human patients receiving FMT for treatment of recurrent CDI commonly have clinical resolution of diarrhoea before they have evidence of faecal microbiota recovery (Khoruts et al. 2010; van Nood et al. 2013; Song et al. 2013) suggesting that the resolution of diarrhoea is related to factors other than full restoration of gut microbiota as represented by the faecal microbiota (a reasonable but incomplete proxy for the proximal intestinal tract). If stable engraftment of transplanted microbes occurs, it may take some time to achieve. Alternatively, the key for clinical resolution may not be development of an overall microbiota akin to the donor but restoration of key components (e.g. Lachnospiraceae). The potential mechanisms by which FMT improves outcome in other GI and non-GI disorders are being actively investigated, as is the determination of the direction of causality and reversibility of these conditions (Aroniadis andBrandt 2013; transplant in man Faecal enemas were used infrequently starting in the 1950s fortreatment of pseudomembranous enterocolitis, a conditionnow thought to be associated with CDI (Khoruts andWeingarden 2014). procedures 2013). Standardisation and cryopreservation protocols have since been described (Hamilton et al. 2012; Petrof and Khortus 2014; Satokari et al. 2015). However, the need for cryopreservatives is unclear and a randomised clinical trial in man comparing fresh vs. frozen (without cryopreservative) stool showed lack of inferiority of frozen stool (S. Weese, unpublished data). Typically, each FMT dose is from a single donor to limit risk of disease transmission (Khoruts and Weingarden 2014). Donor screening tends to be intensive and expensive to reduce the risk of transmission of enteric or bloodborne pathogens or infusion of antigens ( Table 1 ). These guidelines are not strictly evidence-based and optimal practices are unknown (Allen-Vercoe et al. 2012). In addition, research is needed to explore the potential transfer of antimicrobial resistance genes on plasmids or in the genome of donated bacteria (Dicks et al. 2014). The impressive ef cacy of FMT in achieving clinical cure of recurrent CDI in man has been systematically reviewed (Gough et al. 2011; Kassam et al. 2013; Cammarota et al. 2014). In 20 case series, 15 case reports and one RCT, 467 of 536 (87%) patients treated experienced resolution of diarrhoea (Cammarota et al. 2014). Resolution rates varied by site of infusion and were highest in caecum or ascending colon (93%). Interestingly, there are very few reports of complications although patients receiving FMT are often debilitated, elderly or immunocompromised with multiple systemic problems and disruption of the gut mucosal barrier (Khoruts and Weingarden 2014). Complications reported possibly associated with upper GI FMT delivery include upper GI bleeding, enteritis and peritonitis; no mortality associated with FMT was reported in 11 studies of FMT for CDI (Kassam et al. 2013). No severe adverse events directly attributed to FMT were reported in the studies in other reviews (Gough et al. 2011; Cammarota et al. 2014) and there was no difference in clinical outcomes in anonymous vs. patient selected donors (Kassam et al. 2013). On the other hand, FMT for treatment of IBD has had more mixed results. In meta-analysis of 9 cohort studies, 8 case studies and one RCT, 54 of 119 (45%) patients achieved clinical cure and in the 6 studies where the microbiota was evaluated pre- and post FMT, there were variable associations with clinical response (Colman and Rubin 2014). Additional work is needed to de ne the case selection, timing and utility of FMT for treatment of IBD. The American College of Gastroenterology recommends physicians consider FMT for a third recurrence of CDInonresponsive to metronidazole or vancomycin (Surawiczet al. 2013). Nonpro t stool banks and universities have established donor screening and sample storage capabilitiesto serve physicians unable to perform donor selection andscreening (Kelly 2014). A standardised microbiota suspensionderived from fresh stool received United States Food andDrug Administration (FDA) fast-track status; phase 2 safetydata showed no major adverse effects and an overallefcacy of 87% (Dubberke et al. 2014).The FMT procedure is regulated by the FDA in the United States. In April 2013, the FDA moved to regulate FMT as an unapproved drug requiring all procedures and clinical trials to receive Investigational New Drug (IND) approval (Anon 2013a). Objection from the medical communityresulted in the FDA adopting an interim policy of'enforcement discretion 'which allows clinicians to perform FMT for CDI not responsive to standard therapies without obtaining IND approval provided adequate informed consent is obtained (Anon 2013b). Faecal microbiota transplant for other indications including IBD, irritable bowel syndrome, metabolic syndrome, autoimmunity and autism requires IND approval. Transfaunation and FMT in animals are not currently regulated. Rumen transfaunation Rumen transfaunation has been recently reviewed (DePetersand George 2014). Early investigations of the effects of cudinoculation in calves revealed that their rumens containedbacteria and protozoa at 3 weeks of age compared withnoninoculated calves whose rumens only contained bacteria(Pounden and Hibbs 1948). Rumen fluid from an alfalfa-fed steer transferred into a protozoa-free sheep-fed alfalfaresulted in establishment of all 24 species of protozoa withinthe sheep rumen (Dehority 1978), indicating that protozoacan successfully be transferred between host and recipient.While rumen fluid is known to contain viable microbes, volatile fatty acids, bicarbonate buffers and proteins, thereare many yet unidenti ed components (DePeters and George 2014). The complexity of the rumen fluid milieu is now being explored via metabolomics analysis (Saleem et al. 2012; Zhao et al. 2014). Rumen transfaunation remains a common treatment for indigestion in domestic ruminants to improve rumen function,intake and milk production following surgical correction of leftdisplaced abomasum in dairy cattle, as well as to provideunique microorganisms capable of degrading plant toxins inexposed al. and George 2014). Rumen transfaunation improved health and survival of calves in a herd experiencing bloody diarrhoea and death in preweaned calves (Pounden and Hibbs 1949). In our hospitals (T.J.D. and J.S.W.), we have for many years routinely used fresh rumen transfaunation as treatment for a large number of metabolic and infectious conditions in cattle exhibiting anorexia and those that have undergone abdominal surgery. Recently, Jing et al. (2014) reported that systemically administered endotoxin will alter the rumen microbiota. It is as yet unknown if transfaunation can restore the perturbations in rumen microbiota caused by systemic endotoxin; however, our clinical impression that transfaunation improves appetite and outcome in cows with toxic mastitis supports this premise. Microbiota transplant in other veterinary species In an early study on the effects of commensals on diseaseresistance in broilers, chicks inoculated with ingesta fromadult roosters placed directly in the chicks 'crops had fewer numbers of Salmonella infantis isolated and there were fewer carrier animals than noninoculated controls (Nurmi andRantala 1972). With restrictions on use of antimicrobials inproduction animals, there is interest in alternative means of \u00a92016 EVJ Ltd153 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE food-borne pathogens. Piglets fed spent cider yeasthad fewer Salmonella and Escherichia bacteria in faecal samples than control animals, which suggest that probiotics can potentially alter the gut microbiota and reducepathogen loads (Upadrasta et al. 2013). There has also been recent interest in FMT in dogs and cats as a treatment for chronic diarrhoea. Anecdotal data currently dominate scienti c study, although preliminary studies of ef cacy andTABLE 1: Donor exclusion criteria for faecal microbiota transplant donors in man History and physical examination Risk of infectious agents Known HIV or viral hepatitis exposure High risk sexual behaviours History of incarceration Use of illicit drugs Tattoo or body piercing within 12 months Travel history to endemic regions with a high risk of acquiring infectious pathogens Current communicable disease or history of tropical disease Other infectious disease risk factors including Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease Gastrointestinal comorbidities History of irritable bowel syndrome or associated symptoms History of in flammatory bowel disease including Crohn 's disease, ulcerative colitis and lymphocytic colitis Chronic diarrhoea Chronic constipation or use of laxatives History of GI malignancy or known colon polyposis History of any abdominal surgery Use of probiotics or other over-the-counter aids for regulating digestion Family history of IBD, colon cancer Systemic medical conditions Established metabolic syndrome or body mass index/waste:hip ratio suggestive of its emergence Known systemic autoimmunity Known atopic diseases Chronic pain syndromes Ongoing/intermittent use of any prescribed medications Neurological, neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders Psychiatric conditions Surgeries or other medical conditions Abnormal physical examination ndings Family history of disease Additional factors known to affect intestinal microbiota Antibiotics for any indication within the preceding 6 months Antivirals, antifungals, immunosuppressants Laboratory screening Blood tests/serology HIV Hepatitis A, B, C Treponema pallidum T lymphotropic virus in man Complete blood count Hepatic function panel Serum triglycerides, HDL cholesterol, high sensitivity C reactive protein, fasting glucose Fluorescent antinuclear antibody test Stool testing Clostridium dif cile toxin Culture for Yersinia, Campylobacter, E. and Anon (2015). \u00a92016 EVJ Ltd154 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / MARCH 2018safety have been previously reported (Weese et al. 2013; Murphy et al. 2014). Equine transplant As in other neonates, changes dramatically over time. Foals practice coprophagia from their dams and the environment which is thought to be a part of their normal development (Francis-Smith and Wood-Gush 1977). Foals pastured with their dams and other mares and foals were observed to ingest manure from their own dams and not from other mares or foals, immediately after defaecation, between the ages of 2 -5 weeks and not before or after, suggesting an evolutionary adaptation for ef cient inoculation of the GI tract (Francis-Smith and Wood-Gush 1977). Between Days 2 and 30 of age, increases in bacterial diversity and changes in relative abundance of the foals ' faecal microbiota were noted (Bordin et al. 2013). By Day 30, foals had developed a faecal microbiota that remained stable for the remainder of the rst year of life (Faubladier et al. 2014). While this change in the microbiota over time is considered part of the normal developmental process, it is evident that certain disease processes, management practices and medications can alter the equine gut microbiota. For example, in adult horses, undifferentiated colitis, grass sickness, post partum colic, acute and chronic laminitis, simple obstruction colic, diet change and supplementation and as noted above antimicrobial administration, have also been associated with changes in the equine intestinal or faecal microbiota (Garrett et al. 2002; Willing et al. 2009; Gr\u00f8nvold et al. 2010; Costa et al. 2012, 2015b; Daly et al. 2012; Steelman et al. 2012; Harlow et al. 2013; Dougal et al. 2014; Fernandes et al. 2014; Moreau et al. 2014; Proudman et al. 2015; Weese et al. 2015). Extrapolation of data from man and cattle is dif cult because of the differences in targeted diseases and GI anatomy. As hindgut fermenters, horses have an intestinal tract profoundly different from man and ruminants. The types of chronic disease usually targeted by FMT in those species also have little relationship to important problems in horses. Due to the long small colon in the horse, FMT via enema may not be effective and to the authors 'knowledge has not been investigated. Faecal microbiota transplant in horses has thus far been limited to administration via NG intubation. Efcacy of this route may be reduced due to bacterial inhibition and degradation by gastric acid, small intestinal enzymatic digestion and competition and degradation in the caecum due to fermentation. Therefore, while the clear impact of FMT in man and rumen transfaunation provides proof of concept, equine speci c study is required. In a small case series, 3 out 4 horses with antibiotic-induced or undifferentiated colitis had an improvement in faecal consistency following treatment with FMT (Mullen et al. 2014). One author (T.J.D.) used fresh caecal transfaunationsuccessfully in a horse with severe, subacute CDI, with normalmanure consistency returning 12 h post treatment. Chronicdiarrhoea, although uncommon in the horse, has anecdotallyresponded to treatment with FMT (Feary and Hassel 2006;McGovern 2013). Caecal contents collected from a recently deceased horse or faeces obtained from rectal evacuationof a healthy horse provided the transfaunate (Feary andHassel 2006). These ndings do provide thepotential ef cacy of FMT in horses; however, the variable and sometimes self-limiting nature of GI disease precludes a denitive assessment of ef cacy from studies such as these. Equine studies are needed to develop optimal practices, including transplant material type, donor characteristics, donor screening, transplantation methods and diseases to target. Antibiotic-induced and undifferentiated colitis and IBD, which has been associated with changes in the gut microbiota in man (Aroniadis and Brandt 2013; Smits et al. 2013) and dogs (Minamoto et al. 2015), may be potential candidates for additional FMT research in horses. Yasuda et al. (2015) demonstrated differences in the composition of the luminal and mucosal GI microbiota in rhesus macaques and preliminary results show a difference between the composition of the equine GI luminal and mucosal microbiota (K. Yasuda, unpublished data). As diseases such as IBD may be associated with perturbations in the mucosal microbiota, developing preparations to restore the mucosal microbiota health in horses with IBD might be helpful in ameliorating clinical signs. Based on ndings in mice where intestinal micro flora promotes peristalsis (Husebye et al. 1994), duodenitis/proximal jejunitis (DPJ) and ileus may be disorders that would bene t from FMT treatment, but further research in horses is needed. There are no studies evaluating the use of FMT for treatment of diarrhoea in foals. Unlike in man, recurrent CDI is uncommon in the horse, with most equine CDI cases presenting as severe, acute enterocolitis. Moreover, acute,undifferentiated colitis is more common than CDI in horses. Regardless of the indication, administration of FMT may present a risk of donor-associated bacteraemia, although this treatment has been used in human patients with compromised mucosal barrier function and concurrent treatment with immunosuppressive medications without complications (Khoruts and Weingarden 2014) and infusion of a small volume of faeces relative to the amount of intestinal content already present would seem to be of limited additional risk. Additionally, restoration of normal commensals may actually improve IL-1 brecruitment of neutrophils to the gut mucosa and protect against septic complications (Hasegawa et al. 2012). A standard protocol for FMT in horses has not been developed. Preliminary guidelines based on limited data, extrapolation from the literature in man and expert opinions are provided ( Table 2 ). Although adverse events associated with FMT in horses have not been reported, disease transmission from donor to recipient is possible (Naylor and Dunkel 2009) and proposed screening tests for donors are provided in Table 2 . For foals undergoing FMT, the dam would make a suitable donor provided the screening criteria are met. Fresh faeces should be collected from the rectum of the screened donor, or caecal contents could be collected from horses that t the inclusion criteria above and which are to be subjected to euthanasia because of an acute, noninfectious and non-GI disease event (e.g. acute, catastrophic musculoskeletal injury). Studies comparing the microbiota of the caecum and faeces have had variable results with some studies suggesting signi cant differences in population structure between the two (Dougal et al. 2012; Costa et al. 2015a) and others nding the highest similarity between the composition of the microbiota in the faecesand caecum vs. other intestinal compartments (Schoster et al. 2013). However, there are no data to suggest whether \u00a92016 EVJ Ltd155 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / MARCH 2018caecal contents or faeces constitute a preferredtransfaunate. The processing and delivery of FMT is shown ( Fig 1 ). In our hospitals (K.R.M., T.J.D., and we have utilised frozen aliquots of FMT without cryopreservation. However, we simply do not know the impact of storage temperature and time on efcacy and in the absence of evidence fresh FMT is probably best. Discontinuation of antimicrobials before FMTas well as pretreatment with PPIs, similar to the human protocol, have been recommended to diminish antimicrobial and gastric acid-induced bacterial inhibition, but remains speculative (Feary and Hassel 2006). Following omeprazole 4 mg/kg bwt per os every 24 h, intragastric pH in clinically ill and clinically normal neonatal foals and healthy adult horses was signi cantly increased by 1, 2 and 48 h ( rst time point measured), respectively (Merritt et al. 2003; Sanchez et al.TABLE 2: Equine faecal and caecal microbiota transplant guidelines Guideline Evidence 1.

Complications are rare (Kassam et al. 2013; Dicks et al. 2014) 2. Patient selection criteria Chronic diarrhoea Antibiotic-induced colitis Acute-severe colitis IBD Possibly duodenitis/proximal chronic diarrhoea in horses (Feary and Hassel 2006) Minimal for acute-severe and antibiotic induced colitis in horses (Mullen et al. 2014) Moderate ef cacy for IBD in man (Colman and Rubin 2014) studies evaluating FMT for IBD or proximal duodenitis/proximal jejunitis in horses.

The optimal volume ofFMT has not been determined. Typical dosage is provided inTable 2. Future of FMT Research is needed to determine the core microbiotarequired for equine GI health. It is likely that moreimportant than achieving stable engraftment of the hostmicrobiota in the recipient is establishing some keypopulations (e.g. Lachnospiraceae, Ruminococcaceae andperhaps other butyrate or acetate producers). bestway to deliver these bacteria (FMT, probiotic products orstool substitutes) needs to be evaluated. The use of shelf-stable stool substitutes made from puri ed isolates from ahealthy donor (Petrof et al. 2013) would eliminate the need for donor screening and could improve accessibility and our ability to perform controlled ef cacy studies. Research is needed to investigate the ef cacy of FMT/stool substitutes for treatment of speci c equine GI diseases including acute and chronic diarrhoea, IBD, DPJ and post foaling colic and for prophylactic use in, for instance, horses undergoing surgical procedures, horses being treated with antimicrobials and post partum mares. With the recent developments in understanding how the microbiota changes in various disease states, therapies aimed at microbiota restoration may represent the next frontier in equine gastroenterology.

S. Kennedy* and P. M. Dixon Infection and Immunity Research Group, Glasgow Dental Hospital and School, University of Glasgow, UK; and Division of Veterinary Clinical Studies, Royal (Dick) School of Veterinary Studies and Roslin Institute, University of Edinburgh, 16sRNA Periodontal disease is a painful and highly prevalent disorderof horses that causes a signi cant welfare problem. Despite its importance, few scienti c studies on its aetiopathogenesis have been performed. Equine periodontitis differs from the plaque-induced periodontitis found in brachydont species where bacteria accumulating in dental plaque induce a destructive in flammatory response in the periodontium. In contrast, equine periodontitis is usually initiated by entrapment of feed between cheek teeth, which causes inflammation of periodontal tissue that likely allows bacterial infection of the periodontal tissues that is later exacerbated by the host 's response. Equine oral microbiology is a neglected eld of research and identi cation of the bacteria involved in this disorder by use of molecular bacteriology and examination of the interaction between these bacteria and the equine oral immune response should reveal important information about the pathogenesis of this disease. Introduction Periodontal disease is increasingly recognised as a commonand painful equine oral disorder. With progression of thisdisease, the tissues surrounding and supporting the tooth aredestroyed until eventually the tooth itself may be lost. Earliestrecorded observations of equine periodontal disease byAristotle date back to 333BCE (Carmalt 2007) and in the early1900s, several reports described its clinical features and highprevalence, especially in urban horses (Colyer 1906; Little1913; Harvey 1920). Colyer (1906) also acknowledged itssubstantial welfare impact describing periodontal disease as'the scourge of the horse '. More recent studies have shown periodontitis to be present in up to 75% of horses (Baker 1970; Ireland et al. 2012) with its prevalence increasing with advancing age. Other recent equine studies have con rmed this disorder to be very painful, causing quidding and weight loss (Dixon et al. 2008, 2014). Donkeys are also commonly affected, with this disease noted in 24% of working donkeys (Rodrigues et al. 2013) and 100% of diastemata in one donkey study had an associated periodontitis (Du Toit et al. 2009). This disorder is not limited to domesticated equids, with Penzhorn (1984) noting periodontitis in free-ranging Cape Mountain Zebra. Despite the high prevalence of periodontitis in domesticated horses and the signi cant welfare problem it causes, the disease may initially go unnoticed by owners because associated clinical signs such as quidding and lossof condition can be absent (Dixon et al. 2008, 2014). Although there has been increased recognition of the importance of equine periodontal disease in recent years, very few scienti c studies on the aetiopathogenesis of this disorder have been performed. This article aims to review current knowledge of this disorder critically and also outline the potential use of novel methods in investigating its aetiopathogenesis. Equine periodontal anatomy The periodontium is a complex, dynamic structure comprisedof four separate tissues -the gingiva, peripheral cementum, periodontal ligament and alveolar bone -that interact together to protect and support the tooth. Staszyk and Gasse (2005) described the equine periodontium as having three major supportive functions: (1) to secure the tooth in the alveolus; (2) to accept a variety of masticatory forces; and (3) to restore the tooth to its original position after temporary displacement during mastication. The equine periodontium must also adapt to allow for the prolonged eruption of hypsodont dentition and cope with masticatory forces of over 1550N exerted on the caudal cheek teeth for up to 18 h/day (Huthmann et al. 2009). Although it is intuitive to think of peripheral cementum as part of the tooth itself, especially in hypsodont teeth, where it compromises a substantial part of the clinical crown (Mitchell et al. 2003), it can also be considered as a component of the periodontium due to its distinctive odontogenic development (Staszyk et al. 2015). Throughout the life of the tooth peripheral cementum is continuallyproduced by cementoblasts and deposited at the apexand around the periphery of the reserve crown, a featureunique to hypsodont periodontium (Staszyk and Gasse2007). The cementum of human teeth has an organiccontent of around 50% primarily collagen, with smallcollagen brils being produced by cementoblasts and nourished by vessels within the periodontal ligament (Hands2008). Larger brils known as Sharpey 'sbres originate from the periodontal ligament and are incorporated into boththe peripheral cementum and alveolar bone, flexibly anchoring the tooth into the alveolus (Grant and Bernick1972). The equine periodontal ligament is a highly vascular and cellular structure that largely consists of collagen bres, broblasts and ground substance interspersed with blood and lymphatic and Gasse ligament contains bothnourishes and supports the tooth during mastication andprolonged eruption. Periodontal blood vessels are integratedinto the equine periodontal ligament in three distinctways (Staszyk and Gasse 2004). The type 1 arrangement of periodontal blood vessel groups are protected frommasticatory forces by a sheath of 'veil cells 'and connective tissue that is thought to protect blood flow during mastication. An elaborate collagen network anchors blood vessels in thetype 2 arrangement, resulting in a functional brovascular unit able to resist forces of traction during mastication. In thetype 3 vascular arrangement, dilated ballooned venules running parallel to the tooth surface between collagen bre bundles have a cushioning effect, absorbing the substantialforces of mastication. Staszyk and Gasse (2004) also notedpresence of elastic oxytalan bres in the equine periodontal ligament, which allow regeneration and remodelling, whilstimproving periodontal blood vessel stability. Matrix metalloproteinase-1, which initiates collagen breakdown to allow remodelling has been detected in theequine periodontal ligament (Warhonowicz et al. 2007). As eruption progresses, equine teeth reduce in size and shape(narrowing towards the apex), and in turn the surroundingalveolar bone must constantly remodel in order to providesufcient support to the tooth. Sharpey 'sbres in the periodontal ligament insert into a thin, compact layer of'cortical 'alveolar bone which lines the alveolus and is radiographically known as the lamina dura . The alveolar bone surrounding this super cial compact layer is more porous, which may re flect its constant remodelling (Dixon and du Toit 2011). The gingiva is a rm, keratinised epithelium covering the underlying alveolar bone, periodontal ligament and reservecrown and acts as a physical barrier against oral microbialinvasion of the periodontal tissues. It is possible to classifygingival tissue further by its location within the oral cavity andwith regards to its position relative to the tooth. Staszyk et al. (2015) describe two distinct zones of equine gingiva: theinterdental gingiva, also known as the interdental papilla,and bulk of the gingiva located on thebuccal, labial, palatal and lingual aspects of teeth. The freegingiva is the most occlusal and mobile aspect of the gingivaand acts as an interface with the epithelium of the gingival(crevicular) sulcus, which is a shallow pocket between thetooth and adjacent sulcular epithelium. Junctional epitheliumat the base of the sulcus adheres tightly to the peripheralcementum on the tooth surface. Gingival sulcus depth may be 1 -4 mm in periodontally healthy horses (Cox et al. 2012) and an increase in sulcar depth indicates the presence of periodontal disease.Gingival crevicular fluid containing antibodies, enzymes and other in flammatory mediators and immune components is secreted into the sulcus, and together with gingival tissueplays an important role in responding to immunologicalchallenges posed by oral bacterial communities. Inperiodontal health, the gingiva provides a tight seal aroundthe erupted crown and protects underlying structures by forming a mechanical barrier. However, in periodontaldisease, this barrier is damaged leaving underlying sensitive tissues exposed and open to both mechanical damage and bacterial colonisation. A very complete description of equineperiodontal anatomy has recently been published by Staszyk et al. (2015).Aetiopathogenesis of periodontal disease Plaque induced periodontal disease in brachydont species Periodontal disease is also of major importance in man andbrachydont domestic animals and consequently has beenextensively studied in many brachydont species, often as amodel for human disease (Giannobile et al. 1994). In brachydont dentition, the initiating factor for gingivitis, whichis the earliest and often reversible stage of periodontaldisease, is the accumulation of dental plaque in the gingivalsulcus, which may eventually become calci ed (calculus) (Theilade et al. 1966; Mariotti 1999). More speci cally, the of gingival sulcus initiates a bacterial-induced in flammatory reaction (gingivitis) that may or may not proceed to involve the deeper periodontal tissues (Pageand Kornman 1997). More severe periodontal disease is mostfrequently due to the host 's response to the bacterial invasion (Bartold and Van Dyke 2013). Entrapped food induced periodontal disease in hypsodont species Plaque induced periodontitis does not appear to be acommon problem in horses, unlike in brachydont species(Dixon et al. 2000), an exception being the canine teeth, where the presence of calculus can cause gingivitis ( Fig 1 ) and, rarely, more severe periodontitis. In equids, food trapping in anatomical defects, such as diastemata between adjacent cheek teeth is the usualinstigator of periodontitis. In a study of referred equine caseswith cheek teeth disorders, periodontal disease in theabsence of intercurrent dental disorders, and without thepresence of plaque was identi ed in just 3/349 (0.9%) cases (Dixon et al. 1999, 2000). Equine periodontitis is particularly associated with diastemata which can be described as abnormal spacesbetween adjacent teeth that should normally be in tightocclusal apposition. Food material becomes impacted intothis abnormal space during mastication, often becomingtightly entrapped and initiating in flammation of the underlying gingiva initially, that invariably progresses to the deeper periodontal tissues ( Figs 2 and 3). Colyer (1906) noted the high prevalence and importance of equine periodontaldisease and attributed it to a coarse diet, but Dixon et al. (2000) noted that the illustrated specimens of cheek teethperiodontal disease from Colyer 's study as illustrated by Miles and Grigson (1990) all had diastemata, and that the reported Fig 1: Calculus on a canine tooth with local gingivitis (arrows). \u00a92016 EVJ Ltd162 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / MARCH 2018periodontal disease appears to have been initiated byinterproximal food trapping. Little (1913) had previouslyattributed diastemata as a cause of equine periodontaldisease, the mandibular 09/10 and 10/11 interdental (interproximal) spaces. Diastemata may be developmental or acquired. Dixon et al. (2008, 2014) classi ed equine diastemata as primary diastemata (where the teeth developed too far apart and/or with insuf cient angulation to occlusally compress them; Fig 2 ) and as secondary diastemata, such as caused by displaced ( Fig 4 ) or rotated cheek teeth ( Fig 5 ), dental overgrowths or supernumerary cheek teeth. In addition, senilediastemata may form due to the tapering of equine cheekteeth towards their apices resulting in decreased surfacearea at the occlusal surface, along with age-related loss ofangulation of the 06s and 11s ( Fig 6 ). Diastemata have been documented in up to 50% of horses in a UK equine practicesurvey, with feed material becoming trapped in 91% ofdiastemata (Walker et al. 2012). In addition, 34% of diastemata had associated gingivitis and 44% were accompanied by periodontal pockets. Impaction of feed material into the periodontal pocket has also been recorded in 76% of cheek teeth diastemata in donkeys (Du Toit et al. 2009), with 71% of these donkeys also having concurrent dental disorders such as displaced cheek teeth, which probably initiated or contributed to diastemata formation. Malerupted (rotated) maxillary cheek teeth have also been described as the primary cause of diastemata formation and associated severe periodontitis (Casey and Tremaine 2010) (Fig 5 ). Voss (1937) suggested that irregular feeding times interrupted salivary flow in horses, which in turn could contribute to the development of periodontal disease. Food stasis and bacterial proliferation The above described trapping, stasis and subsequentdecomposition and fermentation of food material in equineinterdental spaces can, as noted abrade the gingiva,causing mechanical damage and gingival in flammation (Little 1913; Baker 1979; Cox et al. 2012). Over time, impacted food (a porous foreign body), acts as a bacterial nidus, Fig 2: Post mortem image of a left maxillary cheek teeth row showing deep periodontal pockets between the rostral fourcheek teeth with deep periodontal pocketing of food. Fig 3: Oral endoscopic view of severe equine cheek teethperiodontal disease caused by a diastema. The teeth adjacent tothe diastema have caries of the peripheral cementum and arecovered in thick grey plaque. There is marked loss of periodontaltissues in the interdental space (yellow arrow) but no loss ofgingiva which is markedly hyperplastic (white arrow). Fig 4: Secondary diastema. This post mortem image shows a developmentally displaced (and also curved) cheek tooth withsecondary diastemata rostral and caudal to it and a deepperiodontal pocket on its lingual aspect (arrow). There are also'primary 'diastemata between other adjacent teeth.

The Lactobacillales order of bacteria,which includes lactobacilli, streptococci and enterococci,ferment plant by anaerobically metabolisingcarbohydrates to produce lactic acid (G \u20acanzle 2015). Inflammation of the periodontium The initial insult provokes a substantial in flammatory response within gingival tissue due to both mechanical abrasion of sensitive gingival epithelium and bacterial proliferation, as noted earlier. This is apparent clinically as gingivitis with hyperaemia and bleeding upon gingival probing. In man, a number of different pathogenic bacteria are implicated in the induction of a marked host in flammatory response which in turn leads to destruction of the periodontal ligament and resorption of alveolar bone and cementum, which can lead to end stage disease, i.e. loss of the tooth (Carranza and Camargo 2012). This exaggerated in flammatory response shown in human periodontitis is the result of prolonged cytokine production in gingival tissues leading to increased production of proteases, which can destroy invading microbes, but can also damage the host 's periodontal tissues (Teng 2003). This immune response may show individual variation, including a genetic component in man (Yoshie et al. 2007). Apart from the study of Cox et al. (2012) there appears to be no published work on equine periodontal diseasehistology. These authors showed the mucosal surface ofequine periodontal pockets to be hyperplastic, with epithelialdisruption and presence of large numbers of in flammatory cells such as neutrophils in the lamina propria (Fig 7 ) and adjacent connective tissues ( Fig 8 ) and destruction of the periodontal tissue including peripheral cementum in whichthe periodontal membranes were once attached ( Fig 8 ). Accumulations of food material, which may be obvious clinically, has also been con rmed on histopathology, alongside large numbers of bacteria and microabscesses in the submucosa of equine periodontal pockets (Cox et al. 2012). In absence of clinical intervention, the disease progresses and in flammation spreads to the periodontal ligament with in ltration of mononuclear cells ( Figs 7 and 8). The ligament is gradually destroyed over time, as is thesurrounding alveolar bone and cementum ( Fig 9 ), decreasing tooth support and further deepening periodontal pockets.Teeth may become mobile at this stage. The increasing depth of the equine periodontal pocket provides the ideal environment for further invasion and proliferation of anaerobic bacteria and the cycle of in flammation and tissue degradation continues until tooth loss occurs. Oral microbiology It is well recognised that bacteria play a major role in theaetiopathogenesis of human (Socransky et al. 1998), canine (Hennet and Harvey 1991a,b) and feline (Harris et al. 2015) periodontal disease and it is easy to appreciate the potentialimportance of bacteria in equine periodontitis. This role wasrecently supported by the histopathological nding spirochetes in the sulcar epithelium ( Fig 10 ) of diseased equine periodontal pockets, which also had cocci on the epithelial surface ( Fig 11 ) (Cox et al. 2012). The ecological community of bacteria, both commensal and pathogenic, inhabiting the oral cavity is known as the oral microbiome. There are approximately 700 different species identi ed to date in human healthy and diseased oral cavities (Dewhirst et al. 2010), even though the human oral microbiome has not yet been fully characterised. This bacterial community is incredibly complex and dynamic, with species interacting with each other and also with the host immune system. In order to survive in an environment being constantly washed Fig 6: Caudal cheek teeth of a horse with senile diastemata.

Cox. \u00a92016 EVJ Ltd164 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / MARCH 2018with host saliva, in addition to being challenged withmechanical abrasion from masticatory movements, bacteriahave found a method of adhering to the surface of oraltissue and so exist in a bio lm. The oral bio lm The pellicle (acquired pellicle) is an acellular lm composed mainly of salivary glycoproteins whose function is to lubricateand protect the surface of the tooth itself (i.e. the enamelsurface in brachydont dentition and all three calci ed tissues in equine teeth) and surrounding soft tissue (Gibbins et al.2014). Later, bacteria attach to it, forming an oral bio lm and under certain conditions the normal bio lm may develop into (abnormal) plaque (Marsh and Bradshaw 1995). A bio lm is dened as 'a biopolymer matrix-enclosed bacterial population, adherent to each other and surfaces '(Costerton 1999). Multispecies bacterial communities existing within the oral bio lm are supported and protected by the surrounding matrix. The composition of an oral bio lm is very much dependent upon its location within the oral cavity, and thus human tooth-associated bio lms can be divided into two categories. Supragingival bio lms adhere to the surface of the clinical crown, and subgingival bio lms adhere below the gum line within the (normal) gingival sulcus or (abnormal) periodontal pocket (Kolenbrander et al. 2010). Early bacterial colonisers, which are well adapted to community formation and multispecies growth (Kolenbrander et al. 2010), initially adhere to the salivary pellicle as recently reviewed by Borkent and Dixon (2017). Adhesion and subsequent proliferation of early colonisers is followed by coadhesion of genetically distinct bacteria to the existing attached population. In addition to coadhesion, distinct bacterial species also interact via cell surface components when both are suspended in fluid, a process that is termed coaggregation. For example, strains of Fusobacterium nucleatum are able to coaggregate with early and late oral bio lm and may play a bridging role in the development of human dental plaque (Kolenbrander and London 1993; Kolenbrander et al. 2010). Under certain conditions, the bio lm becomes increasingly C CT Fig 8: Massive in ltration in flammatory cells interdental subgingival connective tissue (CT).

The oral bio lm is highly intricate with dynamic microbial interactions, includingcomplex cell signalling between bacteria of differing generaas well as transfer of DNA between bacteria. Conjugativetransposons, which facilitate DNA transfer between bacteriahave been detected in many genera of human oral bacteriasuch as Fusobacterium, Streptococcus and Veillonella (Rice 1998). This is a cause for concern as there is potential fortransference of antibiotic resistance genes between differentspecies of bacteria in the dental bio lm. Bacteria within the bio lm matrix can be protected from exposure to host innate and adaptive immune mechanisms as well as to administered antimicrobial compounds. In the human oral cavity, front-line immune responses such as phagocytosis are ineffective in the bio lm matrix as bacterial cells cannot be readily engulfed at this site (Kharazmi 1991) and in ltration of neutrophils into the plaque may even provide an additional matrix for bacterial attachment (Walker et al. 2005). Although ineffective in removing the bacterial biolm, the immune response has a signi cant side effect on surrounding tissue, stimulating in flammation and often destruction of the human periodontium (Teng 2003). Due to the limitations of the host immune system and of antimicrobial therapy in combating potentially periodonto- pathogenic bacteria within the dental bio lm, mechanical removal of dental plaque is necessary to treat brachydont periodontal disease. Bacteria in oral health and disease Current understanding of the role of bacteria in disease ischanging and traditional principles such as Koch 's postulates are becoming increasingly irrelevant in modern microbiology. Due to the dif culties in culturing some bacteria, it cannot be said that an organism is not involved in disease purely because it cannot be grown in culture. Likewise, to suggest that an organism is not involved in a disease because it may be found in healthy individuals or is unable to replicate disease when inoculated into a healthy individual would be to ignore variations in host-pathogen interactions. The human oral microbiome in health is markedly different to that found in periodontitis lesions (Wang et al. 2013). Analysis of the equine oral microbiome has shown similar ndings, with samples from orally healthy horses showing major dissimilarities to samples taken from diseased periodontal pockets (Kennedy et al. 2015). This substantial shift in oral microbiota with periodontitis can be interpreted in several ways. The traditional hypothesis of pathogenic (or certain) bacteria occurring in high numbers or solely detected in periodontitis lesions being the cause of the disease appears to be overly simplistic and it is more likely that many factors with complex interactions are involved. Signi cant local environmental changes occur during the development of periodontal pockets (Loesche et al. 1983 ), which may be especially deep around equine cheek teeth(Cox et al. 2012). The anaerobic or partially aerobic environment of deep human periodontal pockets encourages invasion and proliferation of microaerophilic organisms, anaerobes and spirochetes, while the environment of the general oral cavity supports a signi cantly different microbiota (Loesche et al. 1983). Another hypothesis that can be applied to the diseased oral microbiome is the keystone pathogen hypothesis , which maintains that certain pathogens existing at low abundance in the oral cavity may modulate their environment, disturbing the normally symbioticrelationship between the bacteria of the oral cavity, creating a state of dysbiosis (dysregulation of commensal oral bacteria) thus contributing to the development of inflammatory disease. One such species , Porphyromonas gingivalis, is a well-known keystone pathogen in human periodontal disease due to its ability to modulate the host immune system, and thus altering host immune responses to the entire oral bio lm (Hajishengallis et al. 2012). The equine oral microbiome in health and periodontitis It has been acknowledged that the equine oral microbiome hasbeen a neglected eld of research (Dacre et al. 2008; Sykora et al. 2014). Culture of oral swabs from orally healthy horses was performed by Boyer (1919). Baker (1979) subsequently performed traditional bacterial culture and biochemical identi cation of orally healthy and periodontitis affected horses and recorded a signi cant bacterial population shift between oral health and periodontitis. High counts of streptococci and micrococci weredetected in orally healthy samples with intermediate counts of Veillonella and low counts of Lactobacillus spp., Fusobacteria spp. and In Streptococci, Fusobacteria and coliforms. In addition, Campylobacter and spirochetes were detected upon direct smears of diseased samples (Baker 1979). Sykora et al. (2014), found Porphyromonas gingivalis, Tannerella and Treponema species were more commonly isolated from horses with periodontitis secondary to equine odontoclastic tooth resorption and hypercementosis than in orally healthy horses by using polymerase chain reaction assays of gingival crevicular fluid samples. When analysing any microbiological community, the number and diversity of bacterial species detected is dependent on the method of analysis used (Lozupone and Knight 2008). Studies in other species have estimated that around 50% of oral bacteria cannot be cultured by conventional means (Socransky et al. 1963). It is therefore likely that previous culture studies have vastly underestimated the number and variety of bacterial species present in the equine oral cavity because novel species and uncultivable bacteria would have gone undetected. It is now possible to characterise the oral microbiome using methods that do not rely on culture and can detect novel and uncultivable bacteria. One such method involves high-throughput sequencing of the gene encoding the 16s subunit of the bacterial ribosome (16s rRNA) that is useful in assessing the composition of complex microbial communities directly from clinical samples (Song et al. 2013). The 16s rRNA gene is universal in bacteria but not found in mammalian cells. It is around 1550 base pairs long and consists of nine hypervariable regions (V1 -V9), which are between constant regions (Song et al. 2013). These constant regions are highly conserved between phyla, which is thought to be due to the critical importance of the ribosome to basic cell function(Clarridge 2004). Sequencing of hypervariable regions may allow for differentiation up to species level (Chakravorty et al. 2007). Most hypervariable regions occur within the rst 500 bases (Keller et al. 2010) and so sequencing of the whole gene is not required, with read lengths of 500 -700 base pairs being suf cient for identi cation at species level (Paster et al. 2006; Clarridge 2004; Song et al. 2013). Whole 16s rRNA sequencing is desirable if a previously unknown species is identi ed (Clarridge 2004) and it is highly likely that the equine oral microbiome in both health and disease contains \u00a92016 EVJ Ltd166 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / MARCH novel and previously uncharacterised species.Recently, Gao et al . (2015) revealed an in-depth snapshot of the equine subgingival microbiome of two orally healthyhorses using 16s and suggested the possiblepresence of 'equine-speci c taxa '. A recent high throughput 16s rRNA sequencing study performed by the authors (Kennedy et al. 2015) has revealed a population shift towards Gram-negative organisms as well as increasing numbers of spirochetes in horses with periodontal disease, as would be expected. Bacteria belonging to the Prevotella ,Veillonella ,Treponema and Tannerella increase in equine periodontitis lesions (Kennedy et al. 2015), with some species belonging to these genera being well known humanperiodontal pathogens (Sykora et al. 2014) . In addition to high throughput 16s rRNA sequencing to uncover the oral microbiome, the 16s rRNA gene can also be used as a target in polymerase chain reactions, to screen samples for speci c bacteria as used by Sykora et al. (2014). Conclusion Periodontal disease is a common and painful equine diseasethat is usually induced by the mechanical impaction of foodbetween and around teeth. Further progression of the diseaseis very likely to be dependent on invasion of the periodontaltissues by the extremely complex group of oral bacteria alongwith the host 's immune response to these microorganisms, with a severe host in flammatory response resulting in increased tissue breakdown and progression of the disease. In addition, keystone oral bacterial pathogens may alter the host 's immune response to other components of the bio lm. Whilst it is clear that feed stasis and subsequent bacterial proliferation play an important role in the initiation and progression of periodontitis in the horse, there is a great need for further studies into the aetiopathogenesis of this disorder. Recent work has given an insight into which bacterial species are present in the periodontal pockets of horses with periodontitis; however, it is crucial to distinguish which species are important in disease pathogenesis and which simply flourish due to the change in oral environment. In particular, the interaction between bacteria of the diseased equine oral microbiome and the local immune system requires further investigation in order to provide additional insights into the aetiopathogenesis of equine periodontal disease.
