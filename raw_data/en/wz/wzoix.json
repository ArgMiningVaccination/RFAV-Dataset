Homeopathy can be used for all ages and many pregnant mothers can choose it for a multitude of reasons, such as helping with morning sickness, or relief of soreness. With an increase in children being diagnosed with allergies, ADD, and ADHD due to food, air, and water pollutions, many mothers are turning to homeopathy as a form of treatment that helps to control what their children ingest and use as the other medicaments. Homeopathic remedies have been well selected, FDA regulated and ultra-diluted with no side effects and easy to administer. It can restore health and help many childhood illnesses like eczema, asthma and allergies instead of steroid or antibiotics, which can disrupt the bowel flora and the long-term immunity for developing immune system. For example, many ear infections are treated with antibiotics, which helps treat the infection, but in return completely disrupts the gut flora - causing further health issues. Treating an ear infection with well-chosen homeopathic remedies can not only heal the ear infection without any interruption of gut flora, but it will also help enhance the body's ability to fight similar infections in the future. Homeopathy also has a lot to offer for gut brain connection. Over the past few years, the increased interest in the gut-biome has emerged, and in doing so we've seen the development of \"fecal implants\" by conventional medical providers as a way to get good bacteria from healthy individuals to help those who are sick. What has been interesting is that this theory is not new to homeopaths around the world. Homeopathy has had their own form of fecal implants using bowel nodoses - and these immunotherapy remedies have been used for over 200 years - much earlier than the modern probiotic, or fecal implants. Bowel nodoses, aka homeopathic probiotics, take doses of different bacteria from the large intestines and help re-establish good bacteria in the gut. The group of 11 remedies known as the bowel nodoses are unique in both their derivation and the opportunities that they offer. They have some indications in acute homeopathic prescribing because of the connection and resonance that they have with the miasmatic forces that are active in the body, but they are particularly useful in the treatment of chronic disease. The origin of these remedies lies in human medicine, and there are still major indications in that field. The clinical research has repeatedly shown how these tiny globules known as \"Magic Pills\" can enhance your immunity within the seconds when an acute illness is going in. The principle is very simple: the symptoms of the illness must be matched with the remedy causing that illness. \"Like cures like\". How does that work? The homeopathic practitioner chooses a remedy to treat symptoms that would normally be caused by that remedy at full strength. By doing this, the remedy acts to stimulate the body's own systems to cure the problem. Choosing a homeopathic remedy involves studying a history that goes beyond the symptom at hand. Your symptom may be a cough, but selecting a remedy out of the many that treat coughs may have more to do with your fears or sleep patterns than the cough itself.For example, red onion can quickly eradicate your symptoms of stuffy and runny nose when it is diluted and given sublingually - but we'll talk more on that in another blog post!
