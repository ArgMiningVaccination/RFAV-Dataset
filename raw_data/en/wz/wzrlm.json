Challenges arise concerning how to optimally support the immune system in the general population, especially under self-confinement. An optimal immune response depends on an adequate diet and nutrition in order to keep infection at bay. For example, sufficient protein intake is crucial for optimal antibody production. Low micronutrient status, such as of vitamin A or zinc, has been associated with increased infection risk. Frequently, poor nutrient status is associated with inflammation and oxidative stress, which in turn can impact the immune system. Dietary constituents with especially high anti-inflammatory and antioxidant capacity include vitamin C, vitamin E, and phytochemicals such as carotenoids and polyphenols. Several of these can interact with transcription factors such as NF-kB and Nrf-2, related to anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects, respectively.

Introduction [1](#B1-nutrients-12-01562)]. This virus is now well-known as the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), resulting in the development of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) [ [2](#B2-nutrients-12-01562)]. The disease has spread worldwide and has been classified by the World Health Organization (WHO) as a global pandemic [ [2](#B2-nutrients-12-01562), [3](#B3-nutrients-12-01562)]. SARS-CoV-2 manifestation might be asymptomatic or moderate to severe with coughing, fever, and shortness of breath [ [3](#B3-nutrients-12-01562)]. In more severe cases, complications can include acute respiratory distress syndrome, acute cardiac complications, multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, septic shock, and death [ [4](#B4-nutrients-12-01562), [5](#B5-nutrients-12-01562), [6](#B6-nutrients-12-01562), [7](#B7-nutrients-12-01562)]. These complications are believed to be related to what has been described as the cytokine storm, in which viral replication triggers an abnormally strong release of cytokines and other immune-related is also fundamental to modulate inflammatory and oxidative stress processes, which are all interrelated with the immune system [ [16](#B16-nutrients-12-01562)]. The important notion of the relationship between dietary constituents, nutrition, inflammation, and oxidative stress is well-regarded, and has been emphasized, for example, in the development of the anti-inflammatory dietary index [ [17](#B17-nutrients-12-01562)]. Dietary and nutritional constituents known to exert anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties include omega-3 fatty acids [ [18](#B18-nutrients-12-01562)], vitamin A [ [19](#B19-nutrients-12-01562)], vitamin C [ [20](#B20-nutrients-12-01562)], as well as a variety of phytochemicals, such as polyphenols [ [21](#B21-nutrients-12-01562)] and carotenoids [ [22](#B22-nutrients-12-01562)] that are widely present in plant-based foods. Also, the dietary fiber present in plant-based food items has been associated with various health benefits including anti-inflammatory properties [ [11](#B11-nutrients-12-01562)], through fermentation by the gut microbiota and consequent formation of metabolic compounds, especially short chain fatty acids (SCFA). Such anti-inflammatory active compounds could be important in the overall homeostasis of inflammation and oxidative stress, both before and/or during acute infection. In fact, dietary fiber [ [23](#B23-nutrients-12-01562)] and a variety of phytochemicals such as polyphenols [ [24](#B24-nutrients-12-01562)] have been proposed to influence the gut microbiota, having prebiotic effects such as fostering the growth of bacteria that are associated with health benefits, such as of Bifidobacterium spp., and reducing potential pathogenic ones such as Clostridium spp. Such aspects are of interest as gastro-intestinal complications such as diarrhea have been reported following SARS-CoV-2 infection [ [25](#B25-nutrients-12-01562)]. In addition to the interrelation of nutrients and infections via inflammation and oxidative stress, additional pathways may play a role. While the vitamin A metabolite retinoic acid interacts with the transcription factor RAR (retinoic acid receptor), which may play a role in immunity, vitamin D has been proposed to interact with its own transcription factors (vitamin D receptor) or the cellular receptor important for viral entry, i.e., ACE2 (angiotensin converting enzyme 2), inhibiting virus particles from entering the cell [ [26](#B26-nutrients-12-01562)]. 2. The Immune System, COVID-19, Inflammation, and Oxidative Stress [27](#B27-nutrients-12-01562)]. The non-specific or innate natural defense mechanism is derived from cells of the myelocytic line, and provides an immediate response [ [28](#B28-nutrients-12-01562)]. If pathogens (i.e., viruses, bacteria) invade the body, the innate response together with the specific or adaptive defense mechanism derived from cells of the lymphocyte line, adapt their response by secreting proteins directed towards intra- and extra-cellular pathogens, including several cytokines and chemokines released by macrophages, triggering inflammation to enhance the response [ [29](#B29-nutrients-12-01562)]. Inflammation and oxidative stress also contribute to the normal functioning of the human body. In particular, oxidative stress plays an essential role in mitochondrial processes [ [30](#B30-nutrients-12-01562), [31](#B31-nutrients-12-01562), [32](#B32-nutrients-12-01562)]. [33](#B33-nutrients-12-01562)]. The role of oxidative stress during infection is not fully elucidated, but free radicals have been shown to protect against invading microorganisms [ [34](#B34-nutrients-12-01562)]. Chronically elevated oxidative stress occurs in long-lasting viral infections, for example, with the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), among others [ [35](#B35-nutrients-12-01562), [36](#B36-nutrients-12-01562)], and has been associated with impaired immune responses [ [27](#B27-nutrients-12-01562), [37](#B37-nutrients-12-01562), [38](#B38-nutrients-12-01562), [39](#B39-nutrients-12-01562)]. An association between ROS, such as NO, the superoxide-radical (O2), and peroxynitrites, and endothelial damage and inflammation has been reported [ [40](#B40-nutrients-12-01562)]. Both endothelial damage and inflammation appear to play a vital role in COVID-19 [ [41](#B41-nutrients-12-01562)]. [31](#B31-nutrients-12-01562), [42](#B42-nutrients-12-01562)], can either oxidize biomolecules including RNA/DNA, lipids, or proteins, or can structurally modify proteins and genes to trigger signaling cascades that can lead to the onset of the inflammatory response. The recognition of detrimental stimuli is initiated by pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) [ [43](#B43-nutrients-12-01562)], in immune cells and non-immune cells, via triggering of germline-encoded pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs), [ [44](#B44-nutrients-12-01562), [45](#B45-nutrients-12-01562)]. Inflammatory stimuli can trigger the activation of intracellular signaling pathways involved in the expression of inflammatory mediators. Primary inflammatory stimuli cause the release of microbial products and cytokines, including interleukin-1 (IL-1), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-). These mediate inflammation through the activation of receptors, for instance toll-like receptors (TLRs), IL-1, IL-6 receptors, and the TNF-receptor [ [46](#B46-nutrients-12-01562)]. As a result, intracellular signaling pathways are stimulated, including [48](#B48-nutrients-12-01562), [49](#B49-nutrients-12-01562)]. [50](#B50-nutrients-12-01562)]. As such, a certain level of inflammation is physiological and required for optimal triggering of the immune response. However, low-grade systemic inflammation is common in several conditions, including cardiovascular disease (CVD), inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), diabetes type 2 (T2D), arthritis, cancer, and obesity [ [51](#B51-nutrients-12-01562)]. [52](#B52-nutrients-12-01562)]. Several issues may arise during extreme conditions as those triggered by COVID-19 [ [53](#B53-nutrients-12-01562)]. In fact, complications related to the severe acute respiratory syndrome caused by SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2 are mainly due to pronounced inflammation caused by viral replication [ [54](#B54-nutrients-12-01562)]. The infection causes increased secretion of IL-1, IL-4, IL-10, gamma chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1) [ [55](#B55-nutrients-12-01562)]. In addition, it has been noted that human bronchial epithelial cells respond to SARS-CoV infection by producing several NF-B-mediated cytokines, including IL-6 and IL-8 [ [56](#B56-nutrients-12-01562)]. Also, patients with severe COVID-19 in intensive care units have shown elevated plasma levels of several cytokines macrophage inflammatory proteins (MIP-1A), suggesting a cytokine storm, resulting in hyper-inflammation and excessive reactions, such as hyperpyrexia and organ failure associated with disease severity, which can be life-threatening [ [53](#B53-nutrients-12-01562)]. In fact, the severe COVID-19 associated cytokine profile (described also as macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) or secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (sHLH)), is characterized by hyper-inflammation together with multiorgan failure [ [57](#B57-nutrients-12-01562), [58](#B58-nutrients-12-01562)]. Furthermore, the cytokine storm response has been associated with an increased mortality risk, mainly due to respiratory failure from acute respiratory distress syndrome [ [59](#B59-nutrients-12-01562)]. [60](#B60-nutrients-12-01562), [61](#B61-nutrients-12-01562)], the immune system is interrelated with multiple aspects of physiological regulation such as hormonal regulation [ [62](#B62-nutrients-12-01562), [63](#B63-nutrients-12-01562)], as well as nutrient utilization [ [69](#B69-nutrients-12-01562)]. Overall, malnutrition can compromise the immune response [ [70](#B70-nutrients-12-01562)], altering cell regeneration and function and making individuals more prone to infection [ [71](#B71-nutrients-12-01562)]. For example, it is well known that in economically poor areas with protein-malnutrition [ [72](#B72-nutrients-12-01562)], the risk of infection is elevated, though additional factors such as tropical diseases may also be a factor [ [73](#B73-nutrients-12-01562), [74](#B74-nutrients-12-01562)]. In addition, inflammation related to poor dietary habits has reached alarming proportions [ [75](#B75-nutrients-12-01562)], especially with regard to numerous cardio-metabolic diseases related to low-grade chronic inflammation such as overweight/obesity, T2D, metabolic syndrome, and auto-immune and cardiovascular diseases. An increasing body of evidence highlights that dietary modifications and nutritional factors can strongly impinge on chronic low-grade inflammation [ [76](#B76-nutrients-12-01562), [77](#B77-nutrients-12-01562)] and viral infection risk and symptoms ( [Table 1](#nutrients-12-01562-t001)). These can serve best via the prevention of inflammation and oxidative stress and strengthening the immune system, but may also aid in the management of disease and infections as an adjuvant strategy. Consideration of dietary constituents and nutritional factors during the COVID-19 crisis can serve to strengthen the immune system for infection prevention, as well as to promote overall health in times of ongoing national restrictions. The following sections review the roles of various dietary constituents in infection, inflammation, and oxidative stress. 3. Dietary Constituents as Key Factors of a Strong Immune System and Low Infection Risk 3.1. Macronutrients 3.1.1. Proteins [101](#B101-nutrients-12-01562)], such as in economically challenged countries with low protein availability, has been well recognized to increase the risk of infection [ [15](#B15-nutrients-12-01562)]. It is believed that the low pool of available proteins also results in a decreased amount of functional active immunoglobulins and gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT), which play a role in gut-mucosal defense against infection [ [102](#B102-nutrients-12-01562)], among others. Very low protein intake (2% of energy) increased the severity of influenza infection in mice, for example, through a low antibody response, and enhanced virus persistence in the lungs, related to hyper-inflammation and associated mortality [ [79](#B79-nutrients-12-01562)]. Even if the prevalence of protein energy malnutrition (PEM) is low in Westernized countries, several protein sources, especially from food items such as processed meats, and cheese, are high in calories and saturated fats and can aggravate post-prandial effects, favoring lipogenesis and elevated inflammation [ [103](#B103-nutrients-12-01562), [104](#B104-nutrients-12-01562)]. In this respect, the rather pro-inflammatory aspects of proteins from animal sources and anti-inflammatory properties of plant derived proteins have been acknowledged [ [105](#B105-nutrients-12-01562)]. For example, meat-protein-rich diets increase colonic monocytes [ [106](#B106-nutrients-12-01562)], though it can be assumed that other matrix components such as saturated fats do play a role as might the absence of fiber and further phytochemicals. [107](#B107-nutrients-12-01562)]. It is also known that proteins of high biological value, i.e., containing the essential amino acids in required amounts, can reduce post-meal glycemic response and improve satiety due to their effect on prolonged gastric-retention and gastro-intestinal transit time [ [108](#B108-nutrients-12-01562), [109](#B109-nutrients-12-01562)]. Therefore, high quality proteins are an essential component of an anti-inflammatory diet [ [110](#B110-nutrients-12-01562)]. The consumption of a certain amount of proteins of high biological value is known to be crucial for optimal production of antibodies [ [111](#B111-nutrients-12-01562)]. Branched-chain amino acids may maintain villous morphology and increase intestinal immunoglobulin levels, thereby enhancing the gut barrier and response [ [112](#B112-nutrients-12-01562)]. Some amino acids modulate the metabolism and immune functions [ [113](#B113-nutrients-12-01562), [114](#B114-nutrients-12-01562)]. For instance, arginine supplementation increased the response of T-lymphocytes and T-helper cell numbers, and rapidly returned to normal T-cell function after operations, compared to control subjects [ [114](#B114-nutrients-12-01562)], suggesting a role in prolonged or repeated infection. [113](#B113-nutrients-12-01562), [115](#B115-nutrients-12-01562), [116](#B116-nutrients-12-01562), [117](#B117-nutrients-12-01562)]. Glutamine is an neutrophils, and lymphocytes, needed for pathogen-identification through the proliferation of immune cells and the repair of tissues [ [118](#B118-nutrients-12-01562)]. For instance, in the immune system, glutamine plays a key role in controlling the proliferation of cells such as lymphocytes, neutrophils, and macrophages [ [113](#B113-nutrients-12-01562), [116](#B116-nutrients-12-01562)], activating signal transduction, e.g., ERK and JNK kinases. Both can activate a number of transcription factors, including JNK and AP-1, eventually promoting the transcription of genes participating in cell proliferation [ [113](#B113-nutrients-12-01562), [119](#B119-nutrients-12-01562), [120](#B120-nutrients-12-01562)]. In addition, a sufficient glutamine level is important for expressing key lymphocyte cell surface markers and also various cytokines, for [122](#B122-nutrients-12-01562)]. [80](#B80-nutrients-12-01562)]. was related to a reduced expression of IF-, TNF-, and iNOS [ [80](#B80-nutrients-12-01562)]. Interestingly, these effects were reversed rapidly within 2 weeks of changing the diet [ [123](#B123-nutrients-12-01562)]. In humans, protein malnutrition and increased susceptibility to Zika and influenza viruses is related to cell mediated immunity and decreased bactericidal function of neutrophils, the complement system, and IgA as well as antibody response [ [124](#B124-nutrients-12-01562)]. Low protein status, characterized by low albumin or pre-albumin levels, but also low iron and vitamin E correlated with lower responses to influenza vaccination in the elderly, thereby highlighting the interrelation between various nutrients and the immune response [ [78](#B78-nutrients-12-01562)]. 3.1.2. Lipids [125](#B125-nutrients-12-01562)]. FAs in particular have been shown to affect the homeostasis and immune cell functioning in mice, e.g., epithelial cells, macrophages, dendritic cells, innate lymphoid cells, neutrophils, and T- and B cells [ [126](#B126-nutrients-12-01562)]. In general, increased fibrinogen and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), an acute phase protein of hepatic origin, have been linked to saturated FAs consumption, while lower hs-CRP levels have been linked with polyunsaturated FA [ [127](#B127-nutrients-12-01562)]. In particular, omega-3 FAs appear to have the most potent anti-inflammatory capability, though not all omega-3 FAs are anti-inflammatory [ [18](#B18-nutrients-12-01562)]. Trans-fatty acid intake, especially from processed foods such as fries and chips, has also been described as pro-inflammatory, being associated with increased TNF-, FAs include various plant sources ( [Table 2](#nutrients-12-01562-t002)) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) consumed especially from fish and seafood sources, such as salmon, mackerel, and tuna. Omega-6 FAs such as arachidonic acid are primarily pro-inflammatory [ [75](#B75-nutrients-12-01562), [131](#B131-nutrients-12-01562), [132](#B132-nutrients-12-01562)], subset of oxylipins) such leukotrienes derived from (COX) and lipoxygenase (LOX) enzymes, respectively [ [129](#B129-nutrients-12-01562)]. Eicosanoid signaling resembles that of cytokine signaling and is part of the innate immune response [ [133](#B133-nutrients-12-01562)]. Their signaling is influenced by phospholipase A2 activity, which regulates the different phases of the inflammatory response by releasing eicosanoids. Furthermore, their regulation includes class switching in which pro-inflammatory eicosanoid synthesis (and accompanying TLR4 activation of NF-B induces to anti-inflammatory omega-3-derived oxylipins are specialized pro-resolving mediators, capable of enhancing bacterial clearance together with a downregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines and enhanced removal of apoptotic neutrophils [ [132](#B132-nutrients-12-01562)]. This is believed to contribute to the positive health effects of omega-3 consumption. [126](#B126-nutrients-12-01562), [134](#B134-nutrients-12-01562), [135](#B135-nutrients-12-01562), [136](#B136-nutrients-12-01562), [137](#B137-nutrients-12-01562)]. As omega-3 and FAs may compete for the same enzymes, elevated omega-6 FA concentrations can hamper the omega-3 FA metabolism [ [138](#B138-nutrients-12-01562)]. Thus, it is recommended to keep a healthy balance between omega-6 and omega-3, with a ratio of 1:1-4:1 [ [139](#B139-nutrients-12-01562), [140](#B140-nutrients-12-01562)]. Unfortunately, the intake-ratio of omega-6 to omega-3 FAs has been reported to be in the range of 10:1 in individuals consuming Westernized diets, thereby possibly fostering pro-inflammatory responses [ [141](#B141-nutrients-12-01562)]. For example, in patients with rheumatic diseases, characterized by strong chronic inflammation, omega-3 fatty acid administration resulted in improvements of eicosanoid synthesis toward a less inflammatory profile and reduced pro-inflammatory cytokine production [ [142](#B142-nutrients-12-01562)]. Responses following 4-month supplementation fatty acids of 2.5 g/d and 1.25 g/d vs. placebo were compared in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) study in healthy adults. A significant decrease in serum IL-6 by 10% and 12% in the low and high dose omega-3 FAs groups, respectively, was seen, compared to a 36% increase in the placebo group [ [143](#B143-nutrients-12-01562)]. Likewise, another RCT reported that omega-3 FA supplementation resulted in reduced IL-6 production, while decreasing omega-6/omega-3 ratios reduced the production of stimulated IL-6 and TNF- [ [144](#B144-nutrients-12-01562)]. [81](#B81-nutrients-12-01562)]. On the other hand, care has to be taken; in an earlier study, mice fed fish oil for 2 weeks had a reduced inflammatory state, even in the lungs, that resulted in increased morbidity and mortality, the latter by 40% [ [145](#B145-nutrients-12-01562)]. This was accompanied with reduced CD8+ T cell populations and decreased mRNA expression of protein1-, TNF-, and IL-6. Thus, while reducing inflammation during hyper-inflammation and cytokine storm conditions is likely beneficial, a general reduction of inflammatory state during infection may be a double-edged sword. In another study with mice, consumption of 6 weeks of omega-3 FA-rich diets had no effect on vaccinia virus infection of the respiratory tract [ [146](#B146-nutrients-12-01562)]. It can be hypothesized that prior FA status, amount, time of omega-3 FA intake, and state of infection need to be considered. Unfortunately, well-designed human studies on this are missing. [82](#B82-nutrients-12-01562)]. A high-fat diet administration in mice has also been associated with an efficacy reduction in influenza vaccine through a reduced antibody response, due to macrophage dysfunction in fatty environments [ [83](#B83-nutrients-12-01562), [147](#B147-nutrients-12-01562)]. 3.1.3. Carbohydrates and Dietary Fiber [110](#B110-nutrients-12-01562)]. Even a single high glycemic index meal has been associated with an immediate increase of inflammatory cytokines and C-reactive protein [ [148](#B148-nutrients-12-01562), [149](#B149-nutrients-12-01562)]. Increased levels of TNF- and IL-6 have also been correlated with a higher glycemic index/glycemic GI/GL [ carbohydrates can improve postprandial glycemia and lower inflammatory responses [ [151](#B151-nutrients-12-01562)]. In contrast, less processed, low-GL foods, such as vegetables, fruit, nuts, seeds, and whole grains, do not trigger such adverse post-prandial inflammatory effects [ [152](#B152-nutrients-12-01562)]; this is attributed to more complex food matrices slowing down the digestion and absorption of carbohydrates. Interestingly, the administration of a ketogenic diet, i.e., a high fat but low-carbohydrate diet (<10% energy), seemed to protect mice from the severity of influenza A virus infection in terms of morbidity and mortality through the expansion of gamma delta T cells in the lungs. These cells play an essential role of host defense against the influenza A virus infection [ [84](#B84-nutrients-12-01562)]. [153](#B153-nutrients-12-01562), [154](#B154-nutrients-12-01562)]. A significant reduction in hs-CRP concentrations has been observed with increased fiber (i.e., 3.3 g/MJ or approximately 30 g/d) consumption [ [13](#B13-nutrients-12-01562)]. In general, while the intake of 25 g and 38 g of fiber for women and men, respectively, is recommended, true intake is generally lower (around 15-20 g/d), at least in Westernized countries [ [155](#B155-nutrients-12-01562)]. Another advantage of whole-grain intake is also a more favorable gut microbiome composition, which lowers both gut and systemic inflammation, and even small increases of only 5 g additional fiber per day can be beneficial [ [156](#B156-nutrients-12-01562), [157](#B157-nutrients-12-01562)]. Increased whole-grain intake (again with amounts of fiber even below 5 g/d) has been associated with decreased hs-CRP, IL-6, CVD, T2D, and such as acetate, propionate, and butyrate constitute important fatty acids that are produced by the gut microbiota during dietary fiber fermentation [ [165](#B165-nutrients-12-01562)]. In cancer, intestinal homeostasis has in particular been attributed to the SCFA-related histone deacetylase inhibition, involved in enhancing the inflammatory response through gene regulation of cell proliferation and differentiation [ [166](#B166-nutrients-12-01562), [167](#B167-nutrients-12-01562), [168](#B168-nutrients-12-01562), [169](#B169-nutrients-12-01562), [170](#B170-nutrients-12-01562)]. Anti-inflammatory signaling G-protein-coupled receptor (GPRs) in pro-inflammatory molecules release such as TNF, IL-1, and NO [ [178](#B178-nutrients-12-01562)], and reducing NF-B expression [ [178](#B178-nutrients-12-01562), [179](#B179-nutrients-12-01562)]. SCFAs might be key regulators of inflammatory diseases by tightly controlling the migration of immune cells toward inflammatory sites as well as by modulating their activation state, enabling accelerated pathogen clearance through ROS activation [ [163](#B163-nutrients-12-01562), [164](#B164-nutrients-12-01562)]. [180](#B180-nutrients-12-01562)]. Such species could contribute to reducing the growth of health-detrimental pathogens, including Clostridium spp. [ spp. has been associated in a systematic review with lower systemic inflammation, characterized by reduced hs-CRP and IL-6 [ [182](#B182-nutrients-12-01562)], even though probiotic interventions with bacteria have not always shown systematic benefits [ [183](#B183-nutrients-12-01562)]. Furthermore, dietary fiber may, as has been shown in a mouse model, also enhance mucosa thickness. This may prevent bacteria from degrading this important barrier, through which allergens and other microbes could otherwise infiltrate the human host [ [87](#B87-nutrients-12-01562)]. For further interactions between the gut microbiota, diet, and health-related aspects, the reader is referred to more comprehensive reviews [ [184](#B184-nutrients-12-01562), [185](#B185-nutrients-12-01562)]. [186](#B186-nutrients-12-01562)]. An interplay between respiratory tract infections and the gut microbiota has been emphasized. Although viral infections can change the microbiome, the latter also is involved in adaptive immune responses against respiratory pathogens [ [187](#B187-nutrients-12-01562), [188](#B188-nutrients-12-01562)], triggering immune reactions of the innate system [ [189](#B189-nutrients-12-01562)]. For instance, responses of macrophages to respiratory viruses are linked to the presence of distinct gut microbes. The importance of the gut microbiota for functioning innate immune responses has been demonstrated in animal models. Antibiotic treatment of animals resulted in defective macrophage responses to IFNs, resulting in hampered effects to control viral replication [ [190](#B190-nutrients-12-01562)]. [191](#B191-nutrients-12-01562), [192](#B192-nutrients-12-01562)]. It has become clear that these effects depend on immune-regulatory cells. In particular, elevated mRNA levels, i.e., IL-1, IL-18, IL-12, through the lymphatic and circulatory systems (gut-lung axis) have been observed in mice pre-treated with probiotics. Also, studies employing mouse models indicated the microbiota contributed to establish a defense-system against pathogens, such as blocking cell internalization [ [193](#B193-nutrients-12-01562)], binding to and destabilizing virion morphology [ [194](#B194-nutrients-12-01562)], inhibiting further influenza virus infections [ [195](#B195-nutrients-12-01562)], but also suppressing other viral replication, i.e., of herpes simplex virus (HSV)-2 [ [196](#B196-nutrients-12-01562)]. It is obvious that the gut microbiota forms a dynamic environment that can be disturbed by virus infection, but can be positively modulated by dietary constituents. COVID-19 has been associated with both respiratory and gastroenteritis symptoms [ [197](#B197-nutrients-12-01562)]; the latter can affect the diversity of the gut microbiota and increase the risk of contracting secondary bacterial infections. [85](#B85-nutrients-12-01562)]. In this study, for each 10 g increase in dietary fiber per day, the mortality-relative risk from infectious and respiratory diseases decreased by 34% and 18% in men and 39% and 34% in women, respectively. In another observational study with 11,897 US men [ [198](#B198-nutrients-12-01562)], dietary fiber intake was associated with reduced risk of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD, not necessarily related to infection). Highest versus lowest quintiles showed an odds ratio (OR) of 0.85 for total fiber, 0.83 for cereal fiber, and 0.72 for fruit fiber, all of which were significant. Of note, T-cells from the lungs may migrate to the gut to produce type I IFNs. This may then result in Th17 cell activation, increasing IL-15 and IL-17 secretion, damaging epithelial cells in the gut [ [199](#B199-nutrients-12-01562)]. [200](#B200-nutrients-12-01562)]. In a recent systematic review including 11 RCTs with almost 2500 children, it was highlighted that probiotic treatment reduced respiratory infections [ [201](#B201-nutrients-12-01562)]. As dietary fiber can influence gut microbiota and have prebiotic functions, it may be hypothesized that a similar effect can be found also with dietary fiber, though direct evidence for humans is, to our knowledge, lacking. Additional evidence has emerged from animal models. Recently, it was shown that mice fed dietary fiber exhibited increased survival rates to influenza virus infection [ [86](#B86-nutrients-12-01562)] by increasing macrophages with a reduced production of the chemokine CXCL1 (causing neutrophil recruitment to the lung), as well as improving CD8+ T cell function. In another study, mice on a fiber-free diet were more susceptible to Citrobacter rodentium, a mucosal pathogen, likely due to the mucosa erosion also observed [ [87](#B87-nutrients-12-01562)]. 3.2. Micronutrients [202](#B202-nutrients-12-01562)], with a few exceptions such as for iron (measured by hemoglobin). However, plasma and serum are often a fast-exchanging pool, and levels in tissues would be a superior marker for status determination. 3.2.1. Vitamins Vitamin A [203](#B203-nutrients-12-01562), [204](#B204-nutrients-12-01562)]. In fact, it is among the most abundant micronutrient deficiencies worldwide, especially in countries with low protein and meat intake [ [205](#B205-nutrients-12-01562), [206](#B206-nutrients-12-01562)]. However, vitamin A can also be formed out of pro-vitamin A carotenoids such as - or -carotene, being the major vitamin A source in individuals with low meat intake [ [207](#B207-nutrients-12-01562), [208](#B208-nutrients-12-01562)]. Vitamin A is important for the morphology of the epithelium, playing a role in its keratinization, stratification, differentiation, and functional maturation [ [209](#B209-nutrients-12-01562)], constituting a front line of defense against pathogens. Vitamin A is involved in the formation of healthy mucus layers, such as those of the respiratory tract and the intestine, required for mucin secretion and enhancing antigen non-specific immunity [211](#B211-nutrients-12-01562)]. Therefore, (all-trans and 9-cis) retinoic acids play crucial roles in the regulation of the differentiation, maturation, and function of the innate immune system and cells, e.g., macrophages [ [212](#B212-nutrients-12-01562)] and neutrophils [ [213](#B213-nutrients-12-01562)]. Retinoic acid promotes an immediate response to pathogen invasion by phagocytosis and activation of natural killer (NK) T-cells, which relate immune-regulatory functions through cytotoxic activity [ [214](#B214-nutrients-12-01562), [215](#B215-nutrients-12-01562)]. Retinoic acid can also alter the differentiation of dendritic cell precursors [ [216](#B216-nutrients-12-01562), [217](#B217-nutrients-12-01562), [218](#B218-nutrients-12-01562)]. These are specialized sentinels of the immune system, orchestrating innate and adaptive immune responses [ [219](#B219-nutrients-12-01562)]. It is thus not surprising that low vitamin A status (measured typically as serum retinol) has been shown to correlate with hampered function of neutrophils, macrophages, as well as T-and B-cells [ [220](#B220-nutrients-12-01562)]. A critical role in the etiology of influenza, together with vitamin D, has been also proposed [ [219](#B219-nutrients-12-01562)]. Furthermore, individuals with low vitamin A status exhibit histopathological alterations to the pulmonary epithelial lignin and lung parenchyma, resulting in increased risk of lung dysfunction and respiratory disease [ [221](#B221-nutrients-12-01562)]. This is particularly relevant considering the effects that COVID-19 has on lung function [ [222](#B222-nutrients-12-01562)]. [223](#B223-nutrients-12-01562)]. Furthermore, a lack of association between plasma -carotene, retinal (as well as -tocopherol and zinc), and response to the influence of a vaccine was shown in the elderly, suggesting that the immune response was not significantly influenced by the differences of these micronutrients in this population [ [224](#B224-nutrients-12-01562)]. This may be because a low status of vitamin A in Westernized countries is rather uncommon. Of note, vitamin A supplementation did not affect the risk of lower respiratory diseases (LRD) and symptoms in a systematic review in children [ [88](#B88-nutrients-12-01562)], suggesting that vitamin A supplementation should not generally be recommended for LRD prevention. Similar results were found in an earlier meta-analysis, where risk of infection of acute respiratory diseases in developing countries was non-significantly higher in the supplemented group [ [89](#B89-nutrients-12-01562)]. In a recent review, it has been highlighted that vitamin A losses occur in infection via impaired vitamin A absorption and urinary losses [ [19](#B19-nutrients-12-01562)]. In general, studies investigating the efficacy of vitamin A supplementation on improvement of immune responses to vaccines have produced conflicting results [ [225](#B225-nutrients-12-01562)]. However, it is suspected that the influence of pre-existing vitamin A stores and extra-nuclear activities of their hormone receptors play crucial roles in resulting responses. More well-controlled studies are warranted in order to sufficiently investigate this topic. Vitamin D [226](#B226-nutrients-12-01562)]. In fact, T-cell functioning is closely related to vitamin D [ [227](#B227-nutrients-12-01562)]. T-cells express the CYP27B1 gene, responsible for processing the pre-hormone vitamer of vitamin D (25-hydroxyvitamin D), calcidiol into the active hormone (calcitriol). Only after binding to calcitriol can T-cells can carry out their physiological functions [ [228](#B228-nutrients-12-01562)]. Other immune cells are involved in CYP27B1 expression, e.g., macrophages and dendritic cells, enabling vitamin D activation [ [227](#B227-nutrients-12-01562), [228](#B228-nutrients-12-01562)]. As for vitamin A with RAR/retinoid X receptor (RXR), the activated vitamin D form of calcitriol can bind to a specific nuclear receptor (vitamin D receptor, VDR). While this receptor is especially known for its role in regulating phosphorus and calcium levels and thus bone metabolism, its role for both the innate and adaptive immune systems has been highlighted [ [229](#B229-nutrients-12-01562)]. Vitamin D has been controversially discussed for its role in influenza prevention and therapy [ [230](#B230-nutrients-12-01562)], and the WHO has discussed its role in the prevention of respiratory diseases in children [ [91](#B91-nutrients-12-01562)]. [231](#B231-nutrients-12-01562)] between low- and high-dosed vitamin D children, though low vitamin D status at study onset could have played a role. In a recent review discussing intervention trials, mixed results were observed [ [230](#B230-nutrients-12-01562)]. Vitamin D therapy, in a meta-analysis, improved conditions in individuals with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), though this was not caused only by infection [ [232](#B232-nutrients-12-01562)], similar to another meta-analysis [ [232](#B232-nutrients-12-01562)]. Another review reported on a reduced risk of influenza and COVID-19 infections and mortality [ [233](#B233-nutrients-12-01562)], mostly due to related inflammatory status and anti-microbial peptides such as cathelicidin and defensins and by modulating adaptive immunity, such as reducing Th1 helper cell responses. This is corroborated by a meta-analysis of RCTs, finding protective effects of vitamin D against respiratory tract infection, with daily dosing appearing to be the most effective strategy [ [92](#B92-nutrients-12-01562)]. Other, more direct effects on virus-receptor binding could also play a role. Interestingly, vitamin D supplementation promoted binding of the SARS-CoV-2 cell entry receptor ACE2 (angiotensin converting enzyme 2) to AGTR1 (angiotensin II receptor type 1), reducing the number of virus particles that could attach to ACE2 and enter the cell [ [26](#B26-nutrients-12-01562)]. [90](#B90-nutrients-12-01562)]. [234](#B234-nutrients-12-01562)]. Interestingly, at the same time, the Southern Hemisphere is entering autumn and will have the highest vitamin D blood levels at this season. Conversely, Northern Hemisphere countries are entering Spring and have their lowest blood vitamin D levels after winter. In Europe, COVID-related mortality appears blunted with increased latitude. For instance, Nordic countries such as Finland and Norway that have either mandatory vitamin D fortification or higher vitamin D intakes have among the highest vitamin D levels in Europe but also lower mortality. Conversely, despite the high sun exposure, older populations in Italy and Spain show a much lower vitamin D status and higher COVID-mortality rates [ [235](#B235-nutrients-12-01562)]. Surely, correlations are not causation (as infection protocols, testing, population isolation, healthcare, etc. all modify infection rates), but it provides an interesting research hypothesis to confirm with RCTs. Vitamin E [236](#B236-nutrients-12-01562)]. [237](#B237-nutrients-12-01562)], which are important for intertwining innate and adaptive immune systems to orchestrate immune response [ [238](#B238-nutrients-12-01562), [239](#B239-nutrients-12-01562), [240](#B240-nutrients-12-01562)]. In addition to increasing NK cells activity, by modulating NO levels [ [241](#B241-nutrients-12-01562)], vitamin E administration enforces humoral (B cells) as well as antibody responses, both in animals and humans [ [242](#B242-nutrients-12-01562), [243](#B243-nutrients-12-01562)]. Vitamin E has been shown to improve na\u00efve T-cells immune synapse formation and [246](#B246-nutrients-12-01562)]. [247](#B247-nutrients-12-01562), [248](#B248-nutrients-12-01562), [249](#B249-nutrients-12-01562)], but well controlled studies in humans are lacking. In a study with mice, vitamin E administration (60 mg/kg per day for up to 7 d) was superior in reducing the elevated oxidative stress resulting from influenza infection [ [248](#B248-nutrients-12-01562)] compared to vitamin C (80 mg/kg), but the combination of both was most successful in reducing lipid peroxidation. Following influenza infection in mice, vitamin E supplementation decreased lung related-pathology and mortality through the improvement of the T-helper 1-type cytokines response, which produces pro-inflammatory responses against intracellular parasites [ [250](#B250-nutrients-12-01562)]. [251](#B251-nutrients-12-01562), [252](#B252-nutrients-12-01562)]. A recent study conducted in Malaysian adults in which volunteers received either tocopherol or tocotrienol supplementation showed increased expression of a variety of genes associated with the immune response [ [253](#B253-nutrients-12-01562)]. Interestingly, the specific genes altered were different between the two groups. Furthermore, vitamin E supplementation, after a first hospitalization in elderly with pneumonia, was associated with 63% reduced re-hospitalization within 90 days [ [254](#B254-nutrients-12-01562)]. In an RCT, elderly, healthy participants receiving 200 mg/d capsules of vitamin E for 4 months had a 65% increase delayed-type hypersensitivity skin response (p = 0.04) compared to placebo, and also improved antibody titers of hepatitis B and tetanus vaccines, highlighting implications in T-cell mediated functions [ [243](#B243-nutrients-12-01562)]. In another study conducted among 2216 smokers receiving 50 mg/d of vitamin E for 5-8 years, it was shown that vitamin E supplementation reduced pneumonia incidence by 69% in elderly men [ [93](#B93-nutrients-12-01562)]. Vitamin C [20](#B20-nutrients-12-01562)]. However, vitamin C also acts as a cofactor for a number of biosynthetic and gene regulatory monooxygenase Several (cell-culture) and pre-clinical studies have highlighted the barrier-enhancing effects of vitamin C, especially regarding lipid synthesis, via influencing signaling and biosynthetic pathways [ [260](#B260-nutrients-12-01562), [261](#B261-nutrients-12-01562), [262](#B262-nutrients-12-01562), [263](#B263-nutrients-12-01562), [264](#B264-nutrients-12-01562)]. In acid can alter gene expression in dermal fibroblasts, enhancing their proliferation and migration that play paramount roles for tissue remodeling, important in wound healing, for example [ [265](#B265-nutrients-12-01562), [266](#B266-nutrients-12-01562)]. Vitamin C has been shown to stimulate the migration of neutrophils to the infection site, stimulating phagocytosis and ROS generation [ [267](#B267-nutrients-12-01562), [268](#B268-nutrients-12-01562), [269](#B269-nutrients-12-01562)]. [270](#B270-nutrients-12-01562)], and it further aids in macrophage removal [ [268](#B268-nutrients-12-01562)]. Finally, ascorbic acid plays a role in the differentiation and maturation of T-cells [ [271](#B271-nutrients-12-01562), [272](#B272-nutrients-12-01562)]. Similar maturation has been observed with immature NK cells, as well as proliferative and differentiation effects with mature NK cells [ [273](#B273-nutrients-12-01562)]. [274](#B274-nutrients-12-01562)], and positive effects were found in some intervention trials such as shortening the duration of colds [ [274](#B274-nutrients-12-01562)]. In a study with mice exposed to restraint stress and virus-induced pneumonia (H1N1) [ [275](#B275-nutrients-12-01562)], vitamin C administration (125 and 250 mg/kg) was shown to reduce mitochondrial antiviral signaling (MAVS) and interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) and to increase NF-B expression, while reducing steroid hydroxylating enzymes. As reviewed earlier [ [276](#B276-nutrients-12-01562)], a few controlled studies found significant benefits for supplementing vitamin C in subjects with pneumonia. For example, in a double-blinded controlled trial with elderly participants, 200 mg/d of ascorbic acid for 4 weeks improved respiratory condition [ [277](#B277-nutrients-12-01562)]. In a recent meta-analysis of nine RCTs, extra doses (0.7 to 8 g/d) of vitamin C against common cold virus infections reduced duration of infection, shortened time of indoor confinement, and relieved symptoms [ [94](#B94-nutrients-12-01562)]. In another meta-analysis of eight RCTs in 3135 children, supplementation of vitamin C with 0.5-2 g/day did not prevent infection of upper respiratory tract diseases, but reduced the duration of infection by 1.6 days [ [278](#B278-nutrients-12-01562)]. B Vitamins [279](#B279-nutrients-12-01562)]. However, the effect of vitamin B2 alone is not known. Administration of vitamin B3 for lung injury treatment in mice, through nicotinamide treatment, significantly decreased inflammation and reduced the neutrophil infiltration, although hypoxemia was surprisingly increased [ [280](#B280-nutrients-12-01562)]. NAD+-dependent enzymes and their role regarding inhibiting effects of nicotinamide deserve further investigation. Low plasma pyridoxal 5phosphate (PLP), the active coenzyme form of vitamin B6, has been significantly associated with impaired humoral and cell-mediated immunity [ [281](#B281-nutrients-12-01562), [282](#B282-nutrients-12-01562), [283](#B283-nutrients-12-01562), [284](#B284-nutrients-12-01562)]. ill patients, vitamin B6 supplementation increased plasma PLP concentrations associated with increased total lymphocyte cells, including T-helper and T-suppressor cells [ [285](#B285-nutrients-12-01562)]. The inverse relation of vitamin B6 intake and inflammation status has been well reviewed previously [ [286](#B286-nutrients-12-01562)]. [287](#B287-nutrients-12-01562)]. Individual studies have also shown that cobalamin (vitamin B12) may act as an immunomodulator. For example, vitamin B12-deficient patients have shown decreased levels of CD8+ cells, an abnormally high CD4/CD8 ratio, and subdued activity of NK cells [ [288](#B288-nutrients-12-01562)]. Methylcobalamin administration to these patients improved the CD4/CD8 ratio and suppressed NK cell activity and CD3-/CD16+ cell increases [ [288](#B288-nutrients-12-01562)]. Vitamin B forms have also shown to be efficient in lowering inflammation caused by virus infection. In particular, in patients with HIV, high vitamin B3, vitamin B6, and vitamin B12 intake in the form of niacin, pyridoxine, and cobalamin, respectively, have been significantly associated with lower inflammation levels such as decreased CRP [ [95](#B95-nutrients-12-01562)]. [289](#B289-nutrients-12-01562)]. Homocysteine is associated with oxidative stress and is known to increase during B-vitamin deficiencies, especially folate and vitamin B12. In another long-term (7 years) RCT trial it was tested whether a daily administration of folic acid (2.5 mg), vitamin B6 (50 mg), and vitamin B12 (1 mg), versus placebo, could prevent CVD disease markers in women (n = 300). The combination treatment did not change major biomarkers of vascular inflammation [ [290](#B290-nutrients-12-01562)]. Trials with a larger number of participants and stronger epidemiological designs would provide more definitive information about the role of B vitamins in the immune system and infection. 3.2.2. Minerals [9](#B9-nutrients-12-01562)]. Magnesium is co-factor for many enzymes, playing a role in energy-metabolism, and a low status could interfere with numerous enzymatic reactions. Similarly, trace-elements such as zinc, copper, and selenium are required as co-factors for a variety of enzymes involved in antioxidant reactions, and have been implicated in boosting the immune system [ [291](#B291-nutrients-12-01562), [292](#B292-nutrients-12-01562)]. Several mineral deficiencies often occur together, such as low iron together with low zinc status [ [293](#B293-nutrients-12-01562)]. Zinc [294](#B294-nutrients-12-01562)] and also appears to be prevalent in Westernized countries [ [295](#B295-nutrients-12-01562), [296](#B296-nutrients-12-01562)]. A low zinc status has been associated with increased risk of viral infections [ [297](#B297-nutrients-12-01562)]. Zinc has been shown to be important for skin maintenance and mucosal membrane integrity [ [292](#B292-nutrients-12-01562)], and the un-chelated free form of zinc has been shown to have direct antiviral effects, such as on rhinovirus replication in vitro [ [291](#B291-nutrients-12-01562)]. Zinc is essential for cellular growth and differentiation of immune cells, having a fast differentiation and turnover rate, and helps to modulate cytokine release and trigger CD8+ T-cell proliferation [ [298](#B298-nutrients-12-01562)]. Zinc has also been proposed to be crucial for intracellular binding of tyrosine kinase to T-cell receptors, which is needed for the development and activation of T-lymphocytes [ [299](#B299-nutrients-12-01562)]. Zinc is an important cofactor for over 750 zinc-finger transcription factors, and thus implicated in DNA and RNA synthesis [ [300](#B300-nutrients-12-01562)], also necessary for the production of immune-related proteins. By stabilizing the tertiary structure or as an essential component of the enzyme's catalytic site [ [301](#B301-nutrients-12-01562)], zinc serves as a cofactor for over 200 enzymes involved in antioxidant defense, notably of SOD and anti-inflammatory SMAD proteins [ [302](#B302-nutrients-12-01562)]. [303](#B303-nutrients-12-01562)]. The mortality due to pneumonia has been reported to be twice as high in individuals with low zinc status versus individuals with normal zinc levels [ [303](#B303-nutrients-12-01562)]. For some time, zinc has been suggested to improve symptoms of the common cold. In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, patients (n = 100) with common cold symptoms took 13.3 mg of zinc as long as symptoms were present [ [96](#B96-nutrients-12-01562)]. Compared to a placebo, zinc significantly reduced the duration of symptoms of the common cold, from 7.6 to 4.4 days. Iron [296](#B296-nutrients-12-01562)], and its association with infectious diseases is well-recognized [ [304](#B304-nutrients-12-01562), [305](#B305-nutrients-12-01562)]. Often, low iron and low vitamin A status go together, as both are absorbed well from foods with a high content of protein such as meat and meat products [ [306](#B306-nutrients-12-01562), [307](#B307-nutrients-12-01562)]. Vitamin A appears to modulate hematopoiesis and iron metabolism, enhancing immunity to infectious diseases [ [306](#B306-nutrients-12-01562), [307](#B307-nutrients-12-01562), [308](#B308-nutrients-12-01562)]. Iron appears as an essential component in cell differentiation, growth, and functioning (e.g., DNA synthesis through ribonucleotide reductase). Iron helps to fight off infections by enabling T-lymphocyte immune cell proliferation and maturation as well as regulating cytokines production and action against bacteria, for example, by neutrophil action [ [291](#B291-nutrients-12-01562), [292](#B292-nutrients-12-01562)]. [309](#B309-nutrients-12-01562)] and viral infections [ [310](#B310-nutrients-12-01562)], including respiratory infections [ [311](#B311-nutrients-12-01562)], has been critically reviewed, highlighting that iron homeostasis and levels are tightly controlled. During inflammation, iron absorption is downregulated via hepcidin [ [309](#B309-nutrients-12-01562)] in order to limit the available pool of iron for proliferating bacteria and virus particles and to limit excessive oxidative stress. However, during prolonged periods of iron deficiency, antibody production is typically reduced, as shown in experimental studies with mice exposed to influenza virus [ [97](#B97-nutrients-12-01562)]. This has also been shown in elderly adults, relating iron deficiency to disturbed cell-mediated and innate immunity [ [312](#B312-nutrients-12-01562)]. In a case-control study in 485 hospitalized 2-5 year old children receiving 3 months of iron supplementation, recurrences of acute respiratory tract infections, urinary tract infections, and gastroenteritis were significantly reduced [ [313](#B313-nutrients-12-01562)]. Copper [292](#B292-nutrients-12-01562)] and has been associated with IL-2 production and response. High concentrations of copper may be toxic for invading microbes and appear to be employed by macrophages as a defense strategy [ [314](#B314-nutrients-12-01562)], which could play a role in secondary infections following viral infection. Copper is further involved in T cell proliferation [ [315](#B315-nutrients-12-01562)], antibody production, and cellular immunity [ [298](#B298-nutrients-12-01562)]. A healthy copper status has been related to aiding in the defense against several bacterial infections, including E. coli, Salmonella, and tuberculosis [ [316](#B316-nutrients-12-01562)]. However, since copper needs are very low (it is often considered an ultra-trace element) and it is ubiquitously distributed, copper deficiency is rather rare. Selenium [317](#B317-nutrients-12-01562)], and its relationships with influenza virus, hepatitis C virus, coxsackie virus, among others, have been reported [ [317](#B317-nutrients-12-01562), [318](#B318-nutrients-12-01562)]. Low selenium status has been reported in multiple geographical regions including Western countries [ [319](#B319-nutrients-12-01562)]. Requiring selenium for their synthesis, selenoproteins include several antioxidant enzymes such GPx, selenoprotein P, thioredoxin reductase [ [320](#B320-nutrients-12-01562), [321](#B321-nutrients-12-01562)]. Therefore, one of selenium's primary roles is its ability as an antioxidant to quench ROS [ [322](#B322-nutrients-12-01562)]. For example, these selenoproteins play vital roles in the hosts' antioxidant defense system, influencing leukocyte and NK cell function [ [315](#B315-nutrients-12-01562)]. It has been reported that selenium is protective against the heart-damaging effects of the cytomegalovirus [ [291](#B291-nutrients-12-01562)] and is involved in T-lymphocyte proliferation and the humoral especially immunoglobulin production [ [315](#B315-nutrients-12-01562)]. [317](#B317-nutrients-12-01562)]. Selenium supplementation seems to act on selenoprotein gene expression, improving the vaccine response [ [98](#B98-nutrients-12-01562)]. However, supplementation with selenium may be a double-edged sword of low therapeutic width, as supplementation has been discussed in relation to elevated incidence of type 2 diabetes [ [323](#B323-nutrients-12-01562)]. [324](#B324-nutrients-12-01562)]. In a recent RCT, critically ill patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome received selenium in the form of sodium selenite (1 mg for 3 days and 1 mg/d for a further 6 days) [ [325](#B325-nutrients-12-01562)]. Selenium concentrations were linearly associated with serum GPx levels and antioxidant activity, as determined by ferric-reducing antioxidant power. Both IL-1 and IL-6 serum concentrations were inversely associated with selenium serum levels. However, no effects on overall survival, the duration of mechanical ventilation, or ICU stay were apparent, which also raises caution in interpolating findings from sub-clinical markers Polyphenols [326](#B326-nutrients-12-01562), [327](#B327-nutrients-12-01562), [328](#B328-nutrients-12-01562)]. This has been attributed to the high fiber content and higher concentrations of certain vitamins and minerals in these food items, together with a lower caloric density as described above, and other protective phytochemicals abundant in a plant-based diet. Adding fruits and vegetables to the diet, such as those rich in flavonoids, have significantly reduced serum inflammatory markers [ [21](#B21-nutrients-12-01562), [329](#B329-nutrients-12-01562), [330](#B330-nutrients-12-01562)] by reactivity, reducing [332](#B332-nutrients-12-01562)], number of flavonoids including quercetin have been studied in vitro, i.e., in cell culture monolayers, to examine their potential antiviral properties, for example, infectivity and replication of herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-I), polio-virus type 1, parainfluenza type 3 (Pf-3), and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). Quercetin decreased, dependent on its concentration, viral infectivity, and hampering of intracellular viral replication, when mono-layers were infected and subsequently cultured in quercetin-containing medium [ [339](#B339-nutrients-12-01562)]. [340](#B340-nutrients-12-01562)]. The consumption of high-polyphenol diets, likely exert [ and AP-1 and activation of Nrf2 [ [345](#B345-nutrients-12-01562)], have improved lipid profiles and reduced dyslipidemia, via improving concentration and function of HDL-cholesterol and reduction in LDL-cholesterol [ [346](#B346-nutrients-12-01562), [347](#B347-nutrients-12-01562), [348](#B348-nutrients-12-01562)]. In addition to their potential, direct antioxidant effects, several phytochemicals have been proposed to interact with transcription factors, especially NF-kB and Nrf-2 [ [22](#B22-nutrients-12-01562)]. Polyphenols have also been advertised for their potential pre-biotic effects on the gut [ [349](#B349-nutrients-12-01562), [350](#B350-nutrients-12-01562)]. [351](#B351-nutrients-12-01562)]. The major important mechanisms highlighted were suppression of neuramidase and hemagglutinin activity, influences on viral replication, viral hemagglutination, adhesion and penetration into the host cell, as well as modifying cellular signaling pathways and transcription factors. A strong anti-influenza virus activity in chicken embryo fibroblast cells and in mice was shown following the administration of an extract of Geranium sanguineum L., rich in polyphenols [ [352](#B352-nutrients-12-01562)]. Likewise, coumarin derivatives (bis(triazolothiadiazinyl coumarin)) were studied for their anti-influenza activity. Within various cell models, the positive effect of coumarin against viral infections such as of HIV, influenza, enterovirus 71(EV71), and coxsackievirus A16 (CVA16) was shown. This was explained by different mechanisms, including changing protein conformation needed for viral entry, effects on replication and infectivity, and also cellular signaling regulation via AKT-mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin), NF-B, and Nrf-2, important for stimulating the body's own antioxidative system [ [353](#B353-nutrients-12-01562)]. In addition, theaflavin derivatives (polyphenols from black tea) had a strong inhibitory effect against influenza virus in vitro [ [354](#B354-nutrients-12-01562)], perhaps due to downregulation of IL-6 expression. Similar anti-viral activities were reported for further polyphenol constituents due to the implications of MAPK kinases involved in the transport of viral ribonucleoprotein complexes in the cytosol and interactions in vital hemagglutinin protein via redox-sensitive pathways [ [355](#B355-nutrients-12-01562)]. Though human RCTs, to our knowledge do not exist, an intervention trial in mice receiving a polyphenol extract from Cistus Incanus resulted in a lower influenza virus infection rate and reduced mortality of mice receiving the extract [ [99](#B99-nutrients-12-01562)]. [356](#B356-nutrients-12-01562)]. The same study included a meta-analysis of data from all RCTs to study the impact of curcuminoid administration on CRP. Overall, curcuminoids vs. placebo reduced circulating CRP concentrations by about 2.2 mg/L. 3.3.2. Carotenoids [357](#B357-nutrients-12-01562)]. Low levels of - and -carotene, lutein/zeaxanthin, as well as total carotenoids have been significantly associated with increased levels of oxidative stress, as recently reviewed [ [358](#B358-nutrients-12-01562)], and also of inflammation [ [359](#B359-nutrients-12-01562)]. For instance, low levels of - and -carotene, lutein/zeaxanthin, and total carotenoids were significantly more likely to be associated with increased IL-6 levels in women [ [359](#B359-nutrients-12-01562)]. Another randomized, cross-over study determined the effect of orange and blackcurrant juice (high carotenoid content) supplementation in patients with peripheral arterial disease for four weeks; supplementation resulted in reduced inflammation markers, i.e., CRP and fibrinogen in plasma, while no significant differences regarding IL-6 and endothelial markers compared to placebo group were found [ [360](#B360-nutrients-12-01562)]. Carotenoids such as lutein, zeaxanthin, and carotene plasma concentrations have also received attention for their potential antiviral roles [ [361](#B361-nutrients-12-01562)]. A higher risk of mortality has been associated with low concentrations of plasma carotenoids in patients having contracted an HIV infection [ [100](#B100-nutrients-12-01562)]. Carotenoids may also impact immune function by regulating membrane fluidity and gap-junction communication [ [362](#B362-nutrients-12-01562)]. Finally, some carotenoids serve as precursors for vitamin A and may thereby exert immune-modulating functions attributed directly to vitamin A status. [363](#B363-nutrients-12-01562)]. However, cause and consequence could not be established in this study. In line with this finding are results from a meta-analysis in which one study highlighted that in elderly subjects, higher lutein/zeaxanthin levels were associated with 23% lower respiratory mortality [ [364](#B364-nutrients-12-01562)]. Care should be taken as supplementation of higher doses of -carotene (20-30 mg/d for several years) has caused increased cancer rates, though specifically in smokers and asbestos-exposed workers [ [365](#B365-nutrients-12-01562)]. 4. Summary and Future Directions [Figure 1](#nutrients-12-01562-f001)shows a schematic diagram illustrating interactions between selected dietary constituents, the immune system, and viral infection. Evidence indicates that a diet that positively impacts immune function contains adequate amounts of protein, particularly including glutamine, arginine and branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs); high omega-3 versus lower saturated, trans fat, and omega-6 fatty acids, low refined sugars, high fiber content such as whole grains, and micronutrients including vitamin A, vitamin D, vitamin C, vitamin E, B vitamins, zinc, selenium and iron, as well as phytochemicals. [Table 2](#nutrients-12-01562-t002)shows examples of dietary sources. However, as shown well for dietary fiber, an excessive anti-inflammatory response may also reduce the immune response and increase susceptibility to infection. Controversial effects were also found for vitamin A, while carotenoid supplementation may only be detrimental for smokers and asbestos-exposed workers. Selenium supplementation should be considered with care due to the small therapeutic window and possible side-effects, especially in subjects with diabetes. While anti-inflammatory dietary constituents may be beneficial during hyper-inflammation, such as the COVID-19 cytokine storm, care should be taken against high doses of isolated anti-inflammatory compounds and/or antioxidants during healthier conditions in order to not suppress inflammation and the immune system too strongly. [366](#B366-nutrients-12-01562)]. Such an approach may also reveal yet unnoticed relations between nutrients, their metabolites, inflammation, oxidative stress, and the immune system. Furthermore, confounding factors such as medication and environmental pollutants could be also taken into account.

[81](#B81-nutrients-12-01562)] Decreased pro-inflammatory response to IAV in LF for IL-6, IFN-, IFN-, and IP-10 (p < 0.05). Antiviral response in the heart was reduced in HF mice after IAV infection, where higher viral loads were detected in the hearts of HF vs. LF mice (p < 0.05). Correlation between IAV-infected HF mice and viral infection in the heart, left ventricular mass, and thickening of the left ventricular wall, characterized by increased HIF-1 compared to LF group (p < 0.05). [82](#B82-nutrients-12-01562)] Influenza vaccination was conducted after 10 weeks. Vaccination-induced antibody production was decreased in animals receiving HFD vs. RFD (p < 0.001) [83](#B83-nutrients-12-01562)] KD resulted in an expansion of T-cells (p < 0.001), compared with the HFD group. KD-fed mice had better blood O2 saturation (p < 0.001). KD diet was significantly related to improved antiviral resistance (p < 0.001). [84](#B84-nutrients-12-01562)] Per 10 g/d increase in dietary fiber, the multivariate RRs for infectious and respiratory diseases were 0.66 (CI: in After 7 d, HFD-fed mice with high-dose infection had better lung function as shown by reduced pulmonary resistance (p > 0.01) and enhanced compliance in response to methacholine (p > 0.01). In HFD-fed mice, the excessive neutrophil influx into the airways was inhibited by blunted levels of CXCL1, produced by lung monocytes and macrophages (p < 0.001) vs. controls. Increased antiviral immunity by dietary fiber through CD8+ T cell activation (p < 0.01) vs. controls. (HFD)-fed mice showed enhanced adaptive immunity by changed CD8+ T cell metabolism (p < trials (n = 5500) in children (3 months-18 y of age). [94](#B94-nutrients-12-01562)] HIV infected participants (n = 180 men, 134 women; 18-60 y).
