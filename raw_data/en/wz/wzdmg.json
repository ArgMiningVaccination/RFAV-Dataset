Their intellectual growth is only one part of our mission . We must consider how we support students' personal an d social development as they establish their academic and professional identities . Developing students' academic skills is only one of our tasks ; creating a welcoming community that supports students through the normative developmental task of young adulth ood is an essential task as well . This includes building resilience , coping skills, and promoting safe and healthy relationships . Across the country, colleges and universities are witness ing a sharp increase in the number of students seeking mental healt h resources . Leading professional organizations such as the American Psychiatric Association and the American Psychological Association have documented the increasing rates at which college students are making use of mental health serv ices. We can identify a number of factors that may be shaping these trends . Earlier intervention and advances in treatment provide unprecedented opportunities for students with mental health diagnoses to excel in high school and attend college . At the same time, the late teens and early 20s remain the critical age of onset for many mental health disorders . In addition, as stigma decreases, more students fortunately feel able to seek the help they need and approach the utilization of mental health care as normative and a sign of good health and self -care behavior . In line with national trends, at Tufts University we have seen a notable increase in the number of students with significant, ongoing mental health needs . At the undergraduate level, we have seen significant increases in hospitalizations related to mental health . And during the past two years, the Counseling and Mental Health Service (CMHS) serving undergraduate and graduate/professional students on the Medford/Somerville and Boston SMFA campuses has seen a significant increase in severe distress . CMHS has also seen high utilization and an increase in the overall demand for services . Between fall 2015 and fall 2018 , the number of new student intake sessions increased by 60% . More than one-quarter of the students on the Medford/Somerville and Boston SMFA campuses use CMHS services each year, and another eight to 10% utilize local community -based mental health providers. Many students report that their academics at times are impaired by mental health issues . Of some 850 students in the School of Arts and Sciences and the School of Engineering who are registered for academic accommodations, more than 300 seek accommodations for reasons related to mental health . Anxiety and depression ar e the top concerns at Tufts and elsew here in higher education. All colleges and universities are grappling with these challenges . When considering strategies to strengthen student mental health across Tufts, we must keep in mind our own institutional landscape . For our relatively small size we are an unusually complex university, supporting a wide variety of student populations and offering a diverse array of academic programs . Our students study on four Massachusetts campuses; many undertake study and research abroad; and many of them also t rain at remote clinical sites. Traditionally, the individual schools have been responsible for providing student services on our different campuses . The availability of clinical services to support mental health is thus shaped by individual school and cam pus histories . But it became clear two years ago that evolving trends in student mental health needs and treatments , changing student and family 4 expectations, and a complex regulatory landscape necessitated a comprehensive , in-depth assessment at a univers ity-wide level. The university -wide Task Force on Student Mental Health was launched in December 2016 with a charge to examine the state of student mental health on campus; assess mental health services and related resources; review policies and practices ; and develop actionable recommendations with respect to education, outreach , and mental health promotion; services and resources; and policies and practices . The members of the Task Force included faculty, staff , and students from across the university. We are grateful for their engaged participation in a process that aimed to integrate community input, data -gathering, and informed analysis . Thanks to members of the Task Force, academic and administrative leaders across the university, implementation is already in progress for many of the recommendations introduced in this report . On the Medford/Somerville campus , we have long offered expert on-site clinical services t o support student mental health . We are fortunate that our students benefit from the ded ication of outstanding clinical professionals who have a commitment to both the campus community and the highest standards of care . Today, the key challenge is how to respond to an escalating demand for services and the increasing level of acuity . As a res ult, the Task Force took a deep dive into staffing levels and care models, case management and referral processes, and communications. We need to reimagine and invest meaningfully in comprehensive mental health outreach and wellness education across the T ufts student experience . We must remove barriers to accessing treatment, deepen relationships and referral network s with local community providers, and enhance communications to students and families . We have already significantly reduced co - pays for stude nts on the university offered health insurance plan who see off -campus mental health clinicians , are piloting new evening hours on-site at CMHS, and are promoting new telehealth options. At the same time we need to make sure that the sense of community whi ch can enhance engagement, growth and normative development is being supported across our varied educational settings. Not all struggles or challenges require clinical attention, and it is unlikely that simply growing our complement of providers can respon d to all our students' needs. Historically, the university had not provided on-site counseling services on the health sciences campuses . Starting in the fall of 2016, Cummings School of Veterinary Medicine on the Grafton campus began partnering with an ex ternal provider to establish on-site counseling services . The student community responded positively to the introduction of those resources, and util ization is currently at about 21 % of the student population. We identified this as a promising potential model to meet some student needs on the Boston health sciences campus as well . There, students have already benefited from robust health promotion efforts, and the dental and medical schools have incorporated stress reduction, mindfulness , and well-being into the curriculum . Now, as a result of the Task Force review, th e schools on that campus have launched an on-site counseling service similar to the model offered in Grafton. Graduate students on the Medford/Somerville and Boston SMFA campuses have access to clinical services through CMHS . But the Task Force has identified opportunities to strengthen non-clinical resources for graduate students in areas such as student affairs and academic support. 5 At the undergraduate level, the Task Force paid significa nt attention to strengthening academic policies and practices to allow for earlier identification and intervention to support students . Much progress has already been made implementing these recommendations thanks to support from the relevant faculty commi ttees and administrative colleagues . Medical leave processes have been streamlined to empower students to take the time necessary to tend to medical needs in a m ore fluid and supportive way. A more structured personal leave process will provide more opport unities to connect students with resources and advising . Across the university, we recognize the need to enhance training opportunities for faculty and staff, and to develop cohesive communications and outreach strategies . Knowing that alumni, parents, a nd friends share our commitment to Tufts' students, there may be opportunities for philanthropic support to advance initiatives in mental and behavioral health across the university. While the Task Force recognizes that issues of alcohol and substance a buse are often closely related to student mental health concerns, in the interest of a more focused approach , the Task Force did not address these issues specifically . The Task Force is pleased to see initiatives led by our health and student affairs teams across the university to address these challenge s. In the fall of 2019, thanks to generous donor funding, we have welcome d The Haven at College to provide support to students in substance abuse recovery. The Haven at College has an outpatient center at 20 0 Boston Avenue and provides substance abuse assessments and treatment, along with a residential house on campus . We are proud to become the first campus in New England to provide access to The Haven's services , allowing students to continue their studies while being supported in their recovery. Looking ahead, we will establish a standing university -wide Steering Committee on Student Mental Health to oversee implementation of these recommendations and maintain our focus on this complex issue . We are exc ited by the opportunity to make Tufts a leader in supporting student mental health and well-being . The success of our efforts to date was recognized in November 2018, when the university was awarded a scholarship from the HBC Foundation to enter into a fou r-year partnership as a JED Campus . JED Campus is a nationwide initiative of the Jed Foundation designed to help schools through a collaborative process of comprehensive systems, program and policy development to build on existing student mental health, su bstance abuse and suicide prevention efforts . This program will allow for deeper engagement on the Medford/Somerville and Boston SMFA campuses to implement strategic changes and promote student mental health and well -being . The report that follows explor es these and many other issues in much greater detail, outlining the working process employed by the Task Force , its specific findings and recommendations and implementation already underway . The appendices include a summary of recommendations as well as a dditional background information on the Task Force and the institutional context . We hope that this report will encourage students, faculty, staff, parents, alumni , and friends to continue to work with us as we address this challenge of great importance to our entire university community. 6 Task Force Organization, Working Group Process, and Data Task Force Organization In the fall of 2016, President Anthony P. Monaco launched the Mental Health Task Force . The Task Force reviewed expert opinion in the co ntext of national and Tufts -specific trends in student mental health and its promotion and care, analyzed quantitative and qualitative data with respect to our students' experience s, and engaged members of the Tufts community and appropriate outside expert s to fulfill its charge . (See Appendix A: Purpose and Charge for the objectives of the Task Force.) This report reflects the collaborative efforts of the Mental Health Task Force, the Task Force's working groups , and many members of the Tufts community , including students . Partners across the university have already begun efforts to implement many of the recommendations included in this report . Early implementation efforts are also briefly described in the sections below where applicable . (See Appendix B : Mental Health Task Force Timeline for a detailed outline of the Task Force's efforts. ) The Tas k Force was co-chaired by President Monaco and Dr. Paul Su mmergrad , who serves as the Dr. Frances S. Arkin Professor and Chairman of the Department of Ps ychiatry at Tufts University School of Medicine, the Psychiatrist -in-Chief at Tufts Medical Center, and is a past President of the American Psychiatric Association . The full Task Force was complemented by an Undergraduate Working Group (UWG) focus ed on undergraduate students , a Graduate and Professional Working Group (GPWG) focused on graduate and professional students across the university , and a Models of Care (MoC) task group focus ed on clinical services available on the Medford/Somerville and Boston SMFA campus es. The working groups allow ed a broader range of stakeholders to participate in the work of Task Force . (See Appendix C : Mental Health Task Force and Working Group Members and Collaborators for a full list of students, faculty , and staff invol ved in the Task Force's efforts. ) The UWG was co-chaired by Dr. Jennifer Stephan, dean of academic advising and undergraduate studies at the School of Engineering , and Raymond Ou, former senior associate dean of student affairs for the School of Arts and Sciences and the School of Engineering . The GPWG was chaired by John Matias, associate dean of admissions and enrollment at the School of Medicine . The MoC task group was chaired by Mary Pat McMahon, former dean of student affairs for the School of Art s and Sciences and the School of Engineering . 7 Figure 1. Organization and Leadership of the Mental Health Task Force Our Medford/Somerville and Boston SMFA campuses are home to undergraduate and graduate programs in the School of Arts and Sciences (including the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences and School of the Museum of Fine Arts at Tufts University ), the School of Engineering and its graduate program , and graduate programs at The Fletcher School . Our graduate and professional program s in the health sciences take place in the School of Dental Medicine (TUSDM), School of Medicine (TUSM) , Sackler School of Graduate Biomedical Sciences, and Friedman School of Nutrition Science and Policy on the Boston health sciences campus and at the Cum mings School of Veterinary Medicine in Grafton . Working Group Process Undergraduate Working Group The UWG was established in spring 2017; working group members included students, faculty , and staff at the School of Arts and Sciences and the School of Engineering (AS&E) . (See Appendix C for a complete list of all three working group members. ) In the spring of 2017 , the UWG focused its efforts on student engagement and outreach . The primary goals of student outreach were to introduce the Mental Health Ta sk Force to the student population, explain the purpose and charge of the Task Force, and obtain qualitative data on the student mental health issues, needs , and priorities at Tufts . (See Appendix D : Undergraduate Working Group Outreach for a list of liste ning sess ions and outreach activities.) A thematic summary was compiled of recurring themes and concerns generated from student engagement . The themes reflect the concerns, needs, and recommendations that students expressed with regard to their person al mental health as well as that of the broader campus. The themes went beyond clinical services to include topics such as relationships with faculty, residential life experience , family pressures, and campus community . University policies and practices su ch as leave of absence policies, return from hospitalization policies, financial aid , and accommodations generated passionate feedback from students during these sessions . Major themes include d: access to clinical services, academic environment, student li fe, non -clinical support and resources, policies and practices, and education, outreach , and prevention (Figure 2). These themes are described in greater detail in the findings and recommendations of this report.

Major Themes from Student Eng agement Given the strong student interest in policies and practices evident in the listening sessions , during the summer and fall of 2017, the group conducted an in -depth review of AS&E administrative and academic policies and practices that intersect with student mental health . In additional to reviewing policies at Tufts and peer institutions, the group also consulted with relevant departments and administrative leaders to better understand intersecting considerations such as financial aid, academic accommodations , and unique issues for international students . In the fall of 2017 , the UWG developed 16 draft policy recommendations . The c o-chairs of the UWG presented the findings and objectives of its policy recommendations to the full Task Force in October 20 17. In December 2017 , the Task Force accepted the UWG's recommendations and agreed to engage relevant university stakeholders working toward advancing the recommendations . The UWG co-chairs engaged AS&E faculty and staff on draft policy recomme ndations through pre sentations and discussions at a series of meetings with faculty and academic leaders in spring 2018 . (See Appendix D for a full list of UWG's outreach to faculty and staff.) Efforts to advance and refine draft recommendations, exploration with stakeholders of solutions to challenges iden tified, and early implementation of recommendations are ongoing as detailed the sections on findings and recommendations . Graduate and Professional Working Group The GPWG was established in the s pring of 2017 ; the w orking group comprised members from seven schools and across three campuses . (See Appendix C .) Initially , the GPWG conducted an inventory on the resources and services available to graduate and professional students at all eight schools spread across four campuses . Recognizing the lack of uniform data collection across all the schools on student mental health and well -being, the GPWG explored survey options to collect benchmarking data . During the 2017 -18 academic year, the GPWG focuse d on three activities : data collection, community engagement, and policy review . In November 2017, the Health y Minds Survey was Student Mental Health at TuftsAcademic Environment Access to Clinical Services Education, Outreach & Prevention Student LifePolicies & Practices Non -Clinical Support & Resources9 administered to students on the health sciences campuses to collect baseline data equivalent to what was already available from surveys on the Medford/Somerville campus . Working group members and staff supporting the GPWG hosted 15 listening session for students in Boston, Grafton, and Medford/Somerville . The themes and recurring concerns from the listening sessions served as qualitative data to inform and support the recommenda tions of the GPWG . Although some of the challenges differed for the graduate and professional student population , with the exception of Policies and Practices , all of the major themes from listening sessions with undergraduate students (see Figure 2) generated significant feedback from graduate and professional students as well . These themes are described in greater detail in the findings and recommendations of this report. In the spring and summer of 2018, the GPWG divided into two smaller groups to dive deeper into the resources and needs for campus specific communities , one group focused on the Medford/Somerville and Boston SMFA campuses and the other focused on the health science s campuses. The GPWG engaged the student affairs leaders on the health science s campuses in a series of meeting s focused on studen t needs, on -campus resources, barriers to access ing clinical resources , and options for establishing some clinical services on the Boston health sc iences campus . In early autumn 2018 , the GPWG received and reviewed results from the Healthy Minds Survey and drafted and refined its recommendations . Models of Care Task Group During the summer of 2017, the Task Force established the Models of Care (Mo C) task group . The purpose of the MoC task group was to investigate alternative models of care to meet the increasing volume and complexity of mental health care needs of students o n the Med ford/S omerville and Boston SMFA campuses by paying particular atte ntion to clinical services and researching best practice s /national exemplars . Members of the MoC task group included faculty and staff engaged in roles that support student mental health or with clinical expertise . The MoC task g roup held four formal retreats and several focused small group meetings during the 2017 -2018 academic year . During the retreats, the MoC task group explored topics ranging from n ational trends in college student mental health, best practices at peer inst itutions, utilization tren ds at Counseling and Mental Health Services (CMHS) and other campus resources, the scope of care at CMHS, off -campus referral practices, health insurance , communications and outreach strategies, and telehealth innovations . In the spring of 2018, the MoC task group developed draft recommendations , began engaging leadership in the School of Arts and Sciences and the School of Engineering on the feasibility expanding certain resources to support their recommendations, and began vetting vendors to enhance ref erral capabilities . At the same time, CMHS promoted telehealth options available through BetterHelp and iHope . Effo rts to refine draft recommendations, explore solutions to challenges identified with stakeholders , and early implementation of recommendation s continued through the summer and fall of 2018 . Data Sources and E vidence To support the Task Force and its working groups' findings, deliberations, and recommendations, members relie d on the following quantitative data sources on Tufts students : Healt hy Minds Survey American College Health Association \u2014National College Health Assessment 10 Insurance u tilization data from UnitedHealth Utilization data from on-campus services and resources including: CMHS, Health Services, Student Accessibility Services, De ans of Students, Tufts University Police Department, Ears for Peers, AllOne Health, Student Advisory and Health Administration, and Student Wellness Advising On the Medford/Somerville campus, Health and Wellness Services and CMHS have collected data on st udent health and well-being for more t han a decade through the Healthy Minds Survey and the American College Health Association \u2014National College Health Assessment . One unique challenge identified early in the Task Force's work by the GPWG was the lack of u niform university -wide data collection on student health and well-being for graduate and professional student population s. Under the auspices of the Task Force , the Healthy Minds Survey was administered on the Boston and Grafton campuses in the fall of 201 7. The Healthy Minds Survey was also administered as regularly scheduled on the Medford/Somerville and Boston SMFA campuses in spring 2018 ; this was the first time the Healthy Minds Survey has been administered since the SMFA became part of the School of A rts and Science s. Other data sources informing the wo rk of the Task Force included : Thematic summaries of listening sessions with students Written comments submitted via e -mail and online by members of the Tufts community Consultations with peer institut ions and professional associations such as EAB, New England College Health Association, and the Association for University and College Counseling Center Directors In-depth literature review of college mental health trends and service delivery modalitie s and evidence -based intervention strategies The major findings and recommendations presented here outline a multifaceted strategy to supporting student mental health . The findings and recommendations are organized thematically in line with the Task Force cha rge. (For a summary of Task Force recommendations, see Appendix E.) 11 Findings and Recommendations : Education, Outreach , and Mental Health Promotion Student Life Experience Establishing a cohesive and welcoming community at Tufts is a priority , as periods of transition during a student's academic career are sometimes challenging and may take a toll on student mental health and emotional well-being . There are two key time periods that undergraduate students described as being particularl y challenging: the first-year experience and returning to campus following time away for study abroad or a leave of absence . For graduate and professional students, period s of transition of note include returning to an academic setting after taking time of f between undergraduate and graduate/professional studies and , for professional students , shifting from the pre-clinical to the clinical phase of their training . The transition to college life is challenging for many first -year and trans fer students. S tudents arrive on campus with a wide range of academic and social skills, experiences , and expectations. For many first -year students, the transition to campus life comes with independence and new responsibilities like managing personal finances, health , and well-being and prioritizing academic and social obligations . Some students have not yet developed help -seeking behaviors and time -management and stress management skills to cope with the stressors of a rigorous academic environment and campus life . Unde rgraduate students who did not participate in Pre - Orientation programs expressed difficulty transitioning to campus life and described feeling left behind and disconnected from peers who established friend groups during Pre -Orientation . Many graduate an d professional students relocate to study at Tufts , leaving behind established support networks . Among undergraduate and graduate/professional students alike, some students with pre - existing mental health conditions stop taking their medication when they arrive on campus . Discontinuing medication without supervision can make adjusting to campus life more difficult and may have unintended consequences on a student's health and well-being , academics , and ability to make social connections , including clinica l relapse . During the listening sessions, undergraduate students identified intersecting themes between student life , campus climate , and student mental health and well -being . Many of the themes raised here are being addressed through implementation of the recommendations of the Stud ent Life Review Commit tee and the ongoing work of the Dean of Student Affairs Office and the chief diversity officers. While acknowledging that events sponsored by the Office of Campus Life are substance -free, students shared frustration that so many other social events on campus often seem to revolve around and promote the use of alcohol . Some students raised concern that their peers may use alcohol and marijuana to cope with stress and numb m ental health concerns . Micro -aggre ssions experienced in the classroom and on campus are emotionally taxing on students of diverse backgrounds. Students involved in social justice advocacy experience \"burn -out.\" The polarized political climate is anxiety producing for some students and crea tes tension when students are still developing the skills to engage across differences . Breaks throughout the academic calendar year are especially isolating for international students when there are fewer peers on campus . In research -based setting s, some female graduate students voiced concerns of feelings isolation and frustration with a lack of professionalism in male -dominated labs . Doctoral students 12 expressed fear of retaliation from faculty supervisors if they raise d concerns about climate or harassme nt. RECOMMENDATION: The Task Force supports the recommendations of the Student Life Review Committee and continued implementation of changes to undergraduate orientation and residential life aimed at enhancing community and the first -year experience . Implementation Progress: During the time the Task Force has been at work, the School of Arts and Sciences and the School of Engineering have made significant progress implementing the recommendations of th e Student Life Review Committee \u2014deepening orientat ion programming for incoming undergraduates, developing a more intentional and cohesive residential experience, developing new social spaces, and further strengthening programs to support meaningful inclusion for all students, including those from historic ally underrepresented, first -generation and low -income cohorts . RECOMMENDATION: Explore the possibility of developing a 100 -level course for first - year undergraduate students around mental healt h and well -being . Many other colleges and universities are piloting different models of for -credit first year courses to cultivate healthy relationships, self -care, and resiliency, and foster emotional intelligence . Happiness 1011 and THRIVE: Foundations of Well -being2 have proven to be immensely popular and impac tful among students at Yale and the University of Southern California, respectively . Pennsylvania State University, the University of Virginia, and the U niversity of Wisconsin -Madison have come together for the Student Flourishing Initiative, collaborating as part of an initial pilot program for first -year students. Approximately 40% of Tufts undergraduates choose to study abroad for a semester or year, in destinations around the globe. Additionally, many graduate and professional students engage in study and/or research at international sites during their time at Tufts. Many students find study abroad to be a transformative experience; however, study aboard experiences may compound underlying emotional or mental health challenges for some students , and sometimes students are exposed to new trauma while abroad . It can be difficult to find a mental health provider while studying abroad . Cultural norms and attitudes toward mental health, and navigating health care in a foreign country , may prevent students from accessing the care they need . Some students find it difficult to adjust back to campus life after being away following a study abroad experience. Tufts Global Education (formerly Tufts Program Abroad Office) includes mental health, self -care, and well ness as a central component to their pre -departure, in -country orientation, in -country support se rvices, and return programing. RECOMMENDATION: The Task Force encourages continued attention to mental health issues faced by students undertaking study and research abroad. Academic Environment Throughout the Task Force's efforts , students, faculty , and staff all expressed concern about a campus culture where stress is normalized . Students described a campus culture that glorifies 1 Moore, Angela. \" Happiness 101: Psychology course strikes chord with Yale students .\" Health N ews. March 18, 2018. REUTERS. Web.

Students who participated in mindfulness programming through the Chaplaincy or Health Services and time management programming through the Academic Resource Center (ARC ) described positive outcomes with respect to stress management. Sources of stres s described by graduate an d professional students include academic performance, competition, transitioning to a new city, personal finances, career prospects, work -life balance, time management, and family responsibilities . Although time management and str ess manageme nt were among the top concerns cited by Fletcher students, t he Graduate and Professional Working Group found that Fletcher students do not have access to time management programming offered through the ARC . Programs at Tufts are academicall y demanding; academic stress often precipitates student mental health concerns . Academic performance and student m ental health are intertwined . Seventy percent of students on the Medford/Somerville and Boston SMFA campuses and 65% of students on t he health sciences campuses indicated that emotional or mental difficulties have hurt their academic performance.3 Until recently , there has been much less literature about graduate and professional student mental health than about undergraduate issues . High stak es associated with the schedule of board and qualifying exams can make it difficult for students to take time off necessary to tend to personal and health needs . Nationwide, professional degree programs are increasingly incorporating mental health and well-being programing into the curriculum and view ing it as essential to students' professional development. Recognizing the intersection between student mental health and the academic environment, in recent years TUSM, TUSDM , and Cummings School have made cur ricular changes to reduce stress while maintaining the integrity of the academic rigor of their programs . The experience of PhD students is unique since they wear different hats over the course of their academic program \u2014student, teaching assist ant, resea rch assistant, etc . Especially in STEM fields, the PhD experience is highly competitive . The academic environment is demanding and perpetuates bad habits, glorifying long hours and normalizing stress . Doctoral students described mixed experience s with prim ary investigators . The relationship with a principal investigator (PI) or advisor affects not only the quality of training, but also students' career outlook and emotional well-being . Positive mentor relationships are critical to student success.4 The T ask Force found that there is no formal training university -wide required for faculty and staff on supporting student mental health . Across the university , faculty and staff expressed an interest in deepening their understanding of student mental health an d knowledge of how to appropriately support students and make referrals. RECOMMENDATION: Taking a community health approach, the Task Force encourages the schools and academic departments to consider ways to reduce stress, support student development , and promote healthier behaviors . Strategies may include: Avoiding scheduling of course work during designated \"open blocks. \" Enhancing communication and coordination of high -stake deadlines of assignments and exams within departments to reduce stress when fea sible. 3 Healthy Minds Survey, 2017 - 2018. 4 Tsia, J. & Muidi, F. \"Towards sustaining a culture of mental health and wellness for trainees in the biosciences,\" Nature Biotechnology . Vol. 34, November 3, 2016. 14 Participat ing in social -emotional learning training and curriculum development offered through Tisch College and CELT. RECOMMENDATION: To cultivate a supportive and informed university community, the Task Force recommends that schools enhance trai ning opportunities for faculty and staff to deepen their knowledge about student mental health . Strategies may include: Adopting evidence -based online training tools. Expanding gatekeeper training opportunities. Enhancing professional development training for PIs on managing research settings and mentorship. Improving online resources for faculty and staff to ensure easy access, consistency , and accurate information on campus resources, policies , and practices to support students with mental health concern s. Implementation Progress: Health and Wellness Service is working with university leaders to identify and implement a pilot of an online training tool for faculty and staff to deepen their knowledge of student mental health and campus resources. RECOMMENDATION: Recognizing stress management and time management as among the top concerns by Fletcher students, the Task Force recommends the exploration of the feasibility of extending services at the AR C to include Fletcher students. Mental Health A wareness and Stigma Reduction University -Wide Healthy Minds data suggests that stigma surrounding mental health treatment is lower at Tufts than the national average.5 However, concerns about stigma and confidentiality were prevalent topics of discussio n during listening sessions and identified as a barrier to help seeking . Students of color and international students raised heightened concerns about stigma within their communities . Student groups such as Ears for Peers and Active Minds on the Medford/So merville and Boston SMFA campuses , and Cummings Thrive on the Grafton campus play a vital role in stigma reduction an d mental health awareness . Recent research suggests that student -run mental health promotion and education efforts have a positive impact on the mental health climate on college campuses.6 RECOMMENDATION: The Task Force recommends that the university strengthen partnerships with student leaders on mental health awareness campaigns, outreach , and wellness activities. Pro vide and pro mote gatekeeper training op portunities to student leaders across the university . Graduate and professional students expressed significant concerns about stigma and confidentiality throughout the listening sessions and in response to open -ended questions included in the Healthy Minds survey . The most common concerns raised included: Difficulty requesting time off from supervisors to attend appointments during the day 5 Healthy Minds Su rvey, 2017 -2018. 6 Strengthening College Students' Mental Health Knowledge, Awareness, and Helping Behaviors: The Impact of Active Minds, a Peer Mental Health Organization, J Am Acad Child Adolesc Psychiatry 2018; 57(7):500 -507. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaac.2018.03.019 15 Apprehensions that revealing mental health or emotional well -being challenges to advisors or supe rvisors might have a negative impact on professiona l or academic opportunities Concerns about how mental health treatment might impact an individual's eligibility for a federal security clearance or professional licensure RECOMMENDATION: The Task For ce recommends the schools develop consistent stigma reduction programming with an emphasis on graduate and professional students to reduce barriers to help -seeking and promote mental health as a life skill necessary to succeed in their prospective fields . Topics for special attention include confidentiality, providing reliable and current information regarding mental health concerns related to professional licensing and the security clearance process. Boston Health Sciences Campus Student Wellness Advisi ng and Health Promotions is the primary source of me ntal health promotion efforts on the Boston health science s campus. Student Wellness Advising and Health Promotions is staff ed by one full -time wellness advisor responsible for all of the health promotion , wellness programing, advising , and referral support for students across the Boston health science s campus . RECOMMENDATION: To bolster and better support the health promotions programming and wellness advising offered through Student Wellness Advising a nd Health Promotions, the Graduate and Professional Working Group recommends increasing administrative support through a designated administrator or coordinator. Grafton Cam pus Seminars with a focus on mental health promotion are offered throughout the academic year by All One Health, the on -site mental health provider for veterinary students . In addition, as of spring 2018, a part -time donor -funded wellness advisor is provid ing wellness and health promotion programing tailored for the needs of veterinar y students on the Grafton campus . RECOMMENDATION: Following the pilot yea r of programming offered by the wellness advisor at Cummings School, the Task Force recommends that the school evaluate the effectiveness of the programing in the context of a long -term health promotion strategy for veterinary students. Implementation Progress: The Cummings leadership is developing a strategy to fund the wellness advisor role moving forward . Medford/Somerville and Boston SMFA Campuses Health and wellness promot ion efforts on the Medford/Somerville and Boston SMFA campuses are shared across several campus partners . The Models of Care task group found that there is not currently a dedicate d position focused solely on mental health outreach and education . CMHS's cu rrent structure has a model of shared responsibility for on -campus mental health outreach and training. Most clinicians participate in a robust liaison program with key departments, both academic and cocurricular. A smaller team of clinicians share respons ibility for routinely conducting campus gatekeeper trainings with student leaders, faculty, coaches, 16 teaching assistants and research assistants, department chairs, and other faculty and staff . Because of the high dem and for clinical services, clinical sta ff must prioritize treatment over programming . RECOMMENDATION: Hire a dedicated mental health outreach and education specialist for the Medford/Somerville and Boston SMFA campuses . This position would help streamline and facilitate mental health outrea ch and training while also realigning competing dem ands on clinical staff at CMHS. Communications and Outreach The Task Force found that outreach and communications efforts across the university are localized and mostly ta ke place at the school level . Eighty -nine percent of students on the Grafton campus, 77% of students on the Boston h ealth science s campus and 85% of students on the Medford/Somerville and Boston SMFA campus es indicated that they kne w where to seek professional health for mental or emoti onal health concerns.7 In listening sessions , AS&E undergraduate and graduate students report ed some degree of confusion around CMHS's short -term treatment model, as well as concerns about finding ongoing and/or longer -term clinician support off campus . Listen ing sessions illustrated uncertainty among graduate students on the Medford/Somerville campus related to which resources on campus are specific to particular student population s, whether school -specific or campus -wide . During listening sessions, stud ents conveyed frustration with difficulty navigating related Tufts websites and pages to find the information they were looking for related to mental health services and support. RECOMMENDATION: Expand communications efforts to ensure that new and returni ng Tufts students have consistent and accurate information and awareness of resources available through the university . Strategies may include: Collaboration among schools on each campus to develop cohesive and consistent communication strategies to impro ve knowledge of the scope of resources available and improve access to online information and tools. Include parents and families of undergraduate students in the distribution of information about mental health, and provide consistent outreach. Improve he alth and wellness related websites to more clearly outline support structures in and beyond CMHS; improve search function and present more comprehensive information online about services and resources available to support students . Implementation Progres s: Since the summer of 2018, schools have been collaborat ing to improve communications strategies . Examples include: DOSA has proactively included content around mental health resources and related topics in its monthly Parent Newsletter . DOSA and CMHS added Facebook Live session s for incoming students and families, in addition to longstanding programing on student me ntal health during orientation and Parents and Famil y Weeken d. 7 Healthy Minds Survey, 2017 -2018 17 Findings and Recommendations: Services and Resources University -Wide At Tufts, resources and services to support student mental health, well-being , and personal development are primari ly offered at the school level . (See Appendix F : Overview of Current Services and Resources for a description of the wide -range of services and resources available across the university that intersect with and support student mental health and well-being .) Although there are some services available at the university -wide or cam pus-wide level, currently there is not a university -wide approach to supporting student mental health and related resources . RECOMMENDATION: Recognizing student mental health and well-being as a university - wide priority, the Task Force recommends further exploration of the potential to develop an Integrated Wellness Ou treach Center to promote holistic student health, mindfulness, nutrition , and well-being across the university . Such an initiative could support a fundamental transformation of mental health and wellness promotion at Tufts . Within the School of Arts an d Sciences and the School of Engineering, and at Cummings School, donors have shared an interest in s upporting innovative programs t o advance student mental health and wellness . The Task Force is encouraged by these developments and hopes that additional p rivate funding can be secured to support this work going forward . RECOMMENDATION: Engage University Advancement to explore opportunities for philanthropic support to advance initiatives in mental and behavioral health and wellness. Across the universit y, our students have demanding and challenging schedules . Lack of time is the top reason students don't access mental health care . Research has shown promising outcomes for online therapeutic services for individuals presenting with a wide variety of menta l health issues, including anxiety, stress, and depression, which are the most common presenting issues in college mental health.8 Since the fall of 2017, students on the health insurance plans offered by the university have been able to access BetterHel p, an online counseling platform, without charge . RECOMMENDATION: Recognizing the demanding schedules of students across the university and challenges finding local community providers, the Task Force supports the further adoption of evidence -based te lehealth resources where feasible . Telehealth resources have the potential to expand access to care for students in remote clinical locations, studying abroad, on break, or unable to find a community provide r that meets their scheduling needs. As with any new treatment modality, implementation should be accompanied by ongoing monitoring for efficacy. Implementation Progress: In addition to BetterHelp, which is available for free to students on the Tufts' Student Health Insurance plan, beginning in the fall of 2018 CMHS began promoting telehealth resources available through iHope . The iHope counseling service is accepted by most major insurance plans, including Tufts' Student Health Insurance plan. iHope bills students for a copay 8 See telehealth.org/blog/telemedicine -peter -yellowlees -md; Annual Rev iew of Clinical Psychology, Vol. 12, 2016. See also www.apa.org/monitor/2017/11/trends -technology.aspx 18 according to their insuranc e plan . CMHS has developed a webpage with FAQs and other helpful information on telehealth . Boston Health Sciences Campus There is no on -site health service on the Boston health sciences campus . Students enrolled in Schools on the Boston health science s campus must seek mental health care and primary health care through local community providers . Although the Boston health sciences campus is located adjacent to Tufts Medical Center - the principal teaching hospital for Tufts University School of Medicin e - and many Tufts graduate and professional student s access care there. They can still experience barriers accessing mental health care in the local community . In particular, due to LCME accreditation requirements, medical students may not receive treatm ent from medical providers affiliated with TUSM who may be involved with their academic evaluations . More than half of the students studying on the Boston health sciences campus come from outside of Massachusetts, and many are international students.9 Many graduate and professional students do not have a local primary care physician . Some students with out -of- state health insurance policies have difficulty finding local providers who will accept their insurance . Other students with MassHealth experience long wait times for Boston area providers . 41% of Boston health s ciences students are enrolled in the health plan offered by the university . Of the students enrolled in the university health plan , 7% utilized their insurance to access mental health provide rs.10 The top b arriers to help -seeking identified by health s ciences students include lack of time , financial concerns, difficulty finding an ava ilable appointment, and uncertainty where to go.11 The lack of on-site counseling services on the Boston health sciences campus has made us an outlier compared to peer institutions with s imilar health sciences campuses. RECOMMENDATION: Encourage students to identify a primary care physician in the local community to improve access to health care when needs arise . Implementation Progress: During the summer of 2018, the Boston health sciences schools collaborated to send messages to incoming students that clearly outlined the need for them to find local community health care providers on arrival in Boston . RECOMMENDATION: Enhance communications around health insurance options to help students make informed decision when selecting a health plan to meet their needs . RECOMMENDATION: Evolving trends in graduate and professional student expectations, the pr evalence of mental health needs among students , and increasing attention to the mental health needs of medical ,12 dental , and STEM graduate students13 not just during their 9 Tufts University Fact Book 2017 -2018, Geographic Distribution of Students by State/Territory Fall 2017, pg. 91 10 Student Advisory & Health Administration Office, Data for AY 2017 - 2018 11 Healthy Minds Survey, Fall 2017 Health Sciences 12 Karp and Levine. \" Menta l Health Services for Medical Students \u2014Time to Act .\" New England Journal of Medicine 379:13. 28 September 2018. 13 Evans, Bira et. al. \" Evidence for a mental health crisis in graduate education .\" Nature Biotechnology . 36:3. March 2018. 19 academic pursuits but also as part of their professional success suggests a greater n eed for an on-site counseling service to support graduate and professional student mental health and well-being . The Task Force recommends that leaders on the Boston health sciences campus explore modalities to establish an on -site counseling service on th e campus . In the longer term, the Task Force recommends establishing a designated space for health and wellness for on-site resources and programming that is easily accessible for students on the Boston health science s campus. Campus leadership should cont inue to assess, the quality, efficacy and availability of resources including psychiatrists and nurse practitioners. Implementation Progress: During the summer of 2018 , academic and administrative leaders on the Boston health sciences campus began discussions about the need for an on -site c ounseling resource for graduate and professional students on that campus . After exploring several possible models for an on -site counseling resource, leaders on the Boston health sciences campus have partner ed with Al lOne Health to offer on-site counseling resources . On April 1, 2019, an on -site counseling resource , TalkOne2One , was launched on the Boston health sciences campus . Across the university, the Tufts University Police Department ( TUPD ) is a vital communit y partner in responding to students in distress during emergency situations , however, t he Task Force found that the Boston health sciences is the only campus without a ccess to a designated 24/7 hotline for students in distress to reach and receive guidance from a licensed clinician . RECOMMENDATION: The Task Force recommends that a 24/7 telephonic service be made available for students in distress to access a licensed clinician for the Boston health sciences campus . Implementation Progress: Beginning April 1, 2019, a 24/7 telephonic counseling service became available for students on the Boston health sciences campus through the TalkOne2One program . Grafton Campus Over the past three years, the leaders at Cummings School have made significant effor ts to enhance services and resources to support students on the Grafton campus by housing a range of clinical and non -clinical resources to support student development and well-being in the Cummings Support Center . The creation of the Cummings Behavioral H ealth Service , beginning in fall 20 15, was received well by students; approximately 21 % of students on the Grafton campus utilize the on -site counseling service. RECOMMENDATION: The Task Force is encouraged by the positive responses among Cummings studen ts to the on -site clinical services offered on the Grafton campus . The Task Force encourages the school leadership to continue to evaluate the utilization and suc cess of those on -site services. Medford/Somerville and Boston SMFA Campuses Students on th e Medford/Somerville and Boston SMFA campuses have access to expert onsite clinical services to support mental heal th. The clinical team includes psychologists, social workers, licensed mental health clinicians, and a psychiatry department staffed by one senior 20 psychiatrist and two clinical nurse specialists. Healthy Minds Survey data indicate high levels of student satisfaction with the quality of care at CMHS: 89 -90% of Healthy Minds respondents who had utilized CMHS reported that they were satisfied wi th the quality of the therapists they saw.14 Consistent with college counseling services on most campuses across the country, CMHS utilizes a \"brief model\" of assessment and counseling, which typically focuses on helping students to effect a desired chang e or goal. Services offered at CMHS are free to students; providing services at no charge is critical for reducing barriers to accessing care for college students. With the exception of peak periods during the academic year, most students are able to sche dule appointments at CMHS within a week. Urgent appointments are available at CMHS daily. Over the past several years, the demand for urgent and triage appointments has increased. Under Tufts' brief care model, CMHS does not have a predetermined maximum number of sessions per student . The mean number of one -on-one sessions at CMHS per student in AY 2017 -2018 was three , and in AY 2018 -2019 the mean was four. The decision about whether or not the needs of a student fall within the scope of clinical care of CMHS is usually made after an initial meeting with a counselor . Students who utilize CMHS clinicians' services and need or desire more frequent or longer -term treatment are generally referred to a local provider for ongoing care. Currently, 28 % of Medfo rd-based undergraduate and graduate students utilize o n-campus counseling services each year ; in AY 2018 -2019 , 78% of CMHS cl ients were undergraduates were graduate students . The Healthy Minds surve y indicates that another eight to 10% utilize loca l community -based mental health providers each year . First -year students have the highest utilization rates among undergraduate students . The demographics of students utilizing CMHS are reflective of the diverse student populations on the Medford/Somervi lle and Boston SMFA campuses . (See Appendix G : Demographics of CMHS Cli entele .) While on many college campuses it has proven challenging to connect students from underrepresented communities with mental health services, students from historically underrep resented groups access CMHS services at rates equal to or exceeding utilization in the student population as a whole . CMHS recognizes that mental health practices have a history of prejudice and discrimination based on sex, gender identity and expression, ethnicity, race, sexual/affectional orientation, age, physical and mental abilities, size, religious beliefs, and socioeconomic class . Since such discrimination has historically affected the way mental health issues were defined and the way people received care, CMHS acknowledges a responsibility to work toward the recognition and elimination of prejudicial attitudes and practices. In line with national trends ,15 CMHS has seen an increase in the number of undergraduate and graduate students with significant , ongoing clinical needs . Between fall 2015 and fall 2017, the Medford/Somerville Counseling and Mental Health Service (CMHS) saw a 60% increase in new 14 Healthy Minds Survey, 2015 -2016 and Healthy Minds Survey, 2017 -2018 15 According to the Annual Report, Center for Collegiate Mental Health, 2015, \"on average [between 2009 -10 and 2014 -15 academic year s], [the] institutional enrollment [of 93 surveyed colleges and universities] grew by 5.6%.\" Concurrently, \"the number of students seeking [counseling] services increased by 29.6%, and the number of attended appointments increased by 38.4%.\" See also Reill y, Katie. \"Record Numbers of College Students Are Seeking Treatment for Depression and Anxiety \u2014But Schools Can't Keep Up.\" TIME Magazine. March 19, 2018. TIME Web. September 20, 2018. See also Annual Report, Center for Collegiate Mental Health, 2016. 21 student intake sessions in the fall semester and 40% increase in utilization overall . Anxiety and depres sion are the most frequent issues at intake . CMHS saw a sharp increase in students presenting with suicidal ideation from fall 2015 to fall 2018 . Seventy -five percent of students utilizing CMHS report prior mental health treatment. All Tufts students are required to have health insurance coverage that meets the minimum coverage requirements set by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts . The university offers a comprehensive plan for undergraduate and graduate students and, if needed, their spouses and children through UnitedHealthcare StudentResources, one of the largest student health insurance providers in the country . Twenty -five to 30 % of undergraduates and the majority of graduate students purchase health insurance through the university offered plan , which is coordinated by Health and Wellness Services . The university has endeavored to ensure that the plan offered to our students is as comprehensive as possible . To reduce the financial burden on students who may seek mental services off -campus, the in -netwo rk co -pay for appointments was reduced to $5 starting in AY 2018 -19. While there are many local providers in the Medford/Somerville area, many factors can inhibit or prevent a student from continuing treatment with a provider in the local community. The se factors include whether or not the provider takes the student's insurance, the proximity of a provider's office to campus and/or the student's residence, the availability of appointment hours that match the student's course schedule, the preference of t he student for a provider with a particular identity or identities, and the areas of specialization in the provider's practice. Many clinicians do not accept insurance, which can pose a financial barrier to accessing care. RECOMMENDATION: Enhance referr al processes at CMHS to better support students seeking ongoing mental health treatment from local community based providers . Implementation Progress: Implementation efforts to strengthen referral processes and connection with local community providers a re underway . Examples of those efforts include: A comprehensive review of CMHS' referral database of local providers was completed during the summer of 2018 . As a result of the review and outreach, six additional local community providers were added to Tuf ts insurance for the 2018 -19 academic year. Over the summer of 2018, CMHS explored a partnership with Thriv ing Campus, a tool that directs students and staff to loca l clinicians. During the spring of 2019, CMHS piloted Thriving Campus with for clinical sta ff; the tool is currently undergoing required accessibility improvements before it is available to students . To improve community provider awareness of the unique challenges and needs of Tufts students, between May and August 2018, CMHS hosted three open house sessions with local community providers. RECOMMENDATION: To meet a greater portion of our students' needs on campus the Task Force recommends increasing capacity at CMHS through establishing and meeting preferred on -campus clinician -to-student rati o by hiring additional clinicians , enhancing group therapy offerings, and extending clinical hours to include evening hours. Implementation Progress: CMHS, Health Services , and DOSA continue to explore ways to increase our capacity to serve students at C MHS; the following implementation strategies are in process: 22 During the fall of 2018, CMHS piloted offering extended hours . Extended hours were continued into the spring semester . CMHS will offer extended hours one evening per week during AY 19 -20. Duri ng the spring of 2019, CMHS pilot ed offering same -day appointment s during the busy end -of-year period with 45 -minute same - day session s. These same day -session s are designed to be one -time, goal - oriented counseling session s focused on a specific concern . The pilot of rapid access appointments was very successful and received positive feedback from students . CMHS plans to offer primarily rapid access appointments in AY 19 -20 during high -need periods at the beg inning and end of each semester and a mix of appoi ntment types includ ing same -day appointments throughout the year . CMHS continues to offer a limited number of urgent/same -day appointments throughout the academic year. A dedicated graduate student group therapy offer was established in spring 2018 and c ontinued in AY 18 -19. The group meets in the evenings, when a greater number of graduate students are available . The graduate student group therapy offering has been well attended and has been well received by graduate students. In response to concerns by graduate students \u2014with teaching relationships with undergraduate students \u2014of being seen in the waiting room at CMHS, CMHS staff are now also available for appointments at Health Services . CMHS is a division of Health and Wellness Ser vice, which also includes the Health Service . The Health Service and CMHS are committed to strong collaboration in support of student health and well-being . Clinicians at CMHS bring to their work a broad range of educational and professional backgrounds, theoretical orie ntations , and clinical interests . In addition to counseling, services include diagnostic assessments and initial assessments for interventions with medications as well as ongoing management and monitoring of psychiatric medication. Referrals to the CMHS p sychiatry service may be made through the CMHS counseling service or from an off -campus therapist . CMHS and Health and Wellness Serv ice has seen a 33% increase in new medication patients over academic years from 2015 -2016 to 2017 -2018 . Additionally, many s tudents receive medication management from home or off -campus providers . Data from the most recent Healthy Minds survey indicate that 21% of students on the Medford/Somerville and Boston SMFA campuses have used a psychiatric medication in the past year. While CMHS psychiatric staff are able to meet the current volume of requests for on -campus medication management, leadership recognizes the importance of ongoing assessment of staffing levels to support continued psychiatric consultation with CMHS leadership as well as direct patient care. CMHS is committed to ongoing assessment of treatment effectiveness and to continuing professional development for its team, given both changing student needs and evolving best practices in care as informed by relevant rese arch . Advances in psychiatric medication and treatment over the last generation have opened new personal and academic opportunities for many students with mental and behavioral health challenges . CMHS staffing, treatment, and policy decisions will continue to be informed by new research and best practices as the standard of care evolves. 23 RECOMMENDATION: Continue to e valuate operations and staffing practices at Health and Wellness Services and CMHS to reach the optimal use of clinical resources focusing on clinician backgrounds, training , and approaches to meet student mental health needs most efficiently and effectively . CMHS faces intense competition for clinical staff in the local market, both from other colleges and universities and from a wide range of other professional opportunities including private practice . Recruiting and retaining an outstanding staff must and will remain a priority for CMHS in the face of these competitive pressures. RECOM MENDATION: Develop and implement a retention strategy t o ensure Tufts continues to retain a team of hi ghly skilled on -campus clinicians . Over the past three academic years, Student Affairs and CMHS have jointly supported an average of 34 mental health -related hospitalizations for AS&E undergraduate and gradu ate students, a 70% increase from the average of the prior three years . The majority of hospitalizations are initiated by students or their families and/or outpatient clinicians. Three - quarters of students who are hospitalized resume their studies within two weeks' time with support from CMHS and/or a local provider, Student Affairs staff and their advising dean. Others, after hospitalization , choose to engage in additional outpatient or inpatient treatment durin g a medical leave of a bsence and coordinate with Student Affairs staff when they are ready to return to their studies. Each semester, another 2 0-40 students elect to attend to their health needs through a medical leave in consultation with their tre atment providers and Student Affairs staff. Each student's circumstances are unique and call for careful coordination of on - and off -campus resources, often in coordination with their parents and families, Advising Dean, and faculty members. Whether seeking to return to classes and campus life from a sho rt-term hospitalization or developing a support plan to take or return from a medical leave of absence, Tufts students consistently need responsive, well -informed administrative support as they navigate these steps. RECOMMENDATION: The Task Force recommen ds that the Dean of Student Affairs Office continue to evaluate s taffing structures and internal processes to best to meet the needs of students with complex circumstances. Across the university , the Deans or Offices of Student Affairs work directly wit h students in navigating personal and academic challenges during their times at Tufts . Those units also provide important programming to enhance the student experience, create community, and support personal growth and well-being . The Graduate and Professi onal Working Group found that there is a lack of student affairs infrastructure to suppor t students in the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences and graduate programs in the School of Engineering . Almost all support for GSAS and Engineering graduate student s is provided at the program or department level . The lack of clearly defined student affairs support makes it difficult for students to navigate challenges they may face during their time as a graduate student; graduate students often seek help at CMHS or Office of Equal Opportunity ( OEO ) for needs better suited for student affairs professionals. RECOMMENDATION: The Task Force recommends collaboration between GSAS, the graduate programs in Engineering, and the Dean of Student Affairs Office to explore mod els and structures to better support the graduate student experience on the Medford/Somerville and Boston SMFA campuses. 24 Findings and Recommendations: Policies and Practices Leave of Absence Policies Leave of absence policies provide students with the p rocedures to take time off from their studies for personal or health reasons . Students with mental health needs may depart the university by taking a Medical Leave of Absence (MLOA) or Personal Leave of Absence (PLOA) . Additionally, some students who take a Required Academic Withdraw al may be experiencing the effects of mental health challenges . The Task Force found that each policy has different considerations and circumstances for a student departing from a nd retuning to Tufts . (Appendix H: Comparison of Leave Policies outlines the differences between the l eave policies for undergraduate students .) MLOA and PLOA policies and processes are set and administered by the individual s chools . The following discussion surrounding leave of ab sence policies focus es on the MLOA and PLOA policies in pla ce for undergraduate students in the School of Arts and Sciences and the School of Engineering. Medical Leave of Absence The purpose of a medical leave of absence is to allow students to take a break from campu s life and their studies to more intensely address a medical or mental health condition that impacts their ability to function successfully or safely as a member of the Tufts community . All of Tufts' schools have their own MLOA polic ies and processes for d eparting and returning . Concerns around the process of taking and returning from a medical leave of absence were one of the most frequent topics to emerge during the listening sessions with undergraduate students. Students expressed deep concerns over st udent rights during the return process and the transition back to campus after approval to return . Additio nally, students expressed a desire for more options to permit students with mental health conditions to continue their studies while balancing treatme nt needs . The Medical Leave of Absence process assumes students seeking leave are doing so volunta rily. However, in rare cases, DO SA, in consultation with health and/or counseling professionals, ma y determine that an involuntary medical leave is necessar y for health or safety reasons . Decisions to place a student on an involuntary medical leave are based on individualized assessments of the student's ability to access and engage in their educational activities and potential health and safety risks the stu dent may pose to themselves or other members of the Tufts community . Students placed on involun tary medical leave may appeal the dean of student affairs' decision through a grievance process . There is no set limit on how long a st udent may be on medical leave . Most students who take a MLOA subsequently return to Tufts and resume their studies . Some of the benefits of taking a MLOA include: Personalized advising and consultation prior to taking a leave to make informed decisions about all options availabl e to the student and a personalized plan to support the student upon return from MLOA . A stu dent's medical leave status does not appear on their transcript . Students who leave the university during the first six weeks of classes are eligible for a refun d of a percentage of tuition in accordance with the schedule set by the bursar. 25 For students with tuition reimbursement insurance, a medical leave generally qualifies a student for benefits under tuition insurance plans they may carry . Students who have p urchased the health insurance plan offere d through the university are eligible to continue on the plan while on medical leave for up to one calendar year from the start of their leave. Following a review of the MLOA exit process during the summer and fall of 2017 , the Undergraduate Working Group identified the following themes and challenges: There are many mis conceptions and myths within the community surrounding medical leaves of absence. The exit process is intended to be a consultative process with opportunities for students to engage and receive guidance from student affairs professionals , their advising dean, and others prior to taking MLOA . Although intentionally established as a consultative process, the exit process lacks structure or clarity a nd includes redundancies that can be frustrating or disempowering for some students . Need for greater coordination and collaboration between D OSA and the International Center to support international students who take a leave of absence. Eligibility for a tuition refund is limited to a window of several weeks at the beginning of each semester; after the refund period has passed, the financial burden of losing tuition dollars paid and financial aid used is a barrier for some who may benefit from taking a MLOA . Students on MLOA feel disconnected from the Tufts community because they are not permitted on campus and do not have access to Tufts e -mail while on leave . Following a review of the MLOA return process during the summer and fall of 2017 , the Underg raduate Working Group identified the following themes and challenges: There are many misconceptions and myths in the community about the ability of students to return from medical leave, contributing to a reluctance to make use of the policy. It is actua lly extremely rare that a student's request to return from MLOA is denied, and an appeals proc ess has long been in place in the event that a student objects to a decision made by the dean of student affairs . Although intentionally established as a consul tative process, the return process lacks clarity and includes redundancies that can be frustrating or disempowering for some students. The current return from MLOA pr ocess is cumbersome for both students and administrators . Students reported that retu rning from MLOA commonly led to stress with respect to housing and course registration. RECOMMENDATION: Streamline steps necessary to exit and return from MLOA. Strategies may include: Evaluate the exit and return procedures for taking medical leave to ensure students receive adequate guidance and support. Assess the role of external clinician evaluations of a student's readiness to return from MLOA. Codify internal processes for notifying the International Center when international students take a le ave of absence. 26 Engage stakeholders including DOSA, advising deans, the International Center , and Financial Aid to evaluate current practices for determining the effective date of medical leave applications . Implementation Progress: During the summer o f 2018, in consultation with administrative stakeholders , DOSA significantly revised the MLOA policy and associated processes to simplify the exit and return processes. DOSA will continue to assess internal processes and practices regarding the MLOA to sup port students' needs. RECOMMENDATION: Explore and promote possible benefits of broader use of tuition refund insurance. Relevant issues for review may include: Costs, benefits, and access for students with a range of financial needs or aid situations. Further educating students returning from MLOA about the potential value of purchasing tuition refund insurance. Changing the existing \"opt -in\" policy to include tuition refund insurance as an \"opt - out\" selection. RECOMMENDATION: Reduce barriers and stre ssors associated with returning from MLOA . Strategies may include: Consider how students may remain connected with the community while on MLOA. Explore the feasibility of reserving campus housing for students who may be intending to return from medical le ave in future semesters and ways to assist students returning from leave with housing options. Consider permitting students to register for courses prior to their intended return from medical leave. Implementation Progress: In partnership with advising deans, Tufts Student Services, and Tufts Technology Services, DOSA has made the following efforts to reduce barriers and stressors associated with returning from MLOA: Students on MLOA no longer lose access to their Tufts e -mail account or SIS. Students on MLOA no longer are prohibited from campus and may attend campus -wide events. In collaboration with the advising deans and Tufts Student Services, DOSA is piloting course registration for students prior to their return from MLOA. Personal Leave of Absenc e Students may take personal leave for various reason s: some examples include travel, to participate in a non -academic program, attend to a family crisis, work, or to gain a sense of direction . PLOA policies for students enrolled in graduate and professi onal degree programs across the university are structured , consultative , and time bound . By comparison , the current PLOA policy and practices for undergraduates lack structure and consistency to provide opportunities for students to connect with campus res ources prior to taking PLOA and upon returning to the campus community . 27 Some undergraduate students utilize PLOA to tend to medical needs and return to campus without receiving guidance and advising about support structures that may assis t students to make the transition to Tufts . The lack of a formal exit and return process for PLOA may contribute to some students taking multiple leaves of absence and depleting their financial aid resources while not making progress toward their degree . The disparitie s between the return and exit processes of the MLOA and PLOA policies contrib ute to confusion surrounding leave of absence policies . RECOMMENDATION: Establish procedures for persona l leaves to ensure students receive guidance and support for their indiv idual circumstances prior to and upon return from PLOA . The objectives of the new processes should be to : Enhance student advising prior to taking personal leave. Connect students with resources and support, including alternatives to taking a leave of abse nce. Support students transitioning back to Tufts after a leave of absence . Limit the number of times a student may take a personal leave of absence. Ensure greater equity between leave of absence policies by continuing to examine differences between the two and closing identified gaps . Implementation Progress: Advising deans and relevant campus partners have begun to explore opportunities to update the Personal Leave of Absence policy and associated procedures . Accommodations and Reduced Course Loa d The university is committed to providing accommodations and services to students with disabilities in order to ensure a comprehensively accessible Tufts experience . OEO works with student affairs leaders at the various hea lth sciences schools to provide reasonable accommodations for students with documented disabilities covered under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) . The Student Accessibility Services Office (SAS) provides support to 850 registered undergraduate and graduate students on the Medf ord/Somerville and Boston SMFA campuses , including The Fletcher School, with documen ted disabilities, more than 300 of whom are registered for reason s related to mental health. The School of Arts and Sciences and the School of Engineering do not offer pa rt-time program s for undergraduate students . Some students at Tufts , however , have disabilities or conditions that may affect their ability to maintain the expected 12 or more Semester Hour Unit s (SHUs) per seme ster. Students may petition SAS for a reduced course load (RCL) as an accommodation . They must do so prior to the start of each semester ; the RCL accommodation cannot be implemented retroactively . RCL may be granted with reduced tuition depe nding upon the number of Semester Hour Units (SHUs) taken fo r the semester . Additionally, the academic standing degre e progress criteria are amended for students receiving an RCL accommodation . The RCL accommodation and other accommodations offered through SAS provide support and tools to help students with men tal health challenges to succeed on campus . RCL is a relatively new policy; the 2016 -2017 academic year was the first full year t hat the policy was in place . Twelve students took advantage of this accommodation in AY16 -17. Ten students utilized the RCL acc ommodation in AY17 -18. Fifteen students utilized the RCL accommodation in AY18 -19. In the f all of 2019, 18 students are utilizing the RCL accommodation. Undergraduate participants in the listening sessions were not widely familiar with SAS's RCL policy and the 28 broader range of accommodations and support offered through SAS for students with mental health challenges . For eligible students , the RCL accommodation may allow for greater academic success and scheduling flexibility for students to participate in t reatment while continuing their studies . SAS is frequently a resource for students returning from a medical leave of absence . SAS can support students in the academic, housing , and transportation environments depending on their individual needs . RECOMMENDATION: Increase awareness of Student Accessibility Services and the benefits of the Reduced Course Load policy for undergraduate students and academic accommodations available for AS&E and Fletcher students. Academic Policies and Practices Academic policies are set and enforced by faculty committees at the s chool , and in some cases program level . Many of the professional and graduate programs may also adhere to academic or technical requirements set by accredi tors and professional licensing bodies . The faculty and the academic environment play an essential role in the success and well-being of our students and have a major impact on Tufts' ability to support students who may be dealing with mental health challenges. The Undergraduate Workin g Group identified several academic policies and practices that intersect with student mental health . While not all students with mental health challenges also face academic difficulty , academic policies and practices that encourage help -seeking and early identification of struggling students strengthen Tufts' ability to support students effectively . Thresholds for academic intervention (academic alert and probation) may be too low to trigger early intervention . A GPA below 2.0 is a commonly used threshold to trigger academic interventions at peer institutions; the threshold for acade mic alert for undergraduates at Tufts has been a GPA of 1.67 or lower . Academic standing policies and academic progress policies associated with financial aid are not synchroniz ed, putting students at risk of running out of aid before completing their degree . Deadlines for course withdraw al in some cases allow students to postpone seeking help until late in the semester . Once a student is matriculated, the School of Arts and Sc iences and the School of Engineering do not accept transfer credits from community colleges . For students on medical leave, course work at a community college may provide continued academic engagement and fulfilment . It may be cost prohibitive or geographi cally impossible for students on medical leave to take course work at four -year institutions. RECOMMENDATION: Evaluate current academic policies and administrative practices to ensure early identification and intervention to help encourage struggling stud ents to engage with resources . Relevant academic policies and practices for consideration may include: Academic standing criteria and academic progress policies Midterm notification of student performances Deadlines for course withdraw and incomplete poli cy Awarding credit for course work completed at a community college for students on MLOA Transcript treatment of courses enroll ed in prior to medical leave 29 Implementation Progress: The Academic Standing Committees at the School of Arts and Sciences and the School of Engineering revised the academic standing criteria to include a semester GPA threshold of 2.0 and benchmarks for satisfactory credit progress , effective AY 2018 -19. The Education Policy Committee adjusted the course withdraw al deadline to wee k 10 of the semester, effective AY 2019 -20. In collaboration with the advising deans, the incomplete process has been streamlined for faculty members . Members of the Undergraduate Working Group and the advising deans continue to work with the Education Pol icy Committee to explore additional policy considerations . Suicide Pr evention Suicide is recognized as the second -leading cause of death for 15 -to 34 -year -olds16. Suicide prevention has been and remains a critical priority at Tufts University . Impor tant suicide prevention initiatives at the university in recent years include gatekeeper training, orientation programing, consultations with staff, students , and faculty concerned about students, and CMHS liaison relationships. In May 2018, the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts issued an important ruling on student suicides, Nguyen v. MIT . The Nguyen case involved the death of a graduate student at MIT, whose family sued the school , alleging that multiple faculty and staff members knew about their son's men tal health problems and thus had a duty to prevent his suicide . The court ruled in favor of MIT and its non -clinician staff and faculty members , reasoning that Nguyen's suicide was not reasonably foreseeable because no one at the school knew that he had tried to commit suicide in the past or that he had any stated plans or intentions to harm himself in the future . Generalized concerns about student well-being and stress, the court said, were insufficient to trigger a legal duty to prevent suicide . The court concluded that colleges and universities have a responsibility to try to prevent student suicides in cases where a faculty or staff member has actual knowledge that a student has (i) attempted suicide while enrolled at the school, (ii) attempt ed suicide shortly before enrolling at the school, or (iii) has stated plans or intentions to commit suicide . Under those circumstances, the faculty or staff member has a legal obligation to act, either by initiating the school's suicide prevention protoco l, directing the student to medical care , or reaching out to the student's emergency contacts. During the fall of 2018, members of the Mental Health Task Force, student affairs professionals and University Counsel reviewed the protocol s and practices acro ss the university in place for responding to students in distress across the university . Each school has its own protocol and administrative procedures for responding to students in distress . Student affairs professionals at each school and TTAM teams collaborate on assessing and taking action regarding reports of students of concern . Currently, there is no uniform training across the university for faculty and staff on responding to students in distress. RECOMMENDATION: The Mental Health Task Force, in consultation with student affairs leaders and University Counsel , carefully developed the following recommendations and guidance for all schools. 16 National Vital Statistics System, National Center for Health Statistics, Center for Disease Control and Prevention, 2017. https://www.cdc.gov/injury/wisqars/LeadingCauses.html . 30 Review and update the existing \" A Guide for Helping Students in Distress \" issued by CMHS on the Medford /Some rville campus . Create a companion Students in Distress Protocol for the graduate and professional schools, with appropriate resources and contact information . Distribute the updated guide to faculty and staff at all the schools across the university. Stren gthen university -wide \"Students in Distress\" training to provide faculty and staff with the tools to appropriately identi fy and respond to students in distress. Implementation Progress: Across the university, administrative teams are updating or drafting equivalent guide s specific to each school . A \"Students in Distress\" training for faculty and staff with Jeanne Kincaid, a nationally known disability lawyer and consultant, was piloted in February 2019 on the Medford/Somerville campus . Thanks to a scholar ship awarded to the university by the HBC Foundation, the Medford/Somerville and Boston SMFA campuses began participating in a four -year strategic partnership as a JED Campus in fall 2019 . This partnership includes a comprehensive assessment and enhancemen t of Tufts mental health, substance use , and suicide prevention policies . Data Collection There is no uniform data collection tool utilized across the university to track student attitudes, behaviors and needs with respect to mental health, and trends in service utilization . Since 2007 , CMHS has collected and tracked health and wellness data for undergraduate and graduate students on the Medford/Somerville campus through the Healthy Minds Survey , which focuses exclusively on student mental health . The 2 018 data collected through the Healthy Minds Survey is the first data set to include students on the Boston SMFA campus . On the health science s campus es, any data relevant to student mental health has been collected by individual schools and has not been p art of long -term coordinated strategy . RECOMMENDATION: The Task Force recommends the inclusion of the health sciences campuses in the biennial implementation of the Healthy Minds Survey to examine student attitudes, behaviors and needs, and trends in service utilization . The Task Force encourages schools and campus -wide resources to utilize survey data to develop and inform health promotion and outreach efforts . Implementation Progress: The Healthy Minds Survey was administered on the health sciences campuses in the fall of 2017 for the first time . Creation of Steering Committee The decision to launch the Task Force reflected the fact that no single existing administrative office or working group brought together the range of participants need ed to address the critical emerging issues in student mental health holistically across the entire university . The experience of the Task Force has confirmed that supporting the mental health of Tufts' students requires a coordinated approach that draws on the expertise and engagement of students, staff, faculty, and off -campus stakeholders, supporters, and experts . We also believe that student mental health and wellness will benefit significantly from ongoing coordination across our campuses and schools, l everaging opportunities to share best practices and gain economies of scale in important programs and initiatives. 31 Looking forward, we see no sign of a l essening in the demand or need t o support student mental health . It will be essential that we maintain the momentum generated by the Task Force . We have helpful internal models to follow in the university's work on both sexual misconduct prevention and diversity and inclusion . With respect to each of those vital issues, an ongoing university -wide oversight group was established to continue the work of an initial Presidential Task Force or Council . Such a structure responds to Tufts' school -based administrative model while providing a university -wide mechanism for promoting and assessing the implementation of recommended actions and responding to subsequent developments as they emerge. RECOMMENDATION: The Task Force recommends the university establish a university - wide Steering Committee on Student Mental Health to ensure continued attention to this critica l issue for the health and well-being of all of Tufts' students . This Steering Committee should be chaired by the president and include a broad range of stakeholders from across Tufts with the expertise and commitment to spearhead th e university's ongoing efforts. 32 Conclusion Supporting the evolving mental health needs of a diverse student body is a continuous challenge, one that we can best meet with a shared understanding of our community's goals and strengths . While an inc rease in the number and type of clinician providers a nd other individual resources is necessary and recommended by the Task Force , it is clear that the complexity of our students' needs also requires the implementation of a broader, more strategic suite of services \u2014 services beyond the short -term model of care practiced at Tufts and most other colleges and universities in the United States . The major findings and recommendations presented in this report outline a multifaceted strategy to supporting student m ental health . Given the research, discourse , and hard work that has led to the development of these recommendations, Tufts is now better poised to elevate student mental health as a university - wide priority . In the coming years , Tufts stands to augment i ts natu ral resources and capacities toward fostering a healthier university community . Partners across the university have already begun efforts to implement many of the recommendations included in this report . Advancing these recommendations and the broad er dialogue surrounding student mental health at Tufts will depend on the sustai ned involvement of contributors from across the university . Accordingly, it is the sincere hope of the Task Force that this report may serve not only as an advisory document fo r the central administration, schools, and divisions, but a lso as a call to action for the entire community to remain engaged in the important ongoing work of making Tufts a healthier and inclusive community. As Tufts continues to monitor utilization tren ds, evolving student needs, and the regulatory landscape , the university's focus must expand to include greater attention to a coordinated holistic community health approach in supporting student mental health . In pursuit of these efforts, Tufts is creatin g a standing Student Mental Health Steering Committee that will serve as a dedicated, standing, governance structure to continue the work of the Mental Health Task Force. The Steering Committee will comprise students, faculty , and staff. President Monaco w ill chair the Steering Committee. The work ahead is significant. We welcome all those who share in this commitment going forward and thank all those who have already dedicated so much time, energy , and personal sacrifice to this issue. We especially appre ciate the advocacy of our students and the commitment of our faculty and staff who endeavor to make Tufts University a healthy community for all . The Task Force is grateful to everyone who has contributed to its work and looks forward to an ongoing communi ty conversation concerning student mental health at Tufts. 33 Append ix A: Purpose and Charge The purpose of the Mental Health Task Force , as announced at its establishment in December 2016, was to conduct a university -wide review and assessment of student mental health, wellness , and holistic engagement, including the current student experience, the services offered, available resources , and potential areas for additional collaboration and enhancement. The overall goal of the Mental Health Task F orce was to ensure that Tufts University is meeting the needs of our student populations, fostering resilience, and providing a healthy and supportive community . The charge of the task force was to: Examine the state of student mental health university -wide with attention to the needs and experiences of undergraduate, graduate , and professional students in all of Tufts' schools . This should include (1) careful attention to the normative personal development of students and discussion of the faculty and uni versity's role in supporting it, (2) comparisons to national trends and data, and (3) the intersection between academic and curricular policies and practices with student mental health. Assess mental health services and related resources available to help our student populations to address mental health needs, paying careful attention to the particular experiences and needs of diverse groups within the student population and comparison with best practices in evidence -based treatment. Review university polic ies and practices to identify (1) possible barriers to access and utilization of services for students in need, (2) opportunities to strengthen support, and (3) potential updates to ensure Tufts' continued compliance with applicable state and federal laws, regulations , and guidelines. Make recommendations that promote the mission of the task force with respect to: (1) education, outreach , and mental health promotion, (2) services and resources, and (3) policies and practices. 34 Appendix B : Mental Health Task Force Timeline Fall 2016The Office of the President engaged in planning activites and background interviews with students, faculty, and staff President Monaco estabilished and convened the Mental Health Task Force Spring 2017The Undergraduate Working Group and the Graduate and Professional Working Group were estabilished The Graduate and Professional Working Group conducted an inventory of the resources and services available to graduate and pr ofessional students across all eight schools spread across four campuses The Undergraduate Working Group engaged in data collection efforts including reviewing survey data and listening sessions wit h students Summer 2017Recognizing the lack of uniform data collection across all the schools on student mental health and well -being, the Graduate and Professional Working Group investigated survey options to collect benchmarking data The Undergraduate Working Group synthesized themes from listening sessions, conducted a policy review of AS&E administrative and academic policies, consulted with relevant administrative stakeholders, and reviewed peer policies Task Force established the Models of Care Task Group Fall 2017The Graduate and Professional Working Group hosted 15+ listening sessions with students in Boston, Grafton, and Somerville/Me dford;
