Although several vaccines are being prepared by different agencies, there are no approved vaccines against ZIKV infection in human. Methods: In this context, the need for vaccine development, our study was based on the development of the preclinical phase of an Inactivated Zika Vaccine using the Asian strain SV0010-15. Inactivated Zika vaccine was produced using growth with formalin inactivated Serum Free Medium (VP-SFM) and following WHO recommendation and Quality controls. Pre-clinical models were developed using small animal for immune response, safety and dose formulation followed using no-human primate animal model for vaccine efficacy. Results: Our results showed that an optimal and suitable dose formulation of Zika vaccine/Alum adjuvant (5 \u00b5g/250 \u00b5g) was obtained when performed with a use of two doses injections. Also, it showed to be safe, immunogenic and to have a protective effect against two ZIKV genotypes in Non-Human Primate. Ultimately, the first step of the development of this vaccine candidate has been successfully done accordingly to WHO guidelines and shown that the product could be developed in GMP pilot scale for a clinical stage at the request of health authorities. Inactivated vaccine ; Thailand ; vaccine ; Zika vaccine ; Zika virus The Zika virus (ZIKV) is a mosquito-borne virus from the family Flaviviridae and genus Flavivirus which includes, among others, several human pathogenic flaviviruses such as Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), Dengue virus (DENV). ZIKV is an arbovirus transmitted principally mosquito species including Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus. The geographical distribution of these mosquito species across tropical and subtropical regions has led to several outbreaks, including the recent pandemic in Brazil, followed by the Pacific islands and other areas of North and South America [1]. Today, ZIKV is globally widespread [2]. ZIKV was first identified and isolated from a sentinel monkey in a Ugandan forest in 1947 [3] and emerged as a global health threat in December 2015 [4]. For the past seven decades, ZIKV has had limited impact on public health systems worldwide, while few human cases were reported in Southeast Asia and Africa. It was not until 2007 that ZIKV caused large outbreaks and was first detected outside Asia and Africa. Furthermore, ZIKV emerged as a threat in Oceania with a large outbreak in French Polynesia in 2013-2014. Since 2015 ZIKV became endemic in Brazil, with increased pathogenicity impacting the nervous system with severe congenital malformations (microcephaly) as well as neurological as Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome (GBS) with acute inflammatory demyelinating neuropathy [5-7]. On February 1st, 2016, WHO declared the ZIKV epidemic in Brazil a public health emergency of international concern. In Thailand the first report of the possible presence of Zika virus was recorded in 1963 [8]. In early 2013, ZIKV was also detected among travelers and more recently several autochthonous cases were observed providing evidence that ZIKV is widespread throughout Thailand [9-10]. In 2018, United Kingdom health authorities (Public Health England (PHE) have classified Thailand as having a risk of Zika virus transmission). Several ZIKV vaccine candidates have now been developed and tested in preclinical and clinical trials. These include nucleic acid vaccines (DNA and RNA vaccines), inactivated whole virus vaccines, live attenuated vaccines, viral vectored vaccines, protein antigen vaccines in the form of purified proteins from expression systems, or virus-like particles [11]. In mid-2016, WHO, UNICEF and a working group of independent subject matter experts have proposed a ZIKV vaccine target product profile (TPP) for use in an emergency (i.e., urgent need during pregnancy in endemic areas), or in a future emerging outbreak scenario. The TPP suggested non-replicating platforms such as inactivated whole virion and subunit based and those that use alum as adjuvant. The proposed model of TPP was the inactivated Zika vaccine elicited ZIKV envelope specific neutralizing antibodies and protected non-human primates (NHP) against challenge with the virus strains from Brazil and Puerto Rico [12]. In September 2017, the Center for Vaccine Development (CVD) Institute of Molecular Biosciences Mahidol University, Government Pharmaceutical Organization (GPO) and National Vaccine Institute (NVI) Ministry of Public Health took the challenge and decided to develop an Inactivated Zika vaccine in Thailand. In September 2017, the three parties signed a Memorandum of Understand (MOU) to develop such Inactivated Zika vaccine by using WHO Vero cell as recommended by the TPP. The present study report on the development of the pre-clinical phase of this ZIKV vaccine in Thailand. Cell WHO Vero cells RCB 10-87 were derived from GMP cell bank product that was prepared and extensively characterized at Government Pharmaceutical Organization (GPO). Zika virus strains The infectious strain of ZIKV SV0010/15 was used to produce the inactivated vaccine candidate (GenBank: KX051562.1). ZIKV SV0010/15 was generously provided by the Epidemiology Department of Disease Control, Ministry of Public Health, Thailand. ZIKV SV0010/15 was amplified in WHO Vero cell using Hyper-flask (Corning, Corning, NY) and harvested on day 4 and 6 after inoculation. The virus titer tested 7 log10 plaque forming unit/ml and confirmed free of mycoplasma. The identity of Zika virus was confirmed by genomic RNA sequencing from Direct PCR amplicon. ZIKV strain MR766 (African strain) was used for the heterologous ZIKV challenge in primate model. Inactivation of ZIKV candidate vaccine strain SV0010/15 was produced inside the virus vaccine clean room facility at Center for Vaccine Development, Institute of Molecular Biosciences, Mahidol University. WHO Vero cell was scale up in Hyper-flask (Corning;). ZIKV inoculation in Vero cells was performed using serum free medium (VP-SFM, Gibco) and carried out at a standardized MOI of 0.01 PFU/cell. The virus was harvested at 4 and 6 days. Pooled virus harvest was clarified by Refrigerated Centrifugation 5,000 rpm about 10 minute and filter 0.45 micron using Sartopure 0.45 \u00b5 PP3 (Sartorius), concentrated by tangential filtration Pellicon Mini Filter Ultrafiltration 500 Kda (Merck millipore). Residual Vero cellular DNA was removed by using nuclease digestion (Benzonase endonuclease, Merck), and the viral suspension purified on Capto Core 700 (GE Healthcare Life Sciences, Pittsburg, USA) column. ZIKV was inactivated with 0.05% of formalin for 7 days at 22 \u00b0C following the previously described method [13]. Formalin was removed by diafiltration 100 Kda (Merck millipore). Ultimately, the antigen concentration was adjusted with a 6% sucrose, PBS pH 7.4 buffer. Inactivation was considered as complete when no infectious particle could be detected by Indirect Fluorescent after three serial amplifications of the sample in vitro in C6/36 for 7 days. Quality controls were applied accordingly to the Requirements for Japanese Encephalitis Vaccine (Inactivated) for Human Use as previously described [14]. Preclinical Immunogenicity in Small mammal The preclinical phase on the immune response was carried out in Balb/c mice at the animal facility in Faculty of Veterinary Science, Mahidol University. Balb/c female mice 6-8 weeks of age were purchased from M-CLEA Bioresource Company, Thailand. The animals (n = 6 specimen by group) were allocated randomly to different groups. Mice were vaccinated with booster doses (day 0 and day 14) of 5g vaccines and 10g adjuvant (2% Alhydrogel, Invivogen) by IM routes in a 100l volume. All of mice blood samples were collected on day 35 after the second dose, by cardiac puncture [15]. Preclinical Immunogenicity in Primates Two groups of nine (9) 4-5 years old cynomolgus macaque (Macaca fascicularis), from the animal facility of the National Primate Center, Chulalongkorn University at Saraburi Province Thailand, were vaccinated including: A first group (n=6) that received a booster dose (day 0, 14) of 5 g of inactivated Zika vaccine and adjuvant (2% Alhydrogel, Invivogen); A second group (n=3) serves as negative control. All specimen received only adjuvant and PBS7.4 and were randomly injected by IM routes in a 100 l volume vaccine. Also, blood samples were collected on day 0, 7, 14, 21, 30, 60 after the first injection. Ethics All animal experiment protocols for small mammal models were approved by the Faculty of Veterinary Science, Mahidol University-Institute Animal Care and Use Committee (COA. No: MUVS-2017-12-56). The animal experiment protocol for the Pre-clinical Immunogenicity in Primates was approved by the Chulalongkorn University Animal Care and Use Committee (COA. No: 2075002). Challenge test in Monkeys On day 180, the first group of cynomolgus macaque was separated in two subgroups: The subgroup I (1/1 to 1/3) challenged by the ZIKV strain SV0010/15 (Asian strain, titer 5.7 log10) and subgroup II (1/4 to 1/6) challenged by ZIKV strain MR766 (African strain, titer 5.7 log10). Both of them will be injected about 0.5 ml by sub cutaneous (sc) route. The second group was positive control challenged (group III) (2/1 to 2/3). It was challenge by ZIKV strain SV0010/15 with the same dose (0.5 ml of 5.7 log10 titer). Blood samples were collected on a daily base from day 180 to day 187 following a previously establish protocol [12]. ELISA (IgG) serology test Briefly, we used the FBS-depleted ZIKV antigen strain MR766 which derived from Vero cells as previously described, has been slightly adapted from the described technique using Flavivirus mouse brain antigen and replaced by the use of Zika virus cell culture antigen [16]. ELISA (IgM) serology test ZIKV specific capture IgM were by a modified ELISA as previously described [17-18]. ELISA optical reading value For each sample the ratio (P/N) in optical density reading (OD) value was positive control serum including sample well value divided by the OD value of the negative control serum well. It was used for both IgG and IgM ELISA tests. Thus, The sample was considered positive when the P/N value 2 or sample OD higher than the negative control OD about 2 times [18]. Plaque Reduction Neutralization Test (PRNT50) Briefly, we used the ZIKV strain SV0010/15 (Asian strain) and MR 766 (African strain) for neutralizing homologous and heterologous antibody respectively following the protocol as previously described [19]. RT-PCR Following [20] we used the outer primer pairs of Uni for (5 1171 TGGGGNAAYSRNTGYGGNYTNTTYGG 1197 3) and Unirev (5 2178 CCNCCHRNNGANCCRAARTCCCA 2155 3) and, followed by the inner pairs of Mounifor2 (5 1209 GGRDRMDTBKWSAYVTGYGCNAWRTT Amplification was performed using the following procedure: 1 cycle at 50\u00b0C for 30 min and 95\u00b0C for 2 min, and 35 cycles at 95\u00b0C for 20s, 55\u00b0C for 20s, and 68\u00b0C for 30s. Virus Isolation C6/36 cells were used for virus isolation and identification by Indirect Fluorescent (IFA) as previously described [21]. Plaque assay Vero cells monolayer was used for virus titration by plaque assay. The plaques were counted, and the viral titer was calculated and expressed as PFU/ml [19]. | | Group (1) | | Vaccine/Alum (Formulation) | | Geometric Mean Titer (GMT) (2) | | | | | | Day 0 | | Day 35 | | A | | 5/100 | | <10(3)/<10(4) | | 205/131 | | B | | 5/250 | | <10/<10 | | 638/923 Table 1 Immunogenicity of Inactivated Zika vaccine strain SV0010/15 in Balb/C mice by Plaque Reduction Neutralization Test 50 % (PRNT50) Legend: (1) = Mice group; (2) = Geometric Mean Titer (GMT) was mean calculated from six mice neutralizing antibody; (3) = Neutralized by Zika virus strain SV0010/15 (4) (heterologous strain) Inactivated Zika vaccine strain SV0010/15 demonstrated to be safe and immunogenic in Balb/c mice. Also, the dose formulation of Zika vaccine/alum at (5 \u00b5g /250 \u00b5g) produced a variable 1). From the Six cynomolgus macaques immunized with two doses of Zika vaccine/alum no local or systemic reactions were observed after injection. Most of the monkeys showed high positive ELISA of both IgM and IgG on day 14 (Figure 1). | | Time (day post inoculation) | | | | Immunized group (1) | | Monkey | | Negative control group (2) | | | | 1/1 | | 1/2 | | 1/3 | | 1/4 | | 1/5 | | 1/6 | | 2/1 | | 2/2 | | 2/3 | | IgM | | IgG | | IgM | | IgG | | IgM | | IgG | | IgM | | IgG | | IgM | | IgG | | IgM | | IgG | | IgM | | IgG | | IgG | | IgG | | IgG | | IgG | | 0 | | 0(3) | | 0 | | 0 | | 0 | | 0 | | 0 | | 0 | | 0 | | 0 | | 0 | | 0 | | 0 | | 0 | | 0 | | 0 | | 0 | | 0 | | 0 | | 7 | | 0 | | 0 | | 2.3 | | 0 | | 2.4 | | 0 | | 0 | | 0 | | 3.4 | | 0 | | 2.7 | | 0 | | 0 | | 0 | | 0 | | 0 | | 0 | | 0 | | 14 | | 2.5 | | 2.5 | | 11.6 | | 3.7 | | 18.3 | | 5.1 | | 5.0 | | 4.8 | | 30 | | 3.4 | | 22.2 | | 3.1 | | 0 | | 0 | | 0 | | 0 | | 0 | | 0 | | 30 | | 0 | | 2.2 | | 5.8 | | 3.1 | | 9.7 | | 5.0 | | 2.6 | | 5.3 | | 18.1 | | 3.3 | | 16.8 | | 3.9 | | 0 | | 0 | | 0 | | 0 | | 0 | | 0 Figure 1: ELISA Reacting antibody from immunized cynomolgus macaque with inactivated Zika vaccine strain ZIKV SV0010/15 | | Time (day post inoculation) | | Monkey | | Immunized group (1) | | Negative control group (2) | | 1/1 | | | | 1/2 | | 1/3 | | 1/4 | | 1/5 | | 1/6 | | 2/1 | | 2/2 | | 2/3 | | | | Z1(3) | | Z2(4) | | Z1 | | Z2 | | Z1 | | Z2 | | Z1 | | Z2 | | Z1 | | Z2 | | Z1 | | Z2 | | Z1 | | Z2 | | Z1 | | Z2 | | Z1 | | Z2 | | 0 | | <10(5) | | <10 | | <10 | | <10 | | <10 | | <10 | | <10 | | <10 | | <10 | | <10 | | <10 | | <10 | | <10 | | <10 | | <10 | | <10 | | <10 | | <10 | | 60 | | 11 | | 18 | | 273 | | 320 | | 12 | | 20 | | 91 | | 149 | | 26 | | 33 | | 10 | | 21 | | <10 | | <10 | | <10 | | <10 | | <10 | | <10 | | 180 | | 16 | | <10 | | 244 | | 172 | | 18 | | <10 | | 87 | | 120 | | 12 | | 24 | | 20 | | 13 | | <10 | | <10 | | <10 | | <10 | | <10 | | <10 Figure 2: Immunogenicity of Inactivated Zika vaccine candidate (ZIKV strain SV0010/15) in Monkey by Plaque Reduction Neutralization Test 50 % (PRNT50) Legend: (1) = They had injected by Inactivated ZIKV vaccine strain SV0010/15; (2) = They had injected by adjuvant and PBS7.4; (3) = Neutralized by ZIKV strain SV0010/15 strain); (5) PRNT value Also, the neutralizing antibody were observed on day 60 and day 180 against ZIKV strain SV0010/15 (homologous strain) and ZIKV strain MR766 strain (heterologous strain) with about 31, 48 and 14, 34 respectively (Figure 2). | | Group (1) | | Monkey code | | Virus detection (2) | | Virus isolation (Virus titration) (3) | | Viremia (day) | | I | | 1/1 | | - | | - | | - | | | | 1/2 | | - | | - | | - | | | | 1/3 | | - | | - | | - | | II | | 1/4 | | - | | - | | - | | | | 1/5 | | - | | - | | - | | | | 1/6 | | - | | - | | - | | III (4) | | 2/1 | | + | | + (2.1 log10) | | 183 | | | | 2/2 | | + | | + (1.8 log10) | | 184 | | | | | | 2/3 | | + | | + (2.3 log10) | | 183 Table 2 Virus detection, isolation and titration after Challenging test in Cynomolgus monkeys Legend: (1) = Group I and III were respectively challenged with ZIKV strain SV0010/15 (homologous strain) while Group II specimens were challenged by with ZIKV strain MR766 (heterologous strain); (2) Virus detection by RT PCR; (3) Virus isolation by C6/36, IFA and Virus titration by Plaque assay; (4) Positive control challenge group; Ultimately, all vaccinated monkeys were completely protected against ZIKV challenge by two strains of ZIKV, as demonstrated by the lack of detection of viral RNA in the serum samples but excepted the sham control macaques (Table 2). These preclinical results in small animal model showed the safety (dose) and immunogenicity of the inactivated Zika vaccine. The experiments in macaques confirmed the prior results in mice and could be extend them to Non-Human Primate model using vaccine doses and an administration route applicable to humans. Also, the optimized Zika vaccine adjuvanted with AlOOH provided complete 100% protection against two strains of Zika virus of Cynomolgus macaques 6 months after immunization. No specific adverse effects related to the vaccine was reported based on local and systemic observations [22]. Seroconversion was shown in all macaques including IgG/IgM while neutralizing antibody responses remained detectable at 6 months post immunization. This candidate vaccine is the first-generation Zika vaccine in Thailand. Also, it is compliant and deliver a high-quality vaccine. This new inactivated ZIKV vaccine quality candidate has a potential to be developed up to GMP pilot scale. Combined with its excellent performance in animal models this indicates that the vaccine would be appropriate for an accelerated development based on public demand.
