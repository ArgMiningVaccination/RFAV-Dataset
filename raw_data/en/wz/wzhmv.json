[Science & Tech](/Science-Tech) medicine](/science/complementary-and-alternative-medicine) homeopathy, also spelled homoeopathy, a system of [therapeutics](https://www.britannica.com/science/therapeutics), notably popular in the 19th century, which was founded on the stated principle that \"like cures like,\" similia similibus curantur, and which prescribed for patients drugs or other [treatments](https://www.britannica.com/dictionary/treatments) that would produce in healthy persons symptoms of the diseases being treated. This system of therapeutics based upon the \"law of similars\" was introduced in 1796 by the German physician [Samuel Hahnemann](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Samuel-Hahnemann). He claimed that a large dose of [quinine](https://www.britannica.com/science/quinine), which had been widely used for the successful treatment of [malaria](https://www.britannica.com/science/malaria), produced in him effects similar to the symptoms of malaria patients. He thus concluded that all diseases were best treated by drugs that produced in healthy persons effects similar to the symptoms of those diseases. He also undertook experiments with a variety of drugs in an effort to prove this. Hahnemann believed that large doses of drugs aggravate illness and that the [efficacy](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/efficacy) of medicines thus increases with dilution. Accordingly, most homeopathists believed in the action of minute doses of [medicine](https://www.britannica.com/science/medicine). To many patients and some physicians, homeopathy was a mild, welcome [alternative](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/alternative) to bleeding, purging, polypharmacy, and other heavy-handed therapies of the day. In the 20th century, however, homeopathy was viewed with little favour and was criticized for focusing on the symptoms rather than on the underlying causes of disease. Homeopathy still has some adherents, and there are a number of national and international societies, including the International Homoeopathic Medical League, headquartered in [K\u00f6then](https://www.britannica.com/place/Kothen), Germany.
