CLEARED FOR PUBLIC RELEASEREQUIRED INFORMATION FOR EFFECTIVE INFECTIOUS DISEASE OUTBREAK RESPONSE SARS- CoV-2 (COVID -19) Updated 11/17/2020 CLEARED FOR PUBLIC RELEASE 1 Table of Contents Infectious Dose - How much agent will make a healthy individual ill? ................................................................................... 3 The human infectious dose of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS -CoV-2) is unknown by all exposure routes. Based on experimental studies with humans exposed to other coronaviruses and animals exposed to SARS -CoV-2, the dose at which 50% of humans become infected is likely between 10 and 1,000 plaque -forming units (PFU). We need to know the infectious dose for huma ns by all possible exposure routes in order to inform models, develop diagnostics and countermeasures, and inform disinfection efforts. Transmissibility - How does it spread from one host to another? How easily is it spread? ..................................................... 4 SARS- CoV-2 is passed easily between humans (R 0 = 2.2 -3.1, k = 0.2 -0.7), through close contact and aerosol transmission.39, 89, 270, 471 Vertical transmission from mother to fetus is possible198, 682 but rare.650 Individuals can transmit SARS -CoV-2 to others while asymptomatic or pre -symptomatic. Household transmission is rapid, but clusters from social settings are larger than those occurring in households.20 Superspreading events (SSEs) appear common in SARS -CoV-2 transmission and may be crucial for controlling spread. Rates of transmission on public transit are unclear but appear low,256 but the US CDC recommends masks during travel.611 The role of children in disease transmission is not well -understood, but confirmed pedia tric cases in the US are increasing.15 Undetected cases play a major role in transmission,396 and most cases are not reported.328, 587, 617 Individuals who have clinically recovered but test p ositive for COVID -19 are unlikely to be infectious.409, 749 We need to know the relative contribution of different routes of transmission (e.g., fomites, aerosols, droplets). Host Range - How many species does it infect? Can it transfer from species to species? ........................................................ 5 SARS- CoV-2 is closely related to other coronaviruses circulating in bats in Southeast Asia. Previous coronaviruses have passed through an intermediate mammal host before infecting humans, but the presence or identity of the SARS -CoV-2 intermediate host is unknown.399, 413, 415 Current evidence suggests a direct jump from bats to humans is plausible.78 SARS- CoV-2 uses the same receptor for cell entry as the SARS -CoV-1 coronavirus that circulated in 2002/2003. Animals can transmit SARS -CoV-2 to humans. Several animal species are susceptible to SARS -CoV-2 infection. We need to know the best animal model for replicating human infection by various exposure routes. Incubation Period - How long after infection do symptoms appear? Are people infectious during this time? ........................ 6 On average, symptoms develop 5 days after exposure with a range of 2 -14 days. Incubating individuals can transmit disease for several days before symptom onset. Some individuals never develop symptoms but c an still transmit disease. It is estimated that most individuals are no longer infectious beyond 10 days after symptom onset. The average time between symptom onset in successive cases (i.e., the serial interval) is approximately 5 days. Individuals can shed virus for several weeks, though it is not necessarily infectious. We need to know the incubation duration and length of infec tivity in different patient populations. Clinical Presentation - What are the signs and symptoms of an infected person? .................................................................. 7 Most symptomatic cases are mild, but severe disease can be found in any age group.10 Older individuals and those with underlying conditions are at higher risk of serious illness and death, as are men.508 Fever is most often the first symptom. Between 16% and 76% of cases are asymptomatic throughout the course of their infection.92, 95, 368, 379, 386, 462, 491, 507, 639, 658 The case fatality rate is unknown, but individuals >60 and those with comorbidities are at elevated risk of death.649, 772 Minority populations are disproportionately affected by COVID -19.470 Children are susceptible to COVID -19,181 though generally show milder128, 428 or no symptoms. We need to know the true case fatality rate, as well as the duration and prevalence of debilitating symptoms. Protective Immunity - How long does the immune response provide protection from reinfection? ....................................... 8 Infected patients show productive immune responses, but the duration of any protection is unknown.33, 720 Reinfection is possible. The longevity of antibody responses and T -cell responses is unknown but appears to be at least several months. Reinfection with SARS -CoV-2 is possible, but the frequency of reinfection is unknown. The contribution of historical coronavirus exposure to SARS -CoV-2 immunity is unknown.484 Immune responses appear to differ by sex and age, and may contribute to differences in symptom severity. We need to know the frequency and severity of reinfection, as well as the protective effects of immune components. Clinical Diagnosis - Are there tools to diagnose infected individuals? When during infection are they effective? ................... 9 Diagnosis of COVID -19 is based on symptoms consistent with COVID -19, PCR -based testing of active cases, and/or the presence of SARS -CoV-2 antibodies in individuals. Screening solely by temperature or other symptoms is unreliable. Validated serological (antibody) assays are being used to help determine who has been exposed to SARS -CoV-2. We need to identify additional factors that affect the accuracy of serological or PCR -based dia gnostic tests. Medical Treatments - Are there effective treatments? .........................................................................................................10 There is no universally effective treatment for COVID -19, but some treatments reduce disease severity and mortality. Remdesivir may reduce symptom duration in hospitalized patients, but there is no evidence that it reduces mortality. REQUIRED INFORMATION FOR EFFECTIVE INFECTIOUS DISEASE OUTBREAK RESPONSE SARS- CoV-2 (COVID -19) Updated 11/17/2020 CLEARED FOR PUBLIC RELEASE 2 Hydroxychloroquine provides limited to no clinical benefit.218, 602 Corticosteroids may significantly reduce mortality in severely ill and ventilated patients, especially if given early.657 Convalescent plasma treatment is safe and appears to be effective when administered early, though evidence is mixed.525 Anticoagulants may reduce COVID -19 mortality in hospitalized patients. The benefits of tocilizumab are unclear. Other pharmaceutical interventions are being investigated but results from large clinical trials are needed. We need clear, randomized trials for treatment efficacy in patients with both severe and mild/moderate illness. Vaccines - Are there effective vaccines? ...............................................................................................................................11 Work is ongoing to develop and produce a SARS -CoV-2 vaccine , and early Phase III trial results are promising. Globally, there are 6 vaccine candidates that have received broad use approval or Emergency Use Authorization. We need published results from Phase I -III trials in humans to assess vaccine efficacy and safety, and length of immunity. Non- pharmaceutical Intervent ions (NPIs) - Are public health control measures effective at reducing spread? .....................12 Broad -scale control measures such as stay -at-home orders and widespread face mask use effectively reduce transmission and are more impactful when implemented simultaneously. Public health notifications increase adherence to policies.225 Individual behaviors (e.g., face masks, social distancing) have been associated with reduced risk of COVID -19 infection.526 Due to the importance of superspreading events in COVID -19 transmission, particular focus should be placed on minimizing large gatherings where superspreading events are more likely.727 Research is needed to plan the path to SARS -CoV-2 elimination via pharmaceutical and non -pharmaceutical interventions. We need to understand me asures that will limit spread in the winter, particularly in indoor environments. Environmental Stability - How long does the agent live in the environment? .......................................................................13 SARS- CoV-2 can survive on surfaces from hours to days and is stable in air for at least several hours, depending on the presence of UV light, temperature, and h umidity. Environmental contamination is not thought to be the principal mode of SARS- CoV-2 transmission in humans. SARS- CoV-2 survival in the air is highly dependent on the presence of UV light and temperature. There is currently no evidence that SARS -CoV-2 is transmitted to people through food. We need to quantify the duration of SARS -CoV-2 infectivity on surfaces, not simply the presence of RNA. Decontamination - What are effective methods to kill the agent in the environment? .........................................................14 Soap and water, as well as com mon alcohol and chlorine -based cleaners, hand sanitizers, and disinfectants are effective at inactivating SARS -CoV-2 on hands and surfaces. Several methods exist for decontaminating N95 respirators496 and other PPE. We need additional SARS -CoV-2 decontamination studies, particularly with regard to PPE and other items in short supply. PPE - What PPE is effective, and who should be using it? .....................................................................................................15 Face masks appear effective at reducing infections from SARS -CoV-2. Healthcare workers are at high risk of acquiring COVID - 19, even with recommended PPE. We need to continue assessing PPE effectiveness with specific regard to SARS -CoV-2 instead of surrogates. Forensics - Natural vs intentional use? Tests to be used for attribution. ...............................................................................16 All current evidence supports the natural emergence of SARS -CoV-2 via a bat and possible intermediate ma mmal species. We need to know whether there was an intermediate host species between bats and humans. Genomics - How does the disease agent compare to previous strains? .................................................................................17 Current evidence suggests that SARS -CoV-2 accumulates mutations at a similar rate as other coronaviruses. At least one m utation has been associated with greater viral transmission, but virulence appears unchanged. A second SARS -CoV-2 variant is being assessed for its ability to evade the human immune system. Associations between human blood type and COVID -19 severity are unclear, but certain human genome regions are associated with more severe disease. There is some concern regarding SARS -CoV-2 strains involved in continued huma n and mink transmission . We need to link genotypes to phenotypes (e.g., disease severity) in infected patients. Forecasting - What forecasting models and methods exist? ................................................................................................. 18 We need to know how different forecasting methods have fared when compared to real data and develop an understanding of which model features contribute most to accurate and inaccurate forecasts. REQUIRED INFORMATION FOR EFFECTIVE INFECTIOUS DISEASE OUTBREAK RESPONSE SARS- CoV-2 (COVID -19) Updated 11/17/2020 CLEARED FOR PUBLIC RELEASE 3 What do we know? Infectious Dose - How much agent will make a healthy individual ill? The human infectious dose of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS -CoV-2) is unknown by all exposure routes. Based on experimental studies with humans exposed to other coronaviruses and animals exposed to SARS -CoV-2, the dose at which 50% of humans become infected is likely between 10 and 1,000 plaque -forming units ( PFU). The UK plans to conduct human exposure trials in January 2021 to identify the infectious dose of SARS -CoV-2.79 Non-human primates A total dose of approximately 700,000 plaque -forming units (PFU) of the novel coronavirus SARS -CoV-2 infected macaques via combination total dose).578 Rhesus and cynomolgus macaques showed mild to moderate clinical infections at doses of 4.75x106 PFU (delivered through several routes), while marmosets developed mild infections when exposed to 1x106 PFU intranasally.425 Rhesus macaques are effectively via the ocular conjunctival and intratracheal route TCID 50).169 Rhesus macaques infected -CoV-2 by the intranasal, intratracheal, oral and ocular routes combined recapitulate moderate human Rhesus macaques ocular inoculation TCID 50), resulting in mild infection; however, gastric inoculation did not result in infection (same dose), suggesting a limited role of gastric transmission. Interpretation is limited due to the small scale.168 African green monkeys replicate aspects of human disease, including severe pathological symptoms (exposed to 500,000 PFU via intrana sal and intratracheal routes),730 mild clinical symptoms (aerosol exposures between 5,000 and 16,000 PFU),284 and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), with small particle aerosol exposure doses as low as 2,000 PFU.76 Aerosol exposure of three primate species (African green monkeys, cynomolgus macaques, and rhesus macaques) via a Collison nebulizer resulted in mild clinical disease in all animals with doses between 28,700 and 48,600 PFU.327 Rhesus macaques have been suggested as the best non -human primate model of human COVID -19.424 Rodents and other animal models Low-dose intranasal inoculation of ferrets (2,000 PFU) and Golden Syrian hamsters (1,800 PFU) with SARS -CoV-2 resulted in mild clinical symptoms, the production of infectious virus, and seroconversion.464 Golden Syrian hamsters exposed to 80,000 TCID 50 (~56,000 PFU) via the intranasal route developed clinical symptoms reminiscent of mild human infections (all hamsters i nfected).613 In a separate study, immunosuppressed Golden Syrian hamsters showed severe clinical symptoms (including death) after exposure to 100 -10,000 PFU via intranasal challenge.88 Golden Syrian hamsters infected with 100,000 PFU intranasally exhibited mild clinical symptoms and developed neutralizing antibodies,123 and were also capable of infecting individuals in separate cages. In another study, older hamsters had more severe symptoms and developed fewer neutralizing antibodies than younger hamsters.508 Mice genetically modified to express the human ACE2 receptor (transgenic hACE2 mice) were inoculated intranasally with 100,000 TCID 50 (~70,000 PFU), and all mice developed pathological symptoms consistent with COVID -19.59 Transgenic (hACE2) mice became infected after timed aerosol exposure (36 TCID 50/minute) to between 900 and 1080 TCID 50 (~630- 756 PFU). All mice (4/4) exposed for 25- 30 minutes became infected, while no mice (0/8) became infected after exposure for 0 -20 minutes (up to 720 TCID 50, ~504 PFU).60 This paper has methodological caveat s (e.g., particle size). Transgenic (hACE2) mice exposed intranasally to 400,000 PFU of SARS -CoV-2 typical human of SARS -CoV-2 by the intranasal route show similar symptoms to human diseas e.343, 571 Uninfected ferrets in direct contact with infected ferrets test positive and show disease as early as 2 days post -contact.343 In one study, direct contact was required to transfer infection between ferrets,343 however, transmission without direct contact was found in another study.571 In a separate ferret study, 1 in 6 individuals exposed to 102 PFU via the intranasal route became infected, while 12 out of 12 individuals exposed to >104 PFU became infected.588 Domestic cats exposed to 100,000 PFU of SARS -CoV-2 via the intranasal route developed severe pathological symptoms including lesions in the nose, throat, an d lungs.611 Even without symptoms, cats were able to transmit to other cats.80 Related Coronaviruses Humans exposed intranasally infectious dose of seasonal coronavirus 229E is unknown in humans. The infectious dose for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 1 (SARS -CoV-1) in mice is estimated to be between 67-540 PFU (average 240 PFU, intranasal route).159, 162 Genetically modified mice exposed intranasally to Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS -CoV) between 100 - 500,000 PFU show signs of infection. Infection with higher doses result in severe syndromes.24, 144, 391, 765 What do we need to know? We need to know the infectious dose for humans by all possible exposure routes in order to inform models, develop diagnostics and countermeasures, and inform disinfection eff orts. Human infectious dose by aerosol, surface contact (fomite), fecal -oral routes, and other potential routes of exposure Most appropriate animal model(s) to estimate the human infectious dose for SARS -CoV-2 Does exposure dose determine disease severity? REQUIRED INFORMATION FOR EFFECTIVE INFECTIOUS DISEASE OUTBREAK RESPONSE SARS- CoV-2 (COVID -19) Updated 11/17/2020 CLEARED FOR PUBLIC RELEASE 4 Transmissibility - How does it spread from one host to another? How easily is it spread? What do we know? SARS -CoV-2 is passed easily between humans (R 0 = 2.2 -3.1, k = 0.2-0.7), through close contact and aerosol transmission.39, 89, 270, 469 Vertical transmission from mother to fetus is possible198, 680 but rare.648 As of 11 /17/2020 , pandemic COVID -19 has caused at least 55,192 ,409 infection s and 1,330 ,205 deaths globally.323 In the US, there have been 11,2 14,231 confirmed COVID -19 cases and 247, 356 confirmed deaths ,323 though both cases36 and fatalities are underesti mate s.499, 729 Estimates of human transmissibility (R 0) range from 2.2 to 3.1 .434, 516, 575, 739, 764 The US CDC and WHO acknowledge that SARS -CoV-2 can spread via aerosol or \"airborne\" transmission beyond 6 ft in certain situations722 such as enclosed spaces with inadequate ventilation.112 The CDC advises that most SARS -CoV-2 transmission is spread by larger respiratory droplets, not by small -particle aerosols ,112 though the distinct ion is loose.699 Infectious virus aerosols have been found at varying concentrations (6 to 74 TCID 50/L381 or 9 to 219 RNA copies/m3 772). The US CDC defines \"close contact\" as a combined total of 15 minutes within 6 feet of a n infected person in a 24 -hour period , regardless of whether either person was wearing a mask (e.g., cloth face covering , KN95 or N95 respirator ).109 Exhaled breath may emit 105-107 genome copies per person per hour;431 the amount of infectious v irus remains unknown. The risk of infection from fomites is believed to be low, though estimating contact hazard risk from estimated genome copies on surfaces (e.g., 2.5 -105 copies/cm2) is subject to considerable uncertainty.285 Individuals can transmit SARS -CoV-2 to others while asymptomatic or pre -symptomatic. Individuals may be infectious for 1 -3 days prior to symptom onset.48, 705 Pre-symptomatic77, 349, 621, 631, 744, 768 or asymptomatic56, 301, 430 patients can transmit SARS -CoV-2.419 At least 12% of all cases are estimated to be due to asymptomatic transmission.185 Approximately 40%566 (between 15 -56%) of infections may be caused by pre -symptomatic transmission.101, 288, 416, 763 Individuals are most infectious before symptoms begin and within 5 days of symptom onset.130 Asymptomatic individuals can transmit disease as soon as 2 days after infection.630 There is some evidence that asymptomatic individuals transmit SARS -CoV-2 less often than symptomatic individuals ,92, 641 and a symptomatic children may have substantially lower levels of virus in their upper respiratory tracts than symptomatic children.346 House hold transmission is rapid, but clusters from social settings are larger than those occurring in households.20 Meta -analysis indicates that approximately 18% of household contacts of infected index patients acquire SARS -CoV-2 (i.e., the \"attack rate\"), with higher attack rates for symptomatic index cases, spouses of index cases, and adults.347 In the US, symptomatic index cases resulted in transmission to approximatel y 53% of household members, regardless of index patient age.267 This is higher than prior estimates,347 likely due to intense follow -up reporting .267 75% of household infections occurred within 5 days of illness onset in the index case.267 Attack rates are lower for non -household contacts.483 SARS- CoV-2 may be spread by conversation and exhalation14, 389, 595, 623 in indoor areas such as restaurant s;399 positive SARS - CoV-2 patients were twice as likely as negative patients to report that they had recently eaten in restaurants226 or worked in an office.221 Clusters are often associated with large indoor gatherings,380, 517 including bars, restaurants ,755 and gyms.126 Superspreading events (SSEs) appear common in SARS -CoV-2 transmission and may be crucial for controlling spread. The majority of new infections come from relatively few infectious individuals (overdispersion parameter k = 0 .2-0.5),19, 193, 374, 378, 691 though estimates vary.286 Phylogenetics shows the import ance of SSEs early in the COVID -19 outbreak.691 Rates of transmission on public transit are unclear but appear low ,256 but the US CDC recommends masks during travel.609 Several studies have identified plausible transmission on airplanes .55, 137, 291, 339, 476 Fluorescent tracer research on commercial airplanes suggests a low risk of aerosol or surface transmission during flights, though key parameters (emission rate, infectious dose) remain uncertain.614 Testing for this study assumed that mask wearing is continuous, the number of infected passengers is low, and passengers only face forward. The testing did not consider pas senger movement, passenger conversations, or infected flight attendants.614 On trains in China, transmission rates were high for those in the same row as an infectious individual (1.5 -3.5% attack rate), though low for non -neighboring passengers.297 Outbreaks have also occurred on public buses.429 The role of children in disease transmission is not well- understood, but confirmed pediatric cases in the US are increasing .15 A large meta -analysis estimates that children are 44% less susceptible to COVID -19 than adults,678 though modeling suggests that susceptibility does not differ substantially by age.500 During April to May 2020 in the US, adults who worked in childcare centers acquired COVID -19 at rates similar to those without c hildcare exposure.252 Adults in the UK living with children did not have elevated risk of COVID -19 infection,235 though schools were closed for much of this time period (February -August) .2 Extensive contact tracing in India suggests that children readily transmit SARS -CoV-2 to other children.378 In a Georgia summer camp, 260 of 344 tested attendees (campers and staff) tested positive for SARS -CoV-2 RNA.636 Undete cted cases play a major role in transmission,394 and most cases are not reported.326, 585, 615 Individuals who have clinically recovered but test positive for COVID -19 are unlikely to be infectious.407, 747 What do we need to know? We need to know the relative contribution of different routes of transmission (e.g., fomites, aerosols, droplets). How common is transmission from bodily fluids li ke semen,390 urine,632 and feces?668 How infectious are young children compared to adults? What is the emission rate of infectious SARS -CoV-2 particles while breathing, talking, coughing, singing, or exercising, taking into account variation in viral load in the upper and lower respiratory tract? REQUIRED INFORMATION FOR EFFECTIVE INFECTIOUS DISEASE OUTBREAK RESPONSE SARS- CoV-2 (COVID -19) Updated 11/17/2020 CLEARED FOR PUBLIC RELEASE 5 Host Range - How many species does it i nfect? Can it transfer from species to species? What do we know? SARS -CoV-2 is closely related to other coronaviruses circulating in bats in Southeast Asia. Previous coronaviruses have passed through an intermediate mammal host before infecting humans, but the presence or identity of the SARS -CoV-2 intermediate host is unknown.397, 411, 413 Current evidence suggests a direct jump from bats to humans is plausible.78 Early genomic analysis indicates similarity to SARS -CoV-1,773 with a suggested bat origin.146, 773 Positive samples from the South China Seafood Market strongly suggests a wildlife source,116 though it is possible that the virus was circulating in humans before the disease was associated with the seafood market.65, 147, 742, 754 Viruses similar to SARS -CoV-2 were present in pangol in samples collected several years ago,365 and pangolins positive for coronaviruses related to SARS -CoV-2 exhibited clinical symptoms such as cough and shortness of breath.396 However, a survey of 334 pangolins did not identify c oronavirus nucleic acid in 'upstream' market chain samples, suggesting that positive samples from pangolins may be the result of exposure to infected humans, wildlife or other animals within the wildlife trade network. These data suggest that pangolins are incidental hosts of coronaviruses.383 SARS -CoV-2 uses the same receptor for cell entry as the SARS -CoV-1 coronavirus that c irculated in 2002/2003. Experiments show that SARS -CoV-2 Spike (S) receptor- binding domain binds the human cell receptor (ACE2) stronger than SARS- CoV-1,733 potentially explaining its high transmissibility. Changes in proteolytic cleavage of the Spike protein can also affect cell entry and animal host range, in addition to recepto r binding.451 Modeling suggests a wide range of animal hosts for SARS -CoV-2, though experimental studies are still needed.155 Animals can transmit SARS -CoV-2 to humans. Infected mink have been linked to human infections in workers at mink farms.509 Several animal species are susceptible to SARS -CoV-2 infection. Animal model studies suggest that Golden Syrian hamsters and ferrets are susceptible to infection.123, 343 In the Nethe rlands, farmed mink developed breathing and gastrointestinal issues, which was diagnosed as SARS -CoV-2 infection.1 SARS -CoV-2 cases in mink on US farms show high mortality rates, and farms have implemented strict biosecurity measures.368 Several non -human primates are also susceptible to infection with SARS -CoV-2 including cynomolgus macaques,578 African green monkeys,730 and Rhesus macaques.425 Raccoon dogs (mammals related to foxes) are susceptible to COVID -19 (105 intranasal exposure dose) and were shown to transmit infection to other raccoon dogs in neighboring enclosur es.238 Domestic cats are susceptible to infection with SARS -CoV-2 (100,000- 520,000 PFU via the intranasal route611 or a combination of routes277), and can transmit the virus to other cats via droplet or short -distance aerosol.611 Wild cats (tigers and lions)703 can be infected with SARS -CoV-2, although their ability to spread to humans is unknown.436, 760 Studies have c onfirmed that human keepers transmitted SARS -CoV-2 to tigers and lions at the Bronx Zoo.64 Two cases of SARS- CoV-2 infection have been confirmed in pet domestic cats.106 Deer mice can be experimentally infected with SARS -CoV-2 via intranasal exposure (104 or 105 TCID 50)199 and are able to transmit virus to uninfected deer mice through direct contact.264 Their capacity as a reservoir species is unknown. Ducks, chickens, and pigs remained uninfected after experimental SARS -CoV-2 exposure (30,000 CFU for ducks and chickens611, 100,000 PFU for pigs611, for pigs all intranasal route).611 When pigs were inoculated by the oronasal route (106 PFU), minimal to no signs of clinical disease were noted, suggesting limited transmission concerns.534 Chicken, turkey, duck, quail, and geese were not susceptible to SARS -CoV-2 after experimental exposures.629 Rabbits do not exhibit clinical symptoms after exposure to SARS -CoV-2, but do seroconvert.477 Cattle exposed to SARS -CoV-2 showed no clinical disease but exhibited low levels of viral shedding in the nose, which could be residual virus from the exposure dose.663 Dogs exposed to SARS -CoV-2 produced anti -SARS -CoV-2 antibodies81 but exhibited no clinical symptoms.611, 619 What do we need to know? We need to know the best animal model for replicating human infection by various exposure routes. What is the intermediate host(s) (if any)? Which animal species can transmit SARS -CoV-2 to humans? Can SARS -CoV-2 circulate in animal reservoir populations, potentially leading to future spillover events?

Are people infectious during this time? What do we know? On average, symptoms develop 5 days after exposure with a range of 2 -14 days. Incubating individuals can transmit disease for several days before symptom onset. Some individuals never develop symptoms but can still transmit disease. By general consensus, the incubation period of COVID -19 is between 5375 and 6706 days.748 Fewer than 2.5% of infec ted individuals show symptoms sooner than 2 days after exposure.375 However, more recent estimates using different models calculate a longer incubation period, between 7 and 8 days.545 This could mean that 5 -10% of individuals undergoing a 14 - day quarantine are still infectious at the end.545 There is evidence that younger (<14) and older (>75) individuals have longer COVID -19 incubation periods, creating a U - shaped relationship between inc ubation period length and patient age350 while adolescent and young adult populations (15 - 24 years old) have been estimated at ~2 days.402 Individuals can test positive for COVID -19 even if they lack clinical symptoms.56, 122, 271, 647, 768 Individuals can be infectious while asymptomatic,113, 582, 647, 768 and asymptomatic and pre -symptomatic individuals have similar amounts of virus in the nose and throat compared to symptomatic patients.48, 341, 778 Peak infectiousness may be during the incubation period, one day before symptoms develop.288 Infectious virus has been cultured in patients up to 6 days before the development of symptoms.48 It is estimated that most individuals are no longer infectious beyond 10 days after symptom onset. While the amount of virus needed to infect another individual is unknown, mild -moderate COVID -19 cases appear to be infectious for no longer than 10 days aft er symptom onset, while severely ill or immunocompromised patients may be infectious for 20 -7052 days after symptom onset; individuals can also transmit infection before symptoms appear.685 Asymptomatic individuals are estimated to be infectious for a median of 9.5 days.298 The average time between symptom onset in successive cases (i.e., the serial interval) is approximately 5 days. On average, there are approximately 4185 to 7.5392 days between symptom onset in successive cases of a single transmission chain (i.e., the serial interval). Based on data from 339 transmission chains in China and additional meta -analysis, the mean serial interval is between 4.4 and 6.0 days.184, 550, 748 The serial interval of COVID -19 has declined substantially over time as a result of increased case isolation,29 meaning individuals tend to transmit virus for less time. Individuals can shed virus for several weeks, though it is not necessarily infectious. Children are estimated to shed virus for 15 days on average, with asymptomatic individuals shedding virus for less time (11 days) than symptomatic individuals (17 days).428 Asymptomatic and mildly ill patients who test positive for SARS -CoV-2 take less time to test negative than severely ill patients.384 Patients infected by asymptomatic or young (<20 years old) individuals may take longer to develop sym ptoms than those infected by other groups of individuals.706 Viral RNA loads in the upper respiratory tract tend to peak within a few days of symptom onset and become undetectable approximately two weeks after symptoms begin.684 The duration of the infectious period is unknown,684 though patients can test positive for SARS -CoV-2 viral RNA for extended periods of time, particularly in stool samples.684 Patients being released from the hospital may still exhale detectable levels of SARS -CoV-2 RNA (~7,000 genome copies per hour), though the infectivity of these patients is unknown.772 What do we need to know? We need to know the incubation duration and length of infectivity in different patient populations. What is the average infectious period during which individuals can transmit the disease? How soon can asymptomatic patients transmit infection after exposure? Does the incubation period correlate with disease severity or exposure dose?

What do we know? Most symptomatic cases are mild, but severe disease can be found in any age group.10 Older individuals and those with underlying conditions are at higher risk of serious illness and death, as are men.506 Fever is most often the first symptom. COVID -19 generally begins with fever, then cough and malaise.369 In 49 children with COVID -19 (0- 22 years), however, only 51% developed fever.752 Only 20% of emergency department patients testing positive for COVID -19 had fevers >100\u00b0 F.677 Most symptomatic COVID -19 cases are mild (81%).647, 723 Initial COVID -19 symptoms include fever (87.9% ),46, 271 cough (67.7%),271 fatigue, and shortness of breath.114, 127, 299 Initial cough without fever may precede mild/moderate illness.400 Chills, muscle pain,475 sore throat, and loss of taste or smell119, 524, 745 are also possible COVID -19 symptoms.114 Gastrointestinal symptoms are present in approximately 9% of patients.580 Neurologic al symptoms occur in up to 82% of individuals hospitalized with COVID -19.406 Headaches are common, may persist for weeks, and may be associated with shorter disease duration.100 Approximately 15% of hospitalized patients are classified as severe,271, 647 and approximately 5% of patients are admitted to the ICU.271, 647 Higher SARS -CoV-2 RNA loads on admission have been associated with greater risk of death.432, 713 SARS- CoV-2 may attack blood vessels in the lung,94 leading to clotting complications and ARDS.18, 671 Clotting affects multiple organs554 and is present in 15 -27% of cases.427 Other comp lications include pneumonia,513 cardiac injury (20%),612 secondary infection, kidney damage,47, 628 pancreatitis,34 arrhythmia, sepsis, stroke (1.6% of hospitalized patients),453 other respiratory complications ,665 and shock.271, 299, 687, 770 COVID -19 may increase stroke complications.530 COVID -19 symptoms like fatigue and shortness of breath commonly persist for weeks646 to months99 after initial onset. M ost (88%) individuals infected with COVID -19 (n=86) showed evidence of lung damage six weeks after clinical recovery .272 This presentation may be distinct from acute COVID -19, and has been tentatively termed chronic COVID syndrome.57 Adults can experience adverse inflammatory conditions472 that increase disease severity and mortality.704 Kidney disease prior to COVID -19 infection may increase COVID -19 disease severity.495 Critically ill patients have consistently high viral loads in blood samples , indicating an inability to clear the virus.129 Approximately 18.1% of COVID -19 patients have been diagnosed with a psychiatric condition (e.g., anxiety, insomnia, dementia) within three months of COVID -19 illness.643 Approximately 9% of hospitalized patients experience at least 1 hospital readmission (from any cause) within 2 months of COVID -19 recovery, with individuals over 65 showing slightly higher odds of readmission.376 Between 16% and 76% of cases are asymptomatic throughout the course of their infection.92, 95, 366, 377, 384, 460, 489, 505, 637, 656 The case fatality rate is unknown, but individuals > 60 and those with comorbidities are at elevated risk of death.647, 770 Cardiovascular disease, obesity,21, 532 hypertension,758 diabetes, and respiratory conditions all increase the CFR.647, 770 The CFR increases with age (data from China and Italy): 0 -19 years < 0.2%; 20 -29 years = 0 -0.2%, 30- 39 years = 0.2 -0.3%, 40- 49 years = 0.4%, 50 -59 years 1.0 -1.3%, 60- 69 years = 3.5 -3.6%, 70- 79 years = 8.0 -12.8%, >80 years = 14.8- 20.2%.503 In Iceland, the overall CFR has been estimated at 0.3 -0.6% but increases to ~4% in those over 70 years old.273 An estimated overall infection fatality rate for Indiana was calculated as 0.26%, increasing to 1.71% for those >65 years old .75 Smoking appears to be statistically associated with a higher likelihood of COVID -19 progressing to more severe disease.521 Minority populations are disproportionately affected by COVID -19.468 Black, Asian, and Minority Ethnic populations acquire SARS -CoV-2 infection at higher rates than other groups230, 263, 512, 542 and are hospit alized246, 544 and die disproportionately.293, 454 Hispanic and Black COVID -19 patients tend to die at younger ages than white patients.732 Hispanic , Black , and American Indian childre n account ed for 78% of early US pediatri c deaths (n=121).74 Social vulnerability, particularly in non -urban areas, is associated with greater SARS -CoV-2 transmission risk.156 Pregnant women with COVID -1 9 appear to require ICU care more often than non -pregnant women,537 have higher rates of preterm delivery ,728 and are less likely to present with fever and myalgia.31 Severity in pregnant women may be associa ted with underlying conditions such as obesity ,31 and symptom severity may be predicted early.462 Preterm births are more likely in symptomatic patients.164 Approximately 25% of pregnant COVID -19 patients had symptoms for at least 8 weeks.23 Children are susceptible to COVID -19,181 though generally show milder128, 426 or no symptoms. Between 21-28% of children (<19 years old) may be asymptomatic.426, 519, 546 Most symptomatic children present with mild or moderate symptoms,262, 519 with few exhibiting severe or clinical illness.738 In the US, 33% of children hospitalized with COVID -19 required ICU care, though the CFR was low (1.8%).340 Severe symptoms in children415 and infants91, 426 are possible, and more likely in those with complex medical histories.607 WHO721 and US CDC322 have issued definitions for a rare condition in children (Pediatric Multi- System Inflammatory Syndrome, MIS -C)254 linked to COVID -19 infection.576 The prevalence of this condition is unknown. Children with both severe and moderate initial symptoms can progress to MIS -C,253 though it may be more likely to be preceded by fever.752 What do we need to know? We need to know the true case fatality rate, as well as the duration and prevalence of debilitating symptoms. How does the a symptomatic fraction vary across age groups? How long, on average, are affected individuals unable to perform normal jobs and responsibilities? We need to understand the mechanism and clinical implication of recurrent, \"long -haul\" COVID -19. REQUIRED INFORMATION FOR EFFECTIVE INFECTIOUS DISEASE OUTBREAK RESPONSE SARS- CoV-2 (COVID -19) Updated 11/17/2020 CLEARED FOR PUBLIC RELEASE 8 Protective Immunity - How long does the immune response provide protection from reinfection? What do we know? Infected patients show productive immune responses, but the duration of any protection is unknown.33, 718 Reinfection is possible. The longevity of antibody responses and T -cell responses is unknown but appears to be at least several mo nths. Researchers have found SARS -CoV-2 antibodies circulating in patients for 3 -6 months after infection.216, 273, 577, 579 Mild COVID -19 infections can induce detectable immune responses for at least 3 months .579 Antibody levels increas e with disease severit y653 and are largely unaffected by patient age.216 A UK study found evidence of antibody levels waning after 4 -6 months, though the study looked at population- level seroprevalence and not individual antibody levels.702 Neutralizing antibody re sponses are present within 8 -19 days after symptom onset418, 635 and can persist for months.683 Individuals with more severe infections developed higher neutralizing antibody levels that persisted longer than those with asymptomatic or mild infections.601 The antibody IgM appears to contribute substantially to SARS -CoV-2 neutraliz ing ability, with IgG also contributing to a lesser extent.248 Asymptomatic cases generate weaker antibody responses to SARS -CoV-2.136 Specific components of the immune response, such as IgG, may stimulate clotting factors that affect severity.780 Strong, early inflammatory immune responses are associated with more severe clinical presentation.165 There appear to be several distinct immunological phenotypes associated with COVID -19, with cytokine storm syndrome present in ~3 -4% of patients .473 A more common phenotype is characterized by a lack of Type I interferon response and general immunosuppression, which may help to explain variability in corticosteroid trea tment effects.473 Some patients do not develop detectable antibody responses,642, 736 and their future protection is unknown. A small study (n=4) identified that children (<3 years) can seroconvert after asymptomatic infection, but level of protectio n is unknown.334 SARS- CoV-2 specific memory B cells are involved in the human immune response, and provide evidence of B cell -mediated immunity after mild -moderate COVID -19 infection.497 T-cell responses may persist for at least 6 months, though they appear stronger in individuals with more severe COVID -19 cases.779 While memory B and T cells both persist for at least 6 months, there is some variability in the persistence of sp ecific antibodies (e.g., IgG vs. IgA). 241, 610 In a 35 -year study of 10 men, reinfection with seasonal coronaviruses occurred 1- 3 years after initial infection.190 Previous studies on coronavirus immunity suggest that neutralizing antibodies may wane after several years.96, 740 Reinfection with SARS -CoV-2 is possible, but the frequency of reinfection is unknown. Researchers in Hong Kong355 and the US652 have identified COVID -19 reinfections. Reinfections have been either less355 or more severe652 than the initial infection. The infectiousness of re -infected individuals is unknown. Two studies suggest limited reinfection potential in macaques, with re -challenge 28 days170 or 35 days125 after initial exposure resulting in no clinical symptoms. Ferrets infected with 102-104 PFU were protected from acute lung injury following secondary challenge with SARS -CoV-2 28 days after initial exposure, but they did exhibit clinical symptoms.588 The contribution of historical coronavirus exposure to SARS -CoV-2 immunity is unknown.482 Cross -reactivity in T -cell resp onses between other human coronaviruses and SARS -CoV-2 may explain some variation in symptom severity among patients.440 Key components of the human immune response (memory B cells) are activated by SARS- CoV-2, and may persist for decades to offset any waning antibody immunity.485 Cross -reactivity from season al coronaviruses also enhances the immune response toward the S2 unit of the SARS -CoV-2 Spike protein.485 Two studies identified key components of the adaptive immune system (CD4+ T cells) in the majority of recovered COVID -19 patients, and these cells reacted to SARS -CoV-2 Spike prote in.86, 266 These studies also identified Spike protein responses in CD4+ T cells of ~30 -40% of unexposed patients,266 suggesting some cross -reactivity between other circulating human coronaviruses and SARS -CoV-2.86, 266 Long -lasting T -cell responses have been seen in SARS -CoV-1 patients, and T -cell cross - reactivity between other coronaviruses and SARS -CoV-2 suggest additional immune protection.379 Children do not appear to be protected from SARS -CoV-2 infection by historical exposure to seasonal coronaviruses.602 Serum from patients exposed to seasonal coronaviruses did not neutralize SARS -CoV-2,541 though there has been some cross -reactivity between seasonal coronaviruses and SARS -CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) protein.658 Immune responses appear to differ by sex an d age and may contribute to differences in symptom severity. The immune responses of females differ s from males, namely through a stronger T -cell response and lower levels of some inflammatory cytokines .639 Additionally, antibody levels may differ between males and females, supporting the no tion that greater inflammatory responses in males contribute to their elevated disease severity.355 Symptom severity in adults does not appear to be due to a lack of an adaptive immune response; rather, early action of the innate immune response may affect disease severity in both adult and pediatric/adolescent cases.535 Children and adults have different immunological responses to SARS -CoV-2; adults with more severe symptoms develop stronger neutralizing antibody responses than those with milder symptoms, and this severity -dependence is not observed in children.708 Additionally, child ren do not develop robust antibody (IgG) responses to the SARS -CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) protein.708 What do we need to know? We need to know the frequency and severity of reinfection, as well as the protective effects of immune components. How do different components of the immune response contribute to long -term protection? How does initial disease severity affect the type, magnitude, and timing of any protective immune response? REQUIRED INFORMATION FOR EFFECTIVE INFECTIOUS DISEASE OUTBREAK RESPONSE SARS- CoV-2 (COVID -19) Updated 11/17/2020 CLEARED FOR PUBLIC RELEASE 9 Clinical Diagnosis - Are there tools to diagnose infected individuals? When during infection are they effective? What do we know? Diagnosis of COVID -19 is based on symptoms consistent with COVID -19, PCR -based testing of active cases, and/or the presence of SARS -CoV-2 antibodies in individuals. Screening solely by temperature or other symptoms is unreliable. The US CDC recommends that anyone, including those without symptoms, who has been in contact with a positive COVID -19 case should be tested (as of 9/18 /2020).120 The CDC advises that recovered patients need not be tested for SARS -COV -2 again within 3 months of recovery unless symptoms re -develop; this advice does not imply protection from re -infection.115 The timing of diagnostic PCR tests impacts results. The false -negative rate for RT -PCR tests is lowest between 7 and 9 days after exposure, and PCR tests are more likely to give false -negative results before symptoms b egin (within 4 days of exposure) and more than 14 days after exposure.360 Low viral loads can lead to false -negative RT -PCR tests, and viral loads are lower in late stage infections as well as at the end of a given day.410 The duration of PCR -detectable viral samples is longer in the lower than the upper respiratory tract; nasopharyngeal sampling is most effective (89%) between 0 and 4 days after symptom onset but falls signifi cantly (to 54%) by 10 to 14 days.437 After 10 days post-infection , alternative testing methods (e.g., lower respiratory samples) may be necessary.437 Symptom -based screening at airports was ineffective at detecting cases (9 identified out of 766,044 passengers screened),180 and intensive screening on a US military base during mandatory quarantine did not identify any COVID -19 cases.387 Nasal and pharyngeal swabs may sputum and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid,694 although evidence is mixed.724 Combination RT -PCR and serology (antibody) testing may increase the ability to diagnose patients with mild symptoms, or identify patients at higher risk of severe disease.766 Assays targeting antibodies against the nucleocapsid protein (N) instead of the Spike protein (S) of SARS -CoV-2 may improve detection.93 Exhaled breath condensate may be an effective supplement to nasopharyngeal swab -based PCR ,587 and other work examining breath -based samplers is ongoing.605 Diagnostic test results from at- home, mid -nasal swabs were comparable to clinician -conducted nasopharyngeal swabs, though false -negatives were observed in individuals with low viral titer.443 Foam swabs lead to more accurate diagnostic tests than polyester swabs for collecting patient samples, though polyester swabs are good enough to be used in case of a shortage in foam swabs.283 Asymptomatic individuals have a higher likelihood of testing negative for a specific antibody (IgG) compared to symptomatic patients, potentially due to l ower viral loads (as measured by RT -PCR).711 Tests from the US CDC are available to states.104, 113 Rapid test kits have been produced by universities and industry.68, 72, 154, 208, 675 The CRISPR -Cas12a system is being used to develop fluorescence -based COVID -19 diagnostic tests.178, 303, 692 India has approved a rapid CRISPR -based test paper capable of accurate results within an hour of nasopharyngeal swab.5 Low-sensitivity tests (like lateral flow assays) may be beneficial despite lower accuracy, because they reduce the time necessary to identify and subsequ ently contain potential outbreaks.455 Immu 287, 302, 536, 633, 688, 7 57 fasting blood glucose levels ,693 and oxygen levels345 can identify future severe cases,138 and decision -support tools for diagnosing severe infections exist .444, 617, 737 As of 20 October , the FDA has approved 281 tests under EUAs, including 219 molecular, 56 antibody, and 6 antigen tests ,233 including one for detecting neutralizing antibodies from prior SARS -CoV-2 infection.200 Pooling samples and conducting RT -PCR tests may expand testing capability.457 Detection dogs are being used at airports to recommend individuals for subsequent SARS -CoV-2 PCR testing.543 High -throughput diagnostic are comparable in sensitivity and specificity to PCR, and may increase sampling speed.531 A high - throughput diagnostic assay for screening asymptomatic individuals has received US Emergency Use Authorization.82, 234 Infrared temperature readings may be misleading when used at the entrance of buildings with low outdoor temperatures.188 Artificial intelligence is being used to differentiate COVID -19 from other respiratory ailments via patient coughs.363 Som e skin manifestations of COVID -19 may be diagnostic, in particular those associated with inflammatory reactions.478 Validated serological (antibody) assays are being used to help determine who has been exposed to SARS -CoV-2. Repeated serological testing is necessary to identify asymptomatic540 and other undetected patients.592 Exclusively testing symptomatic healthcare workers is likely to exclude a large fraction of COVID -19 positive personnel.627 Research has shown high variability in the ability of tests by different manufacturers to accurately detect positive and negative cases .371, 714 Meta -analysis suggests that lateral flow assays (LFIA) less acc urate than ELISA or chemiluminescent methods (CLIA), but that the target of serological studies (e.g., IgG or IgM) does not affect accuracy.408 The FDA has excluded several dozen serological diagno stic assays based on failure to conform to updated regulatory requirements.206 SARS- CoV-2 RNA is likely to persist long enough in untreated wastewater to permit reliable detection for COVID -19 surveillance ,25 and can warn of SARS -CoV-2 cases ahead of positive PCR tests and hospital admissions.525 Wastewater sampling for SARS -CoV-2 should use ultrafiltration methods, rather than adsorption -extraction techniques.319 What do we need to know? We need to identify additional factors that affect the accuracy of serological or PCR- based diagnostic tests. How long do antibody targets of serological assays persist, and after what point are they not informative for prevalence? What is the relationship between disease severity and the timing of positive serological assays? REQUIRED INFORMATION FOR EFFECTIVE INFECTIOUS DISEASE OUTBREAK RESPONSE SARS- CoV-2 (COVID -19) Updated 11/17/2020 CLEARED FOR PUBLIC RELEASE 10 Medical Treatments - Are ther e effective treatments? What do we know? There is no universally effective treatment for COVID -19, but some treatments reduce disease severity and mortality. There is some evidence that earlier intubation of COVID -19 patients reduces mortality,306 but results are mixed.441 Remdesivir may reduce symptom duration in hospitalized patients, but there is no evidence that it reduces mortality. Remdesivir may reduce the duration of symptoms in infected individuals, from 15 days to 10 days on average.67 The US FDA has approved the use of remdesivir in hospitalized patients 12 years and older,211 with an Emergency Use Authorization for other patient groups.202, 487 Remdesivir with anti -coronavirus immunoglobulin (ITAC) is being investigated in clinical trial.488 A large clinical trial (SOLIDARITY, n=2,750 treated patients) found no benefit of remdesivir for patient mortality, regardles s of ventilation status or treatment severity.514 An abbreviated clinical trial of remdesivir (n=237) found no significant benefits.700 Hydroxychloroquine provides limited to no clinical benefit.218, 600 Hydroxychloroquine does not prevent infection as either pre -17, 250, 551 or post -exposure prophylaxis,83, 458 does not benefit mild -moderat e COVID -19 cases,103 was associated with adverse cardiac events in severely ill patients,336 does not reduce mortality,3 and increases mortality when combined with azithromycin.218 The FDA revoked its EUA on 6/15/20.201 Corticosteroids may significantly reduce mortality in severely ill and ventilated patients, especially if given early.655 Dexamethasone is associated with substantial reductions in mortality for patients receiving mechanical ventilation, smaller benefits for those receiving supplemental oxygen,295 and no benefi ts in patients who did not need oxygen or ventilation.295 A large meta -analysis found that 28 -day mortality in critically ill patients was reduced in patients (n=678) who received systemic corticosteroids.626 Four separate, smaller trials of corticosteroids (n<152) were stopped early.42, 173, 393, 654 The benefits of glucocorticoids may depend heavily on patient inflammation.335 In several studies, high doses of steroids were associated with elevated mortality ,409, 466 though low -moderate doses can reduce mortality in patients with ARDS.735 Convalescent plasma treatment is safe and appears to be effective when administered early, though evidence is mixed.523 A large trial of plasma therapy (>25,000 patients) shows that treatment is safe, with some evidence that it can reduce 7 -day mortality.307, 329 Plasma therapy shows larger reductions in mortality when administered within 44 hours of hospital admission,591 and donor plasma with higher antibody levels appears more effective.330, 438, 555 On 8/24/2020, the US FDA approved an Emergency Use Authorization for convalescent pl asma therapy.212 Anticoagulants may reduce COVID -19 mortality in hospitalized patients. Both therapeutic and prophylactic use of anticoagulants has been associated with significant (~50%) reduction in mortality in hospitalized COVID -19 patients. 479 Anticoagulant use was associated with lower mortality in the severely ill,515 but the correct dose is critical to avoid complications.315 A small Phase II clinical trial found that enoxaparin significantly reduced the need f or mechanical ventilation when used therapeutically.385 The benefits of tocilizumab are unclear. While tocilizumab appears to show a 12% reduction in mortality in treated patients,435 a randomized clinical trial found no effects on mortality,289 and other evidence suggests that it may be beneficial only in certain circumstances.290, 463, 480 Other pharmaceutical interventions are being investigated but results from large clinical trials are needed. Eli Lilly has received Emergency Use Authorization from the US FDA for its monoclonal antibody product, bamlanivimab, for use in recently diagnosed, mild to moderate COVID -19 patients. 404 Regeneron's REGN -COV2 monoclonal antibody has been associated with reductions in symptom duration.561 However, preliminary data from both Eli Lilly and Regeneron suggest that their monoclonal antibody treatments may not work well for hospitalized patients405 or those with high oxygen requirements.559 Regener on ha s applied for Emergency Use Authorization for its therapy .560 Other antibody products are being tested in humans and appear safe ,681 including CT -P59 from Celltrion, which reduced patient recovery time.118 Several interferon -based treatments show promise, including beta -1b,304, 549 beta -1a,158 alpha -2b,528 and kappa .239 A Phase II trial of inhaled interferon beta -1a showed benefits in terms of reduced di sease severity,465 though results from the SOLIDARITY trial found no benefit of a separate interferon beta -1a formulation .514 Anakinra has shown clinical benefits in small observational studies.102, 141 Favipiravir may reduce the duration of clinical symptoms179 and reduce the time for viral clearance.240 Bradykinin inhibitors are being investigated as COVID -19 treatments,666 due to the potential role of bradykinins in disease.247 Statins439, 589 and RAAS inhibitors697 (for hypertension) do not appear to elevate COVID -19 risk.565, 622 Vitamin D (with vitamin B12 and magnesium) may reduce the need for ventilation in COVID -19 patients ,640 and e lderly COVID -19 patients who had taken vitamin D supplements in the year before infection showed less severe COVID -19 symptoms.44 Acalabrutinib may improve patient oxygenation,581 and is being included in large clinical trials (SOLIDARITY).362 Colchicine may reduce rates of intubation and mortality.593 Fluvoxamine may reduce clinical symptoms.386 There is no clinic al benefit from combination r itonavir/lopinavir.98, 244, 265, 401 Androgen levels have been suggested as a factor in disease severity in men,260, 467, 686 and treatment options are in trial.261, 442 What do we need to know? We need clear, randomized trials for treatment efficacy in patients with both severe and mild/moderate illness.

The study, which targets 44,000 people, will continue, and Pfizer plans to submit an Emergency Use Authorization application to the US FDA in the coming weeks.533 Moderna released interim results from the Phase III trial of their mR NA vaccine candidate (mRNA -1273), showing 94.5% efficacy in 95 COVID -19 positive volunteers (90 from placebo group, 5 from vaccine group).461 University of Oxford and AstraZeneca's adenovirus candidate (now called AZD1222) has begun Phase II/III human trials.510 Sinovac has begun Phase III trials of its CoronaVac inactivated vaccine candidate in healthcare professionals.618 Sinopharm has begun Phase III trials of two of its inactivated S ARS- CoV-2 vaccine candidates, one by the Wuhan Institute of Biological Products and the other by Beijing Institute of Biological Products.63 Jansse n, with Johnson and Johnson, has begun a Phase III clinical trial with 60,000 participants for their adenovirus Ad26.COV2.S candidate.320 Russia's Gamaleya will begin a Phase III clinical trial for its adenovirus -based vaccine candidate (COVID -Vac-Lyo).243, 558 CanSino's Ad5 -nCoV adenovirus vaccine is undergoing Phase III clinical trials.774 Novavax has begun a Phase III trial of its subunit vaccine candidate NVX -CoV2373.491 Baharat will begin a Phase III trial of its inactivated rabies virus platform (Covaxin) on 28,500 people557 in with GlaxoSm ithKline, have announced a Phase II/III trial of their tobacco plant vaccine candidate (CoVLP).268 Phase II Trials (initial testing for efficacy, continued testing for safety , continued dose -finding ): Inovio has begun a Phase II trial of their INO -4800 DNA vaccine candidate.311 Imperial College London has begun Phase I/II trials of their RNA vaccine candidate, LNP -nCoVsnRNA.493 Phase I/II trials have begun for vaccine candidates Cadila (ZyCoV -D, DNA plasmid)781 and Baharat (Covaxin, used as carrier for SAR S-CoV-2 proteins).197 Anhui Zhifei has registered a Phase II clinical trial for their RBD -Dimer vaccine candidate.43 Novavax has begun Phase II its NVX -CoV2373 recombinant subunit vaccine candidate.7 CureVa c has begun a Phase II trial of their mRNA candidate CVnCoV.153 Based on unpublished Phase I/II results, Russia has approved a second COVID -19 vaccine, EpiVacCorona.143 Merck has initiated Phase I/II clinical trials for th eir modified measles vaccine (V591).452 Biological E Limited (with Baylor College of Medicine and Dynavax) launched a Phase I/II trial of their vaccine candidate .189 Phase I Trials (initial testing for safety) : mRNA vaccines: Chinese Academy of Military Sciences (ARCoV),166 Arcturus LLC (V -Sars),449 Kazakhstan's Research Institute for -SARS -2-S),278 vesiculovirus vectors,318, 712 tetanus fusion vaccines (Sovereign 2) ,217 and synthetic , mutated SARS -CoV-2 virus (COVI -VAC).145 Globally, th ere are 6 vaccine candidates that have received broad use approval or Emergency Use Authorization. CanSino's Ad5 -nCoV vaccine has been approved for use in the Chinese military,624 Gamelaya9 and the Vector Institute143 have been given conditional approval in Russia, SinoVac's CoronaVac candidate has been approved in China for limited emergency use,11 and two of Sinopharm's vaccine candidates have been approved for use in the United Arab Emirates.167 The US FDA has guidance for vaccine sponsors regarding the data needed to support Emergency Use Authorization.207 In the US, vaccines must achieve 50% efficacy (e.g. reduction of viral shedding, ri sk of illness) for 6 months for approval.203 What do we need to know? We need published results from Phase I -III trials in humans to assess vaccine efficacy and safety, and length of immunity. Safety and efficacy of vaccine candidates in humans, particularly from Phase III trials .REQUIRED INFORMATION FOR EFFECTIVE INFECTIOUS DISEASE OUTBREAK RESPONSE SARS- CoV-2 (COVID -19) Updated 11/17/2020 CLEARED FOR PUBLIC RELEASE 12 Non -pharmaceutical Interventions (NPIs) - Are public health control measures effective at reducing spread? What do we know? Broad- scale control measures such as stay -at-home orders and widespread face mask use effectively reduce transmission and are more impactful when implemented simultaneously. Public health notifications increase adherence to policies.225 Social distancing and other policies are estimated to have reduced COVID -19 spread by 44% in Hong Kong152 and reduced spread throughout China,356, 359, 364, 422, 433, 690 Europe,249, 333 and the US.353 In China, modeling suggests that a one -day delay in implementing control measures increased the time needed to curtail an outbreak by 2.4 days.183 In the US, each day of delay in emergency declarations and school closures was associated with a 5 -6% increase in mortality.751 Reductions in transmission are generally visible 6 -9 days after the implementation of NPIs, and increased transmission is generally visible 14-20 days after NPIs are lifted.398 US counties with mask mandates have lower case growth rates than neighboring counties lacking mask mandates.604 Modeling suggests that widespread use of facemasks is effective at reducing transmission484 even when individual mask efficiency is low,191 though their benefits are maximized when most of the population wears masks.227 In the US, shelter -in-place orders (SIPOs) and restaurant and bar closures were associated with large reductions in exponential growth rate of cases.149 School closures and cancellation of large gatherings had smaller effects.149 Similarly, more public health interventions in a given week was strongly associated with lower COVID -19 growth rates in the next week.331 Adherence to social distancing policies depends on income.707 Telework policies may reduce new cases.221 Mobility228, 370 and physical contact rates321 decline after public health control measures are implemented. Mobility reductions in the US have been associated with significant reductions in COVID -19 case growth.54, 282 Social distancing and reductions in both non -essential visits to stores and overall movement distance led to lower transmission rates.471 A combination of school closures, work restrictions, and other measures are likely required to effectively limit transmission.215, 351 School closures alone appear insufficient,317, 364 though likely reduced mortality in the UK570 and the US.51 Reducing capacity at crowded indoor locations such as restaurants, gyms, hotels, cafes, and religious organizations may be an effective way to reduce COVID -19 transmission without more substantial lockdowns. 126 Increasing air flow rates in indoor environments, improving mechanical filtration efficiency, and wearing masks may also reduce indoor transmission rates.337 Adolescents and young adults (15 -24) may require different messaging to improve adherence to NPIs and public health policies ,275 and self-reported adherence to NPI policies (e.g., mask use) is consistently low in 18 - to 29 -year -olds.305 In the US, limiting transmission in younger populations is crucial for reducing hospitalizations and mortality in older cohorts .507 Individual behaviors (e.g., face masks, social distancing ) have been associated with reduced risk of COVID -19 infection.524 Always wearing masks, maintaining physical distance >1m, and frequently washing hands were all associated with reduced risk of COVID -19 infection in individuals who had direct contact with infected individuals.182 Particle physics modeling suggests that 2m physical distancing is generally sufficient for reduction of SARS -CoV-2 aerosols expressed during coughs, though smaller pa rticles can travel farther, and wind direction and speed may play a role.294 The US CDC has indicated that face masks inhibit transmission by both reducing the number of exhaled particles from infectious individuals, as well as reducing the number of inhaled particles when worn by uninfected individuals.111 Due to the importance of superspreading events in COVID -19 transmission, particular focus should be placed on minimizing large gatherings where superspreading events are more likely.725 Retrospective contact tracing may help identify the source of large clusters of cases, and should be implemented due to the overdispersion or heterogeneity in secondary transmission aris ing from each primary COVID -19 case. 121 There are multiple types of superspreading events, and different policies are required to mitigate risks from each.32 Research is needed to plan the path to SARS -CoV-2 elimination via pharmaceutical and non -pharmaceutical interventions. In South Korea, early implementation of rapid contact tracing, testing, and quarantine was able to reduce the transmission rate of COVID -19. 631 Contact tracing and high levels of testing and physical distancing358 may limit COVID -19 resurgence.27, 219 Premature relaxation of public health control measures may facilitate rapid increases in prevalence at the state level.242 Modeling suggests that periods of social distancing or lock -down may be effective in reducing exposure from asymptomatic cases .657 Testing is critical to balancing public health and economic costs.657 Rolling interventions may be necessary .749 Undetected cases c an lead to elevated risk of re -emergence after restrictions are lifted.280 Quarantining whole households may increase the efficiency of testing .28 Synchronizing public health interventions across US state lines may reduce the total number of required interventions .583 Modeling indicates that COVID -19 is likely to become endemic in the US population, with regular, periodic outbreaks, and that additional social or physical distancing measures may be required for several years to keep cases below critical care capacity in absence of a vaccine or effective therapeutic. 344 Results depend on the duration of immunity after exposure.344 What do we need to know? We need to understand measures that will limit spread in the winter, particularly in indoor environments. How effective are school closures when COVID -19 prevalence in the community is high? Low? How will holiday travel from colleges and universities impact COVID -19 case growth? REQUIRED INFORMATION FOR EFFECTIVE INFECTIOUS DISEASE OUTBREAK RESPONSE SARS- CoV-2 (COVID -19) Updated 11/17/2020 CLEARED FOR PUBLIC RELEASE 13 Environmental Stability - How long does the agent live in the environment? What do we know? SARS -CoV-2 can survive on surfaces from hours to days and is stable in air for at least several hours, depending on the presence of UV light, temperature, and humidity. Environmental contamination is not thought to be the principal mode of SARS -CoV-2 transmission in humans. Viable SARS -CoV-2 and/or RNA can be recovered from contaminated surfaces; however, survivability varies. Both temperature and humidity contribute to SARS -CoV-2 survival on nonporous surfaces, with cooler, less humid environments facilitating survival (stainless steel, ABS plastic, and nitrile rubber; indoors only; simulated saliva matrix).73 Persistence is reduced with warmer temperatures (37 \u00b0C), and enhanced at colder temperatures (4 \u00b0C).281 SARS- CoV-2 was shown to be stable up to 7 days (25 -27\u00b0C; 35% RH) on smooth surfaces, to include plastic, stainless steel, glass, ceramics, wood, latex gloves, and surgical masks.417 At 22 \u00b0C, SARS -CoV-2 was shown to be detectable (via plaque assay) on paper currency for up to 24 hours, on clothing for up to 4 hours, and on skin for up to 96 hours.281 SARS- CoV-2 was found to be stable across pH 3 -10 on several surfaces at 22 \u00b0C.135 After 3 hours (22\u00b0 C, 65% RH), no infectious virus was detected on printing and tissue papers; on day 2, none was found on treated wood and cloth; on day 4, none was found on glass or banknote; on day 7, none was found on stainless steel or plastic. 135 At standard room temperature and humidity, SARS -CoV-2 becomes undetectable on common library items after 2 to 8 days of quarantine depending on the material (e.g., book cover vs leather) and conditions (e.g., stacked vs unstacked).8, 312, 603 SARS- CoV-2 can persist on plastic and metal surfaces for up to 3 days (21 -23\u00b0C, 40% RH)669 and infe ctious virus can be recovered from a surgical mask after 7 days (22 \u00b0C, 65% RH).135 SARS- CoV-2 RNA was detected in symptomatic and asymptomatic cruise ship passenger rooms up to 17 days .470 It is estimated that at least 1,000 viral particles per 25 cm2 are needed to detect SARS -CoV-2 RNA on surfaces.518 In the absence of sunlight, SARS -CoV-2 can persist on surfaces for weeks. In the absence of sunlight, infectious SARS -CoV-2 can remain on non- porous (e.g., glass, vinyl) surfaces for at least 28 days at 20\u00b0C and 50% RH; higher temperatures greatly reduce the environmental stability of SARS -CoV- 2.574 This value is longer than other stability estimates,134, 574, 669 potentially due to a fluid matrix with more protein to simulate human respiratory fluid and a higher inoculation dose.574 In simulated saliva on stainless steel surfaces, SARS -CoV-2 shows negligible decay over 60 minutes in darkness, but loses 90% of infectivity every 6.8 -12.8 minutes, depending on simulated UVB radiation .556 The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) developed a data -based model for SARS -CoV-2 decay on inert surfaces (stainless steel, ABS plastic and nitrile rubber) at varying temperature and relative humidity without sunlight.176 Particulate matter (PM) does not ap pear to be a viable transmission model of SARS -CoV-2. It does not appear that pollen or air particulates are carriers of SARS -CoV-2,187 despite some country -level associations.61 SARS -CoV-2 survival in the air is highly dependent on the presence of UV light and temperature. DHS has deve loped a tool for estimating the decay of airborne SARS -CoV-2 in different environmental conditions.175 Due to the effects of evaporation, modeling suggests that hot, dry conditions increase the aerosol risk of SARS -CoV-2, though cold, humid conditions facilitate transmission by droplet spread.767 Experimental studies using SARS -CoV-2 aerosols (1.78 -1.96 m mass median aerodynamic diam eter in artificial saliva matrix) found that simulated sunlight rapidly inactivates the virus, with 90% reductions in infectious concentration after 6 minutes in high -intensity sunlight (similar to mid -June) and 19 minutes in low -intensity sunlight (simila r to early March or October). 598 In dark conditions, the half -life of aerosolized SARS -CoV-2 is approximately 86 minutes in simulated saliva matrix.598 Humidity alone had no significant impact on aerosolized virus survival.598 SARS- CoV-2 was shown to have an aerosol half -life of 2.7 hours (without sunlight, particles <5 m, tested at 21 -23\u00b0C and 65% RH),669 retaining infectivity for up to 16 hours in appropriate conditions (23\u00b0 C, 53% RH, n o sunlight).213 Stability of SARS -CoV-2 RNA in clinical samples depends on temperature and transport medium. RNA in clinical samples collected in viral transport medium is stable at 18 -25\u00b0C or 2-8\u00b0C for up to 21 days without impacting real-time RT -PCR results.620 RNA in clinical samples is also stable at 4 \u00b0C for up for 4 weeks with regard to quantitative RT -PCR testing (given that the sample contains 5,000 copies/mL). Separately, storage of RNA in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) at room temperature (18- 25\u00b0C) resulted in unstable sample concentrations. 527 There is currently no evidence that SARS -CoV-2 is transmitted to people through foo d. There is no documented evidence that food, food packaging, or food handling is a significant source of COVID -19 infections,314, 716 though several outbreaks have a hypothesized food origin.279 Infectious SARS -CoV-2 has been found on frozen food packaging, but has not been linked to actual infections.567 SARS- CoV-2 is susceptible to heat treatment (70 \u00b0C) but can persist for at least two weeks at refrigerated temperatures (4\u00b0C).134, 553 SARS -CoV-2 maintains infectivity for at least 21 days when inoculated on frozen foods and stored below -20\u00b0C.224 What do we need to know? We need to quantify the duration of SARS -CoV-2 infectivity on surfaces, not simply the presence of RNA. We need to determine the concentration of viral particles per area needed to detect SARS -CoV-2 RNA on surfaces. It is unclear how viability of SARS -CoV-2 is affected across the food supply chain .

What do we know? Soap and water, as well as common alcohol and chlorine -based cleaners, hand sanitizers, and disinfectants are effective at inactivating SARS -CoV-2 on hands and surfaces. Alcohol -based hand rubs are effective at inactivating SARS -CoV-2.357 Chlorine bleach (1%, 2%), 70% ethanol and 0.05% chlorhexidine are effective against live virus in lab tests.133 EPA has released a list of SARS -CoV-2 disinfectants that have been tested against SARS -CoV-2 specifically .195 Twice -daily cleaning with sodium dichloroisocyanurate decontaminated surfaces in COVID -19 patient hospital rooms.504 Regular disinfection of hospital rooms (with benzalkonium wipes) can reduce the presence of SARS -CoV-2 on surfaces, though contamination is widespread without regular cleaning.342 Chlorhexidine dig luconate may be ineffective.50 Oral antiseptic rinses used in pre- procedural rinses for dentistry containing povidone -iodine (PVP -I) are effective decontaminants of inactivating SARS -CoV-2 at concentrations above 0.5% in lab tests (for 15 -30 s) .69 Efforts are ongoing to create paint -on surfaces that can rapidly inactivate SARS -CoV-2.66 Under an emergency exemption, the US EPA permitted Texas and American Airlines to use a product manufactured by Applied BioScience as a surface coating capable of inactivating SARS -CoV-2 within 2 hours, for up to 7 days.196 Iodine -based antiseptics may be able to decontaminate nasal passages, though any influence on transmission is unknown.236 A mouth- spray previously investigated for the 229E (ColdZyme \u00ae) effectively inactivated SARS -CoV-2 in vitro ; additional tests are necessary to determine any clinical benefit.274 Indoor air filters based on non- thermal plasma or reactive oxygen species may be effective at reducing circulating SARS -CoV- 2 concentrations , estimated by re ductions in surrogate virus, though additional testing on live SARS -CoV-2 virus is needed.590 Indoor air filtration devices based on hydroxyl radical cascades, which do not emit ozone, are being trialed at 4 UK hospitals due to their efficacy in reducing concentrations of a surrogate virus (M2 phage). 26, 660 In tests with a surrogate virus (Phi6 phage), a modified version of the Joint Biological Agent Decontamination System (J BADS) was effective at decontaminating military aircraft in approximately three hours using high heat and humidity ;625 Phi6, however, may be less stable than SAR S-CoV-2 on surfaces, and therefore may not be the best surrogate.715 Aquila Bioscience has developed a spray decontamination technique to pair with its existing alcohol - and chemical -free wipe; these products may be used to capture SARS -CoV-2 on skin, surfaces, and washable masks via high -affinity binding.85 Masks with laser -induced graphene have previously shown antibacterial properties,300 and may facilitate mask decontamination, particularly when masks are exposed to sunlight.30 Several methods exist for decontaminating N95 respirators494 and other PPE. Researchers have identified four methods capable of decontaminating N95 respirators while maintaining physical integrity (fit factor): UV radiation, heating to 70 \u00b0C, and vaporized hydrogen peroxide (VHP).223 Ethanol (70%) was associated with loss of physical integrity.223 Dry heat and UV decontamination can also be used under certain conditions.222 Hydrogen peroxide vapor (VHP) can repeatedly decontaminate N95 respirators.572 Devices capable of decontaminating 80,000 masks per day have been granted Emergency Use Authorization from the FDA.204 The FDA has issued an Emergency Use Authorization for a system capable of decontaminating ten N95 masks at a time using devices already present in many US hospitals , 87 though fit failure after reuse remains a concern.403 Respirator decontamination methods such as VHP appear to maintain filtration efficiency after repeated decontamination cycles.526 Several decontamination methods, including VHP, moist heat, an d UVC, are capable of decontaminating N95 respirators for 10 -20 cycles without loss of fit or filtration efficiency.13 Stacking respirators may increase decontamination rates without compromisin g efficiency.586 Peracetic acid may be effective in combination with VHP.325 Pulsed xenon ultraviolet light was able to decontaminate SARS -CoV-2 on respirators with 1 -5 minute exposures.616 Wet heat (65 \u00b0C for 30 minutes) in a can decontaminate N95 respirators inoculated with SARS -CoV-2.177 Methylene blue (in combination with visible light) is being investigated for decontamination of N95 respirators.664 Researchers have developed a thermal inactivation model for SARS -CoV-2, providing estimates of infectivity reduction based on time and temperature in the environment and under decontamination strategies.750 Heat treatment (56 \u00b0C) is sufficient to kill coronaviruses (not SARS -CoV-2 explicitly),548, 769 though effectiveness depends partly on pro tein in the sample.548 Coronaviruses may be resistant to heat inactivation for up to 7 days when stabilized in stool.649- 650 Coronaviruses are more stable in matrixes such as respiratory sputum.186 Dry heat (100\u00b0 C, 5% RH for 50 minutes) was able to decontaminate N9 5 respirators inoculated with several viruses, but has not been tested on SARS -CoV-2.498 Forced air ozone reactors may be able to decontaminate surgical gowns, though SARS -CoV-2 tests are needed.142, 414 What do we need to know? We need additional SARS -CoV-2 decontamination studies, particularly with regard to PPE and other items in short supply. Does contamination with human fluids/waste alter disinfectant efficacy profiles? How effective is air filtration at reducing transmissio n in healthcare, airplanes, and public spaces? We need to know how to efficiently and effectively decontaminate whole rooms and large spaces. REQUIRED INFORMATION FOR EFFECTIVE INFECTIOUS DISEASE OUTBREAK RESPONSE SARS- CoV-2 (COVID -19) Updated 11/17/2020 CLEARED FOR PUBLIC RELEASE 15 PPE - What PPE is effective, and who should be using it? What do we know? Face masks appear effective at r educing infections from SARS -CoV-2. Healthcare workers are at high risk of acquiring COVID -19, even with recommended PPE. Healthcare worker illnesses647 demonstrates human -to-human transmission despite isolation, PPE, and infection control.597 Risk of transmission to healthcare workers is high.564 Contacts with healthcare workers tend to transmit COVID -19 more often than other casual contacts.696 Hospital -acquired infection rates fell after introduction of comprehensive infection control measures, including expanded testing and use of PPE for all patient contacts.573 Universal masking policies also reduced the rate of new healthcare worker infections.695, 776 Even among healthcare personnel reporting adequate PPE early in the pandemic (March -April), rates of infection were 3.4 times higher than the general population.486 A modeling study suggests that healthcare workers are pri marily at risk from droplet and inhalation exposure (compared to contact with fomites), with greater risk while in closer proximity to patients.328 \"Healthcare personnel entering the room [of SARS -CoV-2 patients] should use standard precautions, contact precautions, airborne precautions, and use eye protection (e.g., goggles or a face shield).\"108 WHO indicates healthcare workers should wear clean long -sleeve gowns as well as gloves.719 PPE that covers all skin may reduce exposure to pathogens.214, 710 Respirators (NIOSH -certified N95, EUFFP2 or equivalent) are recommended for those working with potential aerosols.720 Additional protection (Powered Air Purifying Respirator (PAPR) with hood), should be considered for high- risk procedures .90 A small observational study found no COVID -19 cases in 25 healthcare workers exposed to an infected patient while conducting aerosol -generating procedures, despite differences in the mask types (N95 respirator vs. 3 -ply surgical mask) worn by the workers.354 There is still insufficient evidence t o recommend surgical masks as alternatives to N95s. KN95 respirators are, under certain conditions, approved for use under FDA Emergency Use Authorization.205 On May 7, the FDA rescinded a number of KN95 models that no longer meet the EUA criteria and are no longer authorized.210 A study suggests that P100 respirators with removable filter cartridges have similar filtration efficiency compared to N95 respirators and could plausibly be used if N95 respirators were in short supply.522 Particular care should be taken with \"duckbill\" N95 respirators, which may fail fit tests after repeated doffing.163 Dome - shaped N95 respirators also failed fit tests after extended use.163 The US FDA cautions healthcare facilities using passive protective barrier enclosures without negative pressure, and has withdrawn a prior Emergency Use Authorization for the devices. 209 Exper iments with mannequins show that face masks reduce potential spread of SARS -CoV-2 when worn by an infectious individual, but also that face masks by non -infected recipients can reduce the number of inhaled particles; the protective effect was maximized when both infected and uninfected individuals (mannequins) wore masks.662 Researchers have developed a lipopeptide fusion inhibitor that prevents SARS -CoV-2 transmission in ferrets given the peptide prophylactically via the intranasal route; human studies have yet to be conducted.161 Non- medical masks may be effective at slowing transmission, though data specific to SARS -CoV-2 are sparse.6, 12 On 4/3/2020, the US CDC recommended wearing cloth face masks in public where social distancing measures are difficult to maintain.110 The CDC recommends masks without exhalation vents or valves,105 as masks with valves can allow particles to pass through unfiltered.676 The WHO recommends that the general population wear non- medical masks when in public settings and when physical distancing is difficult, and that vulnerable populations (e.g., elderly) wear medical masks when close contact is likely.717 Infected individuals wearing facemasks in the home before the onset of symptoms was associated with a reduction in household transmission.698 A meta -analysis of SARS -CoV-1, MERS, and COVID -19 transmission events found evidence that wearing face masks and eye protection were each associated with lower risk of transmission ,139 with N95 respirators more effective than surgical masks.139 In a separate meta -analysis, N95 respirators were found to be beneficial for reducing the occurrence of respiratory illness in health care professionals including influenza, though surgical masks were similarly effective for influenza.496 N95 respirators were associated with up to 80% reductions in SARS -CoV-1 infections.496 Surgical face masks, respirators , and homemade face masks may prevent transmission of coronaviruses from infectious individuals to other individuals.157, 388, 667 Surgical masks were associated with a significant reduction in the amount of seasonal coronavirus expressed as aerosol particles (<5 m).388 Homemade masks reduce overall flow from breathing and coughing (63 -86% reduction) but also generate leakage jets facing downward and backward from the wearer's face.679 Some non -standard materials (e.g., cotton, cotton hybrids) may be able to filter out >90% of simulant particles >0.3 m,348 while other materials (e.g., T -shirt, vacuum cleaner bag, towels) appear to have lower filtration efficacy (~35 -62%).689 Of 42 homemade materials tested, the three with the greatest filtration efficiencies were layered cotton with raised visible fibers.756 Neck fleeces commonly worn by runners may increase the frequency of small aerosol particles, compared to wearing no mask at all.220 Cotton T -shirt masks appear ineffective at reducing emitted particles when individuals talk, breath e, sneeze, or cough, with those made of single layers increasing emitted particles during these activities.49 What do we need to know? We need to continue assessing PPE effectiveness with specific regard to SARS -CoV-2 instead of surrogates. When and how do N95 respirators and other face coverings fail? How effective are homemade masks at reducing SARS -CoV-2 transmission ? REQUIRED INFORMATION FOR EFFECTIVE INFECTIOUS DISEASE OUTBREAK RESPONSE SARS- CoV-2 (COVID -19) Updated 11/17/2020 CLEARED FOR PUBLIC RELEASE 16 Forensics - Natural vs intentional use? Tests to be used for attribution. What do we know? All current evidence supports the natural emergence of SARS -CoV-2 via a bat and possible intermediate mammal species. New analysis of SARS -CoV-2 and related SARS -like coronaviruses suggests that SARS -CoV-2 jumped directly from bats to humans, without the influence of an intermediate 'mixing' host.78 Pangolin coronaviruses were shown to be more divergent and split off fr om bat coronaviruses earlier than SARS -CoV-2.78 Current sampling of pangolin viruses does not implicate them as an intermediate to human SARS -CoV-2.78 These data suggest SARS -CoV-2 emerged from circulating bat coronaviruses in SE China/SE Asia and additional zoonotic emergence of novel coronaviruses could occur. Based on phylogenetic analysis, SARS -CoV- 2 most likely emerged from Rhinolophus (horseshoe) bats living in China, Laos, Myanmar, Vietnam, or another Southeast Asian country,372 though historical recombination with pangolin coronaviruses may explain some features of the SARS -CoV-2 genome.231 Genomic analysis suggests that SARS -CoV-2 is a natural variant and is unlikely to be human- derive d or otherwise created by \"recombination\" with other circulating strains of coronavirus.38, 773 Phylogenetics suggest that SARS -CoV-2 is of bat origin, but is closely related to coronaviruses found in pangolins.411, 413 The SARS- CoV-2 Spike protein, which mediates entry into host cells and is a major determinant of host range, is very similar to the SARS -CoV-1 Spike protein.423 The rest of the genome is more closely related to two separate bat coronaviruses423 and coronaviruses found in pangolins.413 Comparing genomes of multiple coronaviruses using machine -learning has identified key genomic signatures shared amo ng high case fatality rate coronaviruses (SARS -CoV-1, SARS -CoV-2, MERS) and animal counterparts.276 These data furt her suggest that SARS -CoV-2 emergence is the result of natural emergence and that there is a potential for future zoonotic transmission of additional pathogenic strains to humans.276 Deletion mutants were identified at low levels in human clinical samples, suggesting that the PRRA furin cleavage site alone is not fully responsible for human infection, but does confer a fitness advantage in the human host.727 Additional whole - genome sequencing in humans would help to confirm this finding. Genomic data support at least two plausible origins of SARS -CoV-2: \"(i) natural selection in a non -human animal host prior to zoonotic transfer, and (ii) natural selection in humans following zoonotic transfer.\"38 Both scenarios are consistent with the observed genetic changes found in all known SARS -CoV-2 isolates. Some SARS- CoV-2 genomic evidence indicates a close relationship with pangolin coronaviruses,726 and data suggest that pangolins may be a natural host for beta -coronaviruses.411, 413 Genomic evidence suggests a plausible recombination event between a circulating coronavirus in pangolins and bats could be the source of SARS -CoV-2.395, 741 Emerging studies are showing that bats are not the only reservoir of SARS -like coronaviruses.761 Additional research is needed. There are multiple studies showing that t he SARS -CoV-2 S protein receptor binding domain, the portion of the protein responsible for binding the human receptor ACE2, was acquired through recombination between coronaviruses from pangolins and bats.38, 395, 412, 761 These studies suggest that pangolins may have played an intermediate role in the adaptation of SARS -CoV-2 to be able to bind to the human ACE2 receptor. Additional research is needed. A key difference between SARS -CoV-2 and other beta -coronaviruses is the presence of a polybasic furin cleavage site in the Spike protein (inserti on of a PRRA amino acid sequence between S1 and S2).150 A novel bat coronavirus (RmYN02) has been identified in China with an insertion between the S1/S2 cleavage site of the Spike protein. While distinct from the furin cleavage site insertion in SARS -CoV-2, this evidence show s that such insertions can occur naturally.771 Additionally, \"[...] SARS -CoV-2 is not derived from any previously used virus backbone,\" reducing the likelihood of laboratory origination,38 and \"[...] genomic evidence does not support the idea that SARS -CoV-2 is a laboratory construct, [though] it is currently impossible to prove or disprove the other theories of its origin.\"38 Work with other coronaviruses has indicated that heparan sulfate dependence can be an indicator of prior cell passage, due to a mutation in the previous furin enzyme recognition motif.160 A report claiming a laboratory origin of SARS -CoV-2746 has been heavily disputed by scientists at Johns Hopkins Universi ty.4 What do we need to know? We need to know whether there was an intermediate host species between bats and humans. What tests for attribution exist for coronavirus emergence? What is the identity of the intermediate species? Are th ere closely related circulating coronaviruses in bats or other animals with the novel PRRA cleavage site found in SARS - CoV-2? REQUIRED INFORMATION FOR EFFECTIVE INFECTIOUS DISEASE OUTBREAK RESPONSE SARS- CoV-2 (COVID -19) Updated 11/17/2020 CLEARED FOR PUBLIC RELEASE 17 Genomics - How does the disease agent compare to previous strains? What do we know? Current evidence suggests that SARS -CoV-2 accumulates mutations at a similar rate as other coronaviruses. There have been no documented cases of SARS -CoV-2 prior to December 2019. Preliminary genomic analyses, however, suggest that the first human cases of SARS -CoV-2 emerged between 10/19/2019 - 12/17/2019.40, 65, 552 Analysis of more than 7,000 SARS -CoV-2 genome samples provides an estimated mutation rate of 6x10-4 nucleotides per genome per year.670 The same analysis estimates the emergence of SARS -CoV-2 in humans between October and December 2019.670 This aligns with the first known human cases in China in early December 2019, in Europe in late December 2019,174 circulation in the US (Washington State) in February 2020,731 and circulation in Mexico in March 2020.638 In both California171 and New York City,258 evidence supports multiple introductions of SARS -CoV-2 from inside and outside the US. SARS- CoV-2 is acquiring nucleotide changes at a rate that suggests the virus is undergoing purifying selection (that the genome is stabilizing toward a common genome).734 Low genetic diversity early in the epidemic suggests that SARS -CoV-2 was capable of jumping to human and other mammalian hosts,734 and that additional jumps into humans may occur. In 94 COVID -19 patients, there was no association between viral genotype and clinical severity.762 However, a 382 base pair deletion in the SARS -CoV-2 genome has been linked to milder clinical illness (n=39),753 though the same size was small . At least one mutation has been associated with greater viral transmission, but virulence appears unchanged. Phylogenetic and clinical analysis suggests the D614G mutation in the Spike protein is associated with higher rates of SARS - CoV-2 transmission,682 but no change in clinical severity in infected patients.352 An ongoing study of SARS -CoV-2 sequences reveals the continued spread and increased presence of sequences with the D614G mutation ,352, 420, 538, 759 though it is possible that founder effects contributed to its prevalence. The D614G mutation increased viral loads in experimentally infected hamsters in the nose and throat,538 and hastened transmission (evidence of spread between hamsters after 2 days f or D614G mutants vs. 4 days for wild -type virus).296 The D614G mutation showed a competitive advantage within hamster hosts, meaning it increased in frequency in vitro compared to wild -type virus.539 The mutation did increase viral replication in human cell line s.538, 759 The D614G mutation appears to make the virus more susceptible to neutralization by monoclonal antibodies or by convalescent plasma.709 Antibodies induced by the D614G mutation or wild- type virus are able to neutralize each other.382 A second SARS -CoV-2 variant is being assessed for its ability to evade the human immune system. A separate Spike protein receptor binding motif variant (called N493K) results in similar clinical disease ; importantly , it shows evidence of immune escape from polyclonal sera and neutralizing antibodies . This may affect the ability of vaccines and therapeutics that target this region.651 As of October 2020, this is the second most common receptor binding domain variant worldwide, and has been found in 12 countries.651 Associations between human blood type and COVID -19 severity are unclear , but certain human genome regions are associated with more severe disease . Several human genomic regions have been associated with increased risk of COVID -19 infection and severe diseas e.37 Some of these are linked to human blood type,255 where there is evidence of slightly increased prevalence35, 62, 257 and moderately increased severity in those with type A blood,292 though early evidence was mixed.373 In US hospital patients, COVID -19 prevalence was slightly higher in individuals with non -O-type blood; blood type affected both risk of mechanical ventilation (lower in type A, higher in B and AB compared to O) and death (higher in AB, lower in A and B compared to O), and Rh negative status was protective for all three measures.777 Non-O-type blood has been associated with clotting issues.172 Other regions associated with severe disease include locus 3p21.31, where certain alleles are found more often in patients with respiratory distress requiring ventilation,255 as well as those with severe disease.511 There is some concern regarding SARS -CoV-2 strains involved in continued human and mink transmission . Repeated outbreaks of COVID -19 on mink farms, and the detection of mink -adapted SARS -CoV-2 in humans, has led to the mass culling of all mink in Denmark.568 The State Serum Institute has noted mutations in the Spike protein that differed from commonly circulating strains and initially showed a decreased susceptibility to neutralizing antibodies.313 The stability of these changes and to what extent they would be affected by vaccine or treatment options in progress are unclear. The main SARS -CoV-2 variant associated with mink outbreaks in the Netherlands involves the Y453F mutation, which has also been identified in humans outside of Europe; this suggests the strain originated in humans.148 There is no evidence that Y453F is mo re or less transmissible in humans than other wild- type viruses, though transmissibility in mink is high.148 Individuals with defective androgen signaling (long polyQ allelic repeats in the androgen receptor gene) were more likely to have severe COVID -19, possibly due to increased inflammatory re sponses; this may influence treatment decisions. 58 Researchers have identified a number of human proteins associated with COVID -19 severity, which could be used as a screening tool for designing appropriate treatment regim ens.775 What do we need to know? We need to link genotypes to phenotypes (e.g., disease severity) in infected patients. Are there similar genomic differences in the progression of coronavirus strains from bat to intermediate species to human? Are there different strains or clades of circulating virus? If so, do they differ in virulence or transmissibility ? What are the mutations in SARS -CoV-2 that allowed human infection and transmission? How do viral mutations affect the long -term efficacy of specific vaccines?
