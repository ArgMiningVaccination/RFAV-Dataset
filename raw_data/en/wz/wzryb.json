Photo by Kirsten Johnson Introduction The preservation of Maryland's botanical heritage\u2014a nd its biodiversity\u2014requires conservation of native plants in their natural habi tats . The Work Group had a broad mandate. It was to define challenges, explore opportunities, and make recommendations regarding the preservation of \"plant species native to the State and region,\" that is, Maryland's botanical heritage. Our native plants exist in many settings: natural areas, disturbed places like roadsides and field edges, planted landscapes and gardens, an d as dried specimens in herbaria. But the cornerstone of our botanical heritage is native pla nts in their natural habitats. Public support for conservation of Maryland's botan ical heritage is crucial. Public understanding of the importance of native plants and how they are threatened will be key to preserving our biodiversity and our botanical heritage. Why Maryland Citizens Care about Preserving their Botanical Heritage \"[T]he loss of genetic and species diversity by the destruction of natural habitats. . . is the folly our descendants are least likely to forgive us.\" E. O. Wilson The impact of human activity reaches all other livi ng things. However, we can choose to be responsible stewards of the natural environment in which we live. Conservation of Maryland's native plants is an essential component of responsi ble stewardship of our State's resources. Native plants have intrinsic worth. They also serve us directly and indirectly, and are likely to serve future generations in ways that we cannot pre dict. For example, a thriving economy depends on healthy native plant communities, which support pollinators essential for agricultural production, provide habitats for economically impor tant wildlife and aquatic species, protect our water supply, and provide timber and industrial pro ducts. Healthy and diverse native plant communities also have greater ecological resilience in the face of potentially changing climatic conditions. The Ongoing Destruction of Maryland's Native Plants and N ative Biodiversity Most Maryland citizens are aware of natural areas b eing lost to residential, commercial, and other uses. This loss is occurring at a rapid pace to accommodate our increasing population and its preference for suburban living. What many are n ot aware of is that even our remaining natural 6 Figure 2.

Photo by Rochelle Bartolomei. areas\u2014our forests, our meadows, and our wetlands\u2014ar e severely stressed. The idea that nature is doing fine somewhere \"out there\" is no longer va lid. Plant species that once were common, that were rega rded as ubiquitous as recently as the 1980s, have become uncommon in many areas. Parklands that in our lifetimes displayed a profusion of spring wildflowers do so no more. Many of our fores ts, including those protecting our reservoirs, are missing the understory of shrubs, tree saplings and herbaceous plants that permit forest regeneration and support animal life. Our stream ba nks are choked with monocultures of non- native plants and our trees are dying and falling u nder the weight of non-native vines. White- tailed deer are a common sight throughout Maryland, sometimes in herds of more than a dozen, each consuming many pounds of plant material a day. These trends are most pronounced in urban and suburban areas but also exist in rural ar eas of the Eastern Shore and western Maryland. As the plants go, so go the animals\u2014the b irds, the mammals, the reptiles, the bees and butterflies and the other insects that depend o n native plants for food and shelter. In a nutshell, we are losing our native biodiversit y to habitat destruction from human activity, the invasion of non-native species, and the over-abunda nce of white-tailed deer. At the same time, fewer resources are devoted to preventing or allevi ating the loss. Overview of the Report We begin with Maryland's extraordinarily rich nativ e flora (that is, the set of all its native plants), and the geologic and historic forces that shaped it. Maryland's flora includes about 2500 species. Yet, 710 of those species, or about 28%, a re now listed as rare, threatened, endangered or extinct in Maryland by the Wildlife and Heritage Service of the Department of Natural Resources. Rare, threatened and endangered species are like th e \"canary in the coal mine.\" Their status is an indicator of the health of the e cosystems that we share with them, and can signal the decline of animals and other plants whos e existence may not yet be threatened. The major challenges to the conservation of our nat ive plants and their habitats include the impact from direct habitat destruction and the effe cts of fragmentation of natural areas. Habitat 7destruction continues despite various measures at t he state level designed to slow the pace of this type of loss. In addition, our native plants are being devastated by the large numbers of white-tailed deer whose abundance is no longer kept in check. Deer co nsumption of native plants prevents forest regeneration and facilitates the spread of non-nati ve invasive plants. Maryland has many areas where the majority of plant species are native, but the vast bulk of plant biomass is non-native and invasive. Restoration and landscaping practices , including by government agencies and private landowners, can either harm or help\u2014but can never replace\u2014our native plant diversity. * * * The Work Group is comprised of individuals with var ious affiliations and expertise, but what we have in common is that each of us spends time outdo ors in Maryland, closely observing our plant and animal communities. So this Report is founded n ot only on the sources cited within, but on the day-to-day observations and expertise of Work G roup members with many decades of collective experience. Our unanimous perception is that Maryland's natural resources\u2014not the least of which is its botanical heritage\u2014are under serious threat and in need of both preservation and remediation. We are grateful to the General Assembly for recogni zing the need to preserve Maryland's botanical heritage, and for giving us the opportuni ty to prepare a comprehensive report that focuses attention on this important subject.

Photo by Wesley Knapp 8Executive Summary and Recommendations Native plants in their native habitats are the foun dation of the healthy ecosystems that support wildlife and a thriving economy, as well as having their own intrinsic value. Yet Maryland's extraordinarily rich native botanical heritage is u nder historically unprecedented stress. The main causes of the stress are habitat loss from developm ent and other human activity, invasive non- native species, and the over-abundance of white-tai led deer. The State agencies with responsibility for preservi ng our botanical heritage do their utmost to allocate limited resources in a responsible way. Ho wever, over the years, the resources available for conservation efforts by State agencies have dwi ndled to the point where tasks that Maryland citizens would expect to be done cannot be done. The Work Group's recommendations identify steps tha t would make a positive difference to the preservation of Maryland's botanical heritage, whil e requiring realistic levels of additional resources or reallocations of resources. Recommendations for improved conservation of natural habi tats and listed (rare, threatened and endangered) species To address the need for enhanced conservation of na tural habitats, including those supporting rare, threatened and endangered plant species, we r ecommend reinforcing the foundations of the Natural Heritage Network. This is an international network that tracks and monitors species using consistent methodologies, and whose Maryland component is the Wildlife and Heritage Service (Service) within the Department of Natural Resources (DNR). These recommendations posit that static or declining budgets, at least in the Wildlife and Heritage Service, are likely to continue for the long term, given the manner in whi ch the Service is funded. They also recognize that the Service has limited capacity for on-the-gr ound conservation management. Nevertheless, with modest additional resources it would be possib le to accomplish significant conservation tasks. Thus the Work Group makes the following specific re commendations: 1. We recommend expanding the active stewardship compo nent within the Wildlife and Heritage Service to include four regional stewards . Many of our rare, threatened and endangered plant and animal species require habitat management to maintain and protect viable populations. Currently, the Wildlife and Her itage Service can only undertake a few high priority projects per year. Regional stewards would be chiefly responsible for on the ground monitoring and management activities in each region (Eastern, Southern, Central, Western). 2. We recommend a short-term assistant to the State Bo tanist who would be responsible for assisting with updating and reviewing rank and status, annotating database records and processing herbarium data . The Wildlife and Heritage Service employs a single full-time botanist (the State Botanist) who is responsible for setting plant conservation priorities and whose chief responsibil ity is maintaining the list of rare, threatened and endangered plant species. The State Botanist is continuously revising this list but progress is limited owing to additional ad ministrative duties. 93. We recommend assistance by a professional database management contractor (in the short term) to overhaul and eliminate the data entr y backlog in Biotics that is overwhelmingly botanical in nature . The conservation database administered by the Wildlife and Heritage Service (called \"Biotics\") ha s a critical backlog of data for entry. This database is essential to the conservation of M aryland's biodiversity. 4. We recommend establishing a special projects fund, administered by the Wildlife and Heritage Service's Director, with allocation based upon critical inventory and monitoring gaps . Inventory and monitoring of rare and vulnerable p lant species and communities are poorly funded at present. 5. We recommend establishing a research fund, administ ered by the State Botanist to address critical knowledge gaps for priority specie s . At present there are no specific funds available for research specifically directed at Maryland plants. 6. We recommend encouraging State conservation program s, including easement-based programs funded through Program Open Space, to targ et and design for the long- term conservation of significant botanical communit ies. 7. We recommend that DNR engage and perhaps formalize relationships with volunteer- based programs like the Maryland Master Naturalists to reduce the number of administrative hours shouldered by DNR biologists a nd ecologists . Administrative and database tasks usurp the time of specially trained professional DNR staff. We caution, however, that volunteers cannot perform every task and that there will be tradeoffs between work accomplished and an increase in the wo rkload to manage and coordinate those volunteers. 8. We recommend that dedicated funding be allocated to the Norton Brown Herbarium at the University of Maryland, College Park in orde r to maintain its critical functions. Recognizing the irreplaceable nature of the biodive rsity collection and the uncertainty regarding its future, we strongly recommend that th e State sustain essential funding for core staff comprising the director of the herbarium , a curator and collections manager. 9. We recommend considering an update to the list of N ontidal Wetlands of Special State Concern . This list, maintained by Maryland Department of t he Environment, identifies nontidal wetlands that are subject to mo re stringent review requirements than other nontidal wetlands, often resulting in protect ion for rare plant species and/or high quality natural communities. Recommendations to address the over-abundance of white-ta iled deer Effective control of white-tailed deer abundance is a necessity if we are to preserve Maryland's botanical and wildlife heritage. This challenging a nd complicated issue will require the cooperation of a broad range of partners including government agencies, sportsmen, farmers, and citizens seeking innovative ways to reduce deer num bers for the benefit of native habitats, suburban landscapes, the economy, public safety, an d the well being of Maryland's deer herd. The Maryland White-tailed Deer Plan 2009-2018 (here after referred to as the Plan) presents a thorough and comprehensive approach to a variety of management opportunities and techniques. The Work Group encourages DNR and other land manage rs (as applicable) to actively pursue these opportunities with emphasis on the following. 10 1. We recommend modifications in hunting laws/regulati ons/practices. This would include: season/bag limits adjustments to very loca lized flexibility (Community Based Deer Management), and adjusting safety zones for ar chery pursuits. 2. We recommend increased outreach and education on Ma ryland's Landowner Liability and Recreational Access Law. Private landowners are more likely to invite hunters onto their lands if they are aware of the p rotection from liability that this law affords. 3. We recommend encouraging efforts by state lands man agers to reduce white-tailed deer damage on public lands. This may be done, for example, by increasing hunter access, giving more hunters more time afield, and b y developing management plans directed at restoring regeneration of forest trees and other native plants . 4. We recommend encouraging and facilitating more mana ged deer hunt programs with volunteer hunters and more programs with certified sharp shooters after regular seasons . 5. We recommend investigating and as appropriate imple menting methods to increase donation of harvested deer for community food banks and homeless shelters. 6. We recommend fostering education, public awareness, and endorsement of hunting as a management tool necessary for habitat conservatio n, protection and control of the deer herd, and for the positive impact of hunting o n State and local economies . 7. We recommend continuing to monitor research and dev elopment in deer biological fertility controls . While unlikely to be effective to treat Maryland' s large, free-ranging white-tailed deer population, fertility management could have a role, albeit a limited one, among various management techniques. The Work Group also makes the following recommendat ion. 8. We recommend an investigation under DNR's leadershi p of permitting a regulated commercial market in Maryland for wild-harvested ve nison, with input and open discussion from all interested stakeholders . Input from DNR advisory committees, other stakeholders within state government, sportsmen and conservation groups, as well as non- traditional partners, may provide the way in which over-saturated bag limits per hunter (as viewed by some) can benefit the State, native habit ats, and the local economy. Recommendations to combat the threat of invasions by non- native species The spread and the establishment of invasive specie s is altering and destroying Maryland's botanical heritage and natural ecosystems, as well as inflicting major and long-lasting harm to the State's agriculture, human health and economy. 1. We recommend that resources be allocated and priori tized toward prevention, early detection and rapid response to control newly intro duced or discovered invasive species before they have a chance to spread, become entrenched and are exorbitantly costly to control. Some portion of these resources should be designat ed for mapping invasive species on and adjacent to high priority s ites. An emergency response system 11 similar to the Incident Command System and an emerg ency pool of funds to use for immediate control work should be established. 2. We recommend that Maryland State agencies continue to participate in the Maryland Invasive Species Council (MISC). Although an informal organization, MISC is able to function as a coordinating body for emergency respo nse to new invasive species, as a consensus-building organization, and as an informat ion resource. 3. We recommend increased support of research on and i mplementation of invasive species biological controls and organism release pr ograms . The existing program within Maryland Department of Agriculture (MDA) has been significantly cut in recent years and should be restored at least to prior leve ls. 4. We recommend increased support of research on the d irect and indirect impacts of invasive species on native species and ecosystems . Research documenting and detailing the characteristics of invasive species and the har m they inflict would greatly assist in planning and funding invasive species control effor ts. 5. We recommend funding for additional ongoing assess ments by the Invasive Plant Advisory Committee and for inspections by MDA under Maryland's Invasive Plants Prevention and Control Act . Currently, funding is only available for one year for assessments of non-native plants likely to be invas ive and thus subject to regulation under the law. MDA will ultimately assume responsibility for enforcement as part of its regular nursery inspection program along with the existing responsibilities of nursery inspectors. If inspections are to continue at the current frequenc y (already reduced from prior years), additional staff will be needed. 6. We recommend that Maryland citizens be encouraged a nd provided with incentives to become involved in stewardship of lands adjoining h igh priority natural areas . This is to ensure that invasive species are eradicated or r educed to a maintenance level so that they do not serve as sources for reinvasion of targeted conservation areas. 7. We recommend establishment of a staff position for invasive species education in University of Maryland Extension Service programs i ncluding Master Gardeners . Public awareness, especially among gardeners, is es sential to lessen the spread of non- native invasive species. Recommendations to increase the use of native plants in re storation and landscaping The use of native plants in restoration, landscapin g, and gardening should be encouraged in order to enhance biodiversity in partial compensation for the loss of natural biodiversity, and to avoid spreading non-native invasive species. This include s planting under the auspices of State agencies such as the State Highway Administration ( SHA) and Maryland Department of the Environment (MDE). 1. We recommend continuing coordination among MDE, DNR and SHA with respect to state-sponsored planting protocols where appropriat e . Those agencies recognize the value of using native plants where possible for res toration, roadsides, and other situations, and the need to avoid invasive non-native plants. 12 2. We recommend supporting programs to encourage la ndowners to maintain gardens and landscapes for the benefit of native wildlife a nd to avoid invasive non-native plants. Although there has been coordinated outreach to lan downers, many members of the public remain unaware of the effects\u2014both negat ive and positive\u2014of private gardens and landscapes on our natural environment. Proactiv e strategies will be required to address this information gap. 3. We recommend discussion among MDA, SHA, MDE, and DN R of the potential for an enhanced native plant and seed industry in Maryland . Based on examples from other states and preliminary research in Maryland, there may be potential for the State, in partnership with industry, to assist in the develop ment of an enhanced native plant and seed industry to serve Maryland customers, potentia lly benefitting native plant conservation and local business as well as Maryland consumers. It is understood that further development and enhancement of a Maryland-b ased native plant and seed industry should be industry driven and that additional dedic ated funding for state agencies to providing testing, certification, licensing, and ot her support functions will be required for program creation and development. A possible model is included as Appendix 4. Figure 4.

The current character of Maryland's natural environment is not only a tale of habitat loss through direct conversion, fragmentation and unwitting destruction by development and altered landscapes in modernity but also a tale of Maryland's historical landscape and the ebb and flow of climatic shifts in geological time. The Wildlife and Heritage Service of Maryland's Department of Natural Resources is responsible for the identification, ranking, and protection of rare and endangered species and natural communities in Maryland. The Service currently lists 710 plant species, using a classification system that condenses a large quantity of useful information into shorthand form. Nearly 28% of Maryland's plant species are listed as rare, threatened, endangered, or extirpated. Due to historical differences in the treatment of plants and animals, plants receive less conservation protection and less funding than animals. Thus, although active conservation efforts can be successful, especially if supported by research, it is often impossible to do otherwise than simply observe and record the permanent disappearance of our botanical heritage. Why are there so many rare plants in Maryland? This simple question is answered by looking at the breadth of native plant 1 communities that are contained within our boundaries. Maryland's contrib ution to regional biodiversity is far greater than its small size would suggest. Maryland ranks a mong the smaller states (42/50), and when compared with our close neighbors, Pennsylvania and Virginia, we are not only smaller, we are more densely populated (U.S. Census 2010). Yet Mary land tracks some 710 taxa of rare, threatened and endangered plant species, almost as many as Pennsylvania (793), which is 4 times the size of Maryland and not far from the number tr acked by Virginia (909), which is more than 3 times the size of Maryland (PA Natural Heritage P rogram; VA Natural Heritage Resources). Owing to Maryland's latitude, its plant communities contain elements of both northern and southern floras. Owing to its longitude, Maryland i ntercepts six distinctly different ecological regions from the barrier islands along the Atlantic Coast west to the high elevations of the Allegheny Plateau. (See map in Appendix 2.) Additional floristic complexity is due to the ebb a nd flow of climatic changes over geological time. Maryland was located south of the limit of gl aciers during the Pleistocene Epoch (ending 11,700 years before present (ybp)) and served as a refuge for migrating plant and animal species. Many of these remain as part of our botanical herit age today. More recent climatic changes are also evidenced in our flora. During the interval en ding 3200 ybp, Maryland was much warmer and much drier than it is today. Species from the m idwestern prairies became part of the 1 In the context of this Report, a 'native' plant is one that occurs naturally in the State without direct or indirect human intervention. 14 Maryland flora, and many of those species remain in unique natural communities today (Droege et al. 2009). Finally, the flora has been modified by centuries of habitation, not only by European and African settlers, but earlier by Native America ns who farmed, hunted and actively managed the Maryland landscape (Anderson et al. 1999, Curry 1992). The character of Maryland's pre-settlement (pre-163 4) forests and the degree of active management by fire or clearing by Native Americans is a matter of some controversy. Brush (2001) suggests that with the exception of serpenti ne barrens and tidal marshes the early settlers encountered a densely forested landscape. Droege et al. (2009) suggested that sites along the Patuxent River were open sandy barrens and woodland s due to intensive management by Native Americans. Early settlers sometimes commented on the densely f orested landscape (Frick et al. 1987): \"all the low land [referring to the general landsca pe of the Coastal Plain] is verry woody like one continued forrest, no part clear but what is cleared by the English. An tho we are pretty closely seated, yett we cannot see our n ext neighborurs house for the trees.\" Others characterized the landscape as being foreste d by large widely spaced trees (3 March 1634, A Briefe Relation of the Voyage unto Maryland, MSA SC 2221-17-5). \"there are noe marshes or swampes about it, but so lid firme ground, with great variety of woode, not choaked vp with vndershrubs, but comm only so farre distant from each other as a coach and fower horses may travale witho ut molestation.\" Colonists living in the upper bay along the Susqueh anna River reported entering a great expanse of barren lands (Marye 1955, Porter 1975): \"from the headwaters of the Patapsco, Gunpowder an d Bush River west to the Monocacy there lay a vast body of barrens with no t imber thereon.\" These barrens as mapped (Porter 1975) extended from the Susquehanna and north of Baltimore west across Harford, Baltimore and Carroll Counties to the headwaters of the Monocacy River. So impressive was this expanse that some scholars h ave concluded that the barrens were responsible for delayed settlement of western Maryl and (Porter 1979). They likely attributed the barrenness of the landscape to lack of fertility bu t it is more probable that the barrens were simply a large area burned over by Native Americans in pursuit of game (Porter 1979, Tyndall 2005). These differences between observations may l ie not so much in a comprehensive characterization of the land but in the perception of peoples living in different parts of Maryland, who had no maps but a necessary awareness of their own local geography. Estimates of the number of Native Americans histori cally living along the Chesapeake Bay varies greatly among scholars and ranges from 8000 to over 50,000 (Feest 1978, MSA SC 2221- 17-1). The actual population is less important than the impact that these peoples had upon the landscape. The presence of the \"great barrens\" (Mar ye 1955) suggests that, at least in some parts of Maryland, they managed large areas. Whatever the impact of Native American populations on the landscape, it ended abruptly as evidenced by th is chilling passage in a letter dated 23 January 1698 (Letter from Hugh Jones (Calvert County, Maryl and) to Benjamin Woodroffe, Principal of Gloucester Hall, Oxford, England. 23 January 1698): \"as for our predecessors, the Indians, I cannot giv e you at present any further account of them than this, viszt. that whereas att the first s eating of Maryland there were several 15 nations of Indians in the country governed by sever al petty Kings, now I doe not thinke that there are five hundred fightinge men of them i n the province , and those are most on the Eastern Shore where they have two or three l ittle towns\" . . . . \"the swept away a great many , so that now the y are dwindled to almost to nothing.\" Sources of complexity in Maryland flora Summary: To understand the complexity of the Maryland flora, it helps to look at some particular kinds of examples. These are the disjunct species, the peripheral species, and species that occupy singular or regionally endemic ecosystems. A few illustrative examples are provided for each. Disjunct plant species Summary: \"Disjunct\" plant species make an important contribution to Maryland's complex flora. These are species that occur with marked geographic separation from their core species range and these populations may be ecologically divergent as well. This phenomenon is often explained by long-distance species migrations during major historical climatic shifts, and these shifts contributed to Maryland's botanical diversity in significant ways. What follows are some of the best-studied and most compelling examples. One of the more striking Maryland disjuncts is the Nantucket shadbush ( Amelanchier nantucketensis ) (Figure 6). This species occurs discontinuously a long the Atlantic Coast from Nova Scotia to Long Island, New York, and was once considered restricted to the previously glaciated regions of New England. (With rare except ions this remains true.) In Maryland this species occurs in a relict population in the Potoma c Gorge along the ancient bedrock terrace forests and outcrops of Mather Gorge. These habitat s perhaps mimicked the rocky, barren habitats of New England upon retreat of the ice she ets and likely served as a refuge during the last glacial maximum. Whatever the mechanistic deta ils of the species arrival in Maryland, the presence of this species is fascinating not only to the bio-geographer but to anyone having the imagination to conjure up a landscape containing ma mmoths and bison. This general pattern is reflected in the distributi on of the federally endangered swamp pink (Helonias bullata ) (Figure 6). This plant occurs along the Fall Line (where Piedmont gives way to the Coastal Plain) in Maryland in a series of se epage swamps (with surface flow of spring-fed water). This population is now widely disjunct from the most genetically diverse populations located in the Southern Appalachians (Godt et al. 1 995, Hamrick and Godt 1996). 16 Figure 6. Three of Maryland's rare disjunct species . From left to bullata , Photo by Kerry Wixted. One of the most influential climatic events on Mary land's flora was the pronounced warming period called the Hypsothermal Interval during whic h some midwestern plant species expanded their ranges eastward. The average temperature duri ng this interval may have been up to 5\u00b0 F warmer than today and precipitation levels may have dropped by as much as 25%. Consequently, a number of species more frequently associated with midwestern prairies now occur in Maryland in disjunct populations. An example is pale false f oxglove ( Agalinis skinneriana ), which occurs in Maryland in small populations in sandy barrens o f the Coastal Plain. Pettingill and Neel (2008) found that the plants occurring in Dorcheste r County on Maryland's Eastern Shore were genetic sisters to a population of plants from Miss ouri. The core range of A. skinneriana is in the central United States. The Maryland flora also contains populations of mid western species that are large enough or extend over such a significant geographic area as t o be considered a separate part of the species range. For example, Virginia nailwort ( Paronychia virginica ) occurs in disparate zones, one centered around the Potomac River (MD, VA, WV), one in northern Georgia and Alabama and one zone around Missouri and Arkansas (NatureServe 2013). The final example, showy goldenrod ( Solidago speciosa ) (Figure 6) relates to modification of the environment by Native Americans and is an example o f a within-state disjunct. This species was long-thought to be restricted to southern Maryland in prairie-like habitats persisting in artificially maintained right of ways. However, McAvoy and Harri son (2012) discovered the species over Native American shell-middens on the Eastern Shore. This finding is fascinating because the shell-middens were manmade, created by dumping oyst er shell in the same locations over thousands of years\u2014time enough for these habitats t o intercept and retain elements of an advancing western flora. 17 Peripheral plant species Summary: Maryland's latitude places it at the southern end of northeastern ecosystems and the northern end of southeastern ecosystems. Whether a species hails from the north or the south, the Maryland flora is replete with examples of species at or near their natural range limits, in what biologists call \"peripheral\" populations. The famous English naturalist John Ray (1627-1705) illustrated a new world plant species delivered to him from the Maryland colony in 1688. The species was Spanish moss ( Tillandsia usneoides ) and within the Maryland catalogue Ray also discus ses Galax ( Galax urceolata ) (Brown et al. 1987). According to Brown et al. (198 7), \"apparently the colonial naturalists collected only on the coastal plain of Maryland. . . [Most importantly,] as the geographic attributions accompanying their specimens always refer to Maryland, we can only conclude that the species known today only from southeastern Virginia must have occurred in Marylan d in the past.\" (p 248) These examples are extraordinary not only because n either species has been seen in Maryland for centuries but also because both of these species ve ry likely reached their northern range limits in Maryland. The mountains of Garrett County provide excellent e xamples of northern species that occur in peripheral populations. Some of the more striking e xamples are buckbean ( Taxus canadensis ) (Figure 7). Both of these species are restricted to Garrett County near the southern ends of their natu ral ranges. Maryland populations of buckbean and Canada yew form part of these species discontin uous southern ranges. The Coastal Plain contains multiple examples of species reaching both their southern and northern range limits. For example, northern golden heather ( Hudsonia ericoides ) a common low shrub ranging from Newfoundland through New England, is restricted to southern Maryland at its southern range limit (Weakley 2010 reports a single disjunct locat ion in South Carolina). Pondspice ( Litsea aestivalis ) (Figure 8), a rare southeastern coastal shrub, is found at a single station on the Eastern Shore at its northern range limit. A final example, sourwood ( Oxydendrum arboreum ), may reflect two different periods of migration. A chara cteristic and common subcanopy tree south of Maryland, the few, scattered Maryland records repre sent remnant populations near the northern range limit. Figure 7.

Soldiers Delight Natural Environmental Area is an outstanding example. Of the \"Great Barrens\" of Maryland (Marye 1955) tha t at one time covered approximately 250,000 acres (Tyndall 2005), a remnant of about 10 00 acres remains at Soldier's Delight Natural Environmental Area (SD). SD is a landscape of natural grasslands and oak savanna over the largest outcrop of serpentine in the eastern Un ited States (Tyndall 2005). Now heavily fragmented and greatly altered by fire suppression and the resulting invasion by Virginia pine (Pinus virginiana ), it remains a singular plant community occupied b y a number of very rare plant species. Among these species are excellent ex amples of peripheral and disjunct plant species. For example, SD holds the nation's largest populati on of the federally endangered sandplains gerardia ( Agalinis acuta ). This species is distributed in a series of disju nct populations from the District of Columbia (historical) and Maryland nort h to Massachusetts. Several sedge species are nearly restricted to the SD grasslands. Mead's sedg e ( Carex meadii ) occurs at SD in the state's viable population and Richardson's sedge ( Carex richardsonii ) is entirely restricted to SD. Both species are components of mi dwestern prairies and occur in Maryland as populations disjunct from their core ranges. Additi onally, SD contains the largest population of interior sedge ( Carex interior ), a peripheral species (from the north) that addit ionally represents an interesting ecological shift in the species habi tat. C. interior occurs as a very common wetland plant in the northeastern United States but has hig hly restricted habitat in Maryland occurring only in sites with ultramafic (high nutrient conten t of the soils) substrates like serpentine and diabase. This latter situation is illustrative of t he concept behind state ranks, which is to capture as much of the adaptive genetic variation in specie s as possible, thus potentially allowing the species to adapt to changes in climate or other ant hropogenic changes in habitat. The character of the soils, particularly those soil s rich in calcium, gives rise to a number of diverse plant communities. For example, limestone b luffs and rich forests in the limestone region of Maryland (essentially the northern extension of the Blue Ridge in Washington County) are unparalleled in overall species richness. Engelhard t (2004) found over 110 species of vascular plants in a single 20 x 50 meter plot along Antieta m Creek in Washington County. Many of the Figure 8. Pondspice, Litsea aestivalis , a rare southeastern coastal shrub is found at a single station on the Eastern Shore at its northern range limit. Photo by Christopher Frye. 19 rare plants at this location are obligate occurs in large populations along with a profusio n of wildflowers. Calcium-bearing soils in dry, exposed habitats such as cliffs or steep slopes also give rise to unique plant communities. For example, arbor-vitae ( Thuja occidentalis ), a nearly ubiquitous species of bogs and wetlands in the northeastern Un ited States, is highly restricted to limestone bluffs and outcrops, particularly along the Potomac River. The globally rare tall larkspur (Delphinium exaltatum ) occurs in limestone woodlands along with a variet y of habitat-restricted species including the running serviceberry ( Amelanchier humilis ), which reaches its southern range limit in Maryland and adjacent West Virginia. Some plant communities have been entirely extirpate d, not during pre-colonial times but recently. These \"historical\" plant communities may only be reconstructed through the cataloging of museum specimens. For example, during a period r anging from approximately 1888 to 1921 a number of species were collected in the vicinity of Mountain Lake Park in the southern Garrett County. Amongst these species were Kalm's brome of these species has been seen since 192 1. In association with these collections we find multiple collections of the sta te-endangered Indian paint brush ( Castilleja coccinea ), along with a group of species tirpated including ( Gentiana puberula ). this prairie-like grassland and calci um-rich wetland\u2014now extirpated by the construction of a reservoir and use of the area as a landfill. Regionally endemic plant communities Summary: An \"endemic\" native plant community is one that occurs in only one location on earth. Several of these are known in Maryland. In all likelihood, others have been lost without ever having been discovered. Of the native plant communities endemic to the regi on, the intertidal habitats (occurring along the shorelines between low and high tides) along th e Chesapeake Bay and its tidal tributaries comprise a distinctive set of globally rare and nea a wetland shrub restricted to tidal rivers on the Eastern Shore and Delaware. Two other subspecies have disjunct popula tions occurring (ssp. oklahomensis ). This odd distribution is thought to be the resul t of range retraction during a glacial epoch leaving stranded populations in disparate locations that have now diverged genetically and ecologically (Sch rader and Graves 2004). Another globally rare species is the regional endemic Maryland bur-m arigold ( Bidens bidentoides ) that occurs in the upper Chesapeake Bay, Delaware Bay and few stat ions in New Jersey and New York. Maryland has the lead responsibility for ranking th is species as Maryland populations comprise the bulk of individuals within its narrow range. Al so in intertidal habitats lives federally threatened sensitive joint-vetch ( Aeshynomene virginica ), which occurs from New Jersey south to North Carolina but is currently extant in only 2 0 locations (NatureServe 2013). Additionally, the Chesapeake Bay contains many relatively common species that occur over vast areas in freshwater, brackish water and saltwater marshes. On the Eastern Shore of Maryland occur a group of n atural wetlands called Delmarva Bays. These are shallow, seasonally flooded, freshwater w etlands that are generally small (< 1 acre) but 20 numerous, with an estimated 1500-2500 ponds present on the Delmarva Peninsula (McAvoy and Bowman 2002). The plants of these bays are adapted to a seasonal drawdown of the groundwater with extreme variation in dominant species. Early i n the spring when the bays are full they appear like any other pond with emergent and floati ng vegetation. The same bay may appear to be grassland in late summer and fall with a complet ely different set of dominant species. The species composition is zonal, from open grassy swal es dominated by herbaceous species near the center of the pond to forested wetlands around thei r perimeters. According to McAvoy and Bowman (2002) Delmarva Bays harbor 45 rare and unco mmon species, eight globally rare species and the federally endangered Canby's dropwo rt ( Oxypolis canbyi ); the latter occurs in a single pond in Queen Anne's County. One of the more intriguing globally rare plants is the diminutive Harper's fimbristylis ( Fimbristylis perpusilla ). This is a tiny, inconspicuous grass- like plant growing only a few inches tall that is r estricted to the very center (the lowest elevation) of the ponds. It may grow thickly in the exposed mu ddy soil\u2014but only in those years where the ponds are completely dry. The total habitat area fo r this species may be less than a half-acre with each pond contributing a few square feet! This plan t ranges from Maryland south to Georgia, a typical distribution for plants of Delmarva Bays (M cAvoy and Bowman 2002). On the other end of the spectrum is rose coreopsis ( Coreopsis rosea ) (Figure 9), a lovely aster-like plant that is restricted to only two ponds on the Eastern Shore. Figure 9. Two species found in regionally endemic p lant communities. (left) Rare and threatened Kate's-mountain clover, Trifolium virginicum , endemic to shale barrens. Photo by Christopher Frye; (right) Rare an d endangered Rose coreopsis, Coreopsis rosea , known from two Delmarva Bays on the Eastern Shore , endemic to Bay wetlands. Photo by Wesley Knapp. At the other extreme, Maryland contains part of the biodiversity zone known as the Mid- Appalachian Shale Barrens. These extremely dry and sun-baked barrens and woodlands contain 18 species found nowhere outside of the narrow Appa lachian range from southwestern Pennsylvania, Maryland, western Virginia and adjace nt West Virginia (Keener 1983). The flagship species of the shale barrens is a native c lover called Kate's-mountain clover ( Trifolium virginicum ) (Figure 9). Maryland contains almost 100 populati ons of this species in a narrow ~18 kilometer-wide zone in Allegany and Washington C ounties. The plants that live in these harsh habitats are obligate sun-lovers and are into lerant of shade. Kate's-mountain clover grows in exposed beds of shale with little to no soil dev elopment. Other species endemic to the shale barrens are the aptly-named shale ). In the stream 21 valleys where nutrients accumulate and soil moistur e is less limiting, this narrow region of Maryland contains some of the most diverse displays of native wildflowers in the state. Continuing discovery Summary: A surprising number of plant species are still being discovered. Although it is impossible to prove, it is a certainty that we have lost species from the State that we never knew and will never know existed. Given the threats outlined in this Report it is more critical than ever to find and protect the rare flora of the State. In 2011 Knapp et al. reported fifteen new native ad ditions or rediscoveries to the flora of Maryland. In 2012 and 2013 an additional 9 species have been documented. Nearly all of these discoveries are or will be treated as rare, threate ned or endangered. Among these discoveries are species in groups one would think have been thoroug hly explored such as orchids and tree species. Numerous recent discoveries also mark rang e extensions that would also be considered noteworthy from a conservation standpoint. Figure 10.

In Maryland, the Nongame and Endangered Species Conservation Act defines criteria for listing for both plant and animal species in need of conservation attention. The lead agency with this responsibility is the Wildlife and Heritage Service within DNR, which maintains a database of natural areas and occurrences of rare, threatened and endangered plant and animal species. This database is aligned with an international network (the Natural Heritage Network). Funding for conservation work on plants is largely limited to one source, the Chesapeake Bay and Endangered Species Fund, generated from state tax check-off revenue. Because of its origins in the Teddy Roosevelt era a nd the nature of formative initiatives such as the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, most conservation po licy and law deals with animals rather than plants. Under the North American model for conserva tion, various units of government were established under the Department of the Interior in order to address specific priorities: The Forest Service would provide healthy forests for the produ ction of timber, the Park Service would take care of the parks, and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife S ervice would deal with fish and wildlife. Lands not managed by one of these three agencies wo uld be under the purview of the Bureaus of Land Management and Reclamation. When the Federal Endangered Species Act became law in 1973, protection was provided to animals as populations and individuals, but not to the plant communities that comprised their habitat. Since the Act's inception, plants have bee n added to the federal endangered species list, but with lower standards of protection. Today most federal funding for unique species is specifically designated for animals or even for \"bi rds and mammals\" only. Similarly, in Maryland's version of the Endangered Species Act, while wildlife are well provided with protections (from some activities), plants are effectively left to the discretion of a property owner who may destroy them under most circumstances if that is his wish. Federal and state wildlife laws in the United States have their origi ns in old English common law where the King and Parliament owned the wild animals and prescribe d the ways that ordinary citizens could harvest them on all lands, public or private. By co ntrast, plants were considered to be a part of the land on which they grew and thus plants on priv ate lands were treated as the owner's private property. The primary State law (enacted in 1975) that allows and governs the listing of endangered species is the Nongame and Endangered Species Conse rvation Act (Annotated Code of Maryland 10-2A-01). The Act is supported by regulat ions (Code of Maryland Regulations 08.03.08) that define listing criteria for endanger ed, threatened and endangered extirpated species, establishes the purpose and intent of coll ecting permits and lists prohibited activities. Again, plants on private lands are viewed as the ow ner's property. In contrast, on public lands, 23 State agencies tasked with management of those prop erties are required to take into account the presence of threatened and endangered plant species during project reviews. Maryland land planning efforts have historically ac counted for sites containing protected species relatively late in the planning process, as road de signs, industrial development, or subdivision plans were reviewed. The news of the presence of un ique habitats or rare species generally has been an unpleasant surprise for permit applicants. Recent efforts by Maryland state government to highlight these areas, notably the 'Green Infras tructure\" model, have made the locations of many unique natural communities available to county planning and zoning departments. In some areas, this information is being incorporated into local master plans, but county use of the data is not uniform. The threats to Maryland's botanical heritage, and t herefore to its wildlife heritage, are not news. Recognizing this, the General Assembly and the Gove rnor have assigned to state agencies numerous responsibilities to manage, control, and a lleviate the forces that threaten our state's biodiversity. Since 1979, the Wildlife and Heritage Service (the \"Service\") within DNR has been the lead state agency responsible for the identification, ra nking, protection and management of rare and endangered species and natural communities in Maryl and. 2 The Service seeks to identify and sustain populations of rare plants and animals thro ugh the maintenance of healthy natural ecosystems. The Service also reviews proposed devel opment projects for potentially harmful effects on rare species. The Service maintains a da tabase of natural areas and occurrences of rare, threatened and endangered plant and animal species. This database is aligned with an international network (the Natural Heritage Network ) that tracks and monitors species using identical methodologies, nomenclature, and units of measure across all fifty states, Canada and Latin America. In Maryland, the Service has documen ted approximately 720 sites that support unique habitat for either plants or animals. Moreov er, habitats that support rare animals without the support of specialized plant communities are a small component of these sites. Plant communities are generally the baseline fabric of na tural communities that support both rare plants and animals. The Service provides recommendations for the conser vation of rare plant species and plant communities through its coordination and advisory r ole with other agencies in environmental review. Maryland Department of the Environment (MDE ) and other regulatory agencies and programs provide some opportunity for rare plant an d plant community conservation, though plant conservation is one of numerous consideration s. The Tidal Wetlands, Nontidal Wetlands and Waterway Construction statutes and regulations, implemented by MDE, include such considerations and often require project re-design to address concerns related to protection of designated plants which are state endangered or thr eatened. MDE screens all project applications for the presence of rare species and coordinates wi th DNR on protective measures to balance these concerns with goals of applicants. Nontidal W etland regulations also designate certain wetlands as \"Nontidal Wetlands of Special State Con cern,\" which include wetlands of unique natural community types and rare plant speci es. These wetlands are surrounded by a regulated 100-foot buffer and are subject to more s tringent review requirements than other nontidal wetlands. 2 Direct responsibility for these functions lies wit h the Maryland Natural Heritage Program, a component of the Wildlife and Heritage Service. 24 It is critical to understand that funds for work on rare plants are largely limited to one source, the Chesapeake Bay and Endangered Species F und, generated from state tax check- off revenues, with much smaller contributions from federal sources for federally endangered or threatened species only. Over the years, the resources available for conserv ation efforts by state agencies have continually dwindled to the point where tasks that Maryland cit izens would expect to be done cannot be done. Insufficient resources are available for the most basic of conservation tasks: surveying plant populations to detect and assess changes, thr eats and long-term trends; data collection and inventory; monitoring and managing existing plant c onservation efforts; and outreach to landowners to encourage conservation on private lan d. This results in insufficient protection status for many plant species and populations, and inadequate protection for those species identified as in need of protection. In some cases, the Wildlife and Heritage Service ma y work with other agencies within DNR, with private organizations, or with other federal f unding sources to purchase properties supporting natural communities, restore natural com munities that support rare plants and animals, or to fund other projects involving both r are plants and animals. By focusing energies on those plants, animals and natural areas that are most in danger of disappearing, the Service attempts to ensure that these essential elements of Maryland's diverse biological heritage do not vanish from our landscape.

The current RTE list comprises some 710 species, subspecies and varieties. In order to quickly relate information on the level of rarity and endangerment of species, the RTE list uses a set of shorthand metrics. These metrics communicate two basic pieces of information: (1) the conservation rank, a generalized measure of rarity; and (2) conservation status, a declaration of legal status through the familiar terms, threatened and endangered. Conservation Ranks and Conservation Status Conservation ranks are arranged along a simple numerical scale (1-5) with the lower numbers reflecting increasing rarity. Conservation ranks al so present geographic information about rarity. State ranks (S ranks) communicate the rarity of the species in the State whereas global ranks (G ranks) communicate the rarity of the species throug hout its range (although the term \"global\" is used, most species are far from being globally dist ributed). The rank of a species is determined through analyses of population number, size, viabil ity, threats and trends among other things. The final metric, a combination of the numeric inde x (1-5) and the geographic identifier (G or S) distills this large amount of information into a si ngle metric. By analogy, sports statistics don't relate everything about a player, but they provide an index so that one can visualize how a particular player compares with others. State ranks for many species are modified annually, and status is reviewed every 2-5 years or as needed. Thus, for a particular plant species that has a glo bal rank of G1 and a state rank of S1 the species is not only rare within Maryland but also rare with in its entire range. Similarly, a plant species with ranks of G5 and S5 relate that the plant is co mmon in Maryland and demonstrably secure in its global range. Definitions of conservation ranks are presented in Table 1. All states (and Canadian provinces) use the same ranking system and format. This allows comparisons across the political and geographic landscape and it is on e of the most powerful aspects of the network of State Natural Heritage Programs. Conservation status presents a simple hierarchy of endangerment in thr ee, mostly familiar, categories: threatened (the lowest status), endange red (the highest status), and endangered- extirpated (a category unique to Maryland). Definit ions of conservation statuses are presented in Table 2. All species listed as threatened and endan gered at the federal level are also listed by individual states where the species occurs. This pr ovides a segue into the statistics of the current Maryland RTE plant list. (For a more detailed expla nation of the operation and utility of the RTE Plant List, see Appendix 3.) 26 Table 1. Definitions of Global (G) and State (S) Co nservation Ranks. The conservation rank of a species is designated by a number from 1 to 5, preceded by a letter reflecting the appropriate geographic scale of the assessment (G = Global and S = Subnational/State or Province). Rank Definition GX or SX Presumed Extirpated \u2014Species believed to be extirpated from the jurisdi ction (i.e., nation, or state/province). Not located despite intensive sear ches of historical sites and other appropriate habi tat, and virtually no likelihood that it will be redisco vered. GH or SH Possibly Extirpated \u2014Known from only historical records but still some hope of rediscovery. There is evidence that the species may no longer be present in the jurisdiction, but not enough to state this w ith certainty.. G1 or S1 Highly Rare and Critically Imperiled \u2014At very high risk of extinction or elimination due to very restricted range, very few populations or occurrenc es, very steep declines, very severe threats, or ot her factors. Typically occurring in fewer than 5 popula tions. G2 or S2 Rare and Imperiled \u2014At high risk of extinction or elimination due to r estricted range, few populations or occurrences, steep declines, severe threats, or other factors. Typically occurring in 6 to 20 popul ations. G3 or S3 Rare to Uncommon and Vulnerable \u2014At moderate risk of extinction or elimination due to a fairly restricted range, relatively few populations or occ urrences, recent and widespread declines, threats, or other factors. Typically occurring in 21-80 populat ions. G4 or S4 Apparently Secure \u2014At fairly low risk of extinction or elimination du e to an extensive range and/or many populations or occurrences, but with possible cause for some concern as a result of local recent declines, threats, or other factors. G5 or S5 Secure\u2014 At very low risk of extinction or elimination due t o a very extensive range, abundant populations or occurrences, and little to no concer n from declines or threats. Table 2. Definitions of State and Federal Status. State Status Definition Endangered (E) A species whose continued existence as a viable com ponent of the State's flora is determined to be in jeopardy. Threatened (T) A species that appears likely within the foreseeabl e future to become endangered in the State. Endangered- Extirpated (X) A species that was once a viable component of the f lora of the State but for which no naturally occurring populations are known to exist. Federal Status Definition Endangered (LE) Listed as endangered under the federal Endangered S pecies Act; in danger of extinction throughout all or a significant portion of their ra nge. Threatened (LT) Listed as threatened under the federal Endangered S pecies Act; likely to become endangered within the foreseeable future throughout all or a significant portion of their range. 27 What can be learned from lists of rare, threatened and endangered plants SUMMARY: Nearly 28% of Maryland's flora\u2014710 species\u2014are rare, threatened, endangered or extirpated (RTE). Of these, 343 are classified as rare, meaning that they occur in fewer than 5 populations, and 48 are considered historical or extirpated. DNR's Wildlife and Heritage Service is solely responsible for the listing, management and recovery of all RTE species. This is a significant challenge, especially considering that these species are scattered across Maryland in hundreds of individual sites and populations. A breakdown of the Maryland flora according to both rank and status is presented in Figure 12. From this figure we see that the largest wedge in t he pie presents the good news: 72% of the Maryland flora isn't rare. The bad news is that nearly 28% of the Maryland flo ra is rare, threatened, endangered, or endangered-extirpated. Figure 12. Breakdown of the Maryland Flora by Rank and Status. (Based upon an estimate of 2500 vascular plants in the Flora). Twenty-eight percent represents 710 species. This n umber is striking. Consider that DNR's Wildlife and Heritage Service is solely responsible for the listing, management and recovery of all RTE species. The challenges in dealing with so many species become evident. Further, these species are scattered across Maryland in hundreds o f individual sites and populations, presenting logistical challenges for the small staff of the Se rvice's Natural Heritage Program. Figure 13 presents the breakdown of ranks for Maryl and's 710 rare plants. The largest category is S1 (47%), meaning that about 343 species occur i n fewer than 5 populations! Roughly 17% of the rare plants occur in fewer than 21 populations (S2) and 22% are considered vulnerable (S3). An astounding 14% of the rare plants are considered either historical (SH, 13%) or are considered extirpated (SX, 1%). 72% Endangered Threatened Endangered Extirpated Rare (S1-S3) Maryland Flora 28 Figure13. Distribution of Conservation Ranks for Ma ryland's Rare Plants. To illustrate some of the logistical and management challenges consider the following example of an S1 note: Critically endangered due to hab itat loss. Reduced to small, isolated fragments of habitat. Allegheny Plateau, Piedmont, Ridge and Valley* (phy siographic , Garrett). Indian-paintbrush is listed as endangered because o f habitat loss and from this example we understand that each population is likely small, oc curring in small and isolated fragments of prairie-like habitat from Carroll County west to Ga rrett County (extant) but occurred historically (indicated by asterisks) from Cecil and Frederick C ounties. Management at these locations requires many activities including managed grazing, invasive species control, and annual mowing as well as general monitoring of the populat ions (stem counts, flowering and seed production, etc.). For the present time, the Wildli fe and Heritage Service is rarely able to undertake such activities due to lack of resources. Rather, the Service goes through a process of triage, taking those species in critical need first . The additional bad news is that some species will a lways be endangered or threatened, that is, recovery is not possible because either we do not u nderstand the reasons for population declines (that may be related to ecosystem function) or the habitat is so specific and so reduced that the population occurs only at one or a few stations. This is a dismal assessment but it is made from a p articular frame of reference; chiefly that specific plant conservation projects are difficult if not impossible to fund under the prevailing wildlife-centric budget. Thus, plant conservation p roceeds with individual efforts, but with a botanically oriented staff of 6, most of whom perfo rm many other functions. Efforts dedicated to plant conservation are necessarily limited. However, there are species for which conservation e fforts have proven not only efficacious but have resulted in population growth. For example, re storation of serpentine grassland and savanna at Soldier's Delight has resulted in a stable popul ation of the federally endangered sandplain Distributions ) that is the largest population in the United Stat es. Restoration of bog turtle wetlands in the Maryland Piedmont has stabil ized an otherwise declining population of Canada burnet ( Sanguisorba canadensis ). Woody plant management at an inland sand ridge s ite has resulted in the State's largest population of s undial lupine ( Lupinus perennis ) as well as the largest, most viable population of a globally rare butterfly, the Frosted Elfin ( Calophyrs irus ), an obligate associate of (host plant). Conclusions concerning ongoing conservation of Mary land's rare, threatened and endangered plants Summary: The situation is dire for many of Maryland's plant species. At current funding and staffing levels, the Wildlife and Heritage Service struggles to accomplish the most basic tasks of monitoring and record keeping, and is able only occasionally to conduct conservation projects in the field. Moreover, the infrastructure needed to support plant conservation\u2014herbaria (collections of preserved plant specimens), and botanical/ecological research\u2014is crumbling. The Work Group's recommendations do not aspire to the ideal, but attempt to take the reality of budget limitations into consideration. We conclude that at the current level of support we will be unable to halt the movement of many species from rare to threatened to endangered simpl y for lack of adequate funding\u2014a point made clear almost two decades ago by Schemske et al. (19 94) and more recently by Stein and Gravuer (2008). These losses will occur as a result of incr easing urbanization, resulting in direct habitat conversion (immediate loss due to development), but also as a result of habitat fragmentation, competition and displacement by invasive species, a nd herbivory by white-tailed deer (longer- term losses). Other forms of loss, particularly the losses of individual populations where already rare species become numerically rarer, will also oc cur. Clearly loss of individual populations will occur due to direct development pressures but also and significantly because population-level processes of reproduction and recruitment will be a ltered. Detecting and mitigating these losses requires the kinds of monitoring and management tha t we usually are not able to perform. In addition, the Work Group is deeply concerned abo ut two extrinsic factors unrelated to actual species and population losses but nevertheless impa cting our ability to perform conservation work. The first factor regards the disappearance of biodiversity collections (herbaria). Natural history collections have long been indispensable re sources for studies of biodiversity, and the need to maintain them has recently taken on greater urgency. These collections offer a unique Figure 14. Rare and endangered sandplain gerardia, Agalinis acuta , is a singular disjunct species found at Soldiers Delight Natural Environmental Area. Conservation efforts have been successful, resulting in population growth. Photo by Wayne Tyndall. 30 perspective, providing data over a long time span. They are essential for the study of habitat loss and fragmentation, biological invasions, and the co nsequences of global climate change. Maryland's biodiversity collections that allow long -term analyses of botanical trends (including the DNA archived in those collections) seem to be p erpetually under threat of dismantlement. Where collections have been maintained, they are ma intained on a starvation diet of funding allowing little other than general maintenance. Muc h has been written about the values of those collections (Suarez and Tsutsui 2004). The second factor regards the attrition of botanica l capacity in our state universities and resource management agencies (Kramer et al. 2010). The outco me likely will be that new generations of conservation biologists are discouraged from enteri ng botany because of the lack of research funding. Certainly, without specific plant conserva tion funds, DNR is unable to support undergraduate and graduate research\u2014no matter how i ntegral the research questions might be to management or recovery of the species. Despite thes e limitations, DNR botanists work closely and collaboratively with faculty and staff of Maryl and universities but those relationships and the work performed are often based upon a spirit of vol unteerism and on shoestring budgets. Declining revenues in State budgets appear likely t o continue. Our recommendations reflect what we believe can be accomplished with existing resour ces, as well as with modestly enhanced funding or staff support. We recommend a thorough r evaluation of conservation priorities. Those priorities and our overall strategies are presented in following sections. 31 The Rapid Loss of Maryland's Native Plants and the Wildlife that Depends on Them Challenge: Habitat loss and fragmentation SUMMARY: There is widespread agreement that the loss of biodiversity on local, regional and global scales is driven by habitat loss and fragmentation due to development for commercial, agricultural, residential and industrial uses . The impact is not only on rare and uncommon species but also on what might be regarded as \"ordinary\" natural areas: those with relatively common plant and animal communities that still have great value, and that are rapidly becoming less common. Alleviating these effects implicates policy decisions that are, for the most part, beyond the scope of this Report. The Work Group supports ongoing efforts in Maryland to concentrate development in suitable areas, so as to protect plant and animal communities and to preserve natural plant and wildlife corridors. The scope and pace of development in Maryland Although landscape changes have always been part of the natural process, the colonization of Maryland in 1634 and subsequent settlements by Euro pean and African immigrants drastically impacted the ecological balance due to the rapid pa ce and scope of these activities (Maryland DNR 2005). Forests were cleared to make way for far ms and trees were felled to build cabins, furniture, and ships, and to provide fuel for a rap idly increasing population. Wetlands were ditched to enhance agricultural production and the natural creation of wetlands was seriously impacted by the dramatic harvest of beavers for the fur trade. Competition and impacts from non-native species also began, when colonists broug ht plants and animals from their homelands. With the industrial revolution came pollution that further degraded Maryland's streams and waterways. The remaining forests were logged to pro duce lumber and charcoal, and coal was extracted to power factories and railroads. Canals were dug for commerce and transportation and rivers were dammed for water supplies, flood contro l, and power plants. Channels were dredged through the estuaries to enhance shipping ports. Hi ghways were cut through mountains, and road networks fragmented natural habitats. Many of these same alterations to our environment h ave continued through modern times, exacerbated by Maryland's ever-growing human popula tion. Maryland is the fifth-most densely populated state in the nation. Its 2010 population of 5.8 million people lives on an average of just over one acre of land per person. Twenty-seven perc ent of the 6.2 million acres of land in the State has been developed, and much of the undevelop ed land is fragmented to the point where natural habitats cannot persist. More than 60% of t he developed land\u2014roughly 1 million acres\u2014 was developed since 1973, as illustrated below (Fig ure 15). In other words, it took three centuries to develop the first 650,000 acres of lan d in Maryland and 40 years to develop the next million . By 1993, both the state's forests and wetlands ha d been reduced by half (Weber 2003). 32 An assessment of development patterns in the state from 1997 to 2000 determined that western Maryland suffered the highest losses (over 8,600 ac res) of forests that were formerly large, contiguous forest blocks. Furthermore, an analysis of the risk of forest loss based on these development patterns found that the most likely cou nties to be further developed (to the detriment of these large forest blocks) are Cecil, Garrett, Howard, Montgomery, St. Mary's and Washington (Weber 2004). The decline of single family home construction duri ng the national recession of 2007-2009 has recently changed, with new home construction on the rise for the third year in a row. The largest component of new residential development is single- family home construction. During 2012, the building of 9,232 new single family homes was autho rized\u2014the highest number of single family homes since 2007 and an increase of 10% over the nu mber of houses authorized in 2011. Residential development has generally expanded outw ard in three waves: first to close-in suburbs bordering Baltimore and Washington, then in the outer ring of suburbs lining the beltways and radial highways, and most recently in far-flung exurbs in portions of Western Maryland, Southern Maryland, and the Eastern Shore. A similar pattern has occurred around smaller cities at a smaller scale, such as Salisbur y, Hagerstown, Bel Air, LaPlata and Frederick. These regional trends continued in new housing cons truction in 2012. Since the late 1960s, the average single-family hom e in Maryland has been built on a larger lot, from about one-third of an acre in the 1940s to abo ut two-thirds of an acre today, while the number of people living in each housing unit has de creased. This has translated into more homes that house fewer people and consume more land. If t rends continue, by 2035, the Maryland Department of Planning estimates that 491,000 housi ng units will be added, an additional 404,000 acres of land will be developed, and Maryla nd will lose an additional 226,000 acres of farmland and 176,000 acres of forest. More than 87 percent of these acres will be converted to low or very-low density residential development. Residential development has and will continue to in fluence native plant habitats through direct habitat loss, fragmentation, and loss of natural pr ocesses. 1973 2010 Figure 15.

The impact of development on native plants The apparent emphasis on rare, threatened and endan gered species in this Report should not be taken to mean that these are our only conservation concern. The disappearance of habitat formerly occupied by relatively common species is a lso serious. These \"ordinary\" natural areas provide important services for humans and for wildl ife, and they too are under stress, with common and uncommon species making their way to vul nerability and on to rarity. A number of species considered common by the authors of Herbaceous Plants of Maryland (Brown and Brown 1984), are increasingly hard to find. To take one example, Brown and Brown describe pink lady's slipper, Cypripedium acaule , as \"common throughout\" the State. While not (yet) rare, this plant can no longer be considered common throughout the State. Of the 710 plant species considered rare, threatene d or endangered in Maryland, 100 are considered historic (not having been seen in 20 or more years) or extirpated (lost with virtually no chance of rediscovery). Most of those disappeare d because of habitat alteration or destruction. Often a plant now considered historic or extirpated was known from a single (or very few) high quality sites that became degraded or destroyed out right by development. One illustrative example of such loss is the story of the golden colicroot ( Aletris aurea ), now considered historic/extirpated. This species was kn own from a single Maryland location in a globally rare habitat type: fall-line gravel terrac e bogs. Located between Washington D.C. and Baltimore, these irreplaceable habitats are small b ut highly diverse wetlands that support numerous rare species of plants and animals. A key component of this habitat type is fire. Without fire (or similar habitat management) these habitats convert to shrub-dominated or forested wetlands. The rare species that occupy thi s globally rare habitat require an open condition and are not present when woody plants dom inate. With fire excluded from the landscape and given the development pressure in the Baltimore-Washington corridor, many of these habitats and the species associated with them have been lost. Even in rural portions of the State, single high-qu ality sites have been lost that supported numerous species now considered historic/extirpated . This is the case with the downy gentian 34 (Gentiana puberulenta ), which was lost with the construction of a reserv oir. Sometimes a species such as one-sided pyrola ( Orthila secunda ), which was known from nearly a dozen locations in multiple counties, is lost due to development press ure and most likely also from high levels of deer herbivory. The loss of fire in our landscape\u2014an unavoidable re sult of development\u2014is undoubtedly a major factor in the loss of some species. Fire prov ides routine opening of habitat by controlling woody plant species, a necessary requirement for ma ny plant communities. Some species require fire to stimulate reproduction. An example is the A merican chaffseed ( Schwalbea americana ). This species was once found with frequency from Mas sachusetts southward throughout the eastern United States west to Texas. Now this speci es is so rare it is federally listed as endangered. In Maryland, this plant was historicall y found only in Worcester County. Without fire this species is quickly lost. The only locatio n this species is still found in the mid-Atlantic i s the relatively frequently burned pine barrens of Ne w Jersey. Effects of fragmentation The highly fragmented nature of the Maryland landsc ape presents a major challenge to maintaining native plant communities and species. I deally, where connections do exist they need to be maintained and where none exist they need to be created. However, there are severe limits as to what may be \"protected\" in the long-term. Iso lated fragments of rare natural communities containing populations of rare plants, as a practic al matter, cannot all be managed with equal effort and there is no one strategy to protect them all. Fragmentation of habitats is a frequent, but not ne cessarily inevitable, result of development. Ecologists have been studying the effects of fragme ntation at various scales for decades, arriving at a general consensus on the overall effects of fr agmentation (Fahrig 2003). Figure 17. National, State and county parks are sho wn in green borders. It is evident from this photo that even preserved public land are as are highly fragmented. 35 Most important of these effects are alterations in patterns of important life-history components of organisms (dispersal, reproduction, gene flow and m ortality), which result from increasing isolation of habitat fragments. At some threshold t he probability of an organism or of seed/pollen moving between patches becomes so unlikely that it is essentially zero. Unless connections are re-established between these habitat patches, each population then becomes a \"remnant\" or residual population with an increased extinction ri sk owing to the vagaries of small population size: genetic drift, inbreeding and unpredictable e vents (Lande 1987, 1988; Frankham 1996). Thus, the plants or animals that evolved and adapte d to a historical landscape in a functioning ecosystem find themselves in an entirely different environment. (Tilman et al. 1994; Fahrig 2002; Hanski and Ovaskainen 2002). Visible impacts of fragmentation and altered ecosys tems A large number of species considered rare, threaten ed or endangered require frequent disturbances (i.e., early successional habitats). M any of these species are best described as pyrophytic (fire-loving). Given the loss of a natur al fire regime across our landscape, these disturbance-dependent species are now located only in manmade or maintained habitats, the most significant of which are powerlines and roadsi des. We will never know the historic frequency with which fire impacted habitats and muc h debate surrounds the topic. Yet, even without this knowledge, clues to pre-settlement hab itat conditions are found where the species are still present. Numerous rare species are known only from roadsides and powerlines because these habitats mimic a natural habitat type no long er provided in our landscape. One area that illustrates this well is the Brookvie w area of Dorchester County. The Brookview area supports over a dozen species considered rare by the State. Most of the populations in this area are located along powerlines and roadsides. Mo st notable of These species are all known from very few sites in Maryland and are l ocated within 2.2 miles from one another. Habitats where these species are found in other sta tes are described as \"dry open woodlands,\" \"grasslands\" or \"pine barrens,\" all of which are op en lands with fewer trees than the dense forests currently found in the Brookview area. To s upport these species, this area must clearly have been a more open and frequently burned habitat in earlier times. The roadsides and powerlines here today are simply acting as refugia for these species. The example at Brookview is only one of numerous examples across the State. Many species that are listed as rare in Maryland have no known \"natural\" occurrence in pres ent-day Maryland, with all populations known only from roadsides or powerlines. In all likelihood, the paucity of native plant spec ies existing in many of the small undeveloped plots in Maryland is due in part to the effects of fragmentation, although it would be impossible in most cases to separate this effect from that of invasive non-native species and white-tailed deer browsing. 36 Existing initiatives to address development and fra gmentation Growth Policy The Maryland General Assembly enacted a series of m ajor laws in the 1990s: the 1992 Economic Growth, Resource Protection and Planning A ct and the four 1997 Smart Growth Initiatives. The 1992 Economic Growth, Resource Protection and P lanning Act articulates the State's growth policy through seven visions (the General As sembly added an eighth vision in 2000 and updated the visions in 2009) centered on concentrat ing development in suitable areas, protecting sensitive areas and establishing funding mechanisms to achieve the visions. The Act also requires local jurisdictions to address these same visions in their comprehensive plans. The Smart Growth Initiatives provide incentives to bett er locate new growth, protect rural land resources, and encourage stewardship of the Bay. By concentrating development in suitable areas, environmentally sensitive areas are preserve d and infrastructure impacts, such as construction of new roads, are reduced. It has been estimated that by implementing some basic smart growth principles, developed land could be re duced from a projected 400,000 acres to about 110,000 acres while accommodating the 1 milli on people and 600,000 new jobs expected by 2035. In addition, State resources have been mad e available to preserve land outside of designated development areas. Similarly, the Sustai nable Growth and Agricultural Preservation Act of 2012 encourages planning for development in some areas and prohibiting major residential subdivisions in other areas planned for preservation and conservation. Building on these legislative initiatives, PlanMary land (Maryland Department of Planning 2011) is a State-wide policy that directs State agencies to target their resources to help achieve smart growth at the local level and counties and municipa lities to identify their growth and preservation areas to meet land use, planning, and development g oals. Of the 12 Planning Visions proposed in PlanMaryland, two outline the conservation of resou rces and protection of the environment, including identifying and protecting lands and wate rs integral to the preservation and protection of environmentally sensitive and ecologically signi ficant resources from the impacts of development. These two Visions are to be achieved t hrough local comprehensive plans that are designed to preserve and protect the integrity of t he State's important natural and ecological resources from encroachment and the impacts of inco mpatible land uses. Local jurisdictions are required to include the 12 Visions in their compreh ensive plans and implement them through zoning ordinances and regulations, as well as addre ss conservation of sensitive areas in plan updates. Priority areas for conservation and identification of sensitive areas have been identified through GreenPrint, a web-enabled map showing the relative ecological importance of every parcel of land in the State. This map includes \"Targeted Ecol ogical Areas,\" lands and watersheds of high ecological value that have been identified as conse rvation priorities by DNR, including as targets for Program Open Space. These areas represent the m ost ecologically valuable areas in the State and include large blocks of forests and wetlands, r are species habitats, aquatic biodiversity hotspots and areas important for protecting water q uality. One of the contributing features to GreenPrint is the GreenInfrastructure, a network of large undisturbed land areas (hubs) connected by designated pathways for the movement o f wildlife (green corridors). Hubs include large blocks of contiguous interior forest (contain ing at least 250 acres, plus a transition zone of 300 feet); large wetland complexes, with at least 2 50 acres of unmodified wetlands; important 37 animal and plant habitats of at least 100 acres, in cluding rare, threatened and endangered species locations; unique ecological communities; migratory bird habitats; and relatively pristine stream and river segments (which, when considered with adj acent forests and wetlands, are at least 100 acres) that support sensitive aquatic organisms. Gr eenInfrastructure maps have allowed local governments to enhance their efforts to provide ope n space, recreation lands, and natural areas, and provided a focus for local land trusts and citi zen groups. Critical Area Program The Critical Area Act, passed in 1984, created a pr ogram to oversee the development and implementation of local land use programs relative to the \"Critical Area\"\u2014all land within 1,000 feet of the Mean High Water Line of tidal waters or the landward edge of tidal wetlands, and all waters of and lands under the Chesapeake Bay and it s tributaries. The goals of this program include conserving fish, wildlife, and plant habita t in the Critical Area through the preservation and maintenance of a 100-foot, naturally vegetated, forested buffer (recently proposed as a 200- foot buffer under some circumstances); protection o f nontidal wetlands; and protection of plant and wildlife habitats that are significant from a S tate-wide or local perspective because of their rarity (including for State listed species). Signif icant habitats that receive protection include riparian forests (forested areas of 300 feet in wid th along streams and the Bay's shoreline), relatively undisturbed tracts of forest over 100 ac res in size, certain plant and animal communities that are the best examples of their kin d in Maryland, and other areas determined to be of local significance. Two approaches to habitat protection in the Critical Area have been adopted by local jurisdictions: (1) designation of areas around significant habitats in which disturbances are prohibited; and (2) protection pro grams which employ the acquisition of the habitat, conservation easements, cooperative agreem ents with landowners or other similar measures. In addition, disturbance in the 100-foot buffer area may require planting of native species or allowing natural regeneration for revege tation. Program Open Space: Conservation through Acquisitio n of Property and Property Rights Maryland's Program Open Space was a landmark conser vation initiative when it was conceived in 1968. Funded by a dedicated tax of \u00bd of 1% on mo st real estate transfers, the program directly linked the rate of State land conservation to the r ate of land development. The program currently generates between 100 and 200 million dollars per y ear. Much of this funding has gone to conserve natural habitats that provide significant plant community protection. A significant portion of the Program Open Space funds are transfe rred as block grants to county governments to acquire and develop recreational facilities such as playgrounds and ball fields. Over the past 15 years, an increasing amount of Program Open Spac e funding has also gone to easement programs to protect farmland, scenic vistas and rur al landscapes. The transfer tax-based link between property develo pment and conservation was designed to pay generously during good fiscal times and to constric t during economic recession. During times of fiscal constriction, however, Maryland government h as regularly used Program Open Space monies to shore up deficits in State accounts unrel ated to conservation. Maryland has protected more than 400,000 acres of l and through Program Open Space. Approximately one fourth of this number is comprise d of conservation easements of various sorts. The trend toward easement acquisition over f ee simple acquisition has been driven by numerous factors including: 38 The relative attractiveness of private landowners b eing able to monetize their land holdings without altering their property The highly effective mechanism of using third party land trusts as real estate service providers The assumption that land protection measured in acr es is homogeneous, and that easement ownership is as effective or more effectiv e than State ownership Reluctance on the part of DNR land management units to accept ownership of new lands in a climate of declining personnel and fiscal reso urces Maryland DNR uses a computer model that assigns a n umerical score to all lands being considered for protection with Program Open Space F unds. The model is used consistently and provides the basic function of preventing the acqui sition of ecologically insignificant lands with conservation dollars. However, land acquisition is still mostly conducted in an ad hoc manner as property is offered to the State or comes on the ma rket in areas contiguous with existing managed areas. A long-range strategy for land acquisition is a lau dable goal, but the reality is that only a small percentage of the lands that might be identified as ecologically significant will come onto the market in a given year. Program Open Space monies a re regularly transferred into the general fund during times of shortfall, so it would be impr actical to hold back funds waiting for the most significant properties to become available. On the other hand, to designate tens of thousands of acres as acquisition 'targets' would have broad imp lications. The de facto expression of interest by the State to purchase land could raise unreasona ble landowner perceptions of value and even distort land valuations in heavily targeted areas. In addition, the public targeting of huge land areas in what would be mostly the relatively undeve loped rural counties would almost certainly raise concerns about the effects of a large-scale c onversion of private property to public ownership on the local tax base and economy. Role of education and outreach in public support for conservation Summary: Public support is essential if Maryland's native plants and their habitats are to be preserved. In addition to direct public outreach, increasing public appreciation for Maryland's botanical heritage can be accomplished through volunteer programs that engage citizens in conservation activities. Public support for conservation of Maryland's botan ical heritage is crucial. Public understanding of the importance of native plants, as well as the harmful impact of invasive plants, both in the wild and in the trade, will be key to preserving ou r native biodiversity. Existing education and volunteer-based programs can make significant contr ibutions, and these could be enhanced. For example, the Maryland Master Naturalist program , coordinated through University of Maryland Extension, engages citizens as stewards of Maryland's natural ecosystems and resources through science-based education and volun teer service in their communities. For a fee, the program provides 60 hours of classroom and fiel d experience for volunteers, who then go on to provide 40 hours of service each year. A wide va riety of volunteer opportunities are possible, including environmental restoration projects, educa tion, public awareness campaigns, and field research. The Master Naturalist program began in Co lorado in the 1970 and exists today in 34 39 states. Maryland's program was created between 2008 and 2011, and currently is active in the Coastal Plain and Piedmont Regions with extension t o the Mountains planned for 2014. Further opportunities could be provided for volunte ers to assist with plant conservation tasks. Conserving our native heritage takes time and effor t. Staff reductions have led to fewer eyes in the field surveying for the presence or absence of listed native species and for invasive plants. An enhanced coordinated volunteer program within DN R, could help while, at the same time, educating citizens about the value of Maryland's na tural heritage. Possible volunteer opportunities might include: site monitoring; locat ing, verifying and scanning older paper records of native plants; and assisting with survey s. Of course, to be successful, any volunteer program requires staff planning and supervision. Recommendations for improved conservation of natural habitats and listed (rare, threatened and endangered) species To address the need for enhanced conservation of na tural habitats, including those supporting rare, threatened and endangered plant species, we r ecommend reinforcing the foundations of the Natural Heritage Network. This is an international network that tracks and monitors species using consistent methodologies, and whose Maryland component is the Wildlife and Heritage Service within the Department of Natural Resources (DNR). These recommendations posit that static or declinin g budgets, at least in the Wildlife and Heritage Service, are likely to continue for the lo ng term, given the manner in which the Service is funded. They also recognize that the Service has limited capacity for on-the-ground conservation management. Nevertheless, with modest additional resources it would be possible to accomplish significant conservation tasks: (a) Produce and maintain high-quality and current d ata on rare plants housed in our conservation database (Biotics) and the Norton-Brow n Herbarium. (b) Vigorously curate the basics (rank and status) with up to date, defensible and scientifically sound documents. (c) Produce the highest quality science in whatever projects can be funded and publish those results so that what we learn may be transferred to the conservation community at large. (d) Produce clear, obtainable conservation goals fo r priority plant species including management and recovery plans. Thus the Work Group makes the following specific re commendations: 1. We recommend expanding the active stewardship compo nent within the Wildlife and Heritage Service to include four regional stewards . Many of our rare, threatened and endangered plant and animal species require habitat management to maintain and protect viable populations. Currently, the Wildlife and Her itage Service can only undertake a few high priority projects per year. Regional stewards would be chiefly responsible for on the ground monitoring and management activities in each region (Eastern, Southern, Central, Western). 2. We recommend a short-term assistant to the State Bo tanist would be responsible for assisting with updating and reviewing rank and stat us, annotating database records and processing herbarium data . The Wildlife and Heritage Service employs a singl e full- 40 time botanist (the State Botanist) who is responsib le for setting plant conservation priorities and whose chief responsibility is mainta ining the list of rare, threatened and endangered plant species. The State Botanist is con tinuously revising this list but progress is limited owing to additional administrative dutie s. 3. We recommend assistance by a professional database management contractor (in the short term) to overhaul and eliminate the data entr y backlog in Biotics that is overwhelmingly botanical in nature . The conservation database administered by the Wildlife and Heritage Service (called \"Biotics\") ha s a critical backlog of data for entry. This database is essential to the conservation of M aryland's biodiversity. 4. We recommend establishing a special projects fund, administered by the Wildlife and Heritage Service's Director, with allocation based upon critical inventory and monitoring gaps . Inventory and monitoring of rare and vulnerable p lant species and communities are poorly funded at present. 5. We recommend establishing a research fund, administ ered by the State Botanist to address critical knowledge gaps for priority specie s . At present there are no specific funds available for research specifically directed at Maryland plants. 6. We recommend encouraging State conservation program s, including easement-based programs funded through Program Open Space, to targ et and design for the long- term conservation of significant botanical communit ies. 7. We recommend that DNR engage and perhaps formalize relationships with volunteer- based programs like the Maryland Master Naturalists to reduce the number of administrative hours shouldered by DNR biologists a nd ecologists . Administrative and database tasks usurp the time of specially trained professional DNR staff. We caution, however, that volunteers cannot perform every task and that there will be tradeoffs between work accomplished and an increase in the wo rkload to manage and coordinate those volunteers. 8. We recommend that dedicated funding be allocated to the Norton Brown Herbarium at the University of Maryland, College Park in orde r to maintain its critical functions. Recognizing the irreplaceable nature of the biodive rsity collection and the uncertainty regarding its future, we strongly recommend that th e State sustain essential funding for core staff comprising the director of the herbarium , a curator and collections manager. 9. We recommend considering an update to the list of N ontidal Wetlands of Special State Concern . This list, maintained by Maryland Department of t he Environment, identifies nontidal wetlands that are subject to mo re stringent review requirements than other nontidal wetlands, often resulting in protect ion for rare plant species and/or high quality natural communities. 41 Challenge: Devastation from the over-abundance of whi te- tailed deer SUMMARY: Mile after mile of Maryland forests have a park-like appearance: many tall trees, but almost nothing growing on the ground. The ground cover, when present, often turns out to be non-native and invasive. The native wildflowers are absent, as are the native shrubs and saplings, along with the benefits they provide. These changes are occurring rapidly, in some cases within the last 10 years. The population of white-tailed deer ( Odocoileus virginianus ) in the mid-Atlantic region has rebounded from low levels at the turn of the 20th century to levels today that are generally agreed to be higher than at any time in history. Landscape fragmentation and the rise of suburbs have created excellent conditions for this denizen of successional and edge habitat. Deer are highly adapted to habitat disturbance and quick to become accustomed to close proximity to humans. The same suburban habitats to which deer so easily acclimatize are generally impractical or unattractive to human hunters, their last remaining predator except for the automobile. Even in the most rural parts of Maryland, the number of deer hunters has been in decline for decades, even as opportunity and hunter success are at all-time highs. It has become evident that hunting as it exists today cannot be relied upon as the primary population management tool for our deer herd. The effect of this super-abundance of herbivores on plant populations has been well studied, particularly in regard to its effect on forest regeneration. In Maryland, there are also long-term data documenting the role of deer in the suppression of herbaceous plants that are preferred browse plants. Some native plants (such as Canada yew and tall larkspur) remain in Maryland only in those few areas inaccessible to deer. Effective control of deer abundance is a necessity if we are to preserve Maryland's botanical heritage. The deleterious impact of the over-abundance of whi te-tailed deer Simply stated, we have more white-tailed deer in Ma ryland than our ecosystems can handle, especially in our suburban areas. They have become change agents to our environment, habitats, human lifestyles, and to other wildlife and plant c ommunities. The white-tailed deer can be characterized as a \"keystone herbivore\" in the east ern deciduous forest (Waller and Alverson 1997). A keystone herbivore is a species that affec ts the distribution and abundance of many other species, that can affect plant and animal com munity structure at multiple levels, and whose abundance has a correspondingly heavy impact on the entire plant and animal community in which it lives. The feeding and browsing of white-tailed deer has p rofound effects on Maryland's plant and animal communities. Twenty years ago researchers in Maryland found that as deer densities became higher and their browsing increased, there w as a marked decline in the number of wildflowers, songbirds, and tree seedlings in the f orest habitat (deCalestra and Stout 1997). By 42 2004, the University of Maryland Extension was info rming the forest landowners in Maryland of the threats the growing deer population posed to th e natural regeneration of the forest resource. While deer consume many non-native plants, deer pre fer native plants in the forest and edge habitats, as these plants are the food sources with which deer coevolved. When deer populations are greater than their habitat can sustainably supp ort, over-browsing occurs, removing these native plants from the understory and shrub levels of the forest. This situation has a two-fold deleterious effect: (1) native plants are removed a t a rate that does not allow for regeneration; and (2) once freed from competition by native plant s, invasive non-native plants become established. Deer contribute to the spread of non-native invasiv e plants. They preferentially consuming native plants, reducing the ability of native plants to wi thstand competition from non-natives (Eschtruth and Battles 2008; Kalisz et al. 2003). They also sp read the seeds of non-native plants (Myers et al. 2004). Among the plants over-browsed by the deer are the t ree saplings, which would under normal conditions form the basis for natural succession an d regeneration of the native forest. Many Maryland forests contain few or no tree saplings. A s the existing mature trees die or are removed, they are not replaced and thus the forests themselves are gradually dying. Removal of the forest understory diminishes food so urces and nesting sites of other forest- dwelling small mammals and birds, as well as the de er themselves. The effects to our forests and native plants are obvious to the trained observer\u2014a nd in many cases to the untrained observer. Published and unpublished data point to the severit y of the problem, several of them specific to Maryland. Particularly telling is documentation of the interactions and damage caused by deer to rare plant and animal species. Deer herbivory is so great at a site in Worcester County that flowering stalks of wild lupine ( Lupinus perennis ), a threatened species, are scarce. These flowering stalks are essential to the life of a glo bally uncommon and endangered frosted elfin butterfly ( Callophrys irus ) found at the site (Frye 2012). In another example, 19 of the 21 orchid species of the Catoctin Mountains of Frederick County have seen a significant decline. This decline is al most perfectly correlated to the deer harvest data for the county, a surrogate for deer populatio n data (Knapp and Wiegand, unpublished data). Additionally, a rare oak forest type was recently d ocumented in Talbot County. This forest is a Figure 18. This photo shows the contrast between the understory inside and outside an 8-10 year old deer exclosure fence at Middle Patuxent Environmental Area in Howard County. Photo by Cheryl Farfaras, Howard County Recreation and Parks Department 43 very wet woods with a diversity of mature oak speci es. Unfortunately, the deer herd of the area is so large there is virtually no oak regeneration vis ible in the understory. If deer are not checked, this rare forest will fundamentally change or be lo st entirely. Damage from deer over-abundance is not confined to the impact on plants and wildlife. Deer inflict significant damage on Maryland's agricultur al crops. Deer also have a detrimental effect on human health. On a typical day in Montgomery Cou nty, five motorists strike deer (Morse et al., 2013). One in every 141 Maryland motorists wil l have a deer collision in the next 12 months, while the national chance of striking a deer are 1 in 171 and in neighboring West Virginia it is 1 in 40 (Purcell et al. 2013). The average deer-vehic le collision in Maryland results in an insurance claim of about $3,000 (Kays and Timko 2011, Eyler 2 013). However, a very real and serious result of these incidents is bodily injury and the sometimes fatal outcome for the occupants of the vehicle. And it almost certainly means the demise o f the deer involved. The proximity of deer to human habitation has also resulted in an increase i n the transmission to humans of tick-borne diseases such as Lyme disease. Figure 19.

How the white-tailed deer herd in Maryland came to be so large As early as the mid-1600's Maryland was enacting la ws and regulations related to game species. The first legislation on white-tailed deer in Maryl and was in enacted in 1729. In 1773, due to declining numbers, it became necessary to restrict killing deer for a three-year period, with a season established for September and October. Despi te these early efforts, by the 1800's deer were mostly relegated to the western portions of th e State. The combination of timber harvesting, clearing land for agriculture, hunting, and the ind ustrial revolution were major factors in the near extirpation of Maryland's white-tailed deer. Moreov er, the natural predators of the white-tailed deer, namely the mountain lion ( Puma concolor ) and the timber wolf ( Canis lupis ), had been effectively extirpated from the State by the early years of the last century, leaving humans as the only significant predators of deer. State management to increase the white-tailed deer population began in earnest in 1937 with passage of the Federal Aid in Wildlife Restoration Act (commonly known as the Pittman- 44 Robertson Act). Some early management techniques in cluded: no hunting in some years, antlered-deer-only hunting, requiring hunting licen ses, establishing seasons and bag limits, and restocking by importing deer from the northern Midw est. In addition, from the 1920's into the 1970's, state refuge areas (Wildlife Management Are as) were established for deer and other wildlife and game species. During this same period, and especially after World War II, Maryland's human population grew rapidly, and subur ban development expanded into formerly forested tracts and agricultural lands. These facto rs\u2014available food from farms and rich suburban landscapes, coupled with management practi ces aimed at protecting the deer harvest\u2014 created an ideal environment for deer to thrive and multiply, and thus the deer herd increased to an extent never anticipated. A thumbnail look at the harvest of deer through hun ting efforts during this period of human societal changes in Maryland from the mid-twentieth century until today, reveals the story of the deer herd's growth. It also reveals the decline in the number of hunters after a peak in 1968. Year Hunter Harvest Farmer Harvest Est.

Private hunters are responsible for most of the dee r harvest in Maryland, taking approximately one third of the population annually. White-tailed deer are also harvested by farmers, who can receive permits after demonstrating damage to their field crops (and their livelihood) caused by deer. For many years, since the extermination of wo lves and mountain lions and the reduction of black bears (the natural predators of deer), hunter s have been the primary control on the deer population. But the number of licensed hunters is d eclining. Doubtless the continued apparent success of hunting efforts is a function of the lar ge and ubiquitous deer herd. However, hunters do not have access or choose not to pursue deer in all of the habitats that support the herd (e.g., suburban communities, nature preserves, large priva te land holdings denied to the hunting public). Many landowners are unaware of the signifi cant protection from liability conferred by the Landowner Liability and Recreational Access Law (Annotated Code of Maryland, Natural Resources Article, Title 5-1101 et seq; see Kays 20 08). Bag limits for Maryland hunters could be said to be \"oversaturated,\" meaning that the majority of hunters do not take as many deer as they are leg ally entitled to do. The current annual bag limit in much of the State allows for as many as a total of 36 deer to be harvested per hunter throughout the various deer seasons. While this gen erous bag limit no doubt reflects the relationship of the deer herd population and estima ted license sales, it is not realistic to expect the average hunter to have the necessary access, av ailable time or resources, or the need to harvest more than several deer annually. 45 White-tailed deer greatly benefit from Maryland's l ush and diverse landscape plantings as well as from the protected green spaces, stream corridor s, floodplains, forests and wetlands resulting as the Maryland landscape has changed to accommodat e suburban development. Deer browse to these man-made suburban habitats as well as to the portions of the land (forest remnants and stream corridors) preserved to balance the effects of development is both costly (loss of nursery stock) and damaging to the remaining natural habita t. Figure 20. Maryland White-tailed Deer Population 19 88-2010. Source: Maryland Department of Natural Resources. Currently the average deer density in Maryland is e stimated at about 30 per square mile (Eyler 2013), with estimates as high as 95 per square mile in some suburban areas (Gilgenast et al. 2009). Aerial surveys by helicopters equipped with forward looking infrared radar (FLIR) conducted in Howard County found that deer densitie s in some very localized areas may be as high as \"hundreds\" of deer per square mile (persona l communication P. Norman, Howard County Recreation and Parks). By contrast, estimate s of the maximum deer density that allows healthy forest regeneration might vary from 8 to 20 per square mile. In what is considered by many professionals as a landmark deer density study , deCalestra and Stout (1997) reviewed and studied a number of eastern forest sites in Pennsyl vania with different deer densities, and observed that deer densities higher than about 15 p er square mile had deleterious effects on the forest ecosystem. 46 Alternative methods of deer management \"The lethal control of deer via regulated hunting r emains the most effective way to balance the deer population with environmental and cultural con cerns on a landscape scale.\" (Maryland White-tailed Deer Plan 2009-2018) Unfortunately, attempts to decease deer abundance u sing currently available methods to reduce doe fertility have shown this technique to be expen sive and of limited utility, especially for large areas. The doe must be captured, anesthetized, trea ted, revived and released, all at significant cost ($700-$1000 per doe per treatment). In a study performed in Maryland, only 47% of the treated does were sterile in the second year after treatment (APHIS 2011). In addition, this method is not practical for unfenced tracts accessi ble to untreated deer, let alone for treating the large, widespread, free-ranging deer population tha t exists in Maryland (Eyler and Timko 2013). Nevertheless, fertility reduction could have a role , albeit a limited one, among various deer management techniques. Techniques to exclude or repel deer vary greatly in cost, efficacy, and duration of effectiveness. None of these exclusion techniques addresses the fu ndamental issue of deer over-abundance and its effects on natural habitats. Fencing of various types can be effective but is no t always a practical solution to damage or loss from deer feeding activities. It is most ef fective on individual plants or small areas such as in residential landscapes. Cost and aesthet ic considerations as well as the necessity for diligent maintenance tend to discoura ge its use. Electric fencing can be effective for large home gardens, small orchards, a nd crop fields, although deer may endure the shock if hunger drives them to seek fora ge on the other side of the fence. Fencing of large natural areas is plainly impractic al. Repellants have variable efficacy and they require frequent application due to rapidly growing shoots and weather effects on the repellent s (e.g., rain or heavy dew). Repellants must be applied during mild weather and therefore c an offer little if any protection to the plants during the winter months. Repellants are rat her costly, may damage some plants, and can exhibit noxious and/or unaesthetic product residues on plant parts. Repellents, as with fencing, offer no solution to deer over-abunda nce nor are they practical for large areas. Figure 21.

Photo by Janice Browne, janicebrowne.com 47 Recommendations to address the over-abundance of whi te-tailed deer Effective control of white-tailed deer abundance is a necessity if we are to preserve Maryland's botanical and wildlife heritage. This challenging a nd complicated issue will require the cooperation of a broad range of partners including government agencies, sportsmen, farmers, and citizens seeking innovative ways to reduce deer num bers for the benefit of native habitats, suburban landscapes, the economy, public safety, an d the well-being of Maryland's deer herd. The Maryland White-tailed Deer Plan 2009-2018 prese nts a thorough and comprehensive approach to a variety of management opportunities a nd techniques. The Work Group encourages DNR and other land managers (as applicable) to acti vely pursue these opportunities with emphasis on the following. 1. We recommend modifications in hunting laws/regulati ons/practices. This would include: season/bag limits adjustments to very loca lized flexibility (Community Based Deer Management), and adjusting safety zones for ar chery pursuits. 2. We recommend increased outreach and education on Ma ryland's Landowner Liability and Recreational Access Law. Private landowners are more likely to invite hunters onto their lands if they are aware of the p rotection from liability that this law affords. 3. We recommend encouraging efforts by State lands man agers to reduce white-tailed deer damage on public lands. This may be done, for example, by increasing hunter access, giving more hunters more time afield, and b y developing management plans directed at restoring regeneration of forest trees and other native plants . 4. We recommend encouraging and facilitating more mana ged deer hunt programs with volunteer hunters and more programs with certified sharp shooters after regular seasons . 5. We recommend investigating and as appropriate imple menting methods to increase donation of harvested deer for community food banks and homeless shelters. 6. We recommend fostering education, public awareness, and endorsement of hunting as a management tool necessary for habitat conservatio n, protection and control of the deer herd, and for the positive impact of hunting o n State and local economies . 7. We recommend continuing to monitor research and dev elopment in deer biological fertility controls . While unlikely to be effective to treat Maryland' s large, free-ranging white-tailed deer population, fertility management could have a role, albeit a limited one, among various management techniques. The Work Group also makes the following recommendat ion. 8. We recommend an investigation under DNR's leadershi p of permitting a regulated commercial market in Maryland for wild-harvested ve nison, with input and open discussion from all interested stakeholders . Input from DNR advisory committees, other stakeholders within State government, sportsmen and conservation groups, as well as non- traditional partners, may provide the way in which over-saturated bag limits per hunter (as viewed by some) can benefit the State, native habit ats, and the local economy. 48 Challenge: Insufficient prevention and control of biol ogical invasions SUMMARY. The continuing introduction, establishment and spread of invasive species is devastating Maryland's native plants and ecosystems, and is inflicting major and long-lasting harm to the State's agriculture, to its economy and to human health. In Maryland, there are over 400 species of invasive plants, invasive insects, and plant pathogens that threaten the health and survival of the State's biological diversity and its botanical heritage (EDDMapS 2013). Primarily through Maryland Department of Agriculture (MDA) and Department of Natural Resources (DNR), Maryland has had some success in preventing or slowing the establishment of some potentially very harmful species. In some cases, finding a suitable biological control (an insect or disease) may be the only hope. Currently, the State's agencies do not have the resources they need to take the actions necessary to protect and conserve Maryland's botanical heritage and its biological diversity from the threat of invasive species. Increased education and involvement of Maryland citizens in invasive species issues is crucial. What is an invasive species? As nationally defined, an invasive species is an \"a lien species whose introduction does or is likely to cause economic or environmental harm or h arm to human health.\" An alien species is \"any species, including its seeds, eggs, spores, or other biological material capable of propagating that species, that is not native to a p articular ecosystem.\" By contrast, a native species is one that \"other than as a result of an i ntroduction, historically occurred or currently occurs in [a particular] ecosystem.\" (Exec. Order 1 999) Alien species, also called exotic, non-native, and non-indigenous, include all types of organisms (plants, insects, mollusks, fish, reptiles, birds, mammals, fungi, bacteria and viruses) that have been introduced to places where they did not histor ically occur. Alien species are transported, accidentally or intentionally, by humans; they occu r in locations to which dispersal by natural means\u2014air, water or animals\u2014is highly unlikely. The se newcomers are from other continents, other countries and even from other ecosystems with in the United States. Most non-native species are not harmful or invasive . Most of our food crops and domesticated animals are not native and they pose little or no p roblem. An organism is considered invasive when it becomes established and self-sustaining in its new habitat, and begins to reproduce and spread aggressively at the expense of native specie s and habitats. An invasive species typically arrives without the naturally occurring complement of parasites, pathogens, herbivores and competing organisms with which it has coevolved ove r millennia and which regulate its growth and survival in its native habitat. Free from these natural checks, introduced species adapt and thrive in their new environments. Two examples of m ajor invasive species in the United States are chestnut blight ( Cryphonectria parasitica ), moth (Lymantria dispar ), an insect. Both species were brought in from els ewhere, became established 49 and quickly spread beyond managed systems to signif icantly and forever affect eastern hardwood forests. Invasive species generally have characteristics tha t help them succeed in their new environment. They can reach reproductive maturity early; produce abundant seed or eggs; reproduce asexually; adapt to a wide range of temperature, moisture or s oil conditions; or undergo changes that make them more competitive in their new habitats. While not all non-native invasive species display all of these characteristics, any of these traits c an convey an advantage over a native. Also, invasion often involves a lag time of many years; p opulations of a non-native species increase unheeded until a tipping point is reached after whi ch eradication is impossible and even control is prohibitively expensive (see Figure 22). We must then settle for minimizing the invader's impacts by reducing its numbers, containing it geog raphically, removing satellite populations and hoping for the development of an effective biol ogical control agent. Figure 22. Time course of an invasion framework to use during management planning. Source: Invasive Plant Management, CIPM Online Textbook, Dr. Tim Pra ther, University of Idaho 50 What harm do invasive species cause? Economic consequences Invasive species cause disruption to agriculture, f orestry and fishery operations, with major economic consequences. Impacts range from reduced y ields of food and forage crops and timber, all economically valuable, to reductions and loss o f fish and shellfish. A clear example is the invasive oyster parasite Haplosporidium nelsonii, or MSX, which decimated Chesapeake Bay oyster populations in the 1960s and 70s. It was int roduced when the natural host, the Japanese oyster, was brought to the East Coast of the United States for aquaculture testing. In 2011, DNR promulgated a regulation prohibiting felt-soled wad ers, due to their superior capacity to spread the invasive alga Didymosphenia germinata , or rock snot, from trout stream to trout stream. In this case, both the invader and the regulatory resp onse it precipitated had economic consequences. The cost of invasive species nationally has been es timated at $120 million per year in environmental damage and losses (Pimentel et al. 20 05). Human health impacts Invasive insects and pathogens like the Asian tiger mosquito and West Nile virus, both introduced to the United States in the last 25 year s, are now well established and have cost millions of public and private dollars to monitor a nd manage. Center for Disease Control researchers estimated the average cost per case of West Nile virus that would be saved by use of an effective vaccine to be $34,200, and the cost of vaccinating 100 million people to be about $8.7 billion (Zohrabian et al. 2006). These two spe cies alone have discouraged Marylanders from participating in outdoor recreation, and have cause d illness and even fatalities in susceptible groups. The sap of giant hogweed ( Heracleum mantegazzianum) , a federally listed Noxious Weed, causes such photosensitivity that it can caus e second degree burns and, if in contact with the eyes, blindness. The ornamental shrub Japanese barberry ( Berberis thunbergii) , which increasingly infests Maryland forests, is linked to higher incidence of Lyme disease-bearing ticks (Williams et al. 2009). Ecological impacts and harm to Maryland's botanical heritage Invasive species can reduce numbers and diversity o f native plants and animals and their ecological communities. Impacts include suppression of rare, threatened and endangered species, and increased expenses for management activities an d restoration of damaged landscapes. The Mid-Atlantic Invasive Plant Council reports that ap proximately 300 species of non-native plants are invasive in natural areas in the mid-Atlantic r egion. The Maryland State Botanist estimates that 40% of Maryland listed rare plant species are threatened by one or more non-native invasive plants. 51 Figure 23. (Left) Mile-a-minute vine ( Persicaria perfoliata ) easily climbs and spreads into floodplain forest canopies, blocking light to the plants it ov ertops. (Right) Chinese wisteria ( Wisteria sinensis kills mature trees. Photos by Kerrie Kyde. One plant presents an example of such impacts on se veral levels. The European plant garlic mustard ( Alliaria petiolata) was introduced in New York in the mid-1800s as a p ot and medicinal herb. It has spread and is now widely dis tributed in moist woodlands in all but 12 states and three Canadian provinces. Garlic mustard produces the same chemical signal as other mustard family species, including its botanical cou sins, toothworts ( Cardamine spp ), which are the host plants for the rare butterfly, West Virgin ia white ( Pieris virginiensis ). Maryland's populations of this butterfly occur primarily in Ga rrett County, where garlic mustard is spreading through the forest understory and toothwort numbers are declining. The butterfly is drawn to oviposit on garlic mustard, but its eggs do not hat ch, or hatch poorly, and its larvae cannot survive on this plant. Also, garlic mustard produce s a root exudate that has been shown to inhibit the naturally occurring association of certain soil fungi\u2014mycorrhizae\u2014and tree roots (Roberts and Anderson 2001). All Maryland's hardwood forest trees need mycorrhizal associations to thrive. This is especially true when plants are see dlings, before they have well-developed root systems. Extensive infestations of garlic mustard i n a Maryland forest can thus interfere with tree regeneration. Recent research indicates that the ch emicals garlic mustard produces may directly affect germination of native wildflower seeds (Robe rts and Anderson 2001). Other examples of non-native invasive plants includ e: English ivy other invasive vines overtop trees and shrubs, weigh them down, shade their foliage, g irdle them and eventually kill them (See Figure 23). Lesser celandine (aka fig buttercup) ( Ficaria japonica ), a large shrub-like plant, thrive in floodplains where they suppress dozens of native sp ring wildflowers. 52 The spread of invasive plants also affects animals that depend on native plants for survival. Native plants support the growth and reproduction o f native insects. Because native insects and plants coevolved over many thousands of years, most insects are adapted to the particular leaf chemistry and physical properties of specific plant s. Although some native insects are able to consume invasive plants, especially those related t o the native plants they are typically feed on, native plants produce much more insect biomass and many more insect species than non-native plants. Insects are the direct food source for othe r animals such as birds, reptiles and small mammals. They also provide valuable services to hum ans such as pollination, and aeration and nutrient cycling in soils (Tallamy 2009). Non-native plants provide less beneficial food and habitat for animals than native plants. For example, oriental bittersweet ( Celastrus orbiculatus) , heavily eaten by songbirds, does not supply the nutritive value they need to support the stresses of migration . Ornamental shrubs commonly planted at the suburban-forest interface c an reduce nesting success of forest birds and may cause increased nest failure (Borgmann and Rode wald 2004, Johnston 2006). Exotic insects and pathogens have recently been responsible for enormous losses of native plants, especially trees. Examples include: Hemlock woolly adelgid ( Adelges tsugae ), an insect native to East Asia, is currently causing widespread mortality of eastern hemlock ( Tsuga canadensis ) throughout much of its range including Maryland. Emerald ash borer ( Agrilus planipennis ), a beetle of Asian origin, is responsible for the death of millions of native ash trees ( Fraxinus spp ) in the United States. It is present in Maryland and it is not clear whether con trol and quarantine efforts will be adequate to prevent widespread mortality of ash tre es. Control of non-native invasive species in Maryland Invasive species management consists of: Preventing their introduction and spread; Removing them by physical or chemical means; Introducing biological controls, that is, the micro organisms, predators and parasites that keep them in check in their native environments; an d Reducing the over-abundance of white-tailed deer, w hich preferentially consume native plants. Invasive species control in Maryland resides primar ily with DNR and MDA. These agencies often act cooperatively with federal agencies and m ay receive funds from federal sources. 3 3 The National Invasive Species Council (NISC) provides high-level interdepartmental coordination of federal invasive species actions an d works with other federal and non-federal groups to address invasive species issues at the na tional level. NISC's National Invasive Species Management Plan, most recently updated in 2008, ser ves as a comprehensive \"blueprint\" for federal action on invasive species, as well as NISC 's primary coordination tool. For a list of Maryland and federal laws pertaining to invasive sp ecies, see dnr.maryland.gov/invasives/laws.asp. 53 MDA, primarily through its Office of Plant Industries and Pest Management, has significant responsibility for preventing the introduction and combatting the spread of invasive species. DNR does tracking and control work for invasive animals and plants on public land, working closely with MDA, especially on invasive species th at affect State forests. Due to lack of funds in recent years, these capabilities have been subst antially reduced. Outside funding including grants from federal agencies, supports some efforts , but these are typically short-term and project-based. When grant terms expire, the State a gency often cannot continue work begun with outside funds. The Maryland Invasive Species Council (MISC), established in 2000, is a voluntary non- incorporated \"group of concerned scientists, land m anagers, business people and citizens acting to reduce the spread of invasive plants, animals an d diseases.\" MISC members are drawn from State agencies, the federal government, academia an d the private sector including for-profit and non-profit entities. In addition, MISC sometimes brings in relevant cons tituencies on an ad hoc basis. MISC's status as an informal organization me ans that it does not have paid staff and cannot receive or disburse funds. For projects that require funding, MISC has partnered with (among others): MDA, DNR, USDA, the University of M aryland, the Maryland Nursery and Landscape Association, and with other agencies and entities. Thus, despite its limitations, MISC is able to function as a coordinating body for emer gency response to new invasive species, as a consensus-building organization, and as an informat ion resource. A number of states have legislatively created invas ive species councils whose activities are funded by the state. These councils, which typicall y include representatives from state agencies, academia and the private sector, develop strategic management plans for early detection and rapid response, recommend and coordinate control me asures, identify restoration and research needs, and coordinate among state agencies and adja cent states, among other activities. These councils may confer advantages, including the abili ty to hire staff if funds are available. Given the effectiveness of MISC, however, it was not appa rent to the Work Group that a council of this type would be beneficial for Maryland. The Invasive Plant Advisory Committee (IPAC), established by statute in 2011, was created to support the Maryland Secretary of Agriculture in de veloping approaches to invasive plants, in particular those introduced through horticultural c hannels. The IPAC was charged with adopting a risk assessment protocol, and using that protocol to rank plant species into two tiers. Tier 1 plants will ultimately be banned from production, s ale or transport. Tier 2 plants may be sold and planted, but only with appropriate signage indicati ng their invasive nature. IPAC has adopted a weed risk assessment tool, but has not yet produced a tiered list of species, primarily due to the need for funds to pay a professional to complete as sessments. Just this October, however, MDA has received federal funding that should allow asse ssments to be undertaken; IPAC anticipates the release of a two-tiered species list in 2014. The Mid-Atlantic Invasive Plant Council (MAIPC), another voluntary organization, provides regional leadership to address the threat of invasi ve plants to the native species and natural habitats of the mid-Atlantic region. The council co ordinates regional efforts to gather and share information on the identification, management and p revention of invasive plants, provide training and volunteer opportunities and to identif y research needs. The Council is represented by members from Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey, Pen nsylvania, Virginia, West Virginia, and the District of Columbia. 54 Early detection and eradication The U.S. Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) , along with the Department of Homeland Security, reg ulates the import into the United States of plants and animals (including insects) and conducts border inspections that prevent the import of a large number of invasive and potentially invasive species. Thus Maryland, along with the other states, depends on the efficacy of this federal ins pection team to protect its borders from non- native species known to be invasive. Due to the vol ume and cryptic nature of many of these species, some escape detection and become establish ed. In the last two years, APHIS has developed and begun using a weed risk assessment to predict the probability that an unknown exotic plant species will be invasive in the U.S. T he agency is using this tool to support importation permit decisions for \"plants for planti ng\" that fall into the category of NAPPRA, Not Authorized Pending Plant Risk Analysis. IPAC has ad opted the APHIS weed risk assessment model for its plant assessments. MDA's Nursery Inspection and Plant Certification staff has responsibility to inspect all Maryland licensed nurseries for invasive plants and weeds, insect pests, and pathogens. In fact, it was during one of these routine inspections that em erald ash borer was first discovered in Maryland. In recent years, due to limitations in fu nding and staffing reductions, it has not been possible for existing staff to perform as many insp ections as in the past. In 2005 MDA and DNR developed the Emergency Response Plan for Invasive Forest Pests , to be activated when a new, invasive insect or dise ase species is detected and identified as a threat to Maryland's forests. Its purpose is to coo rdinate the response among state and federal agencies, academia, industry, and the public. Four years ago, DNR formed an internal task force t o advise the Secretary of Natural Resources on invasive species policy and regulation. Titled t he Invasive Species Matrix Team , this group includes representatives from every DNR unit that d eals with invasive species in some way. The group has conducted research, printed signs for aqu atic invasive species identification and awareness, provided a point of contact for outside researchers and helped develop a K-12 invasive species curriculum for Maryland schools. Illustrative Examples Two recent examples illustrate the challenges inher ent in combatting newly introduced invasive plant and animal species that pose a threat to Mary land's native plant populations. Wavyleaf basket grass (Oplismenus undulatifolius ) (WLBG) is a relatively newly discovered invasive species. WLBG was discovered in Patapsco S tate Park in 1996. It was at that time an unknown grass but it was identified and its presenc e published in 1999. It has continued to spread. Its seeds are extremely sticky and adhere i n great numbers to clothes and to the coats of large mammals. By 2007, when DNR invasion ecologist s first became aware of this grass , it was found to be spreading quickly, and exhibiting chara cteristics of a potentially threatening invasive species. In the following three years, DNR spent $1 15,000 to map and treat specific infestations, and attempted to raise additional funds to conduct basic life history research about the species and continue control work. During that period, WLBG was discovered to be widely distributed on thousands of acres of private land within Maryla nd; it was also discovered in Virginia, growing as far west as the Appalachian Mountains. 55 Dr. Vanessa Beauchamp of Towson University has cond ucted the first field studies of this species. Her recent research shows that WLBG exhibi ts the characteristics of a highly invasive species (Fulton 2013). In 2010 DNR abandoned effort s to eradicate it, believing it to be distributed well beyond public lands and lacking th e funding or staffing to complete the work. DNR now attempts to minimize its spread by controll ing newly discovered infestations. There is an active group of volunteers working under a DNR c ertified pesticide applicator to provide herbicide control in Patapsco State Park. Dr. Beauc hamp's group has developed a smartphone application for volunteers to record sightings. See www.towson.edu/wavyleaf. Lessons can be drawn from this example. Intensive i nventory, mapping and research must be done quickly after a potentially invasive plant is discovered, or else eradication is impossible. However, funds for these essential functions were n ot available until it was too late, and the State had no mechanism for prioritizing the control of th is new invasive plant. Emerald ash-borer (Agrilis planipennis ), a beetle that fatally attacks all species of Nor th American ash trees, was first detected in Maryland in 2003 during routine inspection of nursery stock. Coordinated by MDA with substantial particip ation by DNR, eradication efforts were effectuated during 2003-2006. These efforts were th ought to have contained and prevented spread. However, beetles were found outside the qua rantine/eradication zone in 2006 and are likely to be spreading, primarily through the movem ent of firewood. The eradication and control effort thus bought some time but ultimately failed primarily due to uncontrolled transportation of contaminated firewood, inadequate education of the general public and inability to enforce the quarantine. As the above examples illustrate, Maryland's abilit y to respond to new invasions could be greatly enhanced if its existing programs for invas ive species detection, research, monitoring and eradication had adequate funding and political supp ort.

While eradication of invasive species, particularly plants, from specifi c sites of small acreage is possible, the only hope of reducing widespread populations is to rigor ously test, import and release the insects and other organisms that keep those plant species in ch eck in their native regions. Classical biological control involves importing a monophagous (eats only one thing) insect or host-specific disease from an invader's native habitat. Biocontro l agents are typically imported only after extensive testing for host specificity in their nat ive environment, and further testing under laboratory quarantine conditions for several years in the United States. Once the agent is evaluated and recommended for permitted release in the environment, permit holders are required to follow very specific guidelines for bio logical control agent release and reporting. Once established, a biocontrol agent and its host i nvader coexist at low population levels that can be tolerated by the invaded ecosystem. These biological controls will not be a panacea and it cannot be assumed that all of Maryland's invasive species will be subject to biological cont rols within time frames that we can envision. In their native habitats, most plant species are attac ked and therefore controlled by dozens of insects and other animals and pathogens, in addition to fac ing competition from other plant species. The instances where only one or two biological control agents can make a significant dent in the population of a plant species may not be common. Nevertheless, there are encouraging signs of succes s. For three of the 15 most problematic invasive plant species in the mid-Atlantic region: least one non-native has been found. Several insect spe cies have been released under permit as biological control agents for purple loosestrife, a nd since 2007 MDA has been engaged in a biological control program for mile-a-minute weed. (The permit request for garlic mustard biocontrols has not yet been approved.) Much of Maryland's biological control implementatio n (that is, the production and distribution of approved agents) has been carried out by MDA's Plant Protection and Weed Management Section . Currently the MDA staff dedicated to the biologic al control effort consists of one full time contractual employee and one supervisor who ca n devote only about 15% of his time to biological control projects. This is reduced from t he 1990s, when the section had a full-time Figure 25. The rare West Virginia White butterfly ( Pieris virginiensis ) is attracted to invasive garlic mustard ( Alliaria petiolata ), a botanical cousin of its native host plant, but eggs and larvae do not survive.

The current g roup of two individuals currently confines its efforts to rearing and releasing weevils (Rhinoncomimus latipes) that are approved for control of mile-a-minute weed and monitoring for previously in troduced beetles (Galerucella spp.) to control purple loosestrife. While these programs ar e regarded as successful, they require continued monitoring and release over a number of y ears. Yet funding is at risk on a year-to-year basis, and there are little or no resources for res earch or additional introductions. Management of the Overabundance of White-tailed Dee r If given the chance, native plants would in many ca ses have the ability to withstand competition from invasive plants. But they are not given the ch ance to compete when they are preferentially consumed by white-tailed deer. Reducing deer abunda nce \"levels the playing field\" for native plants in their competition with non-native plants (Rawinski 2008). The problems arising from the over-abundance of deer in Maryland are addresse d in detail in a previous section of this Report. Removal of Established Invasive Plants There are specific situations of rare, threatened o r endangered plant species barely hanging on against the onslaught of invasive plants such as Ja panese knotweed. Intensive, focused physical and chemical removal efforts at those sites could s ave valuable and threatened habitats even where the targeted invasive species is unlikely to be eradicated in the State. With the addition of a few regional stewards, DNR's Wildlife and Heritag e Service could undertake such projects, thus making a real difference to the preservation o f Maryland's most valuable and threatened native plant communities. Regulation of Invasive Plant Sales Unlike some other states, Maryland does not current ly regulate the sale or planting of invasive plants other than those classified as agricultural weeds. To begin to remedy this, the General Assembly in 2011 enacted Maryland's Invasive Plants Prevention and Control Law (Annotated Code of Maryland Agriculture Article, 9.5-101). The law established the Invasive Plants Advisory Committee (described above), which was req uested to adopt a science-based protocol to be used as a basis for creating a two-tier list of plants known to be invasive in Maryland. Tier 1 plants will be outlawed in the State. Trade and s ale of Tier 2 plants will require retailers and landscape contractors to provide point-of-sale labe ling regarding invasiveness. The new regulations are to be phased in, with MDA ultimatel y assuming responsibility for enforcement as part of its regular nursery inspection program. Thi s responsibility would be added to the existing responsibilities of nursery inspectors and would in crease the time for inspection of each nursery. If inspections are to continue at the current frequ ency (already reduced from prior years), additional staff will need to be added. Public outreach on invasive species The fight against invasive species is most effectiv e as prevention and early detection, with rapid response when an invasion has just begun. In additi on to educating the general public on this issue, volunteers can be trained to monitor natural areas for invasions, and also to help with eradication. This is already happening around the S tate as a number of counties train volunteer \"Weed Warriors\" to identify and remove invasive non -native plants. Many volunteer 58 organizations conduct invasive plant removal progra ms, often in local parks. It would increase effectiveness to institutionalize this activity by tracking and promoting it at the State level. When early detections of invasive species are made, volu nteers and State agencies could be alerted and put to the task of control. The Texas Master Naturalists serves as a model part nership among federal and state government agencies and nongovernmental organizations, includi ng the Ladybird Johnson Wildflower Center. According to the web site, www.texasinvader s.com, \"The Invaders of Texas Program is an innovative cam paign whereby volunteer \"citizen scientists\" are trained to detect the arrival and d ispersal of invasive species in their own local areas. That information is delivered into a s tate-wide mapping database and to those who can do something about it. The premise is simpl e. The more trained eyes watching for invasive species, the better our chances of lesseni ng or avoiding damage to our native landscape. . . . These teams, coordinated by the Wi ldflower Center, contribute important data to local and national resource managers who wi ll, in turn, coordinate appropriate responses to control the spread of unwanted invader s. The Invaders Program is designed to move the target audience beyond awareness to action on invasive species.\" The Invasive Plant Atlas of New England provides an other successful example of early detection of plant invaders in natural ecosystems (see http:/ /www.eddmaps.org/ipane/). To design such a program in Maryland would require coordination among staff at University of Maryland Extension, MDA, and DNR. A funded position at one of the agencies could act as coordinator. One of the Work Group recommendations is that DNR engage further with volunteer programs like Master Naturalists. This co uld potentially expand to include invasive species programs like that of Texas. Recommendations to combat the threat of invasions by non-native species The spread and the establishment of invasive specie s is altering and destroying Maryland's botanical heritage and natural ecosystems, as well as inflicting major and long-lasting harm to the State's agriculture, human health and economy. 1. We recommend that resources be allocated and priori tized toward prevention, early detection and rapid response to control newly intro duced or discovered invasive species before they have a chance to spread, become entrenched and exorbitantly costly to control. Some portion of these resources should be designat ed for mapping invasive species on and adjacent to high priority s ites. An emergency response system similar to the Incident Command System and an emerg ency pool of funds to use for immediate control work should be established. 2. We recommend that Maryland State agencies continue to participate in the Maryland Invasive Species Council (MISC). Although an informal organization, MISC is able to function as a coordinating body for emergency respo nse to new invasive species, as a consensus-building organization, and as an informat ion resource. 3. We recommend increased support of research on and i mplementation of invasive species biological controls and organism release pr ograms . The existing program within Maryland Department of Agriculture (MDA) has been significantly cut in recent years and should be restored at least to prior leve ls. 59 4. We recommend increased support of research on the d irect and indirect impacts of invasive species on native species and ecosystems . Research documenting and detailing the characteristics of invasive species and the har m they inflict would greatly assist in planning and funding invasive species control effor ts. 5. We recommend funding for additional ongoing assessm ents by the Invasive Plant Advisory Committee and for inspections by MDA under Maryland's Invasive Plants Prevention and Control Act . Currently, funding is only available for one year for assessments of non-native plants likely to be invas ive and thus subject to regulation under the law. MDA will ultimately assume responsibility for enforcement as part of its regular nursery inspection program along with the existing responsibilities of nursery inspectors. If inspections are to continue at the current frequenc y (already reduced from prior years), additional staff will be needed. 6. We recommend that Maryland citizens be encouraged a nd provided with incentives to become involved in stewardship of lands adjoining h igh priority natural areas . This is to ensure that invasive species are eradicated or r educed to a maintenance level so that they do not serve as sources for reinvasion of targeted conservation areas. 7. We recommend establishment of a staff position for invasive species education in University of Maryland Extension Service programs i ncluding Master Gardeners . Public awareness, especially among gardeners, is es sential to lessen the spread of non- native invasive species. Figure 26.

In the past, invasive plants were widely planted by Maryland State agencies, but the State Highway Administration, Maryland Department of the Environment and many local jurisdictions now recognize the value of using native plants for restoration, roadsides and other situations. Invasive plants continue to be sold in the trade, as addressed in a previous section of this Report. Public outreach on ecological benefits of native plants in the landscape should be encouraged and enhanced. How restoration and landscaping affect native plant conservation Restoration and landscaping include a wide range of planting and gardening activities, from roadside planting, restoration of mined areas and w etland mitigation to residential and commercial landscaping. The effect of restoration activities on native plan t habitats varies with the situation. At one extreme is a habitat restoration project whose goal is the literal restoration of a previously existing habitat. Here, the selection of plants sho uld represent the natural community as nearly as possible. Farther along the scale is a typical road side. Even if the original floral inhabitants of that strip of land were known, they are unlikely to represent good choices for a roadside \"landscape,\" with its safety, engineering and other requirements. The conservation goal here is to minimize harm to nearby natural areas, not to repro duce them. A similar challenge arises with urban landscapes that may have been developed decad es ago: the original flora is unknown and the soil and other conditions have drastically chan ged. Many projects fall somewhere in the middle, with the plant choices dictated by a mix of ecological and practical considerations. For example, abandoned agricultural areas often have al tered hydrology and soil nutrient levels, and may be dominated by invasive non-native species. Ne vertheless, a kind of restoration is possible by planting and protecting a selection of trees tha t approximates but does not duplicate the species mix in nearby forests. Landscaping with native plants cannot replace lost natural areas, but it has the potential to partially alleviate the impacts of the loss. In fac t, even modest increases in the native plant cover on suburban properties significantly increase the n umber and species of breeding birds, including birds of conservation concern. Birds and other anim als need insect food to survive, and native insects need native plants to survive. With few exc eptions, only insect species that have shared an evolutionary history with a particular plant lin eage have developed the physiological adaptations required to cope with the chemicals in their host's leaves. Thus, native trees such as oaks support hundreds of different butterfly and mo th species, whereas many non-native trees support few or none (Burghart et al., 2009). 61 Figure 24.

Homeowners often look to landscaping to increase th e value of their properties and thus traditional gardening is usually driven by cultural aesthetics rather than ecological considerations. It is common knowledge that a significant proportio n of the plant species for wholesale and retail sale in Maryland originated outside North America o r in regions of North America distant to Maryland. Many of those non-native plants serve imp ortant decorative and utilitarian functions and do so without harm. Some, however, are invasive , meaning that they escape into the wild and may do considerable damage to our native plant and animal communities . In addition, planting any non-native plant, even one that is not invasive, misses an opportunity to enhance the local ecosystem with a native plant that supports b irds, butterflies and other animals, and that might partially compensate for the loss and fragmen tation of our natural plant and animal habitats. Non-native plants known to be invasive, e.g., Norwa y maple ( Acer platanoides ), as well as plants with characteristics likely to result in inv asiveness, e.g., Japanese silvergrass ( Miscanthus sinensis ), are commonly sold and planted in Maryland. As de scribed above, new regulations to ban sale of a few invasive plant species and requir e point-of-sale labeling of others, are in progress. In addition, some nurseries have voluntar ily begun to label plants as potentially invasive and to list alternative species, including natives . The native plant industry plays an important role in providing responsibly cultivated plant material for landscaping and restoration. We caution against harvesting native plants from th e wild. Landscaping and gardening choices, by definition, a re made with human preferences in mind. In many cases, those preferences can be well served wi th an appropriately selected Maryland native plant that will also benefit the other animals with which we share our environment. The role of local genotypes (\"ecotypes\") and geneti c diversity In revegetation projects, cultivated plants are pur chased from growers and seeded or planted at the restoration site. Even if plant species native to Maryland are used for such projects, the plants may not be from local material. For example, seeds may have been collected from a population in Texas and grown in North Carolina before being s old to a Maryland client. Or, they may be native to one region of the state and planted in an other (e.g., coastal plain vs. mountains). 62 It often happens that a particular plant species gr ows naturally over a wide geographic range, including various different climatic conditions, so il types, and other habitat characteristics. For example, red maple ( Acer rubrum ) is native in much of the eastern United States, b ut populations in New England may have genetic differences that en able them to survive a colder climate than those from the Carolinas. Thus, \"ecotype\" is a conc ept used to describe a sub-population of a species that has adapted to a particular set of env ironmental conditions, and usually is defined as having been derived from plants growing within a pa rticular geographic area (Lubchenco and Real 1991). There is concern about the risks of introducing non -local native plants in restoration projects and roadside plantings. The perceived risk is two-fold: the potential negative impact on local populations of the same species; and the possibilit y that the introduced non-local plants are not well-adapted to the climate and conditions of the r estoration site. For this reason, restoration protocol often suggests using plant sources of loca l provenance or local ecotypes. As will become apparent in the following discussion, furthe r research on the use of local ecotypes is needed and there may be no conclusion that is gener alizable across all species and planting situations. One of the possible threats to local plant populati ons from the use of non-local genotypes in restoration projects is genetic swamping of local p opulations (Booth and Jones 2001). If the introduced plants interbreed with local populations , this will affect the genetics of the local population and may even completely \"swamp\" it so th at the local population is effectively converted to the introduced ecotype. If the introdu ced ecotype is less adapted to the local conditions\u2014for example, if it cannot survive the oc casional drought\u2014then this characteristic will have been transferred to the local population, whose long-term survival is then at risk. 4 It should be noted, however, that in cases of species that have been widely planted over a number of years, it may no longer be possible to isolate o r even to identify the original local genotype. Local ecotypes may be better adapted to the climate and conditions of the restoration site than non-local ecotypes (Allen and Meyer 1998). Adaptati on to the restoration site is essential for the persistence of the newly planted population over ti me. The failure of a restoration project due to lack of adaptation by the new plant material may no t directly affect nearby natural habitats. However, when restoration projects fail, the sites are likely to become infested with non-native invasive plants that will invade nearby natural are as. 4 The need to develop safe \"transfer zones\" for some native plant material has been expressed by state and federal agencies (United States Departmen t of Agriculture and United States Department of the Interior 2002). Transfer zones pr ovide physical boundaries within which ecotypes of species can safely be transferred, with out negatively impacting the genetics of plant metapopulations. Several state programs are already in place. For example, the Iowa Ecotype Project was developed to increase the availability of Iowa-origin seed for roadside plantings and prairie reconstructions (Houseal and Smith 2000). M issouri started a local ecotype program with 33 species from two prairie ecozones, based on clim ate and soil conditions (Erickson and Navarrete-Tindall 2004). Oregon Department of Fores try (2007) developed seed transfer zones for many tree species . 63 The choice of appropriate plant material is, unfort unately, even more complicated because geographical distance is not always the best indica tor of local adaptation. Habitat characteristics may be more important (Hufford and Mazer 2003). Tha t is, source populations from habitats with similar characteristics may be better adapted to the restoration site than closer source populations from different habitats, even if derive d from non-local sources (Ahmad and Wainwright 1976; Hufford and Mazer 2003). In additi on, the majority of species used in restoration are common species whose original range was much larger than the current range. Historical gene flow of species in those population s likely covered a greater distance than in current, fragmented landscapes. Thus it can be argu ed that using seed from distant populations may help to restore the historical gene flow of the species, alleviating to some degree the impact of fragmentation (Sambatti and Rice 2006). In addition to being adapted to a restoration site, plant material utilized in restoration should be genetically diverse (Society for Ecological Restora tion International Science and Policy Working Group 2004). Genetic diversity ensures that plants will be able to respond to future events with a broad range of physiological adaptations (Booth and Jones 2001). These future events not only include average environmental fluctuations for the site but also periodic extreme events, like floods or fires. For this reason, some favor the us e of plant material derived from wild-collected seed. However, wild-collected does not necessarily mean locally collected. Due to habitat fragmentation and isolation, many plant communities are genetically depauperate. Small, genetically isolated populations may have reduced f itness (Falk et al. 2001). In this case, introducing material from farther away could actual ly enhance genetic diversity and result in increased fitness. It is beyond the scope of the Work Group to reach a conclusion on these matters. Contradictory recommendations about planting practices might be i nferred from the various sources described above. We simply comment that in all likelihood, th e importance of using local ecotypes for revegetation projects like restoration and roadside s depends on the location and conditions at the restoration site, as well as on the species propose d to be used. State Highway Administration and Department of the Environment Planting Practices The State Highway Administration (SHA), Maryland De partment of the Environment (MDE), and many local jurisdictions recognize the value of using native plants for restoration, roadsides and other situations and the harm from planting inv asive non-native plants. For storm water management, and erosion and sedimen t control, where both MDE and SHA are involved, the two agencies coordinate with respect to specifications. SHA has developed specifications to align with those of MDE, but in s ome cases its specifications are more stringent or different than those of MDE. Specifications are approved by MDE before being used on any project. In general the seed and plant mixes required by SHA and MDE were developed for engineering purposes, so that, for example, the choice may refl ect the need to quickly stabilize and/or revegetate exposed soil, or to address safety prior ities such as safe site distances and vehicle recovery zones. Most of the Eurasian species used f or this purpose have been used extensively in the United States and are ubiquitous. Some regional ly sourced native seeds and seed mixes are 64 available, and some Maryland-sourced seed mixes are also available through regional companies. State Highway Administration SHA promotes the use of native species wherever pos sible. The SHA 'Landscape Design Guide' (Maryland State Highway Administration 2008) stress es the importance of environmentally appropriate landscape design, which promotes the us e of native species and naturalized elements. The SHA ''Preferred Plant List' provides designers with recommended species adapted for roadside conditions. It includes a listing of speci es that are considered native to Maryland. The Preferred Plant List also list species which are pr ohibited for use on SHA projects because they are invasive or for other reasons. SHA reforestation and native meadow establishment o perations are performed exclusively with native species. Areas where native plants may not b e appropriate include the immediate roadside (10-30 ft off the pavement) and intensely managed l andscaped beds. The immediate roadside is generally managed in non-native tall fescue ( Festuca arundinacea ) as this is the best choice for durability and the safety goals of managing this po rtion of the right-of-way. Intensely managed landscaped beds are generally reserved for urban ar eas or focal points and may include showy non-native species such as Japanese cherry trees ( Prunus serrulata ). These beds are a relatively small component of the SHA landscaping program. SHA specifications allow for trees, shrubs, and per ennials (whether native to Maryland or not) to be produced in and shipped from USDA hardiness zone s 5, 6, or 7 throughout the United States. Due to transportation costs, the majority of this m aterial comes from states east of the Mississippi River. Native meadow grass, sedge, and rush seed are collected from native sources (or grown from seed certified to have been collecte d from) in USDA Hardiness Zones 5b, 6a, 6b and 7a in states east of the Mississippi River. Me adow forb seed is subject to the same origin requirements as grass, sedge and rush seed but is l imited to the States of Maryland, Pennsylvania, New York, New Jersey, Delaware, Virgi nia, West Virginia or North Carolina. Maryland Department of the Environment The Maryland Department of the Environment implemen ts several regulatory programs that affect plant establishment and distribution. The pr ograms regulate permanent and temporary activities in erosion and sediment control, tidal a nd nontidal wetlands, and mining. Erosion and Sediment Control MDE oversees erosion and sediment control for State projects and on State lands. Erosion and sediment control occurs under a State authority del egated to local governments with approved programs implemented by local Soil Conservation Dis tricts. MDE standards and specifications for erosion and sediment control were updated in 20 11 as part of work group effort including the Natural Resources Conservation Service and Maryland Association of Soil Conservation Districts. 5 These standards and specifications require that so il disturbed by construction, mining, and other activities be revegetated. The standards and specifications include lists of seed mixes that should be applied in different soil stabilizat ion situations. The conservation benefits are two- 5http://www.mde.state.md.us/programs/Water/Stormwate rManagementProgram/SoilErosionandS edimentControl/Pages/Programs/WaterPrograms/Sedimen tandStormwater/erosionsedimentcontr ol/esc_standards.aspx 65 fold, preserving soil resources and keeping sedimen ts out of waterways. The revised species lists are an improvement from previous lists in that they contain fewer non-native plants, fewer invasive plants, and more Maryland native plants. Given the recent revision, changes to the standards and specifications would not be anticipated for some years. However, short of an overall review and revision, some recommended adjustments may be possible, for example, to cease using species that are shown to be objectionable if substitutes are available. Wetlands MDE regulates activities in tidal and nontidal wetl ands, and requires mitigation to replace permanent wetland losses. Requirements for stabiliz ation of eroding tidal shorelines establish a preference for \"living shorelines,\" which create or restore additional vegetated tidal wetlands. Regulations require that at a minimum, 85% of a mit igation site or living shoreline must be dominated by a species composition acceptable to MD E. MDE exercises best professional judgment in determining when invasive species shoul d be managed for removal. New federal criteria for wetland mitigation will be likely to c hange the maximum threshold of invasive or exotic species coverage to 5% of the mitigation sit e. MDE requires that all species in the wetland and its 25- or 100-foot buffer must be native to th at region of State, and that all species used for permanent or temporary seeding must be native or no n-persistent. After mitigation wetlands are established, there is a standard 5-year monitoring requirement, including establishing responsibility for removing exotic and nuisance spe cies. MDE typically lists the species that should be used for stabilization when nontidal wetlands are temporarily disturbed. The conditions for restoring nontidal wetlands after temporary disturbance include a list of non-persistent species to be used for stabilization of the site while also allowing for the voluntary revegetation of natural wetland s pecies. MDE is currently updating the preferences and best management practices for seedi ng and stabilization of temporarily disturbed nontidal wetlands. Mining MDE implements regulatory programs for extraction o f minerals, oil, and gas. Mining includes both surface mining and deep coal mining and reclam ation. Native plant species distribution is affected by mining and post-mining reclamation. Pos t-mining reclamation requires re-vegetation , but the species selection, including the proportion of native species used, is of necessity influenced by the future planned use of the land, a s well the condition of the site. Stormwater Management Stormwater management is another State requirement implemented by local governments. The \"2000 Stormwater Design Manual\" encourages native s pecies. An appendix to the manual contains a list of native species suitable for stor m water management. County/Municipal planting guidelines The control of land use by county and municipal gov ernments includes landscape design and maintenance. Thus, guidelines and lists prepared by local government agencies may dictate the species selection of property owners. Local landsca pe design guidelines address issues such as security, screening, historic preservation and recr eational needs in addition to taking ecological concerns into account. Historically, non-native spe cies have often been preferred because of their 66 perceived toughness, hardiness and aesthetic benefi ts. For many decades local government- recommended species lists have included many invasi ve species such as Norway maple bush (Euonymus alatus ). County and municipal governments may look to State policies and guidelines for best management practices, but are also driven by local political and social forces. For example, Japanese barberry, a major invader of Maryland's fo rests, is used (because of its thorns) to direct traffic and to screen open areas of commercial spac es from windblown trash, and has become a staple for local zoning requirements. The standards of agricultural communities may reflect the fact that, as an industry, agriculture tends toward monocultures and seeks to reduce bordering biodiversity, which in some cases may function as a sink for crop weeds and habitat for certain pests and diseases. Recently, some local governments have updated their planting guidelines, eliminating many of the most egregious invasive species and adding nati ve species. To a large extent, changes in local planting guidelines result from pressure by educate d citizens who provide input to their local government officials. The Work Group recognizes the challenges, such as heat and drought, which urban and suburban locations present. A compl ete survey of local planting guidelines was beyond the scope of this Report, but we offer two e xamples where native plants are being recommended: (1) Maryland National Capital Park and Planning Commission requires the use of native plants in addition to non-invasive exotic sp ecies in both Montgomery and Prince Georges counties; and (2) Baltimore City states, \"Native sp ecies provide additional benefits over non- native species. If you are planting more than 3 tre es, at least 50 percent should be native.\" Public outreach on native landscaping and gardening There are a number of programs in place that promot e the importance of native plants in Maryland and their use in the landscape: DNR offers the long-established Wild Acres program to engage the public to plant their gardens for wildlife, including the use of native p lants for pollinators. When first established, the program offered to certify residen tial properties as Wild Acres, with a certificate and sign. Currently the program is web- based offering fact sheets and periodic newsletter. See http://www.dnr.state.md.us/wildlife /Habitat/WildAcres/index.asp The Chesapeake Conservation Landscaping Council (CC LC) promotes the use of native plants for conservation landscaping throughout the mid-Atlantic region, including in Maryland. Through conferences, field days, and thei r web site (www.chesapeakelandscape.org), CCLC educates profes sionals and the gardening public on best practices. Nature centers, arboreta, and State and county gove rnment agencies throughout the State educate the public and promote the use of native pl ants in the landscape and their importance in their native habitats. For example, t he Maryland Native Plant Society and the Sierra Club each has a state-wide presence, spo nsoring field trips, providing educational publications and a web site. Other nonp rofits such as Adkins Arboretum in Caroline County, and county programs such as Jug Ba y Wetlands Sanctuary in Anne Arundel County, also engage the public through publ ications, field trips, and educational events. 67 The University of Maryland Extension Master Gardene rs are trained volunteers who promote environmental horticulture in 21 counties a nd Baltimore City. These volunteers receive basic training in ecology and work with the gardening public to promote their message of environmental stewardship. The Master Ga rdeners offer the Bay-Wise Landscape Management program (BMP). Master Gardener s receive advanced training on BMPs, including the importance of native plants. Up on invitation, they visit home gardens, consulting or certifying landscapes as \"Ba y-Wise\" based on a list of environmentally sound practices. Recommendations to increase the use of native plants in restoration and landscaping The use of native plants in restoration, landscapin g, and gardening should be encouraged in order to enhance biodiversity in partial compensation for the loss of natural biodiversity, and to avoid spreading non-native invasive species. This include s planting under the auspices of State agencies such as the State Highway Administration ( SHA) and Maryland Department of the Environment (MDE). 1. We recommend continuing coordination among MDE, DNR and SHA with respect to recommended and/or approved plant lists and review of the lists as appropriate for the removal of objectionable species . Those agencies recognize the value of using nativ e plants where possible for restoration, roadsides, a nd other situations, and the need to avoid invasive non-native plants. 2. We recommend supporting programs to encourage la ndowners to maintain gardens and landscapes for the benefit of native wildlife a nd to avoid invasive non-native plants. Although there has been coordinated outreach to lan downers, many members of the public remain unaware of the effects\u2014both negat ive and positive\u2014of private gardens and landscapes on our natural environment. Proactiv e strategies will be required to address this information gap. 3. We recommend discussion among MDA, SHA, MDE, and DN R of the potential for an enhanced native plant and seed industry in Maryland . Based on examples from other states and preliminary research in Maryland, there may be potential for the State, in partnership with industry, to assist in the develop ment of an enhanced native plant and seed industry to serve Maryland customers, potentia lly benefitting native plant conservation and local business as well as Maryland consumers. It is understood that further development and enhancement of a Maryland-b ased native plant and seed industry should be industry driven and that additional dedic ated funding for State agencies to providing testing, certification, licensing, and ot her support functions will be required for program creation and development.

BSP Sensitive Joint-vetch G2 S1 E LT In the above example the species is ranked as globa lly rare and State rare (G2 and S1 respectively) with a status of threatened at the fe deral level and endangered in Maryland (states may list a species with a higher but not lower stat us). However, to understand the terms rank and status as it pertains to States the following examp les are presented: Scientific name Common Name Grank Srank S1 T From the two examples above we see that State rarit y does not necessitate global rarity and it is not necessary to be federally endangered or threate ned to have status within individual states. Federal status relates the endangerment of a specie s within the nation, whereas State status relates the level of endangerment of the species wi thin the State's political boundaries. Each treatment presents the case for rarity in Maryland, i.e., why the rank and status. So, for the above examples it is informative to present the rest of t he rare plant treatment instead of just the first line. A key to the headings is presented first: 1. Latin name Common name Grank Srank MDstatus F edstatus 2. Latin Family name (common family name) 3. Taxnote: identifies and clarifies the use of nam es (taxonomy). 4. Consnote: relates information about the conserva tion of the species including factors of rarity and threats. 5. CP (PD, RV, AP): abbreviations of physiographic provinces, e.g., coastal plain, piedmont, ridge and valley, Allegheny plateau: Habitat description (counties of occurrence,). Agalinis skinneriana Pettingill and Neel (2008) confirmed that Maryland plants were sister to the sample from Miss ouri but indicate that further investigation may be warrante d to determine if the Maryland populations are actu ally an unrecognized species as our populations are strikin g disjuncts from the core range in midwestern prair ies. Consnote: Endangered by habitat loss, damage by off -road vehicles, woody succession of barrens habitat . CP: sandy roads, barrens Rosaceae (Rose Family) Taxnote: A widespread species in the northeastern U .S. having both diploid and polyploid populations. Maryland populations are near the southern terminus of the s pecies range and some plants were determined to be triploid. Consnote: Threatened by competition and displacemen t shrubs, particularly Lonicera Washington ). 79 Appendix 4: A Native Plant and Seed Industry Model This appendix contains a summary description of a m odel, developed by Dr. Sara Tangren, for an enhanced, locally based, native plant and seed i ndustry. The intent is to provide a basis for further explor ation of what might be developed with State agency and industry cooperation. The three primary systems are based on the USDA's Specialty Crop Industry Model (Bewick 2007). Information spec ific to the native plant/seed industry was taken from interviews by Dr. Tangren with industry stakeholders in Maryland, Pennsylvania, Connecticut, Iowa, Minnesota and Florida. The model was presented at three stakeholder conferences in 2013 and its content evolves as stak eholder input is received. The accompanying diagram (Figure 1, Appendix 4) depicts this model. A robust, local, native plant and seed industry cou ld benefit Maryland's economy and its environment. The production and sale of locally nat ive plants and seeds is an activity inherently suited to local farms, wholesale nurseries, and ret ail shops. Other states have developed industries that are variations on this model, and M aryland could learn from their experience. 6 Production begins with a state agency that is respo nsible for producing small quantities of certified, locally native, foundation seed from wil d-collected sources. This is provided to farmers and wholesale growers, along with supporting techni cal information. Farmers use the foundation seed to produce large quantities of certified seed, enough for large-scale plantings (roadsides, mine reclamations, etc.). Wholesale nurseries could also use certified seed to produce locally native plant materials for other landscaping uses. State policies and regulations affect the demand fo r plants and seeds. Maryland agencies currently specify the use of native plant material in various situations, but the plants and seeds may be purchased from states distant to Maryland. I f local ecotypes and/or locally produced plant material, certified as described above, were regularly specified, then this would create demand that could only be filled by nurseries offer ing locally native plant materials. Purchasers of plants and seeds include consumers pu rchasing for personal use at retail and landscape companies purchasing for professional use . Retail consumers rely on the labeling of plants on store shelves and this labeling may be mi sleading. For example, plants may be labeled 'native' when they are native to the United States, but are not native to Maryland. Also, some of the plants labeled 'native' are breeder-developed c ultivars rather than naturally occurring genotypes, and this distinction may not be apparent to the customer. Moreover, if plants have been produced in a distant region, they may not be well adapted to growing conditions in Maryland. Wholesale nurseries that produce the plan ts offered by retail nurseries and landscaping companies could benefit from the abilit y to offer quality, locally produced and accurately labeled, native plants. 6 See, e.g., Hodges, A.W. and J.J.

Native Plants: An Overview. of Fl orida IFAS Extension technical paper ENH1045, 7pp. 80 Plants of sufficient size and appearance for use in formal landscapes can be hard to source. At the same time, landscapers are experiencing an incr ease in demand for native plants for use in sustainable landscapes, water-quality plantings, li ving shorelines, and pollinator gardens. A well-developed Maryland-based native plant and se ed industry could help to meet the needs of many different customers. Figure 1 to Appendix 4.
