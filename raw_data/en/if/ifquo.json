This page contains information on wellness requirements for new students, as well as information on how to get connected to care before starting school. Requirements for New Students Undergraduate and Graduate Students All incoming students (including transfer students) must complete two requirements for the Wellness Center leading up to the spring semester. 1. Submit proof of immunization: Proof of immunity is an Illinois state requirement. All Loyola students enrolled in seven or more credit hours must complete the [two-step process ](https://www.luc.edu/wellness/medical/immunizations/)to verify proof of immunity. Incomplete immunization information will block access to registering or changing classes. All students must submit immunization requirements into LOCUS and submit supporting documents to the Wellness Center before the 10th day of the term. Failure to provide timely information will result in a $50 non-compliance fee, that may be applied to your account. The non-compliance fee is non-refundable, and will not be removed even after immunization information is completed. Students living in University-owned housing will not be permitted to move in until the two-step process is complete. *Please note, immunization requirements must be submitted, even if non-compliance fee was applied, in order to register for class or make a change to your registration. For more information, visit [Immunizations](/wellness/medical/immunizations/). 2. Complete AlcoholEdu and Sexual Assault Prevention course: All incoming students, including transfer students, are required to complete online courses called AlcoholEdu and Sexual Assault Prevention for Undergraduates/Graduates. These two courses provide students with important information and resources around alcohol abuse prevention and sexual violence prevention. The courses will be released in late Jan and will be due in mid Feb. The course will be emailed to new students, and reminders will be sent out periodically about the courses. For more information on these courses, visit [AlcoholEdu for College & SAP.](/safetynet/prevention/newstudenteducation/alcoholedu/) Please email [alcoholedu@luc.edu](mailto:alcoholedu@luc.edu) if you have any questions. The Wellness Center provides confidential advocacy services for students who have experienced gender-based violence. Please call [The Line](/coalition/) at 773-494-3810 if you need support or resources. The Line is open Monday-Friday, 8am-4:30pm and 24 hours on the weekend when classes are in session. Connecting to Mental Health and Medical Care The Wellness Center offers medical and mental health services for students. The Wellness Center offers therapy in a brief treatment model to students, and students can make appointments by phone or online when they start school in the fall. If you are an incoming student that currently utilizes mental health services and plans to see a therapist in the spring, we encourage you to reach out to the Wellness Center before the spring semester begins. Call the Wellness Center at 773-508-2530, option 3, and leave a voicemail. An available mental health staff member will call you back shortly. If you have any questions about medical services before coming to campus, please call Dial-A-Nurse at 773-508-8883 between 8:30-4:30, Monday-Friday. The Wellness Center is suspending allergy shots for the spring semester due to COVID-19. If you need regular allergy shots, the Wellness Center put together a list of [Allergy and Asthma Referrals ](/media/lucedu/wellness/pdfs/Allergy & Asthma Referrals.doc) for the Chicago area. "}
