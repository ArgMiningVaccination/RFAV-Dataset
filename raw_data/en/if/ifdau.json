The NKF Helpline is available Monday to Thursday 08:30am - 5:00pm Friday 9.00am - 1.00pm on 0800 169 09 36 or email [email protected]. This list of drugs does not include everything you might be taking. It includes many drugs commonly given to kidney patients. The inclusion of a drug on the list is not a recommendation that it should be used. Conversely, the omission of a drug from the list does not suggest that your doctor should not be prescribing the drug to you. AZATHIOPRINE ABOUT YOUR MEDICINE Azathioprine belongs to a group of medicines called immuno-suppressants. As the word immunosuppressant suggests, the function of these drugs is to suppress the immune system, which is the body's natural defence system. The aim is to dampen down the immune system enough to stop it rejecting the transplanted kidney while still keeping it active enough to fight infections. All patients who have a kidney transplant need to take drugs called immunosuppressants. Azathioprine is also taken for autoimmune disease, for example, vasculitis. It is used to try and improve kidney function and to dampen down the disease, stopping it from causing any further damage to the body. Azathioprine is only available from your doctor. You should NOT be vaccinated with some vaccines whilst receiving azathioprine. (Vaccines are injections that can be given to help prevent you catching some diseases, for example, polio). You should receive more information about which vaccines you can and cannot receive from your consultant. Do not stop taking the drug or start taking it only occasionally, you will lose your kidney or the vasculitis condition may go out of control and your kidneys may fail completely. TAKING YOUR MEDICINE You should swallow the tablets whole with a glass of water, with meals. Do not chew the tablets. Your recommended daily dose should be taken as a single dose at teatime. Take the tablets exactly as directed by your doctor. Please read the label carefully. If you forget to take a dose, take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it is nearly time to take the next one. Never take two doses at the same time. Take the remaining doses at the correct times. Your doctor may want to take regular blood samples while you are taking azathioprine to make sure that dose is OK for you. UNWANTED EFFECTS Azathioprine may cause side effects in some patients. Most side effects are nothing to worry about. Common side effects are feeling sick, being sick, loss of appetite. Taking the tablets with food should reduce this. Other rare, more serious side effects include fever, rashes, decrease in blood cell numbers, liver and kidney problems that are noticed by changes in your blood tests. Your doctor will ensure that the appropriate blood tests are taken. You are more likely to develop infections whilst receiving azathioprine and any infections may be worse than normal. You should report any signs of infection to your doctor. You should report any unexpected bruising, bleeding, or rashes to your doctor. You should avoid sunbathing and use a sunblock in sunny weather. You are recommended to see your doctor about regular skin checks and cervical smears for women, this is because you are more likely to develop skin or cervical cancers which are not serious if noticed early. All tablets may cause side effects in some people. If you think that you are suffering from a side effect of one of your tablets it is important NOT to stop taking the tablet, but see your doctor who will be able to change that tablet for one which will suit you better. CICLOSPORIN ABOUT YOUR MEDICINE Ciclosporin belongs to a group of medicines called immunosuppressants. As the word immunosuppressant suggests, the function of these drugs is to suppress the immune system, which is the body's natural defence system. The aim is to dampen down the immune system enough to stop it rejecting the transplant kidney while still keeping it active enough to fight infections. All patients who have a kidney transplant need to take drugs called immunosuppressants. Ciclosporin is only available from your doctor. Ciclosporin is also taken for auto-immune diseases. It is used to try and improve kidney function and to dampen down the disease, stopping it from causing any further damage to the body. You should NOT be vaccinated with some vaccines whilst receiving ciclosporin. (Vaccines are injections that can be given to help prevent you from catching some diseases, for example, polio). You should receive more information about which vaccines you can and cannot receive from your consultant. Ciclosporin is the drug name, there are different brands of ciclosporin available. The best-known brand is Neoral\u00ae, it is also available as Deximune\u00ae. It is very important that you ALWAYS take the same brand of ciclosporin. Always check that you receive the same brand from your doctor or pharmacy. Different brands can work differently, if you change brands you may damage your new kidney. You should NEVER stop taking ciclosporin unless told to by your hospital consultant. TAKING YOUR MEDICINE You should not chew the capsules. Your daily dose should be taken as two divided doses, morning and evening, as directed by your doctor (12 hours apart). Ciclosporin liquid is available if you have problems swallowing. You should AVOID grapefruit and grapefruit juice for one hour before taking ciclosporin, because it can affect the amount of ciclosporin that gets into your system. You should take the capsules exactly as recommended by your doctor. You will need to have regular blood samples taken to check that you are receiving the correct dose of ciclosporin, too much can be bad for your kidney. When you come to have a blood test you should not take your morning dose until after you have had your blood taken. If you forget to take a dose, take it as soon as you remember, unless it is nearly time for your next dose, then go on as before. Always take ciclosporin as directed by your doctor and only stop it on the advice of your doctor. UNWANTED EFFECTS Ciclosporin can cause side effects in some people, the most common side effects include gum swelling, hair growth (especially facial hair), tremor, feeling sick and diarrhoea, the rarer side effects include rashes, weight increase, kidney damage and muscle weakness. It is important that you visit your dentist regularly and tell them that you are taking ciclosporin and clean your teeth regularly. It is recommended to use a medicated mouthwash such as Corsodyl\u00ae to help the gums not to swell. You are more likely to develop infections whilst receiving immunosuppressant therapy and any infections may be worse than normal, you should report any signs of infection to your doctor. You should also report any unexpected bruising, bleeding or rashes to your doctor. Some drugs may cause problems with ciclosporin, these include erythromycin, rifampicin and phenytoin. Some herbal remedies may also cause problems, including St. John's Wort. - this is not a full list so always check with your doctor or pharmacist before taking any other medicines with ciclosporin. It is best to AVOID sunbathing and to use a sunblock in sunny weather. You are recommended to see your doctor about regular skin checks and cervical smears for women. This is because you are more likely to develop skin or cervical cancers, though these are not serious if noticed early. CO-TRIMOXAZOLE ABOUT YOUR MEDICINE Co-trimoxazole is an antibiotic that you need to take after your kidney transplant or when you are taking cyclophosphamide or rituximab. It is a combination of two medicines called sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim. It is given at a low dose to prevent you from catching a specific chest infection, a type of pneumonia called pneumocystis, or PCP or CDC. You are more likely to get infections while you are taking a lot of immunosuppressant drugs for your new kidney. When you are asked to take fewer immunosuppressant drugs, you will be able to stop taking the co-trimoxazole, normally six months after your transplant or finishing cyclophosphamide or rituximab treatment. TAKING YOUR MEDICINE Before taking your medicine read the information leaflet inside the pack. It will give you more information about the medicine including a full list of the side effects. You should swallow the tablets whole with a glass of water. The tablets are usually taken once a day. If you have problems swallowing, a liquid is also available. UNWANTED EFFECTS As with all medicines, co-trimoxazole can cause side effects in some people. The most common side effects include feeling sick, being sick and skin rashes. If the tablets make you feel sick try taking them with food: if you develop a rash, you should report it to your doctor. straightaway. Rarely, side effects include changes that will be noticed with your blood tests, eg. changes to your red and white blood cells. This means you may become anaemic, bruise or bleed more easily than usual. Your liver might also be affected and cause you to become jaundiced (yellow). Unwanted effects often improve after a short while, however, if they are prolonged or troublesome, speak with your doctor or pharmacist. OTHER ADVICE Some drugs may cause a problem when taken with co-trimoxazole. For instance, co-trimoxazole should never be taken with methotrexate. Always check with your doctor or pharmacist before taking any other medication along with co-trimoxazole including medicines that you can buy without a prescription or any herbal and complementary medicines. CYCLOPHOSPHAMIDE ABOUT YOUR MEDICINE Cyclophosphamide belongs to a group of medicines called immunosuppressants. It can also be used in bigger doses to treat some cancers. As the word immunosuppressant suggests, the function of these drugs is to suppress the immune system, which is the body's natural defence system. Cyclophosphamide is taken for some autoimmune diseases for example, vasculitis, myeloma, lupus or membranous nephritis. It is used to try and improve kidney function and to dampen down the disease, stopping it from causing any further damage to the body. Cyclophosphamide can be given as an injection or in tablet form. Cyclophosphamide can be taken as a larger dose once a week or a smaller dose once a day. Your doctor will decide which is better for you. Contraception should be used whilst taking cyclophosphamide and for 3 months afterwards because it could be harmful to unborn babies. You should NOT be vaccinated with some vaccines whilst receiving cyclophosphamide. Vaccines are injections that can be given to help prevent you from catching some diseases, for example, polio). You should receive more information about which vaccines you can and cannot receive from your consultant. TAKING YOUR MEDICINE The tablets should be swallowed whole, not chewed or crushed. Ideally they should be taken with a full glass of water, you should check with your doctor about increasing your fluid intake. If you are taking high dose cyclophosphamide with another tablet called mesna, the mesna tablets can be broken in half or taken whole to get the dose needed. UNWANTED EFFECTS Like all medicines, cyclophosphamide can cause side effects. With higher doses, feeling sick is common, but this is reduced by a tablet called ondansetron which is taken one hour before your first dose of cyclophosphamide. Cyclophosphamide can cause inflammation of the bladder so, with higher doses, you may be given a tablet called mesna, which will protect your bladder. Hair loss can occur during treatment. It is more likely with the higher dose cyclophosphamide, smaller, daily doses are less likely to cause a problem. Hair growth comes back again after finishing treatment and often comes back whilst remaining on low doses daily. Cyclophosphamide can also cause a decrease in white blood cells, your doctor will check your blood regularly to make sure this does not occur. A drop in white blood cells can make you more prone to catching infections. In particular, illnesses like chickenpox can be more severe in this situation - inform your doctor if you come into contact with anyone with chickenpox whilst on cyclophosphamide treatment or if you have had it before. Cyclophosphamide can also increase the chance of developing a lung infection called pneumocystis (PCP). You may be prescribed a preventative antibiotic called co-trimoxazole to reduce this risk. Contact your doctor if you develop a temperature higher than 38\u00baC, or if you feel unwell and develop unexplained bruising or bleeding at any point during treatment with cyclophosphamide. Cyclophosphamide can cause infertility in some patients (being unable to have a baby). Infertility is usually temporary but, in some cases, can be permanent. It can occur in both men and women. Your doctor will discuss your options, including sperm banking, before you start treatment. In women, cyclophosphamide may also cause a temporary or permanent change in your monthly periods, causing them to become irregular or causing them to stop. Women may also experience an earlier menopause. You are recommended to see your doctor about regular skin checks and, for women, regular cervical smears. This is because you are more likely to develop skin in cervical cancers which are not serious if noticed early. ISONIAZID ABOUT YOUR MEDICINE Isoniazid is a drug which may be taken after a kidney transplant by patients who may come into contact with or have previously had tuberculosis (TB) - a long-term infection which mainly affects the lungs but which can affect any part of the body, or the chest. It is given at a low dose to prevent TB infections. TAKING YOUR MEDICINE Before taking your medicine read the information leaflet inside the pack. It will give you more information about the medicine including a full list of the side effects. You should swallow the tablets whole with a glass of water, take them exactly as recommended by the doctor. It is best to take the tablets half an hour before food or two hours after. This is because isoniazid is absorbed better when your stomach is empty. UNWANTED EFFECTS As with all medicines, isoniazid can cause side effects in some people. The most common side effects include feeling sick, being sick. You should tell your doctor if you suffer badly with being sick. It may also damage peripheral nerves which can cause tingling or a loss of feeling in your hands and feet. This can be avoided by taking another tablet called pyridoxine once a day. This is a vitamin which should be taken every day while you are taking isoniazid. Other side effects can include liver problems. Your doctor will arrange for you to have blood tests while you are taking isoniazid to ensure your liver is working properly. Unwanted effects often improve after a short while, however, if they are prolonged or troublesome, speak with your doctor or pharmacist. Some drugs may cause a problem when taken with isoniazid. These include some anti-epileptic drugs and theophylline. This is not a full list so always check with your doctor or pharmacist before taking any other medication along with isoniazid including medicines that you can buy without a prescription or any herbal and complimentary medicines. MYCOPHENOLATE ABOUT YOUR MEDICINE Mycophenolate belongs to a group of medicines called immunosuppressants. As the word immunosuppressant suggests, the function of these drugs is to suppress the immune system enough to stop it rejecting the transplant kidney while still keeping it active enough to fight infections. All patients who have a kidney transplant need to take drugs called immunosuppressants. Mycophenolate is also taken for autoimmune diseases for example, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). It is used to try and improve kidney function and to dampen down the disease, stopping it from causing any further damage to the body. Mycophenolate is only available from your doctor. There are several mycophenolate products which include mycophenolate mofetil (Cellcept) and mycophenolate sodium (Myfortic or Ceptava). Your transplant doctors will advise which you are to take. You must not switch between the two preparations of the drug unless your transplant doctor advises you to do so. However, you may change between different brands of mycophenolate mofetil - ask your pharmacist for advice. You should NOT be vaccinated with some vaccines whilst receiving mycophenolate. (Vaccines are injections that can be given to help prevent you from catching some diseases, for example, polio).

Take the capsules/tablets exactly as your doctor asked you, never change the dose yourself. If you accidentally take an extra dose, tell your doctor immediately, if you forget to take a dose, take it as soon as you remember unless it is nearly time for the next dose, then go on as before. If you stop taking mycophenolate you will lose your new kidney or cause your disease to get worse. You will need to have regular blood samples taken and your medication may need to be adjusted according to your blood test. UNWANTED EFFECTS Mycophenolate may cause side effects in some people. The most common side effects include diarrhoea, feeling sick, trembling, headaches and dizziness. Other side effects include problems with the blood. As with any immunosuppressant drug you are more likely to develop infections and any infections may be worse than normal, you should report any signs of infection to your doctor. Some other drugs may cause problems with mycophenolate, these include indigestion remedies, aciclovir, probenecid and cholestyramine. Some herbal remedies may also cause problems including St. John's Wort. This is not a full list so always check with your doctor or pharmacist before taking any other medication along with mycophenolate. It is best to AVOID sunbathing and to use a sunblock in sunny weather. You are recommended to see your doctor about regular skin checks and cervical smears for women.

If you think that you are suffering from a side effect of one of your tablets it is important NOT to stop taking the tablet, but see your doctor who may be able to change that tablet for one which will suit you better. Mycophenolate products can cause birth defects in the unborn baby of mothers who are, or have recently been, taking mycophenolate. It is for this reason women are advised not to become pregnant whilst taking mycophenolate and for 6 weeks after stopping it. INFORMATION FOR WOMEN WHO COULD BECOME PREGNANT Do not stop taking mycophenolate without speaking to a member of the transplant/renal team if you think you have become pregnant We now know that approximately one in four children born to women who are taking mycophenolate will have a birth defect. Up to half of pregnant women taking mycophenolate will have a miscarriage. Both of these figures are much higher with mycophenolate compared with women who take other anti-rejection medicines or in those who do not take mycophenolate Before you start mycophenolate, you will be asked to do 2 pregnancy tests 8-10 days apart. Where possible treatment will only be started if these are negative- Date of pregnancy test 1- Date of pregnancy test 2 (8-10 days later) While taking mycophenolate (and for at least 6 weeks after stopping) you should use two reliable forms of contraception. Reliable methods of contraception include :- Barrier methods (condoms, diaphram) when supplemented with spermacide- Tubal ligation (sterilisation) - Hormonal implants - Oral or injected combined hormonal contraceptives (the pill) - Certain intrauterine devices (the coil - check with family planning clinics) - Male sterilisation Do not donate blood during or for 6 weeks after stopping treatment. INFORMATION FOR MEN WHOSE PARTNER COULD BECOME PREGNANT Do not stop taking mycophenolate without speaking to a member of your transplant/renal team even if you think that your partner has become pregnant For sexually active men (including those who have had a vasectomy) condoms should be used during treatment and for 90 days (13 weeks) after your last dose of mycophenolate to avoid mycophenolate being passed to your female partner. Female partners of male patients treated with mycophenolate should use reliable contraception during treatment and for 90 days (13 weeks) after your last dose of mycophenolate Do not donate blood during or for 6 weeks after stopping treatment IF I AM TAKING MYCOPHENOLATE AND WANT TO TRY FOR A BABY, WHAT ARE MY OPTIONS? It is important that you talk to your consultant or a member of the transplant/renal team before trying for a baby. If you are a man or a woman taking mycophenolate, it may be possible for you to change to an alternative medicine. In transplantation, it is recommended that both male and female patients, who are taking mycophenolate, wait one or two years after the transplant before considering a switch of anti-rejection medicines in order to try for a baby. This helps to ensure that: any risk of rejection with medicine switch is minimal you are on the lowest doses of anti-rejection medicine possible your transplant function is stableFor people taking mycophenolate for an auto-immune disease, we recommend that you have a discussion with your consultant in clinic before trying for a baby. Your consultant will assess how active your disease is as it is important that you only try for a baby if your disease is well controlled. Your consultant will discuss the possibility of switching to an alternative treatment to mycophenolate. PREDNISOLONE ABOUT YOUR MEDICINE Prednisolone is a steroid tablet.
