In modern parlance crystal theory is related to Electrocrystal therapy, which is concerned with the balancing and the rebalancing and harmonizing of human energy. Electrocrystal therapy was developed by the British inventor Harry Oldfield in the 1980s. This technique involves the use of an electromagnetic generator attached to conducting tubes filled with specific types of crystals. These tubes are applied to the body, and energy is transmitted through them. It is proposed that various types of crystals in these tubes have different effects on the body. An electronic device may also be used that is said to be able to detect areas of energy imbalance of the body. These areas may then be treated with electrocrystal therapy. Crystal Therapy, Electrocrystal Therapy) However, as critics note of Electrocrystal therapy; \"The safety and effectiveness of these techniques have not been thoroughly tested scientifically.\" (Crystal Therapy, Electrocrystal Therapy) In more scientific terms it is known that crystal structures can \"...collect, focus, and emit electromagnetic energy. \" (Gemstone / Chakra therapy) While science realizes that crystals have specific properties,\" Yet science is not even close to understanding how truly powerful crystals are in the more important task of focusing life energy.\" (Gemstone / Chakra therapy) Central to the concept and praxis of this form of therapy is the focus on a holistic approach to healing and various elements of holistic medicine and holistic therapies. This means that this therapy views the individual as a whole entity and does not just focus on the specific physical symptoms of an illness, as is usually the case in more conventional allopathic methods of treatment. In many cases crystal healing is used as a complementary method rather than an alternative to conventional medicine. It is felt by many practitioners that the restoration of energy balance in the body as a result of crystal theory can be positively combined with other forms of medicine and healing. Crystal therapy is also considered to have a positive impact on the overall health of the patient in that it is known to relieve \"...stress and tensions, through revitalisation, relaxation or establishing a greater amount of peace and harmony.

However they are sometime used to determine the conditions of the patient's \"bio-magnetic field\" and in helping to harmonize and balance the appropriate human energy fields and chakras. As will referred to in the section on statistics, there is at present no general acceptance or formal acceptance of this method of therapy in the larger medical community.

Crystal therapy can only be correctly understood if there is acceptance of its wider meaning and context and in terms of the fundamental tenets of \"New Age\" alternative medicine and healing. The fundamentals of the alternative therapy movement are based on metaphysical and spiritual assumptions and beliefs - all of which strongly influence the practice of crystal healing.

It enters into and is incorporated in the various energy points or chakras in the body. This relates is turn to the natural health and vitality of the body and the total human being. Therefore, in terms of New Age philosophy: \"When white light flows harmoniously [from the astral body] into the interior centers (the chakras), our condition becomes healthy and more harmonious. When there is some obstruction in the chakra, blocks are formed, and these blocks prevent energy from flowing freely, and the body is unable to heal itself.\" (Fuller 242) Therefore an understanding of this metaphysical system is necessary to see how crystal therapy relates to health issues.
