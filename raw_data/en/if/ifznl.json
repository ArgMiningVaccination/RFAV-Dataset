While senior nurses administered the vaccines, other students helped with registration and logistics. Approximately 600 doses of the vaccine were dispensed at the clinics held March 16 and March 23. Dr. April Cone, Nursing Academic Program Manager for the USC Salkehatchie Rural Nursing Initiative, understands the importance of the nursing program's partnership with the community. \"We are excited that our nursing students have the opportunity to provide their expertise and assistance in such a significant community health endeavor. This experience not only enhances their clinical nursing skills, but also allows them to realize the true impact nurses have in a community. As a rural and medically underserved area, it's encouraging to see the partnerships of local healthcare and education organizations that are making it possible for Allendale County residents to access this essential public health service,\" Cone said. USC Salkehatchie will host additional clinics in April, and Dean Chris Nesmith hopes that the opportunities provided by the clinics will help accelerate a return to normalcy. \"We are pleased to be able to host the vaccination clinics for the Allendale community and to support everyone's health and safety. It is great to see so many taking advantage of these opportunities, and we hope clinics like these will bring us closer to moving past the pandemic,\" Nesmith said. The clinics are sponsored by Allendale County Hospital along with multiple community partners including Low Country Health Care System, USC Salkehatchie, USC Salkehatchie Nursing Program, Allendale County, SC National Guard, Concerned Citizens for Allendale County, Georgia "}
