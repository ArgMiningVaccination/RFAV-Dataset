Learn about ways to relieve sinus pain without medication. Sinus Pain Has a Variety of Causes If your head is throbbing and you feel pressure around your eyes, cheeks, or forehead, you could have a sinus headache. \"Many factors can cause a sinus headache,\" says [Subinoy Das, MD](http://www.usasinus.org/meet-dr-das), chief executive officer and interim medical director for the U.S. Institute for Advanced Sinus Care and Research in Columbus, Ohio. The most important factor is swelling of the lining of the nose and sinuses, causing pressure and pain on in the face and head. Symptoms of [sinus pain and headache](/pain-management/headache/sinus-headache.aspx) include pain associated with congestion from a [common cold](//www.everydayhealth.com/flu/guide/) or allergies; pain around your eyes, forehead, or over your teeth; pain that is worse in the morning; and pain that gets worse when you bend over. Some of the more natural methods of relieving sinus pain that reduce swelling, thin mucus secretions, and improve sinus drainage are often very helpful. Treat Sinus Pain With Humidity \"Dry, [thick mucus](/mucus/) in your nose and sinus passages can form crusts that block sinus drainage and trap viruses and other particles. Increasing humidity and getting more fluid into your body can help your mucus thin out and get moving again,\" says Dr. Das. Some natural ways to get your sinuses draining and relieve sinus pressure include drinking plenty of fluids; using a humidifier; avoiding cold, dry air; taking plenty of steamy showers; and drinking a cup of hot tea or soup. Irrigate to Relieve Sinus Pressure \"Salt water irrigation is the best way to cleanse the nose and sinuses \u2014 this can help prevent or relieve sinus pain. You can use an over-the-counter saline [nasal spray](https://www.everydayhealth.com/ear-nose-throat/nasal-sprays.aspx), but I recommend using a sinus rinse bottle, [neti pot](/products/reviews/how-safely-use-neti-pot/), or bulb syringe irrigation kit that you can get at the drugstore,\" advises Das. Try this commonly-used, easy-to-make [nasal irrigation](/sinus-infection/irrigating-your-sinuses-with-neti-pots-nose-sprays/) solution with your own sinus irrigation kit: Fill a clean 8-ounce glass with distilled or sterilized lukewarm water. Do not use tap water unless it has been boiled for at least 1 minute (3 minutes at high elevations). Add 1/2 teaspoon of non-iodized salt and a pinch of [baking soda](/diet-nutrition/diet/baking-soda-uses-benefits-side-effects-recipes-more/). And be sure to clean all equipment and make a fresh batch of solution each time you use your kit. Alternate Hot and Cold Compresses \"Reclining with a hot washcloth over your eyes and nose can help warm the nasal passages and loosen secretions,\" says Das. You can also alternate warm and cold compresses to relieve [sinus pain](/pain-management/headache/sinus-headache.aspx) and sinus pressure. Here's how to do it: Start by placing a hot towel or washcloth across your sinuses for about three minutes. Then place a cold compress across your sinuses for 30 seconds. Alternate two more times, and repeat the treatment about four times a day. Spice Up Your Diet to Ease Sinus Pressure \"Many people find that spicy food like peppers or hot mustard opens up their nasal passages and gives them some relief from sinus pain. There is good evidence that [capsaicin](/drugs/capsaicin-topical), which is the active ingredient found in chile peppers, is effective in relieving some types of pain,\" says Das. Capsaicin preparations have been investigated for the treatment of some facial pain syndromes and of rhinitis with promising results. But if you have the taste (and stomach) for them, you can try spicy foods to help with sinus discomfort. Differentiate Between Sinus Headache and Migraine Headache Many people who assume they are having sinus pain due to sinus pressure are actually having a [migraine headache](/migraine/guide/). [Migraine](/migraine/guide/) pain can involve the same nerves as the sinus cavities and is frequently accompanied by nasal congestion, nausea, and aggravation by bright light. \"If sinus pain is caused by a migraine, the best natural treatment is lying down in a dark, quiet room,\" advises Das. Hum Your Way to Sinus Pain Relief \"Some people report that humming for one hour improves sinus pain,\" says Das. Researchers in Sweden have found that [humming can keep your sinuses clear](https://www.atsjournals.org/doi/full/10.1164/rccm.200202-138BC). How could that be possible? Humming may increase both airflow through your sinuses and the level of nitric oxide in your sinuses. The combination of nitric oxide and airflow may reduce your risk of sinusitis. So if you have a common cold or allergies, want to prevent a [sinus infection](/sinus-infection/), and know a happy tune that you don't mind hearing for an hour, you may want to try a little humming. Make the Sinus Pain and Mind-Body Connection \"Techniques that take advantage of the mind-body connection, such as deep breathing practices and relaxation exercises, can be very effective for relieving sinus pain,\" notes Das. These practices rely on the mind's ability to influence pain perception and are especially helpful with chronic or recurrent pain that is often seen with sinus pressure. Some examples include biofeedback, meditation, [yoga](https://www.everydayhealth.com/yoga/), and [hypnotherapy](/integrative-health/hypnotherapy/guide/). Avoid Sinus Pain Triggers \"One of the most important things to avoid is over-the-counter nasal decongestant sprays. They may give some fast relief, but after a few days they make sinus pressure and nasal congestion much worse,\" warns Das. Some other things you can do to prevent sinus pain include avoiding alcohol, which can aggravate sinus pain and congestion; cleaning your [humidifier](/ear-nose-throat/humidifier-for-sinusitis.aspx) to avoid fungal allergies; washing your bedding in hot water to decrease allergy exposure; and avoiding swimming, diving, or flying when you have sinusitis, a common cold, or nasal allergy. Know the Limits of Natural Sinus Pain Relief You should not try to self-treat your sinus pain if you have symptoms such as as yellow or green mucus discharge; persistent fever or stiff neck; pain for more than 24 hours; confusion, weakness, numbness, or tingling; and persistent nausea or vomiting. These symptoms could be a sign of a significant infection in your sinuses that might need antibiotics. \"Using natural sinus pain relief is fine if you have mild chronic pain or a headache related to a common cold or an allergy, but if you have severe pain that is not responding to these techniques, you need to see your doctor,\" advises Das.
