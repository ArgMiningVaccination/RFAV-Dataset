Chronic ilness, insomnia, nutritional deficiencies or sensitivities, hormone imbalances such as thyroid, adrenal, or menopausal issues, toxicity, Candida, chronic pain, or situational stress all can be factors. Once the causes are identified, we can help with lifestyle counseling, nutrition, supplements, homeopathy, or acupuncture and chinese herbs. Traditional Chinese Medicine elegantly and energetically rebalances the Qi, and Homeopathy works on a very deep level to kick start a change. Our goal is to reconnect you with your vital self so that you can get your life back on track and enjoy work and activities with your friends and family again. Digestive Disorders In naturopathic medicine we pay particular attention to bowel and liver function. Without proper digestion, even the best foods or supplements cannot be assimilated and transformed into energy; and without proper elimination, toxicities build up and wreak havoc in the body. Our goal is to identify the obstacles to cure and support the healing powers of nature to enable the body to function as it was designed. Fertility I didn't try to start a family until after I was 40, so I have special empathy for anyone involved in the emotional rollercoaster of trying to get pregnant: that monthly cycle of trying, hoping, and disappointment. In natural medicine we identify the obstacles to conceiving: hormone imbalance, nutritional factors, stress, toxicity, and the many unknown factors which acupuncture and Chinese Herbal Medicine are excellent in addressing.
