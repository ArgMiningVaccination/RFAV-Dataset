Ayurvedic Solutions that can settle your Immunity problems If you are someone who faces health issues, it most probably implies that your immune system is weak. A weak immune system can result from your lifestyle, genetics, inherent disorders, and many other factors. While it might not always be easy to point out a single reason for your fragile immunity, you definitely can try to boost your immunity to make things better. Ayurvedic methods have proven to be more than effective for a lot of health problems, and you can always count on Ayurvedic practices to improve your immunity in the long run. There are many Ayurvedic remedies for strengthening your immunity and building internal power, which will help you to fight off diseases and infections. Especially now that the monsoon is here, cold and flu will become almost inevitable, and incorporating Ayurvedic techniques can help you improve and support your immune system. Pay attention to the diet Ayurveda believes in the concept of \"Food is medicine,\" and what you eat pretty much determines what your health is like. You can incorporate superfoods such as black pepper, broccoli, orange, garlic, brussels sprouts, ginger, and strawberries to improve the health of your immunity. Your gut health is very important to support your immunity, and fermented foods are your best option. These include yogurt, sauerkraut, kombucha, kimchi, etc, which will promote favorable microbial activity inside your gut, and this improves your immunity. Besides your gut health, it is essential that you keep the Kapha, pitta elements of your body balanced as the optimum balance of these elements directly translates to optimum health and immunity. The following tips can help you maintain balance and improve your immunity. - Include proportionally more vegetables, greens, healthy legumes, fruits, and so on - Reduce the intake of fried foods, red meat, salty foods, and so on. - Keep yourself hydrated at all times. It is advisable to drink warm water or organic teas. - Herbs such as Ginger, Turmeric, Tulsi, Coriander seeds, Liquorice Cumin seeds, etc., have great benefits associated with building a sturdy immune system. The best way to consume these herbs is to make a tea-like concoction out of them. There are many other ayurvedic immunity booster herbs that also can be used in cooking or in teas. - You can incorporate immunity-boosting concoctions such as warm milk with turmeric and pepper, Kabasura concoction, ginger-honey reduction, etc. [Nivaran90](https://nivaran90.com/) has made the [kabasura](https://nivaran90.com/products/nivaran-90-kabasura-syrup) concoction more accessible and palatable. Kabasura is a traditional herbal formulation derived from Siddha medicine and has a blend of natural herbs- including Chukku, Thippili, Vatta Thirappi Ver, Yashad Bhasma, etc. This blend is usually boiled with water to make a drinkable potion, but Nivaran90 has cut down that process for you by formulating the Nivaran90 kabasura in a syrup form that is sweet and palatable, unlike the original bitter potion. Hence, it wouldn't be a problem to make kids drink it too. Ayurvedic Massages Stress can be a major reason behind a weak immune system, and there is nothing better than an indulging massage that can take away all of the stress. Unfortunately, it is not quite practical to have an in-salon massage session every other day, which is why Ayurveda suggests Abhyanga, which is a form of self-massage done with warm oils with great nourishing properties. Some of these oils include sesame oil, coconut oil, jojoba oil, etc. that help you calm down and support your immunity. This massage practice usually involves slightly heating up the oil and working the oil over your body, starting from the toes to the head. This practice nourishes your skin, relieves stress, and activates your nerve endings, which in turn makes you feel great inside out. The main benefit of practicing self-massage is that it relieves the stresses built on the nervous system and, in turn, supports your immunity. Oil pulling with sesame oil is also great for boosting your immunity. Besides, practicing regular steam inhalation with essential oils like eucalyptus, echinacea, etc., can help you breathe better. You can also go a step further and incorporate nasal oils into your regimen. These oils pretty much cleanse the nasal membranes and keep them strong. Practice Yoga Yoga has a lot of benefits associated with immunity-boosting and is considered an immunity-boosting activity. Practicing yoga regularly will have a great impact on your physical and mental health. Especially inverted yoga positions will aid in lymphatic drainage that gets rid of germs from your system. Yogic postures such as the Uttanasana, Sarvangasana, etc., aid in lymphatic cleansing and draining, which are great for your immunity. Besides, meditation techniques and breathing exercises that are part of yoga can help relieve stress as well. Ayurveda advocates a wide array of preventive techniques that help you stay healthy and keep diseases away. But, more than just preventive techniques, Ayurveda believes in the effectiveness of long-term practices that are intertwined with one's lifestyle, and the same approach holds true for a healthy immune system as well.
