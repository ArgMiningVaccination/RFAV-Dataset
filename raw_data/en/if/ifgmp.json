Dr Kirkor is here to explain why platelet-rich plasma has emerged as a viable solution amongst a crowded field of remedies. What is platelet-rich plasma (PRP)? Platelets are one of the natural components of our blood. They are responsible for clotting, i.e., they stop bleeding. But what is less known, is that they are also packed with very strong so-called growth factors which combat inflammation and promote natural healing of any tissue in the body by stimulating the immune system. So, it can be said that platelets are an anti-inflammatory natural remedy, more potent than any available medication. [Platelet Rich Plasma (PRP)](https://www.topdoctors.co.uk/medical-dictionary/platelet-rich-plasma) is made by concentrating platelets from a patient's own blood in order to make an extremely strong product that will stimulate a natural anti-inflammatory response. PRP is like a double espresso shot for the immune system. Such made PRP can be injected into any tissue where the injury is. How effective is platelet-rich plasma for neck pain? PRP is very effective as proven by growing numbers of good quality research articles. It has been shown that PRP is more effective than steroid injections, [hyaluronic acid](https://www.topdoctors.co.uk/medical-dictionary/hyaluronic-acid) and other similar treatments. More importantly, its beneficial effect lasts longer compared to other injections. Their effectiveness depends on correct diagnosis and precise injection. We are able to address many structures in the neck, such as facet joints, ligaments, discs, nerve roots and so on. PRP is also effective in so-called cervicogenic headaches, i.e., headaches caused by neck problems. What is the procedure for injecting platelet-rich plasma into the neck? The procedure is carried out on a daily basis, i.e., does not require hospital admission. It is carried out under local anaesthesia and the injection is either x-ray or [ultrasound](https://www.topdoctors.co.uk/medical-dictionary/ultrasound-treatment)-guided. Neck injections require high skill levels and should only be performed by a fully trained, experienced and skilled physician. The procedure consists of two parts: drawing blood like for any blood test and after preparation injecting PRP to the target tissue. Altogether it takes approximately two hours, of which the longest part is PRP preparation. Are there risks of using platelet-rich plasma for neck pain? PRP is a natural product derived from our own blood. So, there is no risk of allergic reaction. Also, as this is a natural product, there is no risk of an overdose. The only risk is related to an operator and his/her skills. That's why it is vital to approach only a skilled and experienced one. How long until platelet-rich plasma results are noticeable? It usually takes a couple of weeks before PRP shows its effect. Can neck pain return after PRP treatment? Like after any treatment, the pain can return. But the effect of PRP lasts considerably longer than after other injections. Usually, one may expect pain relief lasting up to 18-24 months. The good news is that the treatment can be repeated anytime if needed. Dr Zbigniew M Kirkor is a highly experienced consultant pain management specialist based in London.
