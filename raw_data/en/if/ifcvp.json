The Entity Energy Release Meditation will guide you through an identification process to locate negative thought forms and energies stuck in your unconscious. I refer to these negative energies as entities. I explain about these energies in the Introduction. I look at entities much like a parasite. They often function through the mind and work themselves into a persons way of thinking (most times without the person realizing the energy is not them). This is its parasitic, energy draining nature, and this is where we intend to shine the light of awareness. The second part of the MP3 takes you through the active Pranayama Breath Meditation that will help you identify, clear and, most importantly, HEAL. Set the time aside and do the work. It can change your life. Love, David guided meditations are different than private session work. The imagery I am working with as I create the guided meditations is a person laying on their bed, under a blanket in a comfortable position with an eye mask on. I talk more in guided meditations than i do in private sessions because I want you (the breather) to feel safe with the accompaniment of my voice and guidance through emotional releases. These meditations only work if you lean into them with the active breathing, so if you are interested in doing the work and empowering yourself with your own healing then lean into them fully and practice often. Also there are many of the older meditations free on [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/artist/7lnGKrOWAuKvNoxEleY8Vm?si=G3c4WiatRVShDpDW8HEU3Q), use them as much as you want!\" Lastly at any point if you feel like the energy is getting too strong and creating too much release or movement then slow the breathing down, breathe through the nose and even remove the eye mask. As you start thinking the energy will subside. If your hands get tight then make a fist and open the hands while affirming or saying out loud, \"It is safe for me to open my heart and receive love\". If the energy gets tight around your mouth you can affirm and say out loud, \"It is safe for me to speak up and I have a lot to say!\" 32 Reviews [ Hide Reviews Show Reviews ](#productReviews-content) - Very good meditation, I did a few sessions and felt a feeling of energy flow. I recommend this meditation. - Entity clearing/ release Meditation This meditation was so nice, once i settle into the breath and fully surrender which is a new experience each and every times it allows me to fully let go all all old energy, tension and old thought patterns that are ready to be let go of in that particular session so its perfect to use whenever i need it... Thank you, many blessings for the work you do - Entity Energy Release A wonderful, powerful healing meditation. David's work has had a wonderful impact on my healing journey. - Wonderful Guidance and Clarity This meditation is a great way to continue or even start spiritual work. Each time it unleashes something and is very powerful. It's amazing how drastically this work can shift energy. David has a clear and gentle presence even on mp3, would suggest this to anybody. - Life changing I have used this meditation 3 times and each time memories that were stuck in my unconscious and fundamentally affected my life have came up. These are memories that I've never been able to work through because these things happened when I was so young that I didn't understand their emotional impact, but they went on to create fundamental misunderstandings that I based my subsequent thoughts on. Thank you for creating this powerful meditation that has already done wonders for my self-worth, self-expression and how I move forward in my life. - excellent First it was confusing to breathe on a different way but after it was amazing and very powerfull - a guide in my own work This piece has been essential for me. It is also a guide in my own work as I try to establish a safe space to practice. I have done the entity meditation on my own three times. It is intense but very much needed, and appreciated. It is working for me not just in my own exploration of healing but also I have been developing how I want to hold space through it. - very helpful I do the breathe work to this .mp3 and just started entity #2 every night and which has helped me so much - Incredibly powerful and effective for release and healing I purchased this along with David's Intro to Meditation/Breathwork mp3 and have practiced with one of the albums daily over the past week though I have primarily listened to this one in 5 sessions, at least. All in all, a wonderful supportive guided meditation and breath work session to releasing unhealthy stored energy as it actively moves, as the breath work does, unsupportive thoughts and energies supporting those thoughts out and up to Spirit. I am definitely going to have this as a mainstay in my healing and meditation practice. Thank you, David, for sharing with us. "}
