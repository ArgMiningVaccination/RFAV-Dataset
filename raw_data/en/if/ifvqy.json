Gustavo Blanco, who se rves as the Kathleen M. Osborn Chair and Dr. Warren Nothnick, who is the Vice Chair . The department maintains a rel atively large size, currently having 16 tenured facult y members, 3 research track f aculty, 3 postdoctoral fellows, 3 senior scientists, and 17 doctoral graduate students. In May of 2018, a new faculty member, Dr. Ning Wang , joined our department as an assi stant professor. Dr. Wang came from Harvard Universit y and with his work in male rep roduction, he represents a great addition to our group of reproductive resear chers. During this past year the physiol ogy department has successfull y continued working towards its academic goals, whi ch include: 1) engaging in high quality research to generate new discoveries of physiol ogical relevance in basic an d translational science that contribute to advance human health; 2) training new genera tions of physicians, graduate students, and postdoctora l fellows in physiology and p athophysiology through high quality and innovat ive teaching, to contribute to the acad emic excellence of KUMC and 3) providing academic servic e through participation in diff erent committees and task forces that help the functioni ng of our department and school. Research programs in the departm ent span various areas of resea rch and the investigators have continued to m aintain a consistent level of publications. This past year approximately 60 peer reviewed original articles were publ ished in top research journals and as book chapters. The main research areas of the d epartment include male and female reproduction, neur oscience, muscle, metabolism and integrative physiology. Studies are performe d at the molecular and whole an imal level and utilize a wide diversity of methods and approaches. In addition, research in the department complements the research efforts of several centers in our inst itution. Regarding teaching, the departm ent has had another outstanding year. Our faculty continued to maintain a high pres ence in medical education duri ng the first and second year of the Active Competency bas ed and Excellence driven (ACE) curriculum. Dr. Wood served as Discipline Lead er, and he and Dr. S tanford lead the Cardiopulmonary and Muscle and Movement blocks res pectively as Module Directors . Dr. Wolfe has been working on the upcomi ng Reproductive block. All our faculty wer e involved as Facilitators, leading the small group Case Based Clinical Learn ing (CBCL) activities of the ACE medical curriculum. The hard work of our faculty in tea ching has been recognized with important awards given to individual lecturers and to course directors for their excellence in educati on. Members of our department ha ve also continued to play a major role in the educat ion of graduate students by part icipating in the core Integrated Graduate Progr am in Biological Sciences (IGPBS) curr iculum. Faculty also taught in our department's mandator y courses for graduate stude nts, including the Comprehensive Human Physiology and Human Pathophysiology course s, led by Drs. Andrei Belousov and Steve LeVi ne respectively. In addition, var ious advanced physiology courses were offered, which cover new advances in sp ecific areas of physiology. As a testament to the work of our faculty these cou rses have received 2 excellent reviews fr om the students. Moreov er, several of our f aculty were invited to give educational seminars at ot her universities; Drs. Blanco an d Christenson taught lectures and a laborat ory in the prestigious Frontiers in Repro duction international course offered every year at t he Marine Biological Laboratories in Woods Hole, Massachusetts. We are also proud that members of the physiology department hav e continued serving in numerous key comm ittees and leadership roles at the universi ty level which are essential to the overall mission of our school. Dr. Smith serve s as the Senior Associate Dean for Research and the Co-Dir ector of the Kansas Intellectua l and Developmental Disabilities Research Center ( KIDDRC); Dr. Nothnick is the Dire ctor of the Center for Reproductive Sciences; Dr. Stanfor d is the Program Director of the KUMC Biomedical Research Training Program and t he Campus Coordinator, K-INBRE P rogram Director; Dr. Blanco is the K-INBRE Resear ch Developmental Core Director; Dr. Geiger is the Facility Co- Director of the Me tabolic and Obesity Research Phe notyping Facility (MORPh); Dr. Thyfault is the Sci entific Director of Children's Mercy Healthy Lifestyle and Nutrition Center (KUMC/CMH joint funded center), and Dr. Wo lfe is the Research Integrity Officer of our school . In addition, we have maintaine d our presence at the national and internat ional level. Our faculty have served on di fferent review panels of the National Institutes of Health as well as review panels of o ther funding agencies. They have also participated as editors, or as members of the ed itorial boards for a variety of journals. We are very grateful to our faculty who th rough talent and hard work, have continued to maintain the high academic standards and succ ess that gives our department great national and international visibility. The physiology department has a lso undergone some challenges th is year. This consisted in difficulties rela ted to obtaining extramural fundi ng, which is a problem common to other departments and schools. This has been caused b y the continuous reduction in funding from local a nd national agencies. Funding was further impacted by some changes in the allocation m odel for the distribution of fu nds in our university, which occurred at the beginni ng of 2018. The department has tak en initiatives, by starting an enhancement program, with the idea of facilitating faculty obtaining grants. We are confident that this should improve our ability to obtain new funds. Regarding the department's office , we continue oper ating with S hari Standiferd, who serves as the Director of Oper ations, and Jennifer Wallace and Liam Higgins, who are our coordinators for financial a ccounting support. Our special thanks go to them. They provide outstanding administra tive support to our department th rough their hard work and continuous dedication. In addi tion, we would like to thank our work study students, Alexis Battershell and Mackenz ie Boone, who provided additional excellent clerical support to our office. We would like to especially rec ognize our benef actor and contin uous supporter Mr. Jim Osborn. His generous contributions o ver the years, in memorial of his daughter Kathleen, and wife Marion, as well as his recent commitment hav e significantly contributed to our success. The Kathleen M. Osborn Endowed Chai r, the Marion M. 3 Osborn Professorship, and the lectureship in honor of Kathleen M. Osborn have made a great difference to our departm ent. These funds continue to sup port the department's goals and our students. We all imm ensely appreciate the excepti onal support that Jim Osborn has given in honor of his family. 4 HIGHLIGHTS FROM THE 2017 - 2018 ACADEMIC YEAR RESEARCH FUNDING: The loss of faculty, as well as the difficulties in obtaining new grants, has resulted in a decr ease in research funding to the d epartment. Most universities today face a climat e of low general funding levels . Currently members of our department continue to work hard to produce and submit high qua lity grant proposals. This has resulted in new grant s being funded; however, our goal is to increase this number. Based on data provided by KUMC Enterprise Analytics, to tal NIH funding was $3,184,810, which is higher than that of last year ($2,571,231) . The latest data available shows that our department was r anked 52nd at the national level for NIH research funding among 81 medical schools re ceiving NIH funding. While t his is a good position, we would like to imp rove this ranking. During fiscal year 2018 grant requests from the department indicated total costs of $47,599,374 (which included $34,479,119 in direct costs and $13,120,255 in indirect c osts). From these, $44,936,4 33 corresponded to grant proposals submitted to the National Institutes of Health. EDUCATION: Continuing a long tradition th e physiology depar tment has had another outstanding year with respect to t eaching. As mentioned previou sly, Drs. John Wood and Stanford led the Cardiopulm onary and Muscle and Movement bl ocks of the ACE curriculum. Cardiopulmonary wa s awarded best module and Drs. Bl anco and Wood received Student Voice awards for excellence in teaching. These awards were presented by the medical student s at the Grande Affair celebrat ion on January 20, 2018. These awards are a testimony to the long-lasting commitme nt of our faculty members to education. As a cont inuation of our commitment to ed ucation, our faculty participated in developing the ne w ACE medical curriculum. Dr. John Wood served as a Discipline Leader. Due to the importance of physiology in years 1 and 2 of the medical curriculum, faculty in our depar tment will continue to have an important role in teaching new generations of physicians . Regarding the graduate student c urriculum, we continued offering our two main c ourses, Human Physiology and H uman Pathophysiology, directed by Drs. Belousov and LeVine respectiv ely. In addition, several advanced courses were t aught. These included the Integr ative Physiology of Exercise course (directed by Drs . Geiger and Thyfault) and the Molecular Mechanisms of Neurological Disorders (lead by Dr. LeVine). TENURE TRACK APPOINTMENTS: We are pleased and excited to have added Dr. Ning Wang to the department as a new assistant professor. Ning Wang, Ph.D., started as an assistant professor on May 1, 2 018.

Osborn Chair 8 9 Molecular & Integrative Physiology Emeritus Professors 10 In Honor of Physiology Donors and the Continued Impact that their Generosity Provides Mr. James Osborn (1919 - 2018) Mr. Osborn's relationshi p with our department began through his daughter Kathl een. She developed an interest in science and biol ogy in high school and while attending college at the Univ ersity of Missouri. During the summers of 1968 and 1969, Kathleen worked in the reproductive physiology lab of Dr. Gilbert Greenwald at the KU School of Medicine. This experience was particularly meaningful to Kathleen and might have motivated her to enter a career in science had she not been taken prematurely in an automobile accident in 1970. At the time of her death, Kathleen was in her junior year at the University of Missouri. Mr. Osborn and his late wife Mari on, had such high regard for D r. Greenwald, who died in 2004, and deep gratitude for Kathleen's experience, that the y made plans to benefit the medical center through KU E ndowment. Their generosity start ed with the Kathleen M. Osborn Lectureship in 1971. Thi s lectureship remains the lon gest running and most successful lectureship in the hi story of the medical center. It has attracted a long list of preeminent scientists from ar ound the world and funds from the Kathleen Osborn Lectureship have also support ed the annual Gilbert S. Greenwald Symposium. In 2006, in memory of his beloved wife, Mr. Osborn established the Marion M. Osborn Professorship to support reproduct ive science within the depart ment. The inaugural and current recipient is Dr. Leslie Heckert. Mr. Osborn continued his generosit y in honor of his daughter in 2012, establishing the Kathleen M. Osborn Chair to s upport the leadership position of the department. Dr. Paul Cheney was the inaugural r ecipient and in 2016 Dr. Gustavo Blanco was named the second Kathleen M. Osborn Chair. This year we are again the thank ful beneficiaries of Mr. Osborn 's philanthropy with the establishment of the Kathleen M. Osborn Fellowship in Reproduct ive Physiology. This fellowship will support graduate students in our department int erested particularly in reproductive science. The fellowsh ip will enable recipient stud ents to discover the same 11 enthusiasm for science and love o f learning that Kathleen found so many years ago. The first student to receive this great honor was Rikki Nelson. 12 William Biklen Pendl eton J.D. (1920 - 2015) William Biklen Pendleton attended Liberty High School and graduated in 1939 from Shattuck High School in Minnesota. After graduation he attended the University of Kansas and joined the Beta Theta Pi fraternity. William served during World War II i n the U.S. Army from 1942- 1946 as a Lieutenant in the 593rd engineer boat and shore regiment that was attached to the Australian 6th Division for the invasion of B orneo. Following the war, he resumed his studies at the University of Kansas. He graduated with an AB in ec onomics in 1946. He was hired by the account ing department of Link Belt Company of San Francisco. Later, he moved back to Lawrence and farm ed for five years. In 1957 he re ceived his JD from the University of Kansas Law School. D uring his law practice he was a municipal court judge from 1959-1967, and president o f the Douglas County Bar A ssociation in 1981. In 1958 he married Edith Cottom Livingston and adopted her two children Stephen and Helen. Together, they had a son Martin William Pendleton. Edith and Martin both passed away in 1974 in an automobile accident. When William retired he remained active in the community. He pa rticipated in many clubs including the KU Chancellors Club, Elizabeth M. Watkins S ociety, the Vestry of Trinity Episcopal Church and wa s treasurer in the 1960's, Lawre nce Breakfast Optimist Club was Optimist of the Year i n 1992 and 1997, the Midland Rai lway Historical Association where he was a di rector, and the American Legion. H e volunteered at the Heartland Medical Clinic at the L eo Center and Fr iends of Hidde n Valley. When he was not volunteering or participati ng in clubs William enjoyed coll ecting one-cylinder antique engines, traveling and riding st eam trains around the world, an d going on rail excursions in his own Fairmont inspection car. He passed away at the age of 95 on May 15 th, 2015 at Pioneer Ridge Assisted Living in Lawrence, KS. Pendleton donat ed his body to research. Pendleton graciously donated to the University of Kansas Endowm ent Association. He wished for the money to be used in reproductive biology for fam ily planning and birth control research and counseling. 13 Dr. Louis R. Fletcher (1892 - 1973) \"Life is so precious and exciting, and there is so much to be learned, that I dislike to waste a minute.\" Louis R. Fletcher, M.D. Dr. Louis R. Fletcher left an unforgettable and generous mark on the University of Kansas. Described as a farm boy from Harper, Kansas, Dr. Louis R. Fletcher attended the University of Kansas and Southwestern College for medical school. Hardworking, humble, and adventurous are just a few words to describe the life Dr. Louis R. Fletcher lived. Dr. Fletcher was a modest man who worked extremely hard for his opportunities and income. Throughout college he paid for his expenses by washing dishes, lawn keeping, and working wheat fields. Additionally, he took breaks in his schoo ling to save money by working in various employment opportunities in Alaska including working in the gold mines, ore processing mills, and as a bridge carpenter. He retu rned to KU for the 1917- 18 school year and then finished his last 2 years of education at Rush Medical College of the University of Chicago where he received his degree in medic ine. He spent much of his professional career (26 years) working for the United Fruit Company in hospitals in Panama, Guatem ala, and Honduras. He served his country as a commissioned Lieutenant Commander i n the Navy. Additionally, he also served as chief of surgery at the Camp White Na val Hospital in Medford, Oregon. He had a lifelong love of learning. He returned to KU for postgraduate study in anatom y, not for a degree, but for the inner desire to learn. Dr. Fletcher rarely stayed idle in his work as he then served i n many different medical positions. His adventurous spirit served as a driving factor as he traveled and worked in many different countries. He returned to the United Fruit Compa ny for a few years, served at a hospital at Superior, Ariz ona, worked as the medical super intendent of the Valdez Community Hospital, was the project physician at the Naval Base at Point Barrow, and served as a surgeon for a constru ction company in the Marshall Islands. Following retirement from the medical pr ofession, Dr. Fletcher spent time traveling to grand places. He began by sailing from New Orleans to South Africa and then c ontinued his travels to Asia, Australia, and New Zealand. Throughout his life, Dr. Louis R. Fletcher became intrigued wit h the prospect of being a \"millionaire.\" Fletcher made th is happen through \"frugality, sk imping, and strict economy.\" He invested his money and was very conservative with his spendi ng and lifestyle. He lived modestly, ate low cost substantial food, and chose to tra vel by bus instead of train or plane. Dr. Fletcher humbly ac hieved that goal of a million d ollars, in which he then said, \"As you know, I have always dreamed of acquiring a million doll ars. This has finally been accomplished and today I have given this million dollars to Kan sas University, the school that I love so deeply and which has had such a tremendous good influence on my life. I 14 have done this with the greatest of pleasure and satisfaction.\" His donation to the Kansas University Endowment Association has provided support for resea rch in physiology, biochemistry, pharmacology, and anatomy at the University of Ka nsas Medical Center as well as construction of the Dr. Louis R. Fletcher Research Labo ratories. The physiology department wants to extend a grac ious and continued thank you t o Dr. Louis R. Fletcher for the opportunities and suppor t his generosity continues to p rovide. 15 Dr. Walter Joseph Meek (1878 - 1963) Dr. Walter Joseph Meek demonstrated academic excellence throughout his life. Dr. Meek and his family's generosity is cont inually valued and honored in the Physiology Departm ent. Walter Joseph Meek was born in Dillion, KS in 1878. At age eight, Dr. Meek's father passed away f ollowed by his mother's passing a few years later. Following their passing, he was raised with his first cousins. From a young age, Dr. Meek showed strong educ ational aspirations. Dr. Meek graduated from the University of Kansas in 1902 where he was senior class president and editor of the school paper. As of 1983, Dr. Meek held the highest-grade point aver age of a University of Kansas Graduate. He cont inued his educational pursuits at Penn College and the University of Chicago obtaining his Ph.D. in Physiology in 1909. While pursui ng his Ph.D. he taught at Penn College from 1903 - 1908 wher e he attained the rank of pro fessor of biology. Dr. Meek then began teaching at the University of Wisconsin. He ser ved as instructor in physiology (1908-1910), assistant professor (1910-1912), associ ate professor (1912- 1918), and professor (1918-1948). He then assumed the position of chairman of Physiology Department until his retirement in 1948. Additional professional accompli shments at the University of Wi sconsin include assistant dean of medicine from (1920 - 1942) , acting dean (1942 - 1945), and associate dean from 1945 until his retirement. Dr. Walter Joseph Meek also hel d the commission of major in the Chemical Warfare Service during the World War I. A chemi cal warfare unit was set up at the University, and Dr. Meek assisted with discovering th e biological effects of mustard gas, lewisite, and phosgene. Dr. Meek married Crescence Eberley on December 26, 1906. Six ye ars later, they had their first child, Joseph Walt er Meek, born in 1912. Joseph bec ame a law school professor at the University of New Mexico. Their second child, Mary Cresc ence Meek, born in 1917, worked as a stewardess for American Airlines. Their third and f inal son, John Sawyer Meek, was born a year later in 1918. He became a professor of c hemistry at the University of Colorado. The Meek family wa s very adventurous, embarking on many different outdoor endeavors. They visited Swi tzerland to hike over the hi gh passes and climbed Pikes Peak. They also spent time at Yellowstone and Glacier Nat ional Parks. Additionally, Dr. Meek enjoyed side hobbies including photography, gardening, repairing and refinishing antique furniture, and collecting shells and stamps . Dr. Meek's contributions to the study of the history of medicin e are nothing short of extraordinary. His bibliography c onsisted of 110 scientific pap ers and one of his most clinically relevant contributions was the discovery, in collabo ration with Maurice H. 16 Seevers and Ralph M. Waters, tha t catecholamines cause ventricu lar fibrillation in dogs anesthetized with cyclopropane. Upon Dr. Meek's retirement in 1948 he remained at the Universit y of Wisconsin as a research professor for an additional year. He continued to lect ure at the University of Texas and served on a committee to establish a medical school i n Gainesville, Florida. His death occurred quietly in 1963 at the age of 84. Mrs. Meek passed away in 1973 at the age of 92. His ashes are bur ied with his wife's in her fami ly's burial plot in Pennsylvania. The Physiology D epartment extends remembrance and sincere gratitude to Dr. Meek and his family for the generosity bestowed upon the Physiology Department. The allocation of funds is st ill greatly valued and utilized wi thin the Department to continue Dr. Meek's passion of advancing medicine. 17 Abrahams Lectureship Established Mr. J. Hambleton Abrahams (1913 - 1996) Abrahams and his wife, J ulie, lived in Topeka, where he was born and raised. Mrs. Abrahams was a KU E ndowment Association trustee. He attended Chattuck Military Academy, Northwestern University and graduated from the Universi ty of Chicago with a bachelor's degree in philosophy. In 1978 he received an honorary doctor's degree in Business from Washburn University. He served during World War II in the U.S. Navy and later in the Naval Re serve as an officer. Abrahams was active throughout the community. Serving as an officer or member on the board of banks, hospitals, the chamber of commerce, the Red Cross, and many other organizations. Security Benefit is the paren t company of the Security Benefit Group of Companies, a financial services organization th at maintains more than $13 bi llion of life insurance in force and has $2 billion in a ssets under management. After join ing the company in 1935 he later held the positions of secretary treasurer, executive v ice president, president, and chairman. Abrahams encompass ed the leadership skills to gro w Security Benefit from a small, midwestern company to one of the largest life ins urance companies in the United States. The Security Benefit Group o f Companies headquartered in Topeka , started an annual gift of $7,500 to the KU Endowmen t Association to fund the J Ha mbleton Abrahams lectureship in Physiology at K UMC. The lecture series honors Ab rahams's 50 years with Security Benefit. According to Gilbert S. Greenwal d, Ph.D., chairman of the Physi ology Department in KUMC: \"the funds will be used to bring annually to the center a person of national and international reputat ion in one of the physi ology subspecialtie s: cardiovascular physiology, renal physiology, neurophysiology, endocrinology, b iophysics or epithelial transport physiology.\" After 60 years of service for Se curity Benefit Abrahams retired in 1995. He stayed busy traveling between homes in Topek a, Colorado, and Arizona. Abrah ams passed away at the age of 83 in 1996 one y ear after reti rement. 18 Mr. James Osborn (1919 - 2018) Born December 18th 1919.

Belousov, Ph.D. , Associate Professor We are interested in the mechanisms of r egulation of neuronal gap junctions (electrical synapses) during development a nd neuronal injury. We also st udy the role of neuronal gap junctions in death of neurons in the developing nervous system and in the secondary, glutamate-dependent neuronal death following ischemic stroke, traumatic brain injury and epilepsy. As a result of t hese studies, a novel model of the mechanisms of glutamate-dependent neur onal death has been proposed, where neuronal gap junctions play a critical role.

Belousova, M.S., Senior Research Associate 63 V. Gustavo Blanco, M.D., Ph.D. , Professor & Kathleen M. Osborn Chair Our laboratory studies the role of ion-transpor t proteins of the plasma membrane in cell function, with a particular emphasis on the Na,K-ATPase. The Na,K-ATPase or Na pump is an enzyme of the cell plasma membrane, that uses ATP to transport cytoplasmic Na+ out of the cell in exchange for extracellular K+. Structurally, Na,K- ATPase is composed of a catalytic and an associated subunit. In mammals, different molecular variant s or isoforms of the (1, 2, 3 and 4) and a (1, 2 and 3) polypeptide are expressed in a tiss ue and cell dependent manner. Our work has shown that different isoforms of the Na,K -ATPase have enzymatic properties that are unique and that they are not biologically redundant. Wh ile the ubiquitously expressed Na,K-ATPase 1 and 1 functions as the housekeeping Na,K-ATPase in the cell, the other isozymes mediate tissue-spec ific roles. We have identified 4 as a catalytically active isoform of the Na,K-ATPase, which is only expressed in testis male germ cells and is abundant in the sperm flagellum. Using pharmacological tools and genetic approaches in transgenic mice, we hav e established that Na,K-ATPase 4 is essential for sperm motility and male fertility. We are currently continuing experiments to understand the mechanisms of action and regulation of 4, with the idea of using it as a biomarker for male fertility and a target for male contraception. In addition, we are studying the role of the Na,K-ATPase in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). ADPKD is characterized by the progressive enlargement of fluid filled cysts in the kidneys that comp romise the function of the organ. We have found that the hormone ouabain, acti ng via the Na,K-ATPase 1 stimulates renal cyst formation and progressi on in ADPKD. We continue experiments to understand the role and mechanisms of ac tion of ouabain in ADPKD, with the idea of finding approaches to slow ADPKD cystogenesis.

Chennathukuzhi, Ph.D. , Associate Professor My research interests include uterine fibroi d pathogenesis, fertility and contraception. Uterine fibroids are the most common tumors of the fema le reproductive tract and are the leading indication for hyster ectomies in the US. Sadly, there is no approved drug to treat uterine fibroids chronically. Our l aboratory is trying to understand the regulation and function of GPR10, a G pr otein-coupled receptor, aberr antly expressed in uterine fibroids. We have generated transgenic mice overexpressing GPR10 in the myometrium in order to understand its ro le in the pathogenesis of fi broids. Transgenic-hGPR10 mice develop uterine fibroids that are phenotypically identical to the human disease. We plan to use this preclinical model for the dev elopment of small mole cule modulators of GPR10 as treatment for fibroids. In addition, we have identified t he molecular machinery that regulates aberrant expressi on of GPR10 in uterine fibroi ds. We recently developed a conditional knockout model for Rest, the tr anscriptional represso r of GPR10. Rest cKO mice develop uterine fibroid phenotype. We have also identified PRICKLE1 as the upstream regulator of REST st ability and function in the uterus . Our laboratory is trying to validate the role of environmental estr ogens in the suppression of Prickle1 gene and REST protein expression using rodent models. Our laboratory is also interested in molecu les that regulate sper m function and male fertility. We have an ongoing proj ect to identify small molecule inhibitors of CDK2 that specifically inhibit meiosis, as potential contraceptive dr ugs. We are also studying the functional regulation of the sperm specif ic sodium-proton exchanger (sNHE) in expression systems that ut ilize chimeric channels.

Christenson, Ph.D. , Associate Professor Fertility, infertility and ovarian cancer are major health concerns for women. Research in my laboratory focuses on understanding t he terminal events involved in follicular development and ovulation. The studies have di rect implications in development of a fertile healthy oocyte, contraception and dis ease conditions such as polycystic ovarian syndrome and ovarian cancer. Current studies focus on understanding the role extracellular vesicles (exosomes and microves icles) play in ovarian maturation, granulosa cell function) and in ov arian cancer. The laboratory is also examining how post-transcriptional regulator y processes such as RNA editing impacts oocyte developmental competen ce. These studies use the latest state of the art technologies, including next-gen-sequencing, nanoparticle analysis in addition to standard molecular and biochemical techni ques. The laboratory also uses a comparative approach using human, bovine and murine cells and animal studies in both cows and mice to gain further insights into the reproductive biology of the ovary.

Undifferentiated spermatogonia with spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs or male germline stem cells, GSCs) at the foundation of the differentiation hierarchy undergo both self-renewal and differentiation to support lifelong production of sperm. We employ molecular, cellular, genetic, and transplantation approaches to investigate the mechanism regulating SSCs maintenance and meiotic differentiati on. In addition to the basic science importance, our studi es will aid the development of SSC transplantation therapy to improve and re scue fertility in clinical settings. Joined the department on May 1, 2018. Research Personnel: Bailey Bye, Research Assistant Xiaoyu Zhang, Ph.D., Postdoctoral Fellow 96 Michael W. Wolfe, Ph.D. , Associate Professor Research in my laboratory has focus ed on estrogen signaling and its control of reproduction and metabolism. Use rat models in which estrogen receptor alpha or beta has been mutated. These receptors have diffe rential and at times opposing functions. We have found that loss of estrogen signaling l eads to female infertility, hyperplasia of the male prostate and alterations in metabolism including hepatic function.
