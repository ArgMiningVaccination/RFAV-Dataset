Brexafemme (ibrexafungerp), Sporanox and Tolsura (itraconazole) are only available as oral formulation s (due to its formulation Tolsura exhibits greater bioavailability than conventional capsule formulations of itraconazole) (Tolsura prescribing information 20 20). Clotrimazole and miconazole are available as oral, topical, and vaginal formulations. Only the oral formulations will be discussed in this review. In May 2016, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommended limiting the use of ketoconazole for the treatment of skin and nail fungal infections due to the risk of severe liver injuries and adrenal gland problems and advised that it can lead to harmful drug interactio ns with other medications. Ketoconazole should be used for the treatment of certain fungal infections, known as endemic mycoses, only when alternative antifungal therapies are not available or tolerated (FDA Drug Safety Communication 2016).

CLINICAL EFFICACY SUMMARY The oral antifungal agents are FDA- approved for a variety of indications. Some head- to-head clinical trials have been conducted to evaluate the efficacy of the oral antifungal agents for the treatment of various indications.Data as of June 3, 2021 RS-U/H JI-U/KM R Page 35 This information is considered confidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

For the treatment of aspergillosis, open- label trials have demonstrated the effectiveness of itraconazole for the treatment of pulmonary aspergillosis in patients who are immunocompromised and/or refractory to amphotericin B (Caillot 2003, Caillot et al 2001). Another study demonstrated the superiority of itraconazole over standard supportive measures in chronic cavitary pulmonary aspergillosis (CCPA) (Agarwal et al 2013). Posaconazole has been shown to be effective in the treatment of invasive aspergillosis in patients who are refractory to 7 days of antifungal therapy or intolerant to conventional therapy (Walsh et al 2007). In the treatment of invasive mucormycosis, isavuconazonium sulfate was studied in a single- arm, open- label trial and was associated with an all -cause mortality rate of 38% through day 42 and an end- of-treatment success rate of 31% . Isavuconazonium sulfate was shown to be noninferior to voriconazole as treatment for invasive aspergillosis for all -cause mortality at day 42 (McCormack 2015). Another trial found isavuconazonium sulfate noninferior to voriconazole in all -cause mortality at day 42 in patients receiving primary treatment for invasive mold disease primarily caused by Aspergillus species (Maertens et al 2016). Open- label studies e valuating the use of itraconazole in the treatment of blastomycosis and histoplasmosis have demonstrated clinical response and/or success rates of 81 to 90% (Dismukes et al 1992 , Wheat et al 1995). In a multicenter, prospective trial, a relapse- free rate of 95.3% was demonstrated at 1 year in patients treated with itraconazole for a first episode of mild to moderate disseminated histoplasmosis who had successfully completed 12weeks of induction therapy with itraconazole (Hecht et al 1997). In a double- blind, randomized, controlled trial, fluconazole and itraconazole were compared in pediatric patients with signs of sepsis and positive blood cultures for Candida species . Statistically similar cure rates were observed between groups (Mondal et al 2004). In another randomized, controlled trial, voriconazole and amphotericin B were compared in patients with candidemia and demonstrated no significant difference between groups in rates of successful response.However, significantly more patients infected with C. tropicalis had a successful response to voriconazole compared to amphotericin B (Kulberg et al 2005). Fluconazole with or without flucytosine has also been compared to amphotericin B with or without flucytosine for the treatment of Cryptococcus species infection with somewhat conflicting results. In a multicenter, randomized, controlled trial, no significant difference in successful treatment in HIV -infected patients with cryptococcal meningitis was demonstrated with oral fluconazole vs amphoteri cin B, with or without flucytosine (Saag et al 1992) . Conversely, in a prospective, randomized controlled trial, significantly fewer treatment failures were demonstrated in patients with orwithout acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) treated with amphotericin B plus flucytosine compared to oralfluconazole (Larsen et al 1990). A Cochrane review concluded that the most effective regimen for cryptococcal meningitis in patients with HIV is combination therapy with flucytosine and amphotericin B ( Tenforde et al 2018). In the treatment of various dermatophyte infections, studies comparing ketoconazole and griseofulvin have shown conflicting results. Some studies demonstrate significantly better response to ketoconazole compared to griseofulvin(Jolly et al 1983, Legendre and Steltz 1980) while other studies fail ed to replicate this finding (Gan et al 1987, Stratigos et al 1983, Tanz et al 1985, Tanz et al 1988). Comparison of griseofulvin and terbinafine for the treatment of tinea corporis and tinea cruris showed significantly higher clinical and mycological cure rates for terbinafine at week 6compared to griseofulvin and significantly higher rates of relapse with griseofulvin (Voravutinon 1993). A meta- analysis found that griseofulvin was more effective than terbinafine in treatment of children with tinea capitis caused byMicrosporum species , and that terbinafine, itraconazole, and fluconazole are at least similar to griseofulvin in treatment of children with tinea capitis caused by Trichophyton species . The findings also suggested that terbinafine was more effective than griseofulvin in T. tonsurans infection (Chen et al 2016). Combination treatment with oral terbinafine and itraconazole for dermatophytosis was found to have higher clinical and mycological cure compared to itraconazole or terbinafine alone (90% vs 50% vs 35%, respectively) . Specific clinical measures included itching, erythema, and scaling. Significant adverse effects were not observed ( Sharma et al 2020). Multiple studies have been conducted evaluating the use of antifungals for oral candidiasis. A Bayesian network meta- analysis of 31 randomized controlled trials (N = 4042) found fluconazole to have better mycological cure rates compared with other agents including itraconazole, miconazole, ketoconazole, r eview meta- analysis found limited results comparing antifungals for the treatment and prevention of oropharyngeal candidiasis in HIV -positive children and adults but did find fluconazole and ketoconazole were superior to nystatin in clinical cure. Itraconazole and fluconazole were superior to clotrimazole in clinical cure. They also found that fluconazole was effective for prevention (Pienaar et al 2010). Studies evaluating the oral antifungal agents as prophylaxis against fungal infections in immunocompromised patients have compared various agents head- to-head. A multicenter, randomized trial compared fluconazole, a nd posaconazole in patients after remission -induction chemotherapy. Significantly fewer invasiveData as of June 3, 2021 RS-U/H JI-U/KM R Page 36 This information is considered confidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

Clinicians should refer to the full prescribing information and published resources when making medical decisions. fungal infections occurred with posaconazole compared to fluconazole and itraconazole. Also of note, significantly fewer cases of invasive aspergillosis were o bserved, and significantly fewer patients experienced treatment failure with posaconazole (Cornely et al 2007). Similarly, a study comparing fluconazole and posaconazole in patients with GVHD after HSCT demonstrated a significantly lower incidence of aspergillosis in the posaconazole group compared to the fluconazole group. Breakthrough fungal infections occurred in more patients in the fluconazole group (Ullmann et al 2007). A comparison between fluconazole and voriconazole in patients undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation showed no significant differences between the groups' fungal- free survival rates and the incidence of invasive fungal infections (Wingard et al 2010). A network meta- analysis of 54 randomized trials concluded that posaconazole is the most effective antifungal for primary prophylaxis in patients with hematological malignancy, but mortality was similar among all of the agents included in the analysis ( Lee et al 2018). The efficacy and safety of voriconazole in the treatment of immunocompromised pediatric patients (aged 2 to < 18 years) with invasive aspergillosis or invasive/esophageal candidiasis were evaluated in 2 noncomparative, open- label trials (Martin et al 2017) . Of the 53 patients enrolled in the studies, 25 were aged 2 to 12 years. For all patient s, global response rates were 64% for invasive aspergillosis and 76% for invasive/esophageal candidiasis at end of treatment. Among patients aged 2 to 12 years, corresponding response rates were 40% and 89% . Treatment -related hepatic adverse events of the aspergillosis and candidiasis groups, respectively; visual adverseevents occurred in 16.1% and 27.3% of patients, respectively. Studies comparing the oral antifungal agents for the treatme nt of onychomycosis have shown varying results. Comparisons of itraconazole (continuous or pulse dose regimens) and terbinafine have demonstrated conflicting results.Some studies showed no difference between treatments (Bahadir et al 2000, Degreef et al 1999, Honeyman et al 1997) while others show significantly better results with terbinafine (Brautigam 1998 , Brautigam et al 1995, De Backer et al 1996 , De Backer et al 1998 , Evans et al 1999, Sigurgeirsson et al 1999, Sigurgeirsson et al 2002). A study comparing griseofulvin microsize and terbinafine demonstrated significantly higher rates of negative cultures at 72 weeks with terbinafine compared to griseofulvin (Hofman n et al 1995). Similarly, 2 studies demonstrated significantly higher complete and mycological cure rates at 1 year for terbinafine compared to griseofulvin microsize (Faergemann et al 1995 , Haneke et al 1995). A Cochrane review including 48 studies (N = 10,200) of oral antifungal agents for the treatment of onychomycosis found high- quality evidence that terbinafine and azole antifungals were superior to placebo for mycological and clinical cure. Moderate- quality evidence suggested that t erbinafine result ed in higher cure rates than azoles with similar safety risks, and that azoles and griseofulvin had similar efficacy but griseofulvin was associated with more adverse events . There was low -quality evidence that terbinafine was superior to griseofulvin with respect to both safety and efficacy ( Kreijkamp- Kaspers et al 2017). A network meta- analysis of 26 randomized controlled trials (N = 8136) found continuous regimens of terbinafine 250 mg or itraconazole 200 mg increased mycologic cure compared with topical treatments, but fluconazole and pulse regimens of itraconazole or terbinafine had similar cure rates to topical treatments ( Gupta et al 2020). A Cochrane review of 15 trials (N = 1438) evaluating oral antifungals for tinea pedis suggested that terbinafine and itraconazole were superior to placebo, and terbinafine was superior to griseofulvin. No significant difference wasdetected or although the trials were generally small ( Bell-Syer et al 2012). In the treatment of vaginal candidiasis, oral fluconazole was found to be similar to topic al antifunga l agents in clinical response. These results were similar when comparing single- dose oral treatment with fluconazole and topical regimens of clotrimazole or miconazole for 1 dose (van Heusden et al 1990, van Heusden et al 1994). In two Phase 3 trials, VANISH 303 and 306, ibrexafungerp 300 mg twice daily for 1 day demonstrated a significant clinical response compared to placebo in non- pregnant females with vulvovaginal candidiasis. At follow -up, c omplete clinical response rates (defined as an abs ence of signs and symptoms without need for additional therapy) in VANISH 303 and VANISH 306 were 59.5% and 72.5%, respectively, with ibrexafungerp compared to 44% and 49.4%, respectively with placebo. The most common adverse events were diarrhea, nausea, abdominal pain, dizziness, and vomiting ( Brexafemme prescribing information 2021 , US National Library of Medicine 2021, US National Library of Medicine 2020 ) CLINICAL GUIDELINES A variety of treatment guidelines address the role of the oral antifungals in the treatment of infectious diseases. Due to changing resistance patterns, guidelines should be frequently referenced.Data as of June 3, 2021 RS-U/H JI-U/KM R Page 37 This information is cons idered confidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

Patients should always seek the advice of a physician or other qualified health provider with any questions regarding a medical condition. Clinicians should refer to the full prescribing information and published resources when making medical decisions. Guidelines are available with recommendations for antimicrobial treatment and prophylaxis for HIV and neutropenic patients (including cancer -related immunosuppression) for selection of an appropriate antifungal to use in specific situations (CDC/NIH/IDSA 2021 , Diseases Taplitz et al 2018a, Taplitz et al 2018 b). Guidelines for community acquired pneumonia (CAP), skin and soft -tissue infections (SSTI), and catheter -related infections also address the treatment of fungal causes of infection, although they are less common than bacterialinfections in most patients (Metlay et al 2019, Mermel et al 2009, Stevens et al 2014). Guidelines also address the role of oral fluconazole (as well as vaginal/local antimicrobials) in the treatment of fungalvaginosis ( American College of Gynecology [ ACOG ] 2020, CDC 2015 , Pappas et al 2016). Finally, multiple guidelines address the role of these agents in the treatment of specific fungal infections as 1 agent may be preferred due to volume of literature support, coverage/susceptibility patterns, and safety. Species with specific guidelines include Aspergillus species (Patterson et al 2016), Blastomyces species (Chapman et al 2008), Cand ida species (CDC/NIH/IDSA 20 20, Pappas et al 2016), Coccidioidomycosis (CDC/NIH/IDSA 20 20, Galgiani et al 2016), Cryptococcus species (CDC/NIH/IDSA 20 20, Perfect et al 2010), Histoplasmosis (CDC/NIH/IDSA 20 20, Wheat et al 2007), and Sporotrichosis (Kauffman et al 2007). SAFETY QT syndrome Griseofulvin: porphyria, hepatocellular and women who are or may become pregnant Ketoconazole: acute or chronic liver disease Miconazole: hypersensitivity to milk protein concentrate Itraconazole: treatment of onychomycosis in patients with evidence of ventricular dysfunction, or in women who intend to become pregnant Terbinafine: chronic or active hepatic disease Posac onazole delayed- release oral suspension: known hereditary fructose intolerance Ibrexafungerp: pregnancy Boxed Warnings: Flucytosine: use with extreme caution in patients with impaired renal function; close monitoring of hematologic, renal, and hepatic status of all patients is essential. Ketoconazole should only be used to treat serious systemic fungal infections when other effective antifungal therapyis not available or tolerated, and the potential benefits are considered to outweigh the potential risks; serious hepatotoxicity including death or need for liver transplantation have occurred; coadministration of the life- threatening ventricular dysrhythmias. Itraconazole should not be administered for the treatment of onychomycosis in patients with evidence of ventriculardysfunction such as congestive heart failure (CHF) or a f esoterodine, and solifenacin is contraindicated. Coadministration patients who are poor orintermediate metabolizers of CYP2D6 and in those taking strong or moderate CYP2D6 inhibitors. Coadministration ofthe former agents with itraconazole can cause elevated plasma concentrations of these drugs and may increase or prolong both the pharmacologic effects and/or adverse reactions to these drugs. Increased plasma concentrations of some of these drugs can lead to QT prolong ation and ventricular tachyarrhythmias including occurrences of torsades de pointes, a potentially fatal arrhythmia. Warnings/Precautions: A warning for hepatoxicity is in the labeling for all of the agents in this class with the exception of Brexafemme (ibrexafungerp), flucytosine, nystatin, and Oravig (miconazole). Flucytosine: monitor hematologic status and bone marrow suppression. Dose adjustments may be necessary inpatients with renal impairment.Data as of June 3, 2021 RS-U/H JI-U/KM R Page 38 This information is cons idered confidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

Clinicians should refer to the full prescribing information and published resources when making medical decisions. Fluconazole, griseofulvin, isavuconazonium sulfate, terbinafine, and voriconazole: rare, sometimes fatal exfoliative skin disorders have occurred. Monitor for skin rashes and discontinue treatment if rash occurs. Fluconazole : administer with caution to patients with potentially proarrhythmic conditions or those with renal dysfunction. Women of childbearing potential who receive doses of 400 to 800 mg daily should use effective contraception during treatment and for 1 week after the last dose due to the potential for spontaneous abortion and congenital abnormalities with fluconazole exposure during the first trimester. Additionally, caution is advised when driving or operating heavy machinery as fluconazole may cause occasional dizziness or seizures. Reversible adrenal insufficiency has been reported with fluconazole. Griseofulvin: a possibility of cross -sensitivity with penicillin exists. Additionally, lupus -like syndromes or exacerbations of existing lupus have been reported. Patients should avoid exposure to intense or prolonged natural or artificialsunlight. Ibrexafungerp: may cause fetal harm; advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment. Isavuconaz onium sulfate: serious hypersensitivity and skin reactions such as Stevens -Johnson syndrome have been reported. Itraconazole: if neuropathy occurs and can be attributed to itraconazole, treatment should be discontinued. If a cystic fibrosis patient does not respond to treatment with itraconazole capsules or oral solution, alternative therapy should be considered. Some immunocompromised patients may have decreased bioavailability and require higher doses.Finally, transient and permanent hearing loss have been reported. Ketoconazole: decrease in adrenal corticosteroid secretion can occur at doses of 400 mg and higher. Miconazole: monitor for hypersensitivity reactions and discontinue at the first sign of such reaction. Posaconazole: administer with caution to patients with potentially proarrhythmic conditions . Monitor ing for electrolyte disturbances (including potassium, magnesium, and calcium) is also recommended with posaconazole. The delayed- release oral suspension contains sorbitol and can precipitate a metabolic crisis that may include hypoglycemia, hypophosphatemia, lactic acidosis, and hepatic failure in patients with hereditary fructose intolerance. P atients taking any formulation of posaconazole should be monitored for severe diarrhea or vomiting as an indicator for breakthrough fungal infection. Terbinafine: taste and smell disturbances have been reported. Severe neutropenia has been reported. Discontinue treatment if neutrophil count is 1000 cells/mm3. Cases of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura and hemolytic uremic syndrome, have been reported. Discontinue treatment if clinical symptoms and laboratory measurements are consistent with TMA. Treatment should be discontinued if drug reactions such as Stevens -Johnson syndrome or similar conditions occur. Development of depressive symptoms should be monitored. Voriconazole: visual disturbances have been reported; galactose intolerance and skeletal disturbances may occur. Voriconazole may increase risk for QT prolongation, hepatic toxicity, and dermatologic reactions (including photosensitivity -related skin reactions). Discontinue voriconazole if severe exfoliative cutaneous reactions occur. The incidence of photosensitivity reactions a nd elevations of liver enzymes may be higher among pediatric patients. Signs and symptoms of adrenal dysfunction should be monitored in patients taking voriconazole and corticosteroids during and after voriconazole treatment. Fetal toxicity may occur with some agents, including fluconazole (use in pregnancy should be avoided unless the benefits outweigh fetal risk), griseofulvin, ibrexafungerp, isavuconazonium sulfate, itraconazole, posaconazole, and voriconazole. In May 2016, the FDA issued a medication safety alert warning health care professionals to avoid prescribingketoconazole oral tablets to treat skin and nail fungal infections. According to the FDA, the risk of serious liverdamage and drug interactions with this agent outweigh the benefits when treating these conditions (FDA Drug Safety Communication 2016) . Adverse Effects: A variety of adverse effects from mild to severe may occur with agents in this class. Consult individual package inserts for details. Drug Interactions: Many drug interactions occur with all of the agents in the class. Drugs metabolized through the cytochrome P450 system increase QT prolongation and may cause torsades de pointes.Data as of June 3, 2021 RS-U/H JI-U/KM R Page 39 This information is considered confidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

CONCLUSION The oral class of antifungals includes a variety of different agents used to treat many different fungal infections, including aspergillosis, blastomycosis, histoplasmosis, candidiasis, mucormycosis, and others. Resistant organisms have been reported; thus, it is important to verify susceptibility when resistant organisms are suspected. Current resistance patterns should be monitored for the antifungal agents in order to select the most appropriate therapy. Appropriate guidelines should be referenced often. Some patients may require intravenous therapy that is not specifically discussed in this review. Isavuconazonium sulfate, fluconazole, voriconazole, and posaconazole are available as oral and intravenous formulations. Some of these antifungal medications are also available in topical formulations. Clotrimazole, nystatin, and Oravig (miconazole) are not absorbed systemically . They are not used for systemic infections, but only for the treatment of oropharyngeal candidiasis. Onyc homycosis (itraconazole) is not indicated for onychomycosis. Griseofulvin is no longer used for this indication. Brexafemme (i brexafungerp) was approved for treatment of vulvovaginal candidiasis based on significant efficacy compared to placebo.

Therapeutic Class Overview Hemophilia Agents INTRODUCTION Hemophilia is an X -linked congenital bleeding disorder that affects ap proximately 1 in 10,000 people (World Federation of Hemophilia [WFH] 2019) . Hemophilia A is characterized by a deficiency of clotting factor VIII (FVIII), while Hemophilia B is characterized by a deficiency of factor IX (FIX), and is less common then hemophilia A ( National Hemophilia Foundation [NHF] Web site, WFH 2012). The incidence of hemophilia A is approximately 1 in 5000 male births, and it affects approximately 80 to 85% of the total hemophilia population ( NHF Web site, WFH 2012). In 2018 , the number of patients in the United States (U.S.) with hemophilia A was reported to be 13,616, while those with hemophilia B was 41 41 (WFH 2019). Von Willebrand Disease (VWD) is a common genetic bleeding disorder due to missing or defective von Willebrand factor (VWF), a clotting protein, which equally affects men and women ( NHF Web site). VWD is the most common bleeding disorder , affect ing up to 1% of the U .S. population ( NHF Web site ). In 2018, the number of patients in the U.S. with VWD was reported to be 11,805 (WFH 2019). There are 3 main types of VWD classified as type 1 (VWF levels 20 to 50% of normal; 60 to 80% of cases; mild symptoms), type 2 (qualitative deficiencies of VWF; 15 to 30% of patients; mild to moderate symptoms), and type 3(very low VWF level; 5 to 10% of cases; severe symptoms) ( NHF Web site). Type 2 VWD is categorized into 4 subtypes: type 2A, type 2B, type 2M and type 2N, depending on the presence and behavior of multimers, the molecular chains of VWF. Other rare factor deficiencies, including those of clotting factor I (FI, or fibrinogen), factor VII (FVII), factor X (FX), factor XI (FXI), and factor XIII (FXIII) also result in bleeding disorders (NHF Web site ). Thes e very rare factor deficiencies, fr om F XIII deficiency (the rarest ) occurring in an estimated 1 out of 5 million people, to F XI deficiency, occurring in about 1 out of 100,000, were all discovered and identified in the 20th century (NHF We b site ). Patients with hemophilia may experience acute serious (eg, joints [hemarthrosis], muscle and soft tissue; life -threatening (eg , central nervous system, gastrointestinal, neck and throat, severe trauma) bleeds. Hemarthrosis is the most common type of bleeding, with an overall incidence of up to 80% (Hoots and Shapiro 2019a, NHF Web site , WFH 2012). Patients with hemophilia may also develop chronic complications including musculoskeletal complications , inhibitors (neutralizing antibodies) against FVIII or FIX, and transfusion- related infections (eg, human immunodeficiency virus [HIV], hepatitis B virus [HBV] , and hepatitis C virus [HCV]) (Hoots and 19a, NHF W eb site, WFH 2012). Hemophilia is a complex disor der with regard to its diagnosis and management. Optimal management, especially of severe disease, requires both the treatment and prevention of acute bleeding with the use of clotting factor replacementtherapy (NHF Web site , WFH 2012). Anti-hemophilic agents evaluated in this review include FIX, The specific Food and Drug Administration ( FDA)-approved indications vary by individual product . In general, these agents are indicated for the control and prevention of bleeding episodes (ie, \"on- demand\" treatment), routine prophylaxis to prevent or reduce the frequency of bleeding episodes, and/or perioperative management. All factor replacement concentrates are effective in temporarily replacing the missing clotting factor to promote hemostasis. The ultimate choice is determined by the specific characteristics of each product, the individual patient, and local standards of practice ( NHF 2020, NHF Web site, WFH 2012). Due to the potential risk for pathogen transmission with human plasma- derived factor concentrates, the NHF recommends use of recombinant factor replacement agents as the treatment of choice in patients with bleeding disorders (NHF 2014, NHF 2020 , NHF Web site ). Of note, no seroconversions to HIV, HBV, or HCV have been reported with any of the plasma- derived factor products currently marketed in the U.S. (NHF Web site ). A possible exception to this recommendation is in a newly diagnosed patient, who should also consider w ith their health care provider to initiate treatment with a plasma -derived F VIII/VWF product ( NHF 2020). This exception isData as of Marc h 27, 2020 ALS/AKS Page 45 This information is considered confidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

The need for frequent injection represents a significant burden for patients and caregivers, in particular in small children and patients with poor venous access ( Mannucci 2015, Martinowitz et al 2015). For hemophilia A, t here are 2 human plasma- derived FVIII concentrates ( Hemofil M U.S. Obizur is the only r FVIII agent approved for the treatment of acquired hemophilia A. Hemlibra is a bispec ific monoclonal antibody that bridges FIXa and FX to promote clotting, and provides an additional treatment option for hemo philia A. Hemlibra is the only prophylactic option for hemophilia A that can be self - administered by a subcutaneous (SC) injection. Three human- plasma derived FVIII concentrates rich in VWF (Alphanate, Humate -P, and Wilate) are also approved for on- demand treatment and control of bleeding episodes in hemophilia A. For hemophilia B, there are 2 human plasma- derived (AlphaNine SD Mononine) Idelvion, Ixinity, Rebinyn, and Rixubis) FIX products available in the U.S. Additionally, there is a human plasma- derived prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC ), Profilnine , which contains F II, FVII, FIX, and F X in variable amounts; Profilnine is rarely used due to the risk of thromboembolism ( WFH 2012 ). Recommended treatment options for patients with inhibitors to FVIII or FIX include the bypassing agents, factor eight inhibitor bypassing activity ( hemophilia A) ( NHF 2020). These agents are not interchangeable and the treatment choice depends on multiple factors, including inhibitor type (eg, low - or high- responding), current titer of inhibitor, bleed location, and previous response to these products . Vonvendi is the only recombinant VWF agent available for the treatment of bleeding episodes in patients with VWD. Three human- plasma derived FVIII concentrates rich in VWF ( Alphana te, Humate -P, and Wilate) are approved for the treatment of VWD ; Alphanate has the lowest purity and most variable VWF specific activity of these agents. NovoSeven RT (rFVIIa) is the only factor replacement agent FDA- approved for treatment of bleeding episodes in patients with Glanzmann's thrombasthenia ( Grainger et al FX, , and FXIII A -subunit deficiencies, concentrates , including afibrinogenemia and hypofibrinogenemia. Desmopressin has been used for decades to prevent or treat bleeding episodes in patients with type 1 VWD and mild hemophilia A. Although the complete mechanisms of action of desmopressin are still not fully understood, it increaseslevels of plasma Hormones - desmopressin. Table 1.

As these products are utilized as replacement therapy in patients with deficient levels of clotting factors required for hemostasis, clinical trial data demonstrated that adequate hemostatic responses were consistently achieved with administration of these products. Due to ethical concerns, there are a limited number of placebo- controlled trials evaluating the hemophilia agents in the management of hemophilia or VWD. Also, head- to-head trials are rare, and available trials evaluate a relatively small number of patients. Within clinical trials, the clinical efficacy of the hemophilia agents was evaluated based on a subjective rating of hemostatic response achieved with the individual agents when administered either as on- demand treatment of acute bleeds or as prophylactic therapy, including in surgical settings. Results from a systematic review of 6 randomized controlled trials supported the use of prophylactic therapy with clotting factor concentrates for preserving joint function in children with hemophilia A or B compared to on- demand treatment. Evidence is lacking to determine if prophylaxis decreases bleeding and related complications in patients with existing damage, and the most effective prophylactic regimen in adults with hemophilia requires further investigation ( Iorio et al 2011). A systematic review of available evidence for desmopressin use in bleeding disorders examined the efficacy of desmopressin treatment across a variety of scenarios (Leissinger et al 2014). In a prospective trial of 169 patients with mild or moderate hemophilia A or VWD utilizing SC desmopressin in theoutpatient setting, 'good ' or 'excellent ' hemostatic responses were achieved in 91% of all bleeding episodes. For surgical hemostasis, several studies demonstrated desmopressin's efficacy in controlling postoperative bleedingin patients with VWD. Data reported from more than 150 patients (mostly children) undergoing adenotonsillar procedures showed that desmopressin was generally safe and effective, although ~5 to 25% of patients experienced breakthrough bleeding 5 to 10 days postop eratively. Clinical efficacy data for newer agents FDA-approved and launched in 2017 through 2019 Fibry and Rebinyn, for Wilate in 2019, are as follows: Esperoct The efficacy of Esperoct was evaluated for routine prophylaxis, on- demand treatment and control of bleeding episodes, and perioperative management in 254 previously -treated male patients with severe hemophilia A in 3 Phase 3, prospective, multinational, open- label trials in the pathfinder clinical program ( Curry et al 2019, FDA clinical review [Esperoct] 2019, Giangrande et al 2017). Pathfinder 2 was a non- randomized trial that evaluated Esperoct for prophylaxis and on- demand treatment and control of bleeding episodes in 186 males 12 years of age. The study included a routine prophylactic treatment arm with Esperoct 50 international units ( IU)/kg IV infusion every 4 days (n = 175) and an on-d emand treatment arm (n = 12). Of note, 1 patient changed from on- demand treatment to prophylaxis and is counted in both groups. Bleeding episodes were treated with Esperoct 20 to 75 IU/kg ( Curry et al 2019, FDA clinical review [Esperoct] 2019, Giangrande et al 2017, Hampton et al 2017, Meunier et al 2017). Seventy (40%) patients in the prophylaxis group and 0 (0%) patients in the on- demand treatment group did not have a treatment -requiring bleeding episode during the trial.Data as of March 27, 2020 ALS/AKS Page 51 This information is considered confidential and proprietary to OptumRx .

In the prophylaxis group, the median and mean annualized bleeding rate (ABR) for treated bleeds were 1.2 (interquartile range [IQR], 0.0 to 4.3) and 3.0 (standard deviation [SD], 4.7), respectively. A total of 58% of the bleeds were spontaneous and 42% were traumatic, and the majority of bleeds (75%) occurred in joints. In the on- demand treatment group, the median and mean ABR for treated bleeds were 30.9 (IQR, 18.6 to 38.5) and 31.9 (SD, 19.1), respectively. A total of 78% of the bleeds were spontaneous and 21% were traumatic, and the majority of bleeds (58%) occurred in joints. For on- demand treatment, 968 bleeding episodes were treated with Esperoct in 117 (67%) patients, of which 436 bleeding episodes occurred in 105 patients in the prophylaxis arm and 532 bleeding episodes occurred in 12 patients in the on- demand treatment arm. The success rates for the treatment of bleeding episodes in the on- demand and prophylaxis groups were similar at 88.4% (95% confidence interval [CI], 80.0 to 93.5) and 83.7% (95% CI, 79.0 to 87.5), respectively. One patient developed FVIII inhibitory antibodies after 93 Esperoct exposure days (EDs). Pathfinder 5 was a single- arm trial that evaluated Esperoct for prophylaxis and on- demand treatment and control of bleeding episodes in 68 males < 12 years of age. All patients were treated with Esperoct 50 to 75 IU/kg twice weekly; bleeding episodes were treated with Esperoct 20 to 75 IU/kg ( FDA clinical review [Esperoct] 2019, Meunier et al 2017). For prophylaxis, the median and mean ABR for treated bleeds were 2.0 (IQR, 0.0 to 2.8) and 3.1 (SD, 7.1), respectively. For treatment of bleeding episodes, 70 bleeds (all rated as mild/moderate) were treated with Esperoct in 39 (57%) patients. The overall success rate for treatment of bleeding episodes was 79%. Most bleeds (80%) were treated with 2 Esperoct injections, with a mean dose of 123.0 IU/kg/bleed (SD, 104.9; range, 44.9 to 435.5) in patients 0 to 5 years of age and 99.0 IU/kg/bleed (SD, 54.4; range, 49.9 to 296.4) in patients 6 to 11 years of age. No patients developed FVIII inhibitors. Pathfinder 3 was an uncontrolled single- am trial that evaluated Esperoct for perioperative treatment in 34 males 12 years of age. Esperoct was administered up to 2 hours prior to surgery and postoperatively; dose levels were individually targeted to attain a minimum FVIII activity as recommended by WFH guidelines. A total of 33 patients underwent 45 major surgeries and completed the trial ( FDA clinical review [Esperoct] 2019, Hampton et al 2017). Intraoperative hemostatic effect was rated as 'excellent' or 'good' 43/45 (95.6%) of the surgeries, and as 'moderate' in 2 surgeries (4.4%). The median preoperative dose was 52 IU/kg, and the median total dose was 702 IU/kg. The number of doses and duration of treatment varied by procedure. Fibryga A Phase 2, multicenter, open- label, crossover trial compared the pharmacokinetics and efficacy as measured by clot strength (ie, maximum clot firmness [MCF], a surrogate marker of hemostatic efficacy) of Fibryga and RiaSTAP in 22 patients with congenital afibrinogenemia ( Ross et al 2018). Bioequivalence was demonstrated for some, but not all, pharmacokinetic endpoints. Notably, bioequivalence was notdemonstrated for the primary endpoint of area under the concentration- time curve normalized to dose administered. A significant increase in mean plasma MCF from baseline (all 0.00 mm) to 1 hour after administration was observed with both Fibryga (9.68 mm) and RiaSTAP (10.00 mm) (p < 0.0001 for both products vs placebo). The difference between active treatments was -0.32 mm (95% CI, - 1.70 to 1.07), which was not statistically significant. A Phase 3, multicenter, open- label, single -arm trial is evaluating the use of Fibryga for on- demand treatment of acute bleeding episodes and prevention of intraoperative and postoperative bleeding in patients with congenital fibrinogen deficiency; interim results are available after the treatment of 13 patients ( Lissitchkov et al 2017). Hemostatic efficacy was assessed based on an objective 4- point rating criteria a nd MCF. Treatment success for bleeding episodes (rating of ' excellent ' or 'good' ) was 95.7% (90% CI, 0.81 to 1.00) the investigators, and 100% (90% CI, 0.88 to 1.00) as assessed by an independent data monitoringand endpoint adjudication committee (IDMEAC). A significant increase in MCF was demonstrated in patients with bleeding episodes , from 0.0 mm at baseline to 6.5 mm (95% CI, 5.65 to 7.40; p < 0.0001) at 1 hour after the first fibrinogen concentrate infusion. The intraoperative and postoperative efficacy of fibrinogen concentrate (based on 4 surgeries) was demonstrated with success rates of 100% (90% CI, 0.5 to 1.0) by both the surgeon or hematologist and the IDMEAC.

The efficacy of Hemlibra for routine prophylaxis in males with hemophilia A with FVIII inhibitors was evaluated in 2 Phase 3, multicenter, open- label clinical trials , HAVEN 1 in 109 adult s and adolescents, and HAVEN 2 in 23 pediatric patient s (FDA multi- discipline review [Hemlibra] 2017, Oldenburg et al 2017) In the 24- week HAVEN 1 trial, the ABR was 2.9 (95% CI, 1.7 to 5.0) in patients treated with Hemlibra 1.5 mg/kg once weekly vs 23.3 (9 5% CI, 12.3 to 43.9) in patients with no prophylaxis, with a statistically significant reduction of 87% in favor of Hemlibra prophylaxis (p < 0.001). A total of 62.9% of patients treated with Hemlibra experienced 0 bleeds (95% CI, 44.9 to 78.5) vs 5.6% (95% CI, 0.1 to 27.3) with no prophylaxis, and the median ABR was 0 and 18.8, respectively ( Oldenburg et al 2017). In an intra- patient analysis of 24 eligible patients in a non- interventional study (NIS) treated with Hemlibra prophylaxis, Hemlibra prophylaxis resulted in a statistically significant 79% reduction (95% CI, 51.4 to vs previous bypassing agent (BPA) prophylaxis (3.3 vs 15.7 events, respectively) ( Oldenburg et al 2017). HAVEN 2 is an unpublished, ongoing, single- arm trial in pediatric males. At the time of the interim analysis, the ABR for treated bleeds was 0.3 events (95% CI, 0.1 to 0.5) and the median ABR was 0; 87% (95% CI, 75 to 94) of patients experienced 0 bleeds ( FDA multi -discipline review [Hemlibra] 2017) . In an intra- patient analysis (n = 18), Hemlibra prophylaxis resulted in a 98% reduction in bleed rate compared with previous BPA treatment prior to enrollment (0. 4 vs 19.8 events, respectively). On Hemlibra prophylaxis, 14 patients (77.8% ) had 0 treated bl eeds. The efficacy of Hemlibra for routine prophylaxis in adult and adolescent males with hemophilia A without FVIII inhibitors was evaluated in 2 Phase 3, multicenter , open- label trials, HAVEN 3 ( N = 152) and HAVEN 4 (N = 41) ( Clinicaltrials.gov Web site , Mahlangu et al 2018) In the 24- week HAVEN 3 trial, the ABR in patients treated with Hemlibra 1.5 mg/kg once weekly was 1.5 (95% CI, 0.9 to 2.5) vs 38.2 (95% CI, 22.9 to 63.8) in patients with no prophylaxis, with a statistically significant reduction of 96% infavor of prophylaxis (95% CI, 92.5 to < 0.0001). For patients treated with 3 mg/kg once every 2 weeks , the ABR was 1.3 (95% CI, 0.8 to 2.3) with a statistically significant reduction of 97% (95% CI, 93.4 to 98.3, p < total of 56% (95% CI, 38.1 to 72.1) of patients treated with 1.5 mg/kg once weekly and 60% (95% CI, 42.1 to 76.1) of patients in treated with Hemlibra 3 mg/kg once weekly experienced 0treated bleeds, vs 0% (95% CI, 0 to 18) with no prophylaxis (Mahlangu et al 2018). In an intra -patient analysis of 48 patients, Hemlibra 1.5 mg/kg once weekly resulted in a statistically significant 68% reduction (95% CI, 48.6 to 80.5; p < 0.0001) in ABR compared with previous FVIII prophylaxis in the NIS prior to enrollment (1.5 vs 4.8 events, respectively). In HAVEN 4, prophylaxis with Hemlibra 6 mg/kg every 4 weeks (after 4 weeks of 3 mg/kg once weekly) at 25.6 weeks of treatment resulted in a median ABR of 2.4 (95% CI, 1.4 to 4.3). A total of 56% (95% CI, 39.7 to 71.5) of patients experienced 0 treated bleeds (Clinicaltrials.gov Web site ). An Institute for Clinical and Economic Review (ICER) and New England Comparative Effectiveness Public Advisory Council final evidence report for Hemlibra in hemophil ia A included a comparative clinical effectiveness review of 5 clinical trials to evaluate the comparative safety and efficacy of prophylaxis with Hemlibra, aPCC, and rFVIIa in patients with hemophilia A with inhibitors ( ICER 2018). The review determined that f or children < 12 years of age, there was high certainty that Hemlibra provided at least a small net health benefit (\"B+\" rating) vs no prophylaxis; in adults and children, there was high certainty that Hemlibra provided at least a small health benefit (\"B+\" rating) vs BPA prophylaxis. Jivi The efficacy of Jivi for on- demand treatment, perioperative management of bleeding and routine prophylaxis was evaluated in the 36- week, Phase 2/3, partially randomized, multicenter , open- label PROTECT VIII trial in 134 previously treated patients (PTPs) 12 years of age with severe hemophilia A ( FDA clinical review [Jivi] 2018 , Reding et al 2017). A total of 13 patients not eligible for randomization (ie, patients who experienced > 1 bleed during the run- in period) were treated with Jivi 30 to 40 IU/kg twice weekly. In these patients, the median ABR (quartile 1 to quartile 3) in the run-in period was 17.4 (14.3 to 26.0), which improved with treatment to 4.1 (2.0 to 10.6); 15% of these patients experienced 0 bleeds. The median ABR (quartile 1 to quartile 3) in 11 patients randomized to Jivi 30 to 40 IU/kg twice a week was 1.9 (0 to 5.2); 46% of patients experienced 0 bleeds. The median ABR for 43 patients randomized to Jivi 45 to 60 IU/kg every 5 days was 1.9 (0 to 4.2); 44% of patients experienced 0 bleeds. The median ABR for all 43 patients randomized to Jivi 60 IU/kg every 7 days was 3.9 (0.0 to 6.5) for the duration of time that they remained in the treatment arm (ie, the intent -to-treat population).Data as of March 27, 2020 ALS/AKS Page 53 This information is considered confidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

The median ABR for 32/43 patients who remained in the every -7-day treatment arm was 0.96 (0.0 to 6.5); 37.2% of patients experienced 0 bleeds. A total of 388 bleeding episodes were treated with Jivi in the on- demand group (n = 20), while 317 bleeding episodes were treated in the prophylaxis groups. Approximately 90% of the bleeds were successfully treated with 1 or 2 infusions in both the on- demand and prophylaxis groups . For perioperative management, 17 patients successful ly completed 20 major surgeries using Jivi for hemostasis . Treatment with Jivi provided or 'excellent' hemostatic control during all 20 major surgeries based on a 4- point scale ('excellent', 'good', 'moderate' or 'poor' ). Rebinyn The efficacy of Rebinyn was evaluated in 4 Phase 3, uncontrolled, multicenter trials (paradigm 2 [pivotal trial], paradigm 3 [perioperative use], paradigm 4 [extension trial of paradigm 2 and 3], and paradigm 5 [pediatrics]) . Paradigm 2 was a 52- week , randomized controlled trial of 74 males 12 years of age with hemophilia B ( Collins et al 2014). The study included 2 routine prophylactic treatment arms, with single- blind randomization to either Rebinyn 10 IU/kg once weekly or 40 IU/kg once weekly , and a 28- week open- label on -demand treatment arm. The median ABRs in the Rebinyn 10 IU/kg and 40 IU/kg groups 2.93 to 6.02) and 1.04 (IQR, 0.00 to 4.00), respectively. The median ABR in the on- demand treatment group was 15.58 (IQR, 9.56 to 26.47). Five (17%) patients in the 10 IU/kg group, 13 (45%) patients in the Rebinyn 40 IU/kg group, and 1 (7%) patient in the on- demand group did not have a treatment -requiring bleeding episode during the trial. For on- demand treatment, 345 bleeding episodes were treated with Rebinyn in 55 (74%) patients, of which 202 bleeding episodes occurred in the prophylaxis arms and 143 bleeding episodes occurred in the on- demand treatment arm. Treatment efficacy was rated by investigators as ' excellent ' or 'good ' in 92.2% (95% CI, 86.9 to 95.4) of bleeds, and 97.4% of bleeds were successfully treated with 1 or 2 injections. Paradigm 3 was an open- label trial in 13 males who underwent major surgery ( Escobar et al 2017). Intraoperative hemostatic effect was considered successful in 100% of the surgeries, and rated as 'excellent' or 'good' in 10 and 3 ofthe 13 surgeries evaluated, respectively. Paradigm 4 was an open- label extension trial allowing for 50 additional E Ds in 71 adult and adolescent patients from the paradigm 2 or 3 trials, who continued routine or on- demand treatment with Rebinyn with the possibility of switch ing regimens during the trial ( Young et al 2016). oA total of 134 bleeds were reported in 44 (65.7%) of 67 patients in the prophylaxis arms. The median ABR s for patients within the 10 and 40 IU/kg treatment arms w ere 1.36 (IQR, 0.00 to 2.23) and 1.00 (IQR, 0.00 to 2.03), respectively. oFor on- demand treatment, 207 bleeds were reported in 49 (75%) patients, of which 134 bleeding episodes occurred in the prophylaxis arms and 73 bleeding episodes occurred in the on- demand treatment arm. The overall success rate (ie, efficacy rated as 'excellent' or 'good') for treatment of all bleeding episodes was 94.6%, and 97.1% of bleeds were successfully treated with 1 or 2 injections. Paradigm 5 was a 52- week, open- label , single -arm trial in 25 males 1 to 12 years of age with hemophilia B ( Carcao et al 2016). The study included 1 routine prophylactic treatment arm wi th once- weekly Rebinyn 40 IU/kg; b leeding episodes were treated with Rebinyn 40 IU/kg for mild/moderate bleeds and 80 IU/kg IU/kg once- weekly prophylaxis , the median ABR was 1.0 in the total trial population. Ten (40% ) patients reported no bleeds, and no spontaneous joint bleeds were reported in target joints. oFor on- demand treatment, 42 bleeding episodes were treated with Rebinyn in 15 (60%) patients. The overall success rate for treatment of all bleeding episodes was 92.9%, and 97.6% of the bleeding episodes were resolved with 1 or 2 injections. Wilate The efficacy of Wilate for routine prophylaxis and on- demand treatment of bleeding episodes was evaluated in a 6- month, Phase 3, open- label, single -arm, multicenter clinical trial in 55 (adults , n = 50; pediatrics 12 to 15 years of age, n = 5) previously treated patients with severe hemophilia A . Patients were treated every 2 to 3 days with 20 to 40 IU/kg of Wilate, with a mean dose 32 IU/kg ( Clinicaltrials.gov Web site, FDA clinical review [Wilate] 2019). For routine prophylaxis, a total of 30 (54.6%) patients experienced 0 bleeding episodes, and there were 12 (21.8%) patients with 1 bleeding episode, 4 (7.3%) with 2 bleeding episodes, 4 (7.3%) with 3 bleeding episodes, and 5 (9%) with 5 bleeding episodes.Data as of March 27, 2020 ALS/AKS Page 54 This information is considered confidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

In adults, the ABR for spontaneous bleeds was 1.67 \u00b1 3.11 (median, 0; range, 0 to 11.76), and the ABR for all types of bleeds was 2.39 \u00b1 3.77 (median, 0; range 0 to 15.69). In pediatric patients, the ABR for spontaneous bleeds was 0 (median 0; range 0 to 0), and the ABR for all types of bleeds was 0.4 \u00b1 0.89 (median, 0; range 0 to 2). Breakthrough bleeds were treated with Wilate doses adjusted to the severity of the bleed. In the per -protocol population (n = 52), 57 bleeding episodes were treated with Wilate , of which 15 (26.3%) were minor , 32 (56.1%) were moderate, 10 (17.5%) were major, and none were life -threatening. A total of 41 (71.9%) bleeds were spontaneous and 16 (28.1%) were traumati c. Thirty -six (63.2%) bleeding episodes were managed with 1 injection of Wilate, 12 (21.1%) were managed with 2 injections , 7 (12.3%) were managed with 3 injections , and 2 (3.6%) required > 3 injections. The mean dose of Wilate per injection was 34 IU/kg. Treatment efficacy was judged as ' excellent ' for 16 (28.1%), ' good' for 32 (56.1%) , and 'moderate' for 9 (15.8%) bleeding episodes. Therefore, 84.2% of all bleeding episodes were treated successfully. Only 1 bleeding episode was treated in 1 patient < 16 years of age; it was treated with a single injection of Wilate 62.81 IU/kg with ' excellent ' efficacy. Further efficacy data in the treatment of bleeding episodes are available from a pooled analysis of 37 patients with hemophilia A from 3 additional clinical studies. Patients had 150 EDs at the time of enrollment and were treated for 50 EDs and 6 months in the studies. A total of 986 bleeding episodes were experienced by patients, of which 936 (94.9%) were treated successfully. CLINICAL GUIDELINES NHF Medical and Scientific Advisory Council (MASAC) recommendations concerning products licensed for the treatment of hemophilia and other bleeding disorders (MASAC # 259) (NHF 2020) Inherited bleeding disorders (FVII, FVIII, FIX, FX, FXIII, FXIII A -subunit deficiencies) Recombinant factor replacement products are the treatment of choice for patients with hemophilia A, hemophilia B, FVII deficiency, and F XIII A-subunit deficiency. A possible exception to this recommendation is for a newly diagnosed patient with Hemophilia A, who should also consider with their healthcare provider to initiate treatment with a plasma- derived FVIII/VWF product . This exception is based on the SIPPET trial (see MASAC #243 below) , which demonstrated a significant difference in inhibitor developm ent between treatment with rFVIII vs plasma -derived FVIII/VWF ((NHF 2016b). The risk of human viral contamination associated with recombinant FVIII is exceedingly low. Third generation recombinant products do not contain any human or animal plasma- derived proteins in the culture medium or final formulation. Emicizumab -kxwh ( Hemlibra) was shown in P hase 3 clinical trials to be safe and effective in adults, adolescents, children, and infants with hemophilia A with and without inhibitors. The SC administration of emicizumab- kxwh is often viewed as being easier and/or less time consuming compared to IV administration of FVIII. Dosing intervals for prophylaxis with emicizumab- kxwh are longer compared with FVIII replacement, with weekly, -week , and concentrates are available to treat FX and FXIII deficiencies, respectfully. Desmopressin may be used in some patients with mild hemophilia A. VWD Desmopressin may be used in patients with VWD type 1 and some variations of VWD type 2. Recombinant VWF concentrate (Vonvendi) is available to treat patients with type 2B and type 3 VWD; it can also beused in patients with types 1, 2A, 2M, and 2N VWD who are not responsive to DDAVP and in children < 2 years ofage regardless of VWD type. Plasma- derived FVIII/VWF complexes (Alphanate, Humate- P, and Wilate) may be used in patients that do not respond to desmopressin (ie, VWD type 2B, type 3), those who have become transiently unresponsive todesmopressin, and in surgical situations. Hemophilia A or B and inhibitors to FVIII or FIX Inhibitor development is the most severe complication of treatment for patients with inherited hemophilia A or B. For high- titer inhibitors, imm une tolerance induction (ITI) is the best option for inhibitor eradication.Data as of March 27, 2020 ALS/AKS Page 55 This information is considered confidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

Clinicians should refer to the full prescribing information and published resources when making medical decisions. The BPAs, NovoSeven RT and FEIBA, and Hemlibra are licensed for treatment of bleeding episodes in patients with inhibitors. These products are not interchangeable. Choice of product depends on multiple factors, including type of inhibitor (low- or high -responding), current titer of inhibitor, location of the bleed, and previous response to these products. Thrombotic risks exist with the use of all of these agents. Acquired hemophilia A Patients who were not born with hemophilia may develop antibodies or inhibitors that cause destruction of factors; such inhibitors may be seen in patients with autoimmune disorders. Patients may be treated with NovoSeven RT or Obizur. Obizur is a recombinant porcine FVIII; often the human FVIII inhibitor does not cross -react with the porcine species of FVIII, thus allowing for measurable factor levels and cessation of bleeding. Fibrinogen Deficiency Plasma-derived fibrinogen concentrate can be used to treat patients with congenital hypofibrinogenemia and afibrinogenemia, but not dysfibrinogenemia. Cryoprecipitate is the only currently available product for dysfibrinogenemia. Because it has not undergone any viral attenuation steps, cryoprecipitate should not be used to treat patients withafibrinogenemia except in life- and limb- threatening emergencies when fibrinogen concentrate is not immediately available. Ancillary Medications Aminocaproic acid and tranexamic acid are antifibrinolytics that may be used as ancillary medications in themanagement of hemophilia and other bleeding disorders. Aminocaproic acid can be orally administered to treat mouth bleeds. A dose of appropriate factor concentrate must be given first to form the clot, and aminocaproic acid can then be administered to preserve the c lot until healing has taken place. Aminocaproic acid can also be given via intravenous ( IV) infusion following oral surgery (eg, wisdom tooth extraction) or ear/nose/throat surgery (eg, tonsillectomy). Tranexamic acid is approved for treatment of menorrhagia and is orally administered for 5 days during menstruation. for individuals with severe hemophilia A or B ( ie, factor levels < 1%). Prophylactic therapy should be instituted early (prior to the onset of frequent bleeding), with the aim of keeping the trough factor l evel > 1% between doses. Optimal dosing and frequency should be determined for each individual. Recombinant factor products are the most appropriate for prophylaxis due to markedly reduced risk of blood- borne infections. Joint bleeds with subsequent joint destruction are a lifelong problem for these individuals; there are no clear guidelines as to when to stop prophylaxis. Reasons to discontinue prophylaxis may include development of an inhibitor or patient preference with physician concurrence. MASAC r ecom mendation regarding the use of recombinant clotting factor products with respect to pathogen transmission (MASAC #226) ( NHF 2014) Current plasma- derived concentrates employed in the treatment of hemophilia A and B, VWD, and other inherited bleeding disorders are very safe with respect to transmission of HIV, HBV, HCV, and hepatitis A virus. However, theseproducts may be capable of transmitting non- enveloped viruses such as parvovirus B19. In addition, these products are potentially capable of transmitting prions, the agents that cause Creutzfeldt -Jakob disease (CJD) and variant CJD (vCJD), which are not eliminated by current viral inactivation and product purification techniques. While vCJD has been transmitted by red blood cell transfusion, no known cases have been reported from the use ofplasma- derived factor products in the past 35 years of use. However, parvovirus B19 and prions may be markers for undiscovered or unrecognized blood- borne infectious agents. This possibility suggests a potentially improved safety profile for recombinant products over plasma- derived products with respect to pathogen transmission.Data as of March 27, 2020 ALS/AKS Page 56 This information is considered confidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

Patients should always seek the advice of a physician or other qualified health provider with any questions regarding a medical condition. Clinicians should refer to the full prescribing information and published resources when making medical decisions. MASAC fully endorses the following recommendation made in April 1998 by the Public Health Service's Advisory Committee on Blood Safety and Availability: \"Every effort should be made to make recombinant clotting factors available to all who would benefit from them, and all barriers to conversion from human plasma- derived concentrates to recombinant clotting factors should be removed.\" Recombinant factor products are potentially the safest factor products available with respect to pathogen transmission and should be considered the treatment of choice for hemophilia A. For hemophilia A and B patients with inhibitors, there are often overriding concerns about efficacy that supersede those of potentially increased safety with respect to pathogen transmission. In all patients, including those with inhibitors, efficacy must be weighed against the risk of potential pathogentransmission. MASAC recommendation on SIPPET (Survey of Inhibitors in Plasma Product- Exposed Toddlers): results and recommendations for treatment products for with hemophilia A (MASAC #243) ( NHF 2016b) Inhibitor to 30% of PUPs treated with FVIII; inhibitors may occur with both plasma- derived and rFVIII concentrates. SIPPET was a prospective randomized controlled trial that evaluated the frequency of inhibitor formation in PUPs treated with rFVIII vs plasma- derived FVIII/VWF complex . There was a significant difference in inhibitor development between the 2 treatments; there was a cumulative incidence of 44.5% with rFVIII 26.8% with plasma- to 2.96). The NHF noted differences between SIPPET and previous studies that showed minimal increase in inhibitor formation with rFVIII, including ethnicity differ ences , use of a third generation agent, and the fact that about half of the patients were on on- demand therapy (episodic) vs a prophylactic regimen. The NHF recommends newly diagnosed patients and caregivers consider the following: Initiat ion of therapy with a plasma- derive d FVIII/VWF product in all PUPs. Initiat ion of therapy with an rFVIII product as previously recommended by MASAC . Initiation of therapy with a newer rFVIII product. WFH Gui delines for the Management of Hemophilia ( WFH 2012) Principles of care The primary aim of care is to prevent and treat bleeding with the deficient clotting factor. Acute bleeds should be treated as quickly as possible, preferably within 2 hours. Prevention of bleeding can be achieved by prophylactic factor replacement. Prophylactic factor replacement therapy Prophylaxis prevents bleeding and joint destruction and should be the goal of therapy to preserve normal musculoskeletal function. Prophylaxis does not reverse established joint damage; however, it decre ases the frequency of bleeding and may slow progression of joint disease and improve quality of life. The administration and dosing protocol should be individualized as much as possible based on age, venous access, bleeding phenotype, activity, and availability of clotting factor concentrates. Clotting factor concentrates FVIII concentrates are the treatment of choice for hemophilia A. Plasma- derived FVIII concentrates may contain variable amounts of VWF. It is therefore important to ascertain a product's VWF content (as measured by ristocetin cofactor activity) if it is used for the treatment of VWD. FIX concentrates are the treatment of choice for hemophilia B. The WFH does not express a preference for recombinant over plasma- derived concentrates, and the choice between these classes must be made according to local criteria. Allergic reactions may occur with infusions of FIX concentrates in patients with anti -FIX inhibitors; hydrocortisone may be used to treat such reactions. Changing the brand of clotting factor concentrate sometimes reduces symptoms. The WFH does not express a preference for recombinant over plasma- derived concentrates, and the choice between these classes must be made according to local criteria.Data as of March 27, 2020 ALS/AKS Page 57 This information is considered confidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

Patients should always seek the advice of a physician or other qualified health provider with any questions regarding a medical condition. Clinicians should refer to the full prescribing information and published resources when making medical decisions. In-process viral inactivation is the single largest contributor to the safety of plasma -derived concentrates. However, some viruses (eg, human parvovirus B19) are relatively resistant to current viral inactivation/elimination processes, and none of the current methods can inactivate prions. Concentrates of lower purity may give rise to allergic reactions. Patients who experience these repeatedly with aparticular product may benefit from administration of an antihistamine immediately prior to infusion or from use of a higher purity concentrate. For surgery and invasive procedures, the dosage and duration of clotting factor concentrate coverage depends on the type of surgery performed. Other pharmacological options DDAVP may be the treatment of choice for patients with mild or moderate hemophilia A when FVIII can be raised to an appropriate therapeutic level, as it avoids the expense and potential hazards of using a clotting factor concentrate . Inhibitors \"Inhibitors\" in hemophilia refer to IgG antibodies that neutralize clotting factors. Inhibitors to FVIII or FIX areconsidered the most severe treatment -related complication in hemophilia. The presence of a new inhibitor should be suspected in any patient who fails to respond clinically to clotting factors, particularly if they have been previously responsive. In this situation, the expected recovery and half -life of the transfused clotting factor are severely diminished. Inhibitors are more frequently encountered in patient s with severe hemophilia compared with those with moderate or mild hemophilia. The cumulative incidence (ie, lifetime risk) of inhibitor development in severe hemophilia A ranges from 20 to 30%, and is approximately 5 to 10% in moderate or mild disease. In severe hemophilia, inhibitors do not change the site, frequency, or severity of bleeding, while in moderate or mild hemophilia, the inhibitor may neutralize endogenously synthesized FVIII, thereby effectively converting the patient'sphenotype to severe. In all cases, inhibitors render treatment with replacement factor concentrates difficult. Management of bleeding in patients with inhibitors must be in consultation with a center experienced in their management . Choice of treatment should be based on the titer of inhibitor, records of clinical response to produc t, and site and nature of bleed. Porcine FVIII has been effective in halting bleeding in some patients, and alternative agents include BPAs, such as rFVIIa and aPCC. The efficacy of 2 doses of rFVIIa and 1 dose of aPCC for management of joint bleeding hasbeen shown to be essentially equivalent. Some patients respond better to one agent than the other, which highlights the need to individualize therapy. In patients with severe hemophilia A, eradication of inhibitors is often possible by ITI therapy . For the vast majority of patients, switching products does not lead to inhibitor development. However , in rare instances, inhibitors in PTPs have occurred with the introduction of new FVIII concentrates. In those patients, the inhibitor usually disappears after withdrawal of the new product. NHLBI : Dia gnosis, evaluation, and management of VWD (NHLBI 2007) General management Treatment of individuals with VWD is aimed at cessation of bleeding or prophylaxis for surgical procedures. Long-term risks and benefits of long- term prophylaxis should be considered carefully. Fluid restriction to maintenance levels should be considered in individuals receiving DDAVP (especially youngchildren and in surgical settings) to avoid the occurrence of hyponatremia and seizures. Treatment of minor bleeding and prophylaxis for minor surgery Epistaxis and oropharyngeal, soft tissue, or minor bleeding should be treated with IV or nasal DDAVP, if appropriatebased on trial testing. If elevation of VWF is necessary and response to DDAVP is inadequate, VWF concentrate should be used, withdosing primarily based on von Willebrand Factor:Ristocetin Cofactor (VWF:RCo ) units and secondarily on FVIII units. For management of minor bleeding (eg, epistaxis, simple dental extraction, or menorrhagia), DDAVP and proper fluidrestriction can be used without laboratory monitoring, unless DDAVP is used > 3 times within 72 hours. For individuals with mild to moderate VWD, antifibrinolytics combined with DDAVP are generally effective for oralsurgery. VWF concentrate should be available for individuals who cannot receive DDAVP or who bleed excessivelydespite this combined therapy.Data as of March 27, 2020 ALS/AKS Page 58 This information is considered confidential and proprietary to OptumRx .

Clinicians should refer t o the full prescribing i nformati on and publ ished resources when making m edical de cisions. Topical agents, such as fibrin sealant or bovine thrombin, may be useful adjuncts for oral surgery. Treatment of major bleeding and prophylaxis for m ajor surgery Whenever possible, all major surgeries and bleeding events should be treated in hospitals with a 24- hour/day laboratory capability and with clinical monitoring by a team including a hematologist and a surgeon skilled in the management of bleeding disorders. Acquired von Willebrand syndrome (AVWS) Individuals who have AVWS and who require surgery should be considered for a trial of therapy with DDAVP and/orVWF concentrate, with monitoring of VWF:RCo and FVIII levels, to evaluate for possible accelerated clearance ofVWF. For individuals who have AVWS and who bleed excessively despite therapy with DDAVP and VWF concent rate, treatment with high- dose IV immun oglobulin should be considered, especially in IgG isotype monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance . SAFETY SUMMARY Inhibitor development Some patients with hemophilia develop inhibitors, which are IgG antibodies that neutralize clotting factors such as FVIII and FIX and make it difficult to obtain sufficient factor levels to control bleeding ( WHF 2012). Inhibitors to FVIII or FIX are considered the most severe treatment -related complication in hemophilia. The development of inhibitors has been reported in 20 to 30% of patients with severe hemophilia A and 1.5 to 3% in severe hemophilia B ( Hoots and Shapiro 2019b ). Many i nfluences may contribute to inhibitor development such as patient characteristics (eg, variations in factor and immune regulatory genes ), the environment, and the hemophilia treatment . Inhibitors are more likely to occur within the first 50 EDs in patients with severe hemophilia A, but a baseline low risk remains through a patient's life ( Iorio et al 2012). The cumulative inhibitor risk in PUPs is approximately 30%, whereas in PTPs it is 2 to 3 per 1000 patient -years. An ED is defined as a 24- hour period during which a dose of concentrate has been administered, irrespective of size and frequency. PUPs are defined as having < 20 to 50 EDs, while PTPs are commonly defined as having > 75 to 150 EDs. All h emophilia agents Contraindication In general, all agents are contraindicated in patients who have had life- threatening hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, to the agent or its components. Warnings/precautions Common warnings and precautions with the factor replacement products include risks of thromboembolic events, development of neutralizing antibodies (inhibitors), and transmitting infectious agents in products made from human blood. FEIBA, Hemlibra, and NovoSeven RT each have a boxed warning for the risk of thromboembolic event s; boxed warning details are included further in the Safety Summary section. Drug Interactions Risk of hypercoagulability with Hemlibra, FEIBA, NovoSeven RT, FX, and FXIII A- subunit agents may increase with concomitant use of other clotting factors. FVIII FVIII neutralizing antibodies (inhibitors) may occur ; PUPs are at greatest risk . Helixate FS, Kogenate FS: When clotting is normalized by treatment with F VIII, development of cardiovascular risk factors may be the same as the risk for non- hemophilic patients. Jivi: Immune response to polyethylene glycol (PEG), manifested as symptoms of acute hypersensitivity and/or loss of drug effect, has been observed primarily in patients < 6 years of age.Data as of March 27, 2020 ALS/AKS Page 59 This information is considered confidential and proprietary to OptumRx .

Cases of TMA and thrombotic events were reported when on average a cumulative amount of > 100 units /kg/24 hours of aPCC was administered for 24 hours or more to patients receiving Hemlibra prophylaxis. Patients should be monitored for the development of TMA and thrombotic events if aPCC is administered. Administration of aPCC should be discontinued and dosing of Hemlibra suspended if symptoms occur.

Boxed warning : Thromboembolic events have been reported during post -marketing surveillance, particul arly following the administration of high doses and/or in patients with thrombotic risk factors. Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of thromboembolic events. The safety and efficacy of FEIBA for breakthrough bleeding in patients receiving Hemlibra has not been established.Cases of T MA were reported in a clinical trial where subjects received FEIBA as part of a treatment regimen for breakthrough bleeding following treatment with Hemlibra. The benefits and risks of FEIBA should be considered if it is considered required for patients receiving Hemlibra prophylaxis and patients should be closely monitored for signsand symptoms of TMA. Presence of isohemagglutinins and interference with laboratory tests: FEIBA contains blood group isohemagglutinins (anti-A and anti -B). Passive transmission of antibodies to erythrocyte antigens, eg, A, B, D, may interfere with some serological tests for red cell antibodies, such as antiglobulin test (Coombs test). FX concentrate (human) ( Coagadex ) Drug Interactions Coagadex should be used with caution in patients who are receiving other plasma products that may contain F X (eg, fresh frozen plasma, PCC [Profilnine]). Based on the mechanism of action, Coagadex is likely to be counteracted by direct Desmop ressin agents Contraindications DDAVP injection: moderate to (creatinine clearance [ CrCl] < 50 mL/min) ; hyponatremia or Warnings/precautions DDAVP Stimate : hyponatremia . Very rare cases of hyponatremia have been reported from worldwide postmarketing experience in patients treated with desmopressin. Fluid restriction is recommended and carefulmedical supervision is required. DDAVP injection, Stimate: polydipsia . Desmopressi n products should be used with caution in patients with habitual or psychogenic polydipsia, who may be more likely to drink excessive amounts of fluids, putting them at greater risk ofhyponatremia. DDAVP injection, Stimate: D esmopressin should not be used to treat patients with Type 2B VWD since platelet aggregation may be induced. DOSING AND ADMINISTRATION The dose and frequency of administration of the hemophilia agents varies among individual patients. The treatment dose and frequency should be calculated based on patient characteristics and clinical considerations such as theseverity of the factor deficiency, the location and extent of bleeding, and presence of inhibitors. Higher factor clearance may occur in pediatric patients with some agents; dose adjustment may be needed. The extended half -life FVIII and FIX agents are intended to reduce the dosing frequency and burden of prophylaxis regimens compared with the standard half -life agents. All factor replacement products require IV administration and are available as single- use vials, with the exception of Xyntha Solofuse which is available as a single- use prefilled dual -chamber syringe. Treatment dose and frequency should be calculated based the patient's clinical condition and the product's prescribi ng information. See Table 13 for general dosing information. Table 13.

See the cur rent prescribing information for full details . CONCLUSION Hemophilia A and B, VWD , and other rare bleeding disorders due to less prevalent factor deficiencies, are complex disorders with regard to diagnosis and management. In general, optimal management, especially of severe disease,requires both the treatment and prevention of acute bleeding with the use of clotting factor replacement therapy. Factor replacement concentrates are all generally effective in temporarily replacing the missing clotting factor to promote hemostasis. The ultimate choice is determined by the specific characteristics of each product, the individual patient, andlocal standards of practice. Due to the potential risk for pathogen transmission with human plasma- derived factor concentrates, recombinant factor replacement agents are generally recommended as the treatment of choice in patients with bleeding disorders. In hemophilia A and B, extended half -life factor replacement products are intended to reduce the dosing frequency and burden of prophylaxis regimens compared with standard factor products with short er half -lives. Hemlibra is a first -in-class bispecific monoclonal antibody with a unique mechanism of action that provides a safe and effective option for routine prophylaxis in patients with hemophilia A with or without F VIII inhibitors . Hemlibra is the only prophylactic option in patients with hemophilia A that can be self -administered by a once- weekly SC injection, with a once- every -4-week s dosing regimen for eligible patients. Certain d esmopressin formulations, including the DDAVP injection and Stimate nasal spray, may be used in some patients with mild hemophilia A, VWD type 1 and some variations of VWD 2.
