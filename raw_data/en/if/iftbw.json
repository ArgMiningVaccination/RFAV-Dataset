While many cringe at the idea of needles, we want to assure anyone out there who is a bit nervous that we mainly use electric stimulation acupuncture that works without needles. Our Chiropractor, Dr. Teresa Larson, is skillful, certified in [acupuncture in Lincoln](/) who employs both electrical stimulation, or traditional needles, and her patients report finding long sought-after pain relief, without discomfort or side effects. Patients undergoing difficult physical therapy after an auto injury, or accident injury of any kind, should consider trying this ancient Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) practice (with or without a modern electrical twist) for pain relief. Physical Therapy and Acupuncture Provide Relief for Accident Injury and Auto Injury Patients in Lincoln NE Physical therapy can involve a range of different healing modalities to help patients recover from accident injuries, auto injuries, or chronic pain. Acupuncture is extremely beneficial to healing a variety of different ailments and conditions because it treats the underlying source of the problem. Here at our family chiropractic clinic in Lincoln, Dr. Larson is a certified in acupuncture who uses both traditional FDA-approved needles, and needle-free electrical stimulation techniques. According to Chinese medicine, all pain and illness originates from inconsistencies in a person's Qi (\"chee\"). Qi is body's natural flow of energy. \"Meridians\" within the body are the channels through which this energy flows. Findings from recent research demonstrate that these meridians flow through the fascia, which is a layer of connective tissue within the body. If the natural flow of these meridians is disrupted or out of balance for some reason, physical and emotional illness can occur. Traditionally, special needles are inserted at very specific points on the body to restore the balance within these meridians. With Electroacupuncture, however, small electrical pulses are sent through these same meridians to restore the normal energy flow, without all the needles! Here at our family chiropractic office, Dr. Larson gets to know each patient, often asking more questions than a regular doctor. She needs to understand things about the patient's entire lifestyle and emotional outlook first. Within TCM, the acupuncturist needs to understand the individual patient, and not just the symptoms of the pain, so that the root cause of the pain can be discovered and treated. While a regular doctor may just prescribe medicine to mask the symptoms, our goal is to treat and eliminate the reason behind the back pain or the neck pain, and not just cover up the symptoms temporarily. We want to help patients solve the root problem itself so that the pain does not return. With thousands of years of practice throughout Asia, and a growing body of scientific study here in the West, it is clear that patients suffering pain can find the relief they seek through acupuncture. Dr. Larson has been able to successfully treat patients with a myriad of painful health problems through this branch of TCM. The Following is a conversation with Dr. Teresa Larson on the topic of Acupuncture Acupuncture is a 5,000 year old Chinese system of natural healing (No drugs... No surgery), which is concerned with restoring proper energy flow to the various organs, glands, and tissues of the body on the premise that most diseases are the result of malfunction due to disrupted energies. Explanations: The Chinese definitions of Health is \"All parts of the body functioning normally,\" all 400 trillion parts. If there is an interruption in the transmission of energy flow or life forces (called chi in Chinese), then organ malfunction, disease, pain and suffering are inevitable. In either or both locations - In the channels of energy flow, which are located throughout the body, just beneath the skin surface; - In the spinal column where vertebrae may become misaligned, thereby compressing vital nerve trunks. Yes of course. Psychosomatic states, hereditary factors, poisons, adverse environmental conditions, injury, germs, malnutrition, ect..., are all disease producing. By many methods, including certain signs, symptoms, pain spots, organ reflex points, and by pulse or instrumental findings. First, the related skin points are determined. Then they are appropriately treated by on of over thirty methods of stimulation some of which are: - Long needle insertions (especially done in acupuncture anesthesia for surgery; - Short needle penetrations; - Fingertip pressure (Called shishin or \"finger needles\"); - metallic balls taped to the points; - Electrical stimulation; - Moxabustion (the burning of herbs over the points) Note: The non-piercing needles (teishin) and electrical stimulation are very popular because these techniques are practically painless, there is no blood, no danger of infection, and results are equal to, if not better than other techniques. Textbook listed conditions run into the hundreds. Typical ailments usually responding to acupuncture health care includes: neuralgias, headaches, trigeminal neuralgia, tics, spasms, muscular rheumatism, neuralgia of the shoulders and arm, tennis elbow, osteoarthritis, rheumatism, ulcers, stomach problems, diarrhea, hepatitis, asthma, bronchitis, shortness of breath, coughs, certain types of heart trouble, abnormal blood pressure, hemorrhoids, lumbago, bladder irritation, bed wetting, certain kidney problems, knee pain, female disorders, impotence, glaucoma (sometimes), weak eyesight, hay fever, loss of smell, tonsillitis, loss of hearing, sciatica, skin conditions, stroke, and even nervous or psychiatric factors based on the fact that often mental problems arise from physical disorders. The above list may seem long as though acupuncture were a Panacea. The truth is that most textbooks list over two thousand diseases. Please be mindful; of the act that acupuncture is not like on drug used for on condition, but on the contrary, it is a complete healing art within itself, concerned with the systems of the body such as nervous, circulatory, digestive, respiratory, eliminatory, reproductive, hormonal, musculoskeletal, etc., and seeks to correct health problems within those systems. On average, 8. Two of ten fail to respond favorable for a variety of reasons. Advanced age, severity of the condition, irreversible tissue damage, etc., are deterrents to recovery. Absolutely. Spinal adjusting is part of the acupuncture health care. World authorities, including Feliz Mann, M.D. of England; Paul Nogier, M.D. of France and Kunzo Nagayama, M.D. of Japan are very emphatic on this aspect of \"getting well\". Dr. Mann states that many internal diseases are cured by the spinal adjustment along. Leaving the adjustment (chiropractic) out of the treatment plan invites failure. Yes. In fact the word acupuncture is incorrect because it implies needles only. The proper name is \"Meridian Therapy\" or Ching Lo Chi Liao in Chinese. It was named \"acupuncture\" in the 16th Century by Portuguese sailors who knew no better. The wrong name stuck. Any doctor (Chiropractor, medical, osteopath) who has had the proper training. Any doctor who has not had the proper training is pretending to know something he/she does not, and by that definition is a quack. Just because a doctor happens to have a chiropractic, medical, or osteopathic degree does not mean he/she is qualified to do acupuncture. If he/she engages in practice, he/she is guilty of acupuncture malpractice. He/she must receive qualified training and pass exams to certify competence. This protects the public. Yes, There are five laws to obey for those who desire health and longevity: - Proper nutrition - Adequate rest - Moderate exercise - A positive mental attitude - Proper nerve supply Meridian therapy is natural healing based on knowledge of another biological principal new only to the western world. Soviet scientists Novinsky and Voroviev have proven the premise of ancient Chinese healing by localizing meridian points with a Wheatstone bridge, using an alternating current to prevent polarization. This was fed by a generator of sonic frequency and recorded on a cathode ray oscillography. When the electrode touched an active acupuncture point the amplitude of the waves on the oscillography diminished. Best results were derived from frequencies of a few kilohertz of voltage from serval millivolts to 4 volts. Research? The Russians have already done it. The research needed concerns results in the country on the sick American. I'm doing that here in Lincoln, NE. How? Our member doctors are sending in testimonials from their patients from all over the nation. A report on this project later. We should welcome new knowledge as it is found... that's what science is all about. Acupuncture won't swallow us up... it'll strengthen our medical professions.
