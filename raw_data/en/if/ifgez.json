DEFINITIONS AND DIFFERENTIATION A. DEFINITIONS OF LIFESTYLE MEDICINE There doesn't seem to be a standard definition, but the available definitions are really saying basically the same thing: The use of lifestyle int erventions within conventional medicine to lower th e risk for a number of lifestyle-related chronic dise ases or, if such conditions are already present, to serve as an adjunct to the management plan. Current definitions include: Egger, 2008: /square4 The therapeutic use of lifestyle interventions in the management of disease at all levels to help manage the growing number of cases presenting to doctors now with a lifestyle-based cause of disease such as obesity and type 2 diabete s. /square4 The application of environmental, behavioral, medi cal and motivational principles to the management of lifestyle related health problems in a clinical setting. ACLM: /square4 The use of lifestyle interventions in the treatmen t and management of disease. ALMA: /square4 The therapeutic use of lifestyle interventions in the management of disease caused primarily by lifestyle. Rippe, 1999: /square4 The integration of lifestyle practices into conven tional medicine to lower the risk for chronic disease and, if disease is already present, to serv e as an adjunct to therapy. Rippe Health: /square4 The study and practice of how to help individuals understand that their daily habits and practices have a profound impact on their short and long term health and quality of life. ACPM, Johnson, Barry, 2008: /square4 A defined scientific approach to decreasing diseas e risk and illness burden by utilizing lifestyle interventions such as nutrition, physical activity, stress reduction, smoking cessation, avoidance of alcohol abuse, and rest. Greenstone, 2007: /square4 The study and practice of how simple lifestyle mea sures such as proper diet, proper exercise, and stress reduction are thoughtfully and comprehensively integrated into conventional Western medicine practices; includes p romoting health through prevention and therapeutic strategies. Additional descriptions: /square4 Bridges the gap between health promotion and conve ntional medicine. [ALMA] /square4 Includes primary prevention, secondary prevention and tertiary prevention. [Egger, ALMA] /square4 An essential component of the treatment of most ch ronic diseases; incorporated in many national disease management guidelines. [Rippe, 19 99] /square4 A clinical discipline which involves general pract itioners working with a team of allied heath professionals to develop a patient specific interve ntion. [Egger] /square4 Involves a range of health professionals working a s a team to prevent, manage and treat the ~70% of modern health problems which have a lifesty le-based cause. [ALMA] /square4 Brings together sound scientific evidence from div erse health related fields to assist clinicians in the process of not only treating disease, but also promoting good health. [Rippe, 1999] /square4 Requires patients to change high risk health behav iors to behaviors that will help to reverse the pathology and or reduce the likelihood of disease p rogression. [Egger] /square4 Changes the emphasis to an approach in which the p atient becomes increasingly involved in his or her care. [ALMA] /square4 Isn't simply about prolonging life, it's about ens uring people can enjoy their later years with less pain and disease. [Rippe Health] Lifestyle Medicine Review American College of Preventive Medicine 3 Interventions included: /square4 Nutrition, physical activity, stress management, s leep management, smoking cessation, personal hygiene and a variety of other non-drug modalities [Egger, 2008] /square4 Diet (nutrition), exercise, stress management, smo king cessation, and a variety of other non- drug modalities. [ACLM] /square4 Coaching patients to improve personal lifestyle ch oices regarding weight, physical activity/exercise, nutrition, smoking, stress manag ement, and depression management. [Harvard ILM] /square4 Protocols and advice about physical activity, diet and nutrition, stress management, smoking cessation and other modalities related to lifestyle decisions and habits. [Rippe, 1999] Trends : /square4 Becoming the preferred modality for not only preve ntion but also treatment of most chronic diseases, including type 2 diabetes, CHD, hypertens ion, obesity, insulin resistance syndrome, osteoporosis, and many types of cancer. [ACLM] /square4 Is often prescribed in conjunction with pharmacoth erapy, e.g., diabetic patients on medication to control the blood glucose levels prescribed a diet and exercise intervention to assist in the long term management.

COMPARISON WITH OTHER NONTRADITIONAL TYPES OF M EDICINE Lifestyle Medicine is based on the recognition of the central role of lifestyle in many chronic disease conditions; the use of lifestyle change interventio ns within conventional medicine to lower the risk f or chronic disease or, if disease is already present, to serve as an adjunct to the management plan. /square4 Includes exercise, eating habits, stress managemen t, tobacco and alcohol use Complementary Alternative Medicine (CAM) is a group of diverse medical and health care systems, practices, and products that are not prese ntly considered to be part of conventional medicine. [NCCAM] /square4 These practices are not typically taught in medica l school, not used in hospitals and not reimbursed by medical insurance /square4 The list of what is considered to be CAM changes c ontinually, as those therapies that are proven to be safe and effective become adopted into conventional health care and as new approaches to health care emerge. Complementary Medicine is used with conventional medicine. [NCCAM] /square4 An example of a complementary therapy is using aro matherapy - a therapy in which the scent of essential oils from flowers, herbs, and tr ees is inhaled to promote health and well- being to help lessen a patient's discomfort following sur gery. Alternative Medicine is used in place of conventional medicine. [NCCAM] /square4 An example of an alternative therapy is using a sp ecial diet to treat cancer instead of undergoing surgery, radiation, or chemotherapy that has been recommended by a conventional doctor. Lifestyle Medicine Review American College of Preventive Medicine 4 /square4 Types of alternative medicine include: 1) Alternat ive medical systems (e.g., traditional Chinese medicine, acupuncture, homeopathy, naturopa thy, ayurveda), 2) Mind/Body techniques (e.g., meditation, biofeedback, relaxati on, hypnotherapy), 3) Biologically based therapies (e.g., herbal therapies), 4) Body based t herapies (e.g., chiropractic, massage, reflexology), and 5) Energy therapies (e.g., reiki, therapeutic touch) Mind Body Medicine focuses on the interactions among the brain, mind, body, and behavior, and on the powerful ways in which emotional, mental, so cial, spiritual, and behavioral factors can directl y affect health. [NCCAM] /square4 It regards as fundamental an approach that respect s and enhances each person's capacity for self-knowledge and self-care, and it emphasizes techniques that are grounded in this approach. /square4 Includes relaxation, hypnosis, visual imagery, med itation, yoga, biofeedback, tai chi, spirituality, etc Integrative Medicine combines treatments from conventional medicine and CAM for which there is some high-quality evidence of safety and effectiven ess. It is also called integrated medicine. [NCCAM] /square4 Many health care institutions have begun integrati ng therapies that aren't part of mainstream medicine into their treatment programs. A number of medical schools now include education on nontraditional techniques. As complementary and alternative therapies prove effective, they're being combined more often with conventional care. This is known as integrative medicine. References: NCCAM: http://nccam.nih.gov/health/whatiscam/overvi ew.htm Merck Manual of Medicine Information, Second n. Pocket Books: NY, 2003 Mayo Clinic: http://www.mayoclinic.com/print/altern ative-medicine/PN00001/METHOD=print Preventive Medicine includes all aspects of medical care aimed at preve nting health problems; includes: /square4 Maintaining good health habits: daily exercise, we ight control, proper nutrition, avoidance of smoking and drug abuse, abstinence from, or moderat ion of, alcohol use /square4 Proper control of any diseases or disorders, such as high blood pressure, diabetes, elevated cholesterol, e.g, monitoring, self management skill s, etc /square4 Periodic screening to prevent or at least minimize disease. /square4 Immunizations /square4 Early detection and intervention of disease proces ses http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001 921.htm Functional Medicine is a patient-centered approach that goes beyond a typical holistic model to balance core functional processes in the body such as cellular metabolism, digestive function, detoxification, and control of oxidative stress.

LIFESTYLE MEDICINE - COMPARE AND CONTRAST Similarities to others: /square4 Similar to Complementary in that it is used with c onventional medicine. Lifestyle Medicine Review American College of Preventive Medicine 5 /square4 Similar to Alternative in that it can be an altern ative treatment - as in the Ornish program for CAD, or a lifestyle approach to treating low back p ain, hypertension, dyslipidemia, etc /square4 Similar to Integrative in that there is evidence t o support its use with conventional medicine for many conditions, and it is integrated into conv entional medicine /square4 Similar to Preventive in the attention to good hea lth habits, the role of lifestyle behaviors in controlling disease, and the application to every p erson Differences between LM approach and the others: /square4 Seems to fit between alternative medicine and conv entional medicine /square4 It is more specific (i.e., prescriptive) in its us e of lifestyle interventions /square4 Stronger evidence base than most alternative thera pies /square4 Includes fewer treatment options; does not include the vast array of therapies that are used in alternative therapy /square4 It is not used in place of conventional medicine as is alternative medicine /square4 Some aspect of LM is almost always appropriate wit h conventional treatment /square4 LM does not include the screening, immunizations, and preventive medical therapies that are part of preventive medicine /square4 Better defined than integrative or functional medi cine; the interventions that make up these approaches are not specified; these approaches seem more nebulous Unique role of Lifestyle Medicine: /square4 Strict focus on lifestyle behaviors /square4 Success depends on patient motivation - must inclu de \"coaching\" /square4 Name describes the approach better than any other type of non-conventional medicine /square4 Applies to every practice, every patient /square4 Emphasizes the use of a collaborative care model b ecause of incorporation of allied health care professionals to provide much of the direct co unseling /square4 Limited number of intervention approaches - more c onducive to staff training /square4 Involves more prescriptive lifestyle interventions for specific diseases or risk conditions /square4 Recommended in many national guidelines for use in both prevention and treatment /square4 The inclusion of cognitive behavioral therapies in lifestyle change, motivational counseling, coaching patients to become more involved and respo nsible for their own outcomes Questions: /square4 Application to primary prevention /square4 If not, where do you draw the line, as \"pre-diabet es\" or \"pre-hypertension\" or other high risk conditions?

CPT codes are already available for tobacco and alc ohol counseling. /square4 Some CPT codes are available for physical activity , such as: Pulmonary rehab exercise (4033F), therapeutic exer cise for osteoarthritis (4018F), exercise counseling for osteoporosis (4019F), and cardiac re hab (93797). Generally don't include non-physician services. /square4 According to the AMA, codes are available for diet change and preventive counseling, but are seldom used and not reimbursed; can bill these services as part of extended visit for chronic disease /square4 No CPT codes for diet or stress management The case needs to be made for specific lifestyle in terventions (i.e., prescriptions for exercise, diet , stress, etc) for specific medical conditions (i.e., diagnoses) - so coverage can be defined. /square4 AMA is actively advocating for adequate compensati on for health behavior counseling. http://www.ama-assn.org/ama1/pub/upload/mm/433/hl_p hysician_guide.pdf Use smoking as an example: Build the evidence base to make the case Indisputable evidence has had an effect on coverage , has led to a greater frequency of identifying and discussing tobacco use, and providing interventions . [1] /square4 Smoking rates have dropped from about 44% in the 1 960s to about 21% today. [2,3] Today, there are more former smokers than current smokers. [4] In the dozen years since the publication of the fir st Guideline, impressive changes have occurred. [1] /square4 In 1997, only 25% of managed health care plans cov ered any tobacco dependence treatment -- By 2003, this figure approached 90%. [5] /square4 Numerous states added Medicaid coverage for tobacc o dependence treatment since the publication of the first Guideline so that, by 2005, 72% offered c overage for at least one Guideline-recommended treatment. [5-7] /square4 In 2002, The Joint Commission (formerly JCAHO), wh ich accredits some 15 000 hospitals and health care programs, instituted an accreditation requirem ent for the delivery of evidence-based tobacco dependence interventions for patients with diagnose s of acute myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, or pneumonia (www.coreoptions.com/new_site /jcahocore.html; www.hospitalcompare.hhs.gov). /square4 Finally, Medicare, the Veterans Health Administrat ion, and the U.S. Military now provide coverage for tobacco dependence treatment. Such policies and sys tems changes are paying off in terms of increased rates of assessment and treatment of toba cco use. /square4 The rate at which smokers report being advised to quit smoking has approximately doubled since the early 1990s. [8-11] /square4 Recent data also suggest a substantial increase in the proportion of smokers receiving more intensive cessation interventions.[12,13] /square4 The National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA ) reports steady increases for both commercial insurers and Medicaid in the discussion of both med ications and strategies for smoking cessation.[14] /square4 Finally, since the first Guideline was published i n 1996, smoking prevalence among adults in the United States has declined from about 25% to about 21%. [15] The 2008 Guideline update emphasizes that clinician s and health care delivery systems consistently ide ntify and document tobacco use status and treat every tobacco user seen in a health care setting. /square4 It also documents the considerable progress made i n tobacco research over the brief period separating these two works. /square4 A key recommendation of the updated Guideline is t hat health care systems, insurers, and purchasers assist clinicians in making the established effecti ve treatments available. /square4 Making tobacco dependence a benefit covered by ins urance plans increases the likelihood that a tobacco user will receive treatment and quit succes sfully. The fifth chapter of the updated guidelines (System s Interventions), targets health care administrator s, insurers, and purchasers, and offers a blueprint to changes i n health care delivery and coverage such that tobac co assessment and intervention become a standard of ca re in health care delivery. /square4 The authors explain that changes in health policy make a difference in curbing smoking. Some helpful policy steps include: Lifestyle Medicine Review American College of Preventive Medicine 7 /square4 Providing tobacco dependence treatment as a covere d insurance benefit /square4 Offering training to physicians and nurses to enco urage them to counsel patients /square4 Improving the ability of physicians to document an d receive reimbursement for tobacco interventions. The same thing needs to be done for: 1) exercise in terventions, 2) diet interventions, and 3) stress m anagement interventions. /square4 May need to break down evidence to specific eviden ce-based practices for diagnosed conditions, such as: o Exercise: Reduce time in sedentary activity, Walki ng 3x/week for 30 minutes, o Diet: Increase fiber consumption to 20 g/day, Red uce saturated fats to 10% of kcals o Stress: Use relaxation response for anxiety attac ks B. MEDICARE COVERAGE http://www.medicare.gov/Coverage/Home.asp Lifestyle Medicine covered: It is a quite narrow range of indications: /square4 Cardiac rehab following an MI, heart surgery, or d iagnosed stable angina for 3-4 mos /square4 Diabetes self management - 10 hrs of self manageme nt training following the diagnosis /square4 Medical nutrition therapy for people with diabetes , kidney disease (not on dialysis), or have a kidney transplant. /square4 Smoking cessation if diagnosed with a smoking-rela ted disease -- 8 visits over a 12-month period. /square4 Individual has to pay 20% of covered amount. Medicare covers screening tests for cholesterol, li pid, and triglyceride levels every five years, BUT does not cover health and wellness education, OR al ternative therapies. CARDIAC REHAB Effective March 22, 2006, Medicare covers comprehen sive cardiac rehabilitation programs that include exercise, education, and counseling for pat ients referred by their doctor who meet one of the following conditions: 1. had a heart attack in the last 12 months, 2. had coronary bypass surgery, 3. have stable angina, 4. had heart valve repair/replacement, 5. had angioplasty or coronary stenting, or 6. had a heart or heart-lung transplant. Program Requirements /square4 Duration: 2 to 3 sessions per week for 12 to 18 w eeks. /square4 Components: Programs must be comprehensive, inclu ding a medical evaluation, a program to modify cardiac risk factors (e.g., nutritional c ounseling), prescribed exercise, education, and counseling. /square4 Facility: Must have the necessary cardio-pulmonar y, emergency, diagnostic, and therapeutic life-saving equipment accepted by the m edical community as medically necessary, e.g., oxygen, cardiopulmonary resuscitat ion equipment, or defibrillator. /square4 Staff: Must be under the direct supervision of a physician; personnel trained in both basic and advanced life support techniques and in exercis e therapy for coronary disease. DIABETES SELF MGMT Includes education about self-monitoring of blood g lucose, diet, exercise, and insulin. /square4 10 hours of initial diabetes self-management train ing; may qualify for 2 hours of follow-up training each year if o it is provided in a group of 2 to 20 people, o it lasts for at least 30 minutes, o it takes place in a calendar year following the ye ar you got your initial training, and Lifestyle Medicine Review American College of Preventive Medicine 8 o your doctor or a qualified non-physician practitio ner ordered it as part of your plan of care. MENTAL HEALTH Medicare covers mental health services on an outpat ient basis by a doctor, clinical psychologist, clinical social worker, clinical nurse specialist, or physician assistant in an office setting, clinic , or hospital outpatient department. /square4 Medicare covers substance abuse treatment in an ou tpatient treatment center if they have agreed to participate in the Medicare program; pati ents usually pay 50% of the Medicare- approved amount. MEDICAL NUTRITION THERAPY Medicare covers medical nutrition therapy services when it is ordered by a doctor for people: /square4 with kidney disease who are not on dialysis or /square4 who have a kidney transplant or /square4 who have diabetes. Services can be given by a registered dietician or Medicare-approved nutrition professional and include nutritional assessment and counseling. /square4 Dietary foods, drinks and vitamins are not covered . SMOKING CESSATION People with Medicare who are diagnosed with a smoki ng-related disease, including heart disease, cerebrovascular disease (stroke), multiple cancers, lung disease, weak bones, blood clots, and cataracts can get coverage for smoking and tobacco use cessation counseling. /square4 Medicare will cover 8 face-to-face visits during a 12-month period. These visits must be ordered by your doctor and provided by a qualified doctor or other Medicare-recognized practitioner. NOT COVERED Medicare generally does not cover health and wellne ss education, OR alternative therapies. III. CURRENT STATUS OF LIFESTYLE MEDICINE An enormous body of evidence supports the effective ness of lifestyle interventions for lowering the risk of developing chronic disease, as well as for assisting in the management of existing disease. As a result of the accumulating evidence, national guidelines emphasize lifestyle interventions for general health, as well as most disease or high ris k conditions. [1-10] The general consensus of these recommendations incl udes: /square4 Get about 30 minutes of moderately intense physica l activity at least 5 days a week, preferably every day, /square4 Quit smoking, if a smoker, /square4 Use alcohol only in moderation, if at all - limit to 2 servings/day for men, 1 for women, /square4 Lose 5% to 10% of body weight, if overweight or ob ese, /square4 Achieve weight loss by reducing kcal intake by abo ut 500 kcal per day and gradually increase physical activity to 60 minutes per day, /square4 Consume a diet rich in vegetables and fruits, at l east 2 fruits, 3 vegetables per day, /square4 Choose whole-grain, high-fiber foods (at least half of gra ins as whole grains), /square4 Limit intake of saturated fat to <10% of energy, trans fat to <1% of energy, and cholesterol to <300 mg/day by choosing lean meats and vegetable al ternatives, fat-free (skim) or low-fat (1% fat) dairy products and minimize intake of partially hydrogenated fats, /square4 Consume fish, especially oily fish, at least twice a week, /square4 Minimize intake of beverages and foods with added sugars. Other recommendations, or some variations of these, are made for specific medical conditions, but there are two key points: Lifestyle Medicine Review American College of Preventive Medicine 9 1) Healthy lifestyle behaviors are included in virt ually every practice guideline for chronic disease prevention or management, and 2) Relatively small lifestyle improvements (e.g., 3 0 min of moderate exercise a day, 100 kcal reduction in daily intake, a weight loss of 5%) if maintained over time can reduce the risk of developing, as well as the progression of, chronic disease. [see evidence section] The USPSTF recommends that clinicians screen all ad ult patients for obesity, tobacco use and alcohol use, and offer cessation interventions for smokers, and intensive counseling and behavioral interventions to promote sustained weight loss for obese, reduced alcohol consumption in excessive users, and diet changes for all who have hyperlipid emia or other known risk factors for cardiovascular and diet-related chronic disease. http://www.ahrq.gov/clinic/pocketgd08/pocketgd08.pd f /square4 USPSTF recommendations are notable in their lack o f endorsement of behavioral counseling in primary care for physical activity or for dietary improvements in otherwise healthy people. /square4 They note the benefits of activity and a healthy d iet, but the lack of RCT evidence precludes recommendations. The Challenge According to Greenstone, the challenge is no longer proving that lifestyle interventions work, but rather in enhancing clinicians' and the health care system's commitment to learning how to incorporate the interventions into their practices and to deliver specific and compelling messages and strategies to patients. The risks of not changing must be clearly articulated, and a specific plan outlined. [11] Physician Responsibility According to the AMA Council on Scientific Affairs, health professionals have a key responsibility to: /square4 promote preventive measures and encourage positive lifestyle behaviors relating to obesity, /square4 counsel patients about safe and effective weight l oss and weight maintenance programs, and /square4 identify and treat obesity-related co-morbidities. [12] Several studies have demonstrated the enormous pote ntial of physician recommendations to influence patients' lifestyle behaviors, such as st opping smoking and improving diet. [13-18] The primary care setting is a natural fit for lifes tyle medicine. [19-21] /square4 PCPs manage the majority of patients with chronic conditions; see 3 out of 4 adults at least once a year; average is 2-3 times per year. [22] /square4 The public perceives physicians as extremely credi ble and reliable sources of information regarding health behaviors. [23,24] Advice from a physician has consistently been shown to lead to attempts to improve lifestyle. [25-31] /square4 Powerful motivator to increase physical activity [ 33,41], or make a serious attempt to lose weight. [34-40] Furthermore, some evidence suggests an association between physicians' personal health behaviors and their counseling of lifestyle interve ntions /square4 Women Physicians' Health Study was a Cross-section al survey of 4501 female doctors An early publication showed correlations between a physician's personal health behaviors and her likelihood of counseling patients on lifestyle interventions related to that behavior. This held true, when controlling for other variables, for low fat consumption and cholesterol counseling, physical ac tivity and exercise counseling, alcohol moderation and alcohol counseling and not s moking and smoking cessation counseling. Authors did not report odds ratios. [1 16] It revealed an association between women physician s placing a high priority on exercising more and counseling patients on exercise at least once a year (OR 1.7). [117] Lifestyle Medicine Review American College of Preventive Medicine 10 It also revealed an association between a physicia n vegetarian diet and her counseling patients on weight loss and nutrition (O R 2.0 and 2.1, respectively) at least once a year. [118]. /square4 A cross sectional survey of 298 primary care physi cians showed that doctors who exercised were more likely to counsel their patients to exerc ise. [119] /square4 A cross section survey of 1349 internists showed t hat among men internists, personal health practices were associated with counseling patients for each behavior except alcohol use. Among women, high physical activity was associated with counseling more patients about exercise and alcohol use [120] A particularly important time to encourage lifestyl e change is after a cardiovascular event or upon th e discovery of existing CVD or diagnosis of some othe r chronic disease. [42] /square4 Unfortunately, physicians often underestimate the importance and power of their role as health behavior change counselors. [42] A. PREVALENCE OF LIFESTYLE-RELATED CONDITIONS The predominant lifestyle-related medical condition s seen in primary care include obesity, hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes, metabolic syn drome, cardiovascular disease, arthritis and osteoporosis. /square4 2 out of 3 overweight or obese (1 in 3 obese) [43] /square4 1 out of 2 with abdominal obesity (waist circumfer ence 40\" in men or 35\" in women) [44] /square4 1 in 3 with one or more types of CVD [45] /square4 1 in 14 with CHD [7], 1 in 17 with PVD [46] /square4 1 in 3 with hypertension (half over age 55, 2 in 3 over age 65); another 1 in 3 with pre- hypertension [47-49,49a] /square4 1 in 4 with high \"bad\" cholesterol [50] /square4 1 in 3 with low \"good\" cholesterol [51] /square4 1 in 8 with diabetes (another 1 in 3 with pre-diab etes) [52] /square4 1 in 3 with metabolic syndrome; approaching half o ver age 60 [53-55] /square4 1 in 5 with arthritis; approaching half over age 5 5 [56-58] /square4 1 in 5 women over 50 with osteoporosis [59] Patient awareness and control are inadequate: /square4 Fewer than half of women aware of healthy levels o f risk factors for CVD. [60] /square4 Nearly 1 in 3 hypertensives unaware, 2 in 5 not ac tively treated, and nearly 2 in 3 not adequately controlled. [49,61] /square4 Between 1988-1994 and 1999-2004, awareness of high cholesterol increased from 39% to 63%, use of lipid-lowering drugs increased from 12% to 41%, LDL control among hyperlipidemics increased from 4% to 25% [62]. /square4 Less than half who should be treated for high LDL are being treated, only 1 in 3 of treated achieving goal level (1 in 5 with CHD) [63] /square4 Pre-diabetes is seldom identified - only 1 in 100 told they have pre- or borderline diabetes [64] /square4 Less than half with diagnosed diabetes achieving a dequate control [65-67] /square4 Fewer than 1 in 7 aware of the metabolic syndrome [68] B. PREVALENCE OF LIFESTYLE-RELATED BEHAVIORS Summary of adult lifestyle behaviors: /square4 1 in 5 smokes [69] /square4 2 in 5 exposed to second-hand smoke [70] /square4 3 in 4 do not get enough physical activity [71,72] /square4 4 in 5 need to significantly improve their diet [7 3-76] /square4 2 in 3 need to lose weight [77] /square4 < 1 in 4 uses the recommended combination of calor ic restriction and physical activity to lose weight. [78] /square4 1 in 3 exceeds the daily or weekly alcohol recomme ndation, 1 in 5 binge drinks at least occasionally. [79] Lifestyle Medicine Review American College of Preventive Medicine 11 /square4 1 in 33 are at healthy weight, non-smoking, physic ally active and consume 5 fruits and vegetables per day [80] /square4 1 in 3 adults 30 to 64 years old averages 6 hours of sleep per day. [81] Few with multiple healthy behaviors: In the 2000 BRFSS, only 1 in 33 (3%) had healthy le vels of all 4 lifestyle behaviors (non smoking, healthy weight, 5 fruits and vegetables per day, an d regular physical activity. [80] Many with multiple CVD risk factors: Greater than 1 in 3 adults had at least 2 major CVD risk factors in the 2003 BRFSS (36% of women, 38% of men, nearly half of blacks and American Indi ans/Alaska Natives). [82,83] Diet Behaviors: Between 1971 and 2002 caloric intake increased by 2 00 kcals in men, 330 in women; energy density of foods and energy intake per meal increased, freq uency of breakfast declined. [84] /square4 Americans average 16 grams of fiber per day vs. th e recommended 20-35 grams per day. [85] /square4 Few meet the guidelines for fruit ( 2 servings) and vegetable ( 3 servings) consumption; < 1 in 3 adults achieves the fruit recommendation and < 1 in 4 meets the vegetable standard. [86,87] /square4 Even fewer (1-2 in 10) achieves both standards on a regular basis. [86,88,89] /square4 Intake of added sugars (sucrose, corn syrup, and high-fructose corn syrup) increased from 13% of energy in 1978 to 17% in 2002. [90,91] /square4 Nearly 2 in 3 adults consumes sugar-sweetened beve rages (SSB); per capita consumption has increased by 46 kcal/day (6 oz) from 1994-2004 [92]. /square4 Only 1 in 6 adults 19-50, and 1 in 10 over 50, con sume the recommended dairy servings per day. [93] /square4 1 in 3 adults average < 1 whole-grain serving per day and only 1 in 12 consumes 3 or more. [94] /square4 From 1977 to 1996, food eaten away from home increased from 18% to 32% of calories. [95] /square4 Fewer than 1 in 5 older adults ( 60 yrs) consumed a \"good\" quality diet, based on i ntakes of fruit, vegetables, low fat dairy, total and saturat ed fat, whole grains, and lean protein. [96] /square4 Fewer than 1 in 5 hypertensive patients who were a dvised to follow the DASH diet were following it. [97] /square4 Only 1 in 12 people with diabetes were adhering to the ADA dietary recommendations for saturated fat and fiber. [98] Physical Activity Behaviors /square4 About half are somewhat active but not enough to l ower health risks, and 1 in 4 are completely sedentary. [72] /square4 2 in 5 spend most of their working day sitting. [7 2] /square4 Total inactivity increases with age -- over 60% at age 75. [72] /square4 Over half over age 60 report no leisure time physi cal activity. [99] /square4 Only 1 in 6 adults have a high level of physical a ctivity. [72] /square4 Data obtained with accelerometers (NHANES 2003-200 4) showed even fewer adults (1 in 20) were actually achieving 30 min/day of physical activity.

IMPACT OF HEALTHY LIFESTYLE AND LOW RISK FACTOR LEVELS Four main causes - excess weight, poor diet, physic al inactivity, and smoking - account for most of the mortality and morbidity of the major diseases o f modern society, including heart disease and stroke, diabetes, osteoarthritis, osteoporosis, col orectal cancer, depression, and kidney disease. [Egger, 2008, p 13] /square4 A number of studies have shown the benefits of a h ealthy lifestyle and lower CVD risk factor burden on CVD outcomes and longevity. The Interheart Study, which analyzed more than 11,0 00 myocardial infarctions, showed that 8 factors -- abnormal lipids, smoking, hypertension, diabetes , abdominal obesity, inactivity, lack of consumption of fruits and vegetables, and alcohol - - accounted for more than 80% of the risk for an MI. [101] The Chicago Heart Association Detection Project in Industry has followed people from a young age (18-39 yrs) for over 30 years. Key findings includ e: /square4 Incidence of CHD and CVD was rare in those with fa vorable levels of 5 major risk factors (BP, cholesterol, BMI, diabetes, and smoking) at a young age. [102] /square4 Mortality rates were much higher in those who had elevated risk factors in early adulthood. [103] /square4 Compared with participants with 3 risk factors, those with favorable profiles had substantially lower lifetime risks for CVD death (2 0% vs. 35% in men, 7% vs. 32% in women) and markedly longer median survival at middle age ( >35 vs. 26 years in men, >35 vs. 28 years in women). [104] /square4 After age 60, the impact of the risk factor burden increases rapidly both men and women. [104] /square4 Lower risk factor burden in middle age was associa ted with better QOL at older ages, along with lower Medicare costs. [105] /square4 Having more risk factors at middle age was associa ted with poorer social functioning, mental health, walking ability, and health perception at o lder ages. [106] /square4 A key finding was that the CVD risk factor burden was an important prognostic indicator for other major diseases besides CVD; remaining lifetim e risk for non-CVD death increased dramatically with increasing risk factor burden. [1 07] The Framingham Heart Study has also shown that the lifetime risk for CVD, as well as longevity, is highly associated with risk factor burden at age 50 . [108] /square4 Remaining lifetime risk for atherosclerotic CVD ev ents was 5 % in men and 8% in women with optimal risk factors at age 50, compared with 69% in men and 50% in women with 2 major risk factors at age 50. [108] /square4 Men and women with optimal risk factors had a medi an life expectancy 10 years longer than those with 2 major risk factors at age 50. [108] /square4 36% of the cohort survived to age 85, 22% survived to that age free of major morbidities. [109] /square4 But, with adverse levels of 4 risk factors at midd le age, fewer than 5% of men and 15% of women survived to 85 years of age. [109] The Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study showe d that >90% of CVD events in black subjects, and > 70% in white subjects, were explained by elev ated risk factors. [110] The Multiple Risk Factor Intervention Trial (MRFIT) Study and Chicago Heart Association Detection Project cohorts found that those with low risk fact or status had a 73- 85% lower risk for CVD mortality, a 40-60% lower total mortality rate, and 6 to 10 years' greater life expectancy than those who were not low risk status. [111] Lifestyle Medicine Review American College of Preventive Medicine 13 The Nurses' Health Study showed that with 3 of 5 he althy lifestyle factors, risk for CHD over a 14- year period was reduced by 57%; with 4, risk was re duced 66%; and with all 5 factors, risk was reduced by 83%. [112] In the Health Professionals Follow-up Study, low ri sk was defined as (1) absence of smoking, (2) BMI <25 kg/m2, (3) physical activity 30 min/d, (4) moderate alcohol consumption (5 to 30 g/d), and (5) top 40% of a healthy diet score. /square4 Over 16 years, men who met all 5 lifestyle factors had only 87% lower risk for CHD as men whose lifestyle achieved no lifestyle factors. /square4 62% of coronary events in this cohort may have bee n prevented with better adherence to these 5 healthy lifestyle practices. /square4 Among men taking medication for hypertension or hy percholesterolemia, 57% of all coronary events may have been prevented with a low-risk life style. /square4 Compared with men who did not make lifestyle chang es during follow-up, those who adopted 2 additional low-risk lifestyle factors had a 27% l ower risk of CHD. /square4 A majority of CHD events among US men may be preve ntable through adherence to healthy lifestyle practices, even among those taking medica tions for hypertension or hypercholesterolemia Among individuals 70-90 years of age, adherence to a Mediterranean-style diet and greater PA have been associated with 65% to 73% lower rates of all- cause mortality, as well as lower mortality rates due to CHD, CVD, and cancer. [113] The NHANES II Mortality Follow-Up Study showed that , over 17 years, the risk for CHD mortality was 51% lower for men and 71% lower for women with none of 3 major risk factors (hypertension, smoking, and elevated total cholesterol) than for t hose with 1 or more risk factors. [114] /square4 They estimated that 64% of all CHD deaths among wo men and 45% of CHD deaths in men could have been avoided if these 3 risk factors wer e not present. The need for early lifestyle intervention: /square4 Individuals with a low 10-year risk for CHD, but a high lifetime risk, have a greater subclinical disease burden and a greater rate of atheroscleroti c progression than individuals with low 10-year and low lifetime risk, even at younger ages . [115] D. BEHAVIORAL SCIENCE METHODS TO CHANGE RISK FACTOR S Physician discussion of healthy behaviors can be as sociated with behavior change. /square4 For instance, a cross sectional study revealed tha t patients whose doctors asked about diet were more likely to have changed fat or fiber intake (64% vs 48%). [121] Improving patient care will likely require better p atient education and use of behavioral science methods to influence patient behavior. [12 2] Behavioral methods for lifestyle interventions may involve: patient assessment, setting goals, raising awareness, confronting barriers, man aging stress, cognitive restructuring, Preventing relapse, providing support, contracting, and adding pharmacotherapy as appropriate. The 5A protocol is one such counselin g framework: [123] 1. Assess current practices and related risk factors. 2. Advise what to change. 3. Agree on individual change goals. 4. Assist change strategies and motivational barriers. 5. Arrange regular follow-up and support or refer to specialis ts if needed. Because patients could be in different stages of re adiness [124], these counseling frameworks can help the clinician assess their read iness and adjust the sounseling appropriately. Lifestyle Medicine Review American College of Preventive Medicine 14 IV. EVIDENCE FOR LIFESTYLE INTERVENTIONS - TREATING CHRONIC DISEASE Lifestyle interventions have the potential to impro ve the entire risk factor profile and most underlyi ng causes of chronic conditions. For many, the diagno sed condition is only the tip of the iceberg. This is the great advantage of lifestyle medicine over c onventional medical therapy. Exercise and increasing physical activity are the f oundation of lifestyle medicine based on supporting evidence. /square4 A systematic review of the benefits of exercise th erapy in the treatment/rehabilitation of specific chronic disease found the most consistent finding t o be that aerobic capacity and muscular strength can be improved without causing detrimenta l effects on disease progression. Severe complications are rare. [1] /square4 Unfortunately, treatment periods and follow-up tim es are often not long enough to document group differences in disease progression. However, exercise reduces disease-related symptoms in many diseases, such as osteoarthritis, asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder. /square4 Also, RCTs of patients with coronary heart disease and heart failure show that all-cause mortality is lower in exercisers than in controls. /square4 Quality of life and physical performance can be im proved for many conditions. The following diseases are addressed in this review : A. Obesity B. Hypertension C. Dyslipidemia D. Impaired Glucose Tolerance/Metabolic Syndrome E. Type 2 Diabetes F. Cardiovascular Disease G. Stroke H. Heart Failure I. Peripheral Artery Disease J. Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease K. Osteoarthritis L. Rheumatoid arthritis M. Cancer - All N. Breast Cancer O. Osteoporosis P. Depression Q. Fibromyalgia R. Chronic Fatigue Syndrome S. Type 1 diabetes T. Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease U. Multiple Sclerosis V. Parkinson's W. Cognitive Impairment/Dementia X. Chronic Low Back Pain A. OBESITY It is well established that obesity results from a chronic imbalance between caloric intake and expenditure. Reducing stored energy in fat cells r equires creating a deficit by cutting calories consumed and increasing calories expended. Consump tion is the key because it is much easier to cut calories than to expend calories. Lifestyle Modification A review of the evidence base of weight loss strate gies showed that treatments with good evidence include counseling and behavioral approaches, exerc ise based programs, pre-prepared low energy Lifestyle Medicine Review American College of Preventive Medicine 15 meals, meal replacement, and bariatric surgery (the most effective for long term weight loss in morbid obesity). [2] /square4 Limited data supports commercial diets and self he lp strategies. /square4 Over-the-counter medications or treatments (with t he exception of orlistat) have no convincing evidence of efficacy. /square4 All successful strategies include some form of lif estyle change resulting in a reduction in energy consumed versus energy expended. The most effective treatments involve combining and matching strategies to the characteristics of the p atient. Lifestyle Modification - All Intensive counseling can promote modest sustained w eight loss. /square4 A Cochrane review of 32 longitudinal analyses and 17 RCTs showed that intensive counseling strategies incorporating behavioral, dietary, and e xercise components resulted in a weight loss of 3 to 4 kg over 1 to 3.3 years. [3] /square4 The loss was linked with improved glucose toleranc e, improved physical functioning, reduced incidence of diabetes, hypertension and CVD, and re duced bone density. Another systematic review of the long-term effects of obesity treatments showed that low-fat diets were associated with continuing weight loss for 3 y ears and improvements in risk factors, as well as prevention of type 2 diabetes and improved control of hypertension. [4] /square4 The addition of an exercise or behavior program to diet was associated with improved weight loss and risk factors for at least 1 year. /square4 The combination of low-fat diets, exercise and beh avior therapy reduced the risk of developing hypertension and CVD. A third systematic review of RCTs of interventions for weight loss in obese found that adding exercise to diet, or to diet and behavior therapy, was associated with improved weight loss for up to 36 months and improvements in HDL, TGs and blood pr essure. [5] /square4 Adding behavior therapy to diet, or to diet and si butramine together, was associated with improved weight loss for up to 18 months. /square4 Adding drugs, exercise or behavior therapy to diet ary advice was each associated with similar weight change. Lifestyle Modification - Women A 6-month lifestyle change intervention in obese, s edentary, postmenopausal women showed that women significantly increased their physical activi ty (+39.6%) and cardiorespiratory fitness (+13.5%) and reduced their body weight (-6.5%), fat (-7 body fat lipoprotein (LDL) cholestero l and their diet (p < 0.05). [6] Diet: A meta-analysis of 32 RCTs involving obese patients showed that moderate and well-balanced calorie restriction is more effective than any othe r diet, resulting in an average weight loss of abou t 5 kg after one year. [7] /square4 A caloric deficit of about 500 kcals per day is th e optimal goal for most. [8] Strategies to reduce energy intake: /square4 Reduce Portion Sizes: Several well-controlled, lab oratory-based studies have shown that larger food portions leads to increases in energy intake. Large portion sizes have been shown to override hunger and satiety signals. [9] /square4 A Lower Energy Density Diet: Studies show that we eat a fairly consistent volume of food day-to- day, rather than a consistent number of calories; t he number of calories in a particular volume or weight of food is its energy density; a higher ener gy density means more calories consumed. [10] /square4 Several studies have demonstrated that eating low- energy-dense foods (e.g., fruits, vegetables, and soups) maintains satiety while reducing energy intake. [9] Dietary Counseling: Lifestyle Medicine Review American College of Preventive Medicine 16 /square4 A meta-analysis of 46 trials of dietary counseling for long-term weight loss in overweight adults revealed a maximum net treatment effect of -1.9 BMI units (approximately -6%) at 12 months. [11] /square4 Providing calorie recommendations, frequency of su pport meetings, and inclusion of exercise were independent predictors of weight change. /square4 Compared with usual care, dietary counseling inter ventions produce modest weight losses that diminish over time. Mediterranean Diet: A 3-year prospective study showed that the adoption of a Mediterranean diet pattern reduced the likelihood of overweight people becoming obese. [1 2] /square4 Adherence to this pattern is inversely associated with BMI and obesity, and the risk for becoming obese. [13,14] Whole Grains: A significant inverse relation between whole grain intake and BMI has been consistently observed in NHANES outcomes. [15] /square4 There is strong evidence that replacing refined gr ains with whole grains helps reduce weight gain and can lead to significant weight loss. [16] /square4 Weight gain has been inversely associated with the intake of high-fiber, whole-grain foods and positively related to the intake of refined-grain f oods. [17] /square4 The Nurses' Health Study showed that women in the highest quintile of dietary fiber intake had a 49% lower risk of major weight gain than women in t he lowest quintile. Fruit and Vegetables: /square4 The Nurses' Health Study also showed that those wi th highest fruit and vegetable intake had a 24% lower risk of becoming obese than those with lo west intake, after controlling for other dietary factors. [18] Legumes: NHANES 1999-2002 data showed that greater consumpti on of legumes (beans) led to higher intakes of dietary fiber, potassium, magnesium, iron, and c opper, and a lower body weight and a smaller waist circumference relative to those who did not c onsume legumes. [19] /square4 It also led to a 22% reduced risk of being obese, along with a lower systolic blood pressure. Low Glycemic Load: A Cochrane review of 6 RCTs that compared a low gly cemic index or load diet (LGI) with higher glycemic index or load diets or other diets (Cdiet) in overweight or obese people showed that those on LGI diets lost more weight and had more improvem ent in lipid profiles than those on other diets. [20] /square4 Body mass, total fat mass, BMI, total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol all decreased significantly more in the LGI group. /square4 Lowering the glycemic load of the diet appears to be more effective in promoting weight loss and improving lipid profiles in obese than nonobese. Fat intake: Diets high in fat have been proposed as a cause of obesity, primarily because fat is more energy- dense than other macronutrients. In the Prostate C ancer Prevention Trial, BMI increased by 0.53 for every 500 kcal of fat consumed daily. [21] /square4 Many studies suggest that the capacity of the body to oxidize dietary fat is a major risk factor for a positive energy balance. Most fat consumed is st ored before oxidized. [22] Exercise/Physical Activity: Exercise is important when trying to lose weight, b ut is even more important when it comes to maintaining weight loss. /square4 Most relevant RCTs show only modest weight loss wi th exercise alone, and slight increases in weight loss when exercise is added to dietary restr iction. [23] Lifestyle Medicine Review American College of Preventive Medicine 17 /square4 A meta-analysis of 43 studies (3476 participants) found that, compared with no treatment, exercise resulted in small weight losses across stu dies, but was associated with improved CVD risk factors, even when no weight was lost. [24] /square4 Increasing exercise intensity increased the magnit ude of weight loss (WMD -1.5 kg). /square4 Exercise as a sole weight loss intervention result ed in significant reductions in diastolic blood pressure (WMD -2 mmHg), triglycerides (WMD -0.2 mm ol/L) and fasting glucose (WMD -0.2 mmol/L). Higher intensity exercise resulted in grea ter reduction in fasting serum glucose than lower intensity exercise (WMD -0.3 mmol/L). The energy deficit produced by exercise is far smal ler than that produced by dietary restriction. But , studies consistently show the essential role of phy sical activity in maintaining weight-loss; prospective trials show a clear dose-response relat ionship between physical activity and weight maintenance. [23] /square4 Weight regain following weight loss is clearly ass ociated with not getting the recommended physical activity, and having a more sedentary life style, especially more screen time (i.e., TV and computer). [23] Exercise prevents the loss of muscle tissue with we ight loss and increases visceral fat loss. [25] /square4 The amount of training is more important than trai ning intensity for reducing fat. /square4 A systematic review of 9 RCTs and 7 non-RCTs of th e dose-response relationship between aerobic exercise and visceral fat reduction found t hat at least 10 METs of aerobic exercise, such as brisk walking, light jogging or stationary cycli ng, is required for visceral fat reduction; there i s a dose-response relationship between aerobic exerci se and visceral fat reduction in obese subjects without metabolic-related disorders, but n ot in those with such disorders. [26] The specific amount of physical activity needed to lose weight differs from person to person, but in general the more activity, the greater the weight l oss. [27] /square4 When 3 doses of exercise were compared the dose re sponse relation of weight loss was apparent: o < 150 min/wk at 6 mos - 7 lbs at 18 mos - 3 lbs o 150-200 min/wk at 6 mos - 11 lbs at 18 mos - 9 lb s o 200+ min/wk at 6 mos - 13 lbs at 18 mos - 14 lbs 28. Jakicic et al., JAMA 1999 The preferred form of activity for most obese patie nts is walking, if they can do it, with 30-60 minut es on most, if not all, days the recommended goal to w ork up to. [29] /square4 60 minutes per day is recommended for weight loss. But, health benefits occur with only 30 minutes of daily moderate activity. [30] /square4 Adding some resistance training does not help with fat loss, but does increase muscle mass. /square4 Cross-sectional studies show that individuals who walk more are thinner than those who walk less. Pedometer-based walking programs result in a modest amount of weight loss. Longer programs lead to more weight loss than shorter prog rams. [31] Diet Plus Exercise: Many studies have shown that the best approach invo lves changes in both eating and activity behaviors to shift the balance in favor of expendit ure. /square4 A Cochrane review concluded that diet combined wit h exercise produced a 20% greater initial weight loss than diet alone, and a greater likeliho od that the weight loss would be sustained. [32] /square4 Numerous studies have shown that regular exercise in conjunction with diet results in an average weight loss of 5% to 10%. [33] /square4 Exercise with no change in diet results in a consi stent small weight loss across studies, but must be combined with diet to yield satisfactory results . [34,35] Another systematic review of 80 RCTs with 1-year follow-up showed that weight-loss interventi ons utilizing a reduced-energy diet with exercise are a ssociated with moderate weight loss of 5 to 8.5 kg (5% to 9%) at 6 months. [36] /square4 In studies extending to 4 years, a mean 3 to 6 kg (3% to 6%) of weight loss was maintained. Lifestyle Medicine Review American College of Preventive Medicine 18 /square4 Advice-only and exercise-alone groups experienced minimal weight loss at any time point. A meta-analysis of 35 RCTs showed that a combinatio n of dieting and increased exercise is more effective than either measure alone. Increasing phy sical activity was also shown to help maintain weight loss. [7] Behavior Therapy Behavior therapy is essential for treating obesity because eating and activity habits are behaviors that need to be changed. [10] The most effective behavioral interventions combine nutrition education with diet and exercise counseling involving behavioral strategies to help patients build the skills needed to change eating and activity patterns. /square4 USPSTF recommends high-intensity counseling and be havioral interventions with at least 2 individual or group sessions per month for at least the first 3 months. [37] /square4 The 5-A framework (Assess, Advise, Agree, Assist, and Arrange) may be useful in helping clinicians guide interventions for weight loss. [37 ] A meta-analysis of 19 RCTs showed that the addition of active support, such as behavioral therapy, increases the effectiveness of weight loss in obese patients. [7] /square4 Having spouses involved increases the likelihood o f success; half of participants lost about 7 kg after one year. /square4 Interventions that do not involve assistance from healthcare professionals have been shown to be no more effective than dieting alone. A Cochrane review of 32 longitudinal analyses and 1 7 RCTs showed that intensive counseling strategies incorporating behavioral, dietary, and e xercise components promote a weight loss of 3 to 4 kg over 1 to 3.3 years. [38] A meta-analysis of 19 RCTs showed that the addition of active support makes dietary weight loss measures more effective in obese. [7] /square4 Behavioral therapy has been shown to be more effec tive when spouses are involved; half of trial participants lost about 7 kg after one year. /square4 Assistance from a healthcare professional was also shown to increase the likelihood of success. The National Weight Control Registry has shown that the following are keys to long-term weight loss success in obese patients: [39,40] 1) A serious, long-term commitment to changes in e ating habits and exercise, 2) A low fat diet (around 24% of calories, compare d to the generally recommended 30%), 3) Eat breakfast regularly, and eat 5 smaller meal s a day, on average 4) Be dedicated to exercise, such as walking 60-90 minutes per day, 5) Do not rely on weight loss drugs, 6) View past failures as learning experiences, 7) Focus on doable, process oriented goals, 8) Monitor body weight regularly (at least weekly) to catch weight gain quickly, 9) Monitor food intake if begin to gain. A Primary Care Lifestyle Intervention: /square4 The Counterweight Program is an obesity management program based on the model of Evidence-Based Quality Assessment. It consists of f our phases: (1) practice audit and needs assessment, (2) practice support and training, (3) practice nurse-led patient intervention, and (4) evaluation. [41] /square4 Patient intervention consisted of screening and tr eatment pathways incorporating evidence- based approaches, including patient-centered goal s etting, prescribed eating plans, a group program, physical activity and behavioral approache s, anti-obesity medication and weight maintenance strategies. /square4 Eighty practices were recruited of which 18 practi ces were randomized to act as controls and receive deferred intervention 2 years after the ini tial audit. Lifestyle Medicine Review American College of Preventive Medicine 19 /square4 At 12 month follow-up, 34% overall achieved a clin ical meaningful weight loss of 5% or more. Full compliance to the program increased the succes s rate to 43%. /square4 The Counterweight Program is an evidence-based wei ght management model which is feasible to implement in primary care. B. HYPERTENSION The relationship of BP to CVD risk is continuous, c onsistent, and independent of other risk factors. Each increase of 20/10 mmHg doubles risk of CVD acr oss the range starting from 115/75 mmHg. [42] /square4 Prehypertension signals the need for increased edu cation to reduce BP to prevent hypertension. The Blood Pressure Lowering Treatment Trialists Col laboration meta-analysis of 29 RCTs showed that lowering BP reduces risk of cardiovascular eve nts and death by around 20%. [43] /square4 Larger reductions in BP produce larger reductions in risk Lifestyle Approach: The JNC-7 recommends as the first line treatment fo r hypertension the following: weight loss in overweight, the DASH diet with limited salt intake, regular physical activity, quitting smoking and moderate, if any, alcohol consumption. [44] The 2008 Canadian Hypertension Education Program Ev idence-Based Recommendations Task Force assessed RCTs and systematic reviews of the i mpact of lifestyle interventions on blood pressure (BP) lowering and concluded that lifestyle modifications to prevent and/or treat hypertension include the following: [45] Restrict dietary sodium intake to 65 mmol/day to 1 00 mmol/day; 30 to 60 min of aerobic exercise 4-7 days per week ; Maintain a healthy body weight (BMI of 18.5 - 24.9 kg/m2) and waist circumference (< 102 cm for men and < 88 cm for women); Limit alcohol consumption to 14 units per week in men or 9 units per week in women; Follow a diet reduced in saturated fat and cholest erol, that emphasizes fruits, vegetables and low-fat dairy products, dietary and soluble fib er, whole grains and protein from plant sources; Lifestyle interventions: A substantial body of evidence supports the effecti veness of lifestyle modifications for lowering BP [46]. /square4 Increasing physical activity, reducing sodium inta ke, losing weight if overweight, moderating alcohol intake, and following the Dietary Approache s to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet, can lower BP at least as well as pharmacologic monother apy. A meta-analysis 105 RCTs (6805 participants) of lif estyle interventions for hypertension found robust statistically significant effects for: diet (-5.0 sodium restriction ish oil supplements (-2.3 mmHg). [47] /square4 The reductions were similar for systolic and diast olic pressure. /square4 Relaxation significantly reduced blood pressure on ly when compared with non-intervention controls. /square4 No robust evidence for potassium, magnesium or cal cium supplements. A multifactorial lifestyle modification in treated hypertensive patients over 4 months resulted in a mean 24-h ABP reduction of -4.1/-2.1 mmHg. At 4 m onths, drug withdrawal improved in men (control 44%; program 66%) but was no different in women (65 and 64%). [48] Lifestyle Modification - The PREMIER Trial The NHLBI PREMIER trial investigated the effects of multiple lifestyle changes in adults with stage 1 hypertension. [49,50] Lifestyle Medicine Review American College of Preventive Medicine 20 /square4 Three groups were compared: 1) Established recomme ndations group (EST) - weight loss if overweight, increased physical activity, limited al cohol intake, and reduced sodium, 2) Same lifestyle recommendations plus the DASH diet (EST + DASH), and 3) Advice only control (CON). /square4 PREMIER demonstrated that people with above-optima l BP and stage 1 hypertension can gain better control of BP with simple lifestyle changes. /square4 At 6 months, SBP was reduced by 3.7 mm Hg and 4.3 mm Hg more in the two intervention groups than the advice only group. /square4 At 6 months, the prevalence of optimal BP (< 120/8 0) was 19% with advice only, 30% and 35% with the two interventions. At 18-month follow-up, relative to the advice only group, the OR for hypertension was 0.83 for the EST group and 0.77 for the EST + DASH group. [51] /square4 The EST + DASH intervention lowered BP in both you nger and older groups, but significantly more so in older individuals. Changes were consist ently greater the higher the baseline pressure. [52] /square4 Both EST and EST+DASH reduced systolic blood press ure, but in patients with the metabolic syndrome only those on the DASH diet were able to l ower their BP. [53] Lifestyle - The Diet, Exercise, and Weight Loss Int ervention Trial (DEW-IT) /square4 A comprehensive lifestyle intervention substantial ly lowered blood pressure in hypertensive overweight adults already on antihypertensive medic ation. At the end of the intervention, mean weight loss in the lifestyle group, net of control, was 4.9 kg. Net reductions in 24-hour ambulatory systolic and diastolic blood pressures w ere 9.5 mm Hg and 5.3 mm Hg, respectively. Corresponding changes in daytime systolic and diast olic blood pressures were 12.1 mm Hg and 6.6 mm Hg. [54] /square4 The lifestyle group also experienced mean net redu ctions in total cholesterol (-25 in overweight hypertensives is a reliab le way to lower BP, and reduce antihypertensive medication dosage requirements. [55]. /square4 Most studies show about a 1 mm/Hg drop in both sys tolic and diastolic pressure with each 2-3 pounds of weight loss. More weight loss, greater dr op in BP. [56] /square4 A meta-analysis of 25 RCTs showed that a weight lo ss of 11 pounds (5 kg) reduced systolic blood pressure by 4.4 mmHg and diastolic pressure b y 3.6 mmHg or about 1 mmHg per kg of weight loss. [57] Diet: The DASH eating plan has been shown to be an effect ive first-line therapy for stage 1 hypertension. It contains < 2 mg of sodium per day, and an overal l pattern that is lower in total and saturated fat and higher in fiber. [58] It includes: o lots of fruits and vegetables (4-5 servings of eac h), o 2-3 servings of low fat dairy, o 7-8 servings of mostly whole grains, o 1 serving of nuts, seeds, and legumes, and o limiting meats, poultry and fish to 2 or fewer ser vings per day. Diet - The Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension Trial The Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension multice nter trial showed that a diet that emphasized fruits, vegetables, and low-fat dairy products with body weight, sodium intake, and physical activity held constant could reduce blood pressure by a net of 11.4 and 5.5 mm Hg systolic and diastolic, respectively in patients with hypertension. [59] /square4 In another 8-week RCT, blood pressure fell from 14 6/85 to 134/82 mm Hg in the DASH group; 18 of 23 participants (78%) reduced their systolic blood pressure to <140 mm Hg, compared with 24% with the control (typical) diet and 50% with a diet high in fruits/vegetables groups. [60] /square4 A key to the DASH diet is that it is made up of re gular foods that are available at most grocery stores. Additionally, the DASH diet is consistent w ith many of the recommendations made by Lifestyle Medicine Review American College of Preventive Medicine 21 organizations in the United States: the Dietary Gui delines for Americans, the National Cholesterol Education Program's Step 2 Diet, and th e National Cancer Institute. [61] Most DASH studies have been tightly controlled, wit h food provided to participants. The only large- scale study in which patients bought and prepared t heir own food is the PREMIER study. [62] /square4 The blood pressure changes observed were smaller, largely explained by participants rarely achieving their food intake goals. It points out the challenge of dietary intervention s - they work but can people do them on their own. /square4 However, a surprising finding in this study was that the \"Advice Only\" gr oup showed almost as big a blood pressure drop as the group that received in tensive counseling on the diet. /square4 Blacks are especially sensitive to the BP-lowering effects of reduced sal t intake, increased potassium intake, and the DASH diet. Diet - Sodium Intake /square4 An extensive analysis of the effects on blood pres sure (BP) of changes in sodium intake found that a sodium reduction from 100 to 50 mmol/2,100 k cal generally had twice the effect on BP as reduction from 150 to 100 mmol/2,100 kcal. [63] /square4 Age had a strong and graded influence on the effec t of sodium within the typical and DASH diets, respectively: -4.8 and -1.0 mm Hg systolic for 23 to 41 years, -5.9 and -1.8 mm Hg for 42 to 47 years, -7.5 and -4.3 mm Hg for 48 to 54 years, and -8.1 and -6.0 mm Hg for 55 to 76 years. /square4 The benefits of reduced sodium intake and the DASH diet strengthen as subjects enter middle age, when the rate of cardiovascular disease increa ses sharply. An analysis of the effects of sodium restriction an d DASH diet showed that both improve BP control. Among subjects with stage 1 hypertension at baselin e: [64] At a higher sodium intake, the DASH diet increased BP control two-fold over controls (63% vs. 32%). Reducing sodium intake alone increased BP control 2.3-fold (74% vs. 32%). Combining lower sodium with DASH resulted in the m aximum BP control rate (84%). BP became normal or optimal in 71% of persons cons uming the control diet with lower sodium and 77% of persons consuming the DASH/lower sodium diet. Another study analyzed the separate effects of the diet and the effects of reducing sodium intake. /square4 DASH was compared with a control (typical) diet at 3 levels of sodium intake (high, which was U.S. average, intermediate and low). [58] /square4 The DASH diet significantly lowered systolic press ure at every sodium level and diastolic pressure at the high and intermediate sodium levels. /square4 Reducing sodium from the high to low level also re duced systolic pressure with either diet. /square4 The greatest effect occurred when the DASH diet wa s combined with the lowest sodium intake (- 12 mm Hg in SBP in those with hypertension). Increased potassium intake has also emerged as a strategy to lower BP. [65] /square4 Other dietary factors, such as a greater intake of protein or monounsaturated fatty acids, may also reduce BP but evidence is inconsistent. Exercise/Physical activity: Moderate intensity endurance type physical activity for 30-45 minutes per day on most days of the week can lower BP in people with hypertension by an average of about 5-10 mm/Hg over several months. [66] /square4 A meta-analyses of RCTs involving either dynamic a erobic endurance training or resistance training showed that in 30 hypertensive study group s, aerobic training resulted in a net reduction of BP of 7/5 mmHg. [67] /square4 Endurance training also 7%, plasma noradrenaline by 29% and plasma renin activity by 20%. Bodyweight decreased by 1.2 kg, waist circumference by 2.8 cm, body fat by 1.4% and insulin resistance by 0.31 uni ts. Lifestyle Medicine Review American College of Preventive Medicine 22 /square4 Meta-analysis of 9 resistance training studies (mo stly dynamic resistance training) showed a net reduction in BP of 3/4. Exercise - Tai Chi and Qigong /square4 A systematic review of the effect of tai chi exerc ise on blood pressure (BP) yielded 26 studies, of which 22 reported reductions in BP with tai chi (3- 32 mm Hg systolic and 2-18 mm Hg diastolic BP reductions). [68] /square4 A systematic review of the evidence of qigong for hypertension found 12 RCTs, of which 7 tested qigong combined with drug therapy compared with dru g therapy alone. The quality of studies was low, but some encouraging evidence of qigong fo r lowering SBP. [69] /square4 A meta-analysis of two trials with adequate data s uggested beneficial of qigong mmHg]; 5 other RCTs report ed positive results in some outcomes. Moderation of alcohol consumption: Reducing alcohol intake can significantly lower BP in those with hypertension who drink excessively. [70] /square4 A meta-analysis of 15 RCTs showed that systolic an d diastolic blood pressures can be reduced by an average of 3.3 mm Hg and 2.0 mm Hg, respectiv ely, by reducing excessive alcohol intake to a moderate level. [71] /square4 A dose-response relationship was observed between alcohol reduction and blood pressure reduction in this analysis; greater reductions were seen in those with higher baseline blood pressure. Smoking Cessation: Smoking has been consistently shown to increase BP; quitting can help lower it. [72,73] Stress Reduction: Can play an important role if excessive stress and poor response to it are a problem. [74] A Cochrane review evaluated the effects of relaxati on therapies on blood pressure in people with hypertension. [75] /square4 Relaxation resulted in small, but statistically si in SBP (-5.5 mmHg) and DBP (-3.5 mmHg) compared to control groups, but mos t studies were of relatively poor quality. C. DYSLIPIDEMIA Lifestyle Interventions: Lipid profiles improve when: /square4 saturated fat and cholesterol intake are reduced, /square4 weight loss occurs in overweight, /square4 dietary fiber is increased, and /square4 physical activity is increased. [76,77] The ATP III has an extensive section on non-pharmac ologic therapy for abnormal blood lipids. [78] /square4 ATP III cites the high-saturated fat atherogenic d iet, obesity, and sedentary lifestyle as the underlying issues to address in a lifestyle approac h /square4 Recommends a program of therapeutic lifestyle chan ge (TLC) including: o keeping trans fatty acid intake as low as possible , o increasing viscous fiber and plant stanol/sterol e sters to reduce LDL-C o de-emphasizing total fat and focusing on the kinds of fat o increasing physical activity, o weight loss in overweight, o increasing fish and omega-3 fatty acids, o referral to RD or other qualified nutritionist for medical nutrition therapy. In the Women's Health Study, lower levels of physic al activity and higher levels of BMI were independently associated with adverse levels of nea rly all lipid and inflammatory biomarkers. A high Lifestyle Medicine Review American College of Preventive Medicine 23 BMI was more strongly related to adverse cardiovasc ular biomarker levels than physical inactivity. However, within BMI categories, physical activity w as generally associated with more favorable cardiovascular biomarker levels than inactivity. [7 9] Lifestyle Interventions: A Cochrane review of 31 RCTs of treatments targetin g HDL cholesterol showed that currently available therapeutic and lifestyle strategies, whe n optimized, can increase HDL-C levels by 20% to 30%. [80] Diet: Saturated and trans fatty acid intakes are directly related to LDL cholesterol levels. [81,82] /square4 Replacing saturated fat intake with good fats such as omega-3 fatty acids and monounsaturated fatty acids can lower LDL while raising HDL levels. [82] The DASH diet, developed for blood pressure control , also improves lipid levels. [83] /square4 An 8 week RCT of patients with elevated cholestero l levels, reduced total cholesterol relative to controls by 13.7 mg/dL, LDL by 10.7 mg/dL, and HDL by 3.7 mg/dL (all P < 0.0001), with no change in triglycerides. Weight was maintained. /square4 Changes were greater in men than women, no differe nces by race. A RCT of the ATP-III recommended diet (low saturate d fat with plant sterols and viscous fibers) against a statin drug and control group in hyperlip idemic adults showed that LDL was reduced by 29% in the diet group vs. 31% with drug therapy and 8% in control. [84] Plant stanols/sterol intakes of 2 g per day can lower LDL cholesterol levels by up to 15% in addition to diet and lifestyle modification. [85] /square4 Soluble or viscous fibers (notably \u00df-glucan and pectin) modestly reduce LDL cholesterol levels beyond those achieved by a diet low in saturated and trans fatty acids and cholesterol alone. [86] Whole-grain intake has been shown to be inversely a ssociated with total and LDL cholesterol in the Framingham Offspring Study. [87] For High Triglycerides: A meta-analysis showed that low-carbohydrate diets resulted in greater improvements in triglyceride and HDL cholesterol concentrations than low-fat diets; however, LDL cholesterol was si gnificantly higher on the low-carbohydrate diets [88]. /square4 Reducing simple and refined sugars and alcohol can also reduce triglycerides. Weight loss: A meta-analysis of 65 RCTs showed that weight loss resulted in an average reduction in LDL cholesterol level of 15 mg/dL and triglyceride leve l of 26 mg/dL. [89] /square4 A meta-analysis of 47 RCTs showed that weight loss resulted in an average increase in HDL cholesterol of 1 mg/dL. /square4 For every 7 pounds of weight loss in overweight, a n increase in HDL of 1 mg/dL has been shown. [90,91] Exercise -- All Dose-response relationships between exercise volume and blood lipid changes suggest that exercise can favorably alter blood lipids at traini ng volumes of 15 to 20 miles per week of brisk walking or jogging that expend between 1200 to 2200 kcal/wk. This range of weekly energy expenditure is associated with 2 to 3 mg/dl increas es in HDL-C and triglyceride reductions of 8 to 20 mg/dl. [92] /square4 Evidence from cross-sectional studies indicates th at greater changes in HDL-C levels can be expected with additional increases in exercise trai ning volume. /square4 Exercise training has little effect on total or LD L cholesterol. Exercise - Type 2 diabetes Lifestyle Medicine Review American College of Preventive Medicine 24 A meta-analysis of RCTs that examined the effects o f 8 weeks or more of aerobic exercise on lipids and lipoproteins in adults with Type 2 diabetes yie lded 7 studies. [93] /square4 A statistically significant reduction of about 5% was found for LDL-C, whereas no statistically significant improvements were found for TC, HDL-C, TC/HDL-C or TG. Exercise - Metabolic Syndrome Systematic review and meta-analysis evidence indica tes that long-term, moderate to moderately vigorous intensity exercise training, even in the a bsence of weight loss, improves the dyslipidemic profile by raising HDL-cholesterol and lowering tri glycerides in overweight and obese adults with characteristics of the metabolic syndrome. [94] Exercise - CVD A meta-analysis to examine the effects of aerobic e xercise on lipids and lipoproteins in adults with cardiovascular disease (CVD) included 10 studies re presenting 1,260 subjects (580 exercise, 680 control). [95] /square4 There was a statistically significant increase of 9% in HDL-C (+3.7 mg/dL) and a statistically significant decrease of 11% in TG (-19.3 mg/dL), bu t Women meta-analysis of the effects of aerobic exercise on lipids and lipoproteins in women showed significant improvements in observed and TG, whereas an increase of 3% was observed for HDL- C. Aerobic exercise is efficacious for increasing HDL-C and decreasing TC, LDL-C, and TG i n women. Smoking Cessation: /square4 Quitting smoking has been shown to raise HDL by as much as 7-20 mg/dL. [97,98] D. METABOLIC SYNDROME / IMPAIRED GLUCOSE TOLERANCE The most indisputable fact about the Metabolic Synd rome is the importance of lifestyle changes in managing it. According to the NCEP ATP III - the p resence of the syndrome is an indication for intensive lifestyle modification. [99] /square4 Weight loss, increased physical activity, and an a nti-atherogenic diet can improve all of the metabolic abnormalities without pharmaceutical inte rvention. [100] Lifestyle Intervention The initial therapeutic approach for the MetS is to reverse the root causes - atherogenic diet, sedentary lifestyle, and overweight or obesity. [1 01] /square4 A review of RCTs with at least 6 months follow-up yielded 3 studies based on lifestyle interventions, 5 studies based on drug therapy, and 3 studies based on laparoscopic weight- reduction surgery. /square4 The striking resolution of the metabolic syndrome with weight-reduction surgery (93%) compared with lifestyle (25%) and drugs (19%) strongly sugge sts that obesity is the driving force. There is abundant evidence that a lifestyle approac h can reduce the likelihood of developing type 2 diabetes, along with a modest reduction in cardiova scular disease risk factors. [102] /square4 This has led the ADA to support lifestyle modifica tion as the best method of treating prediabetes. [103] A meta-analysis of lifestyle interventions reduced diabetes by approximately one-half vs. pharmacologic interventions by approximately one-th ird. [104] /square4 The two largest studies, Finnish Diabetes Preventi on Study (DPS) [105] and the U.S. Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) [106], both reduced develo pment of diabetes by 58%. /square4 DPP evaluated a lifestyle approach to prevent Type 2 diabetes in obese -- was stopped early because results were indisputable: [106] Lifestyle Medicine Review American College of Preventive Medicine 25 o 2 years -- 5% of lifestyle group vs. 22% of contro l developed diabetes, o 4 years -- 20% (lifestyle) vs. 37% (control) devel oped diabetes. /square4 Finnish DPS evaluated diet and exercise interventi on in people with IGT. /square4 After 6 years, fewer than 20% of diet/exercise gro up vs. greater than 40% of control developed type 2 diabetes. [105] A Cochrane review of the effects of exercise or exe rcise plus diet for preventing type 2 diabetes mellitus in patients with IGT or MetS included 8 tr ials of exercise plus diet, and 2 studies of diet o nly or exercise only. [107] /square4 Exercise plus diet interventions reduced the risk of diabetes compared with standard recommendations by 37% over a follow-up of one to s ix years. /square4 Exercise and diet interventions had a modest effec t on blood lipids, but improved systolic and diastolic blood pressure levels (-4 mmHg and -2 mmH g, respectively). /square4 No significant effects on diabetes incidence were observed with exercise or diet only. Another analysis found that moderate-intensity life style interventions can delay type 2 diabetes by an average of 11 years and reduce the number of new ca ses by 20%. This is much greater than what can be achieved with pharmacotherapy (delayed onset by 3 years, reduced cases by 8%). [108] There is growing evidence of the impact on the clin ical status of patients with the syndrome. /square4 A significant reduction in prevalence of metabolic syndrome (OR 0.6) and abdominal obesity (0.5) were observed in the Finnish Diabetes Prevent ion Study. [109] /square4 A focused lifestyle intervention carried out by tr ained professionals was compared to standard unstructured information given by family physicians . The result: after one year, the lifestyle intervention significantly reduced the MetS (OR = 0 .3), as well as central obesity (OR = 0.3), hypertriglyceridemia (OR = 0.5), and diabetes (OR = 0.2). [110] /square4 The combination of diet and exercise interventions was significantly more effective than either diet or exercise alone in the treatment of the meta bolic syndrome after a one year study. Two out three cases were reversed with the combination vs. only about 1 in 3 in each of the other groups. [111] The power of a lifestyle intervention was seen in a small study from the Pritikin Longevity Center. [112] /square4 Obese men were placed on a highly controlled low-f at (12-15%), high-unrefined carbohydrate, high-fiber, (> 40 gm) diet with daily aerobic exerc ise (45-60 min) for 3 weeks. /square4 After 3 wk, there were significant reductions in B MI, all serum lipids and lipid ratios, fasting glucose, insulin, insulin resistance, oxidative str ess, inflammation, chemotaxis, and cell adhesion. /square4 There was a 50% reduction in the metabolic syndrom e post-intervention. Analysis of published data along with Kaiser Perman ente administrative data has shown that, compared with no prevention program, the DPP lifest yle approach can reduce a high-risk person's 30-year likelihood of developing diabetes from abou t 72% to 61%, the chance of a serious complication from about 38% to 30%, and the chance of dying of a complication of diabetes from about 14% to 11%. [113] /square4 Metformin would deliver about a third of the long- term benefits achievable by lifestyle. Exercise, Physical Activity and Fitness Low cardiorespiratory fitness is a strong and independent predictor of incident metabolic syn drome in women and men. Age-adjusted incidence rates were s ignificantly lower (linear trend, P<0.001) across incremental thirds of fitness in men and women -- 1.0, 0.74, and 0.47 in men; and 1.0, 0.80, and 0.37 in women. [114] Exercise has many positive effects in people with M etS - improved insulin action, glucose metabolism, aerobic metabolism, mitochondrial densi ty, and respiratory chain proteins. [115] RCT evidence shows that exercise training in people with the MS or IGT: [116,117] /square4 Increases insulin sensitivity, Lifestyle Medicine Review American College of Preventive Medicine 26 /square4 Decreases blood pressure, if elevated, /square4 Reduces triglycerides, increases HDL, /square4 Reduces inflammation, /square4 Improves endothelial function [117] Almost all physical activity has a positive effect on insulin action, but moderate intensity, daily ac tivity seems best. A significant part of the positive eff ect comes from the last bout of activity. [118] T his is because the effect on insulin sensitivity lasts 24 to 48 hours. /square4 30 minutes brisk walking 3-7 times per week over 6 months reversed insulin resistance in sedentary insulin resistant individuals with no cha nge in diet or weight. [119] /square4 Small increases in activity and fitness improved c lustered metabolic risk in the ProActive cohort of at-risk individuals. [120] /square4 Both an increase in overall physical activity and an increase in cardiorespiratory fitness have been shown to improve the entire cluster of metabol ic abnormalities. [116] /square4 Adding some resistance exercise to aerobic exercis e can provide additional benefits. [121] o A modest amount of moderate-intensity exercise, wi th no change in diet, significantly improved the MetS; increasing the volume of exercis e, i.e., more than 30 minutes per day, had greater benefits than increasing the intensity of exercise. [122] Just becoming less sedentary has a positive effect on the syndrome. /square4 The Australian Diabetes, Obesity and Lifestyle stu dy showed that avoiding prolonged periods of sedentary time, especially sitting, has a favorable effect on waist circumference, BMI, triglycerides, and 2-h plasma glucose. [123] /square4 The Nurses' Health Study showed the importance of both reducing sedentary activity and increasing physical activity. Sedentary behaviors, especially TV watching, were associated with significantly elevated risk of obesity and type 2 d iabetes, whereas even light to moderate activity was associated with substantially lower risk. [124 ] Diet Changes The epidemic of the Metabolic Syndrome has been see n by some as the unwanted result of the dietary low fat crusade that has dominated the past 50 years. [125] /square4 Fat intake has dropped but obesity and the metabol ic syndrome have risen. /square4 The problem is that low fat diets tend to be high in carbohydrates, and there is evidence that such diets may increase triglycerides and reduce HD L in susceptible people. [126] /square4 The 2006 AHA scientific statement on diet and life style recommendations recommends a moderate fat intake for the metabolic syndrome. [1 27] There is no single diet currently recommended for p eople with the Metabolic Syndrome , BUT there is evidence to support a Mediterranean style diet as t he best approach. [101] /square4 A systematic review of 35 studies of the effects o f the Mediterranean diet showed favorable effects on lipoprotein levels, endothelial vasodila tation, insulin resistance, metabolic syndrome, antioxidant capacity, myocardial and cardiovascular mortality, and cancer incidence in obese patients and in those with previous myocardial infa rction. [128] /square4 Analyses from the Nurses' Health Study suggest tha t over 80% of coronary heart disease, 70% of stroke, and 90% of type 2 diabetes can be avoide d by healthy food choices that are consistent with the traditional Mediterranean diet, along with regular physical activity and not smoking. [129] /square4 A Mediterranean style diet reduced the prevalence of the syndrome by nearly 50% over a low fat diet. [130] /square4 The Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (DASH) d iet, which is similar to a Mediterranean diet, reduced the prevalence of the metabolic syndr ome by 35% compared with a control diet. [131] /square4 A dietary pattern that included frequent intake of vegetables, fruits, fish, pasta and rice and low intake of fried foods, sausages, fried fish, and po tatoes was associated with a better metabolic profile. [132] There is growing evidence that the type of fat in t he diet plays an important role in the development of insulin resistance. [133] Lifestyle Medicine Review American College of Preventive Medicine 27 /square4 Higher levels of saturated fats impair the action of insulin, while polyunsaturated fatty acids, especially omega-3 and -6, improve insulin sensitiv ity, hence the beneficial effects of adding a fish oil supplement. /square4 Omega-3 fatty acids in fish oils help reduce trigl ycerides and increase HDL, and have the added benefit of antioxidant properties. Substituting whole grains for refined grains in the same hypocaloric diet in people with metabolic syndrome resulted in a significantly greater decrea se in percentage body fat in the abdominal region, and a significantly greater reduction in inflammati on. [134] /square4 Increased whole grain and cereal fiber intake was also associated with a reduced risk of developing the metabolic syndrome in the Framingham Offspring Study. [135] In middle-aged adults, soft drink consumption is as sociated with a higher prevalence and incidence of multiple metabolic risk factors. Consumption of 1 soft drink per day was associated with nearly 1.5 times the risk of developing metabolic syndrome . [136] /square4 Emerging evidence also suggests that increased con sumption of fructose may also be a factor in the growing rates of obesity and the metabolic synd rome. [137] The Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) stud y found that long term consumption of a Western dietary pattern, especially including meat, fried foods, and diet soda, increased the risk of developing the Metabolic Syndrome. [138] /square4 The Whitehall II study confirmed this -- a dietary pattern with high consumption of diet soft drinks, onions, sugar-sweetened beverages, burgers and sausages, cr isps and other snacks, and white bread and low consumption of high-fiber breakfast cereals, jam, French dressing/vinaigrette, and whole wheat bread was ass ociated with the development of insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. [139] Weight Loss: Weight loss has a huge impact in improving the risk factors of the metabolic syndrome. Several studies have shown that losing just 7% to 10% of in itial body weight is sufficient to improve waist circumference, elevated triglycerides and low HDL-c holesterol, trunk fat, and plasma glucose. [140] E. TYPE 2 DIABETES A growing body of evidence shows that lifestyle int erventions are a critical adjunct to the management of type 2 diabetes - improves glycemic c ontrol, slows progression of the disease, and minimizes the risk of developing complications. [1 41,142] /square4 With the high risk for CVD, aggressive management of CVD risk factors is imperative. [143] Lifestyle Intervention: The Look AHEAD (Action for Health in Diabetes) tria l involved an intensive lifestyle intervention in type 2 diabetics, most also with the MetS. [144] /square4 Intervention involved group and individual counsel ing to achieve weight loss through decreased caloric intake and increased physical activity. /square4 1-year outcomes included 8.6% weight loss, 21% imp rovement in fitness, and 0.7% reduction in A1C (from a baseline of 7.3%), as well as improvements in blood pressure, triglycerid es and HDL cholesterol. A short-term (3 wk) lifestyle intervention showed h ow quickly metabolic changes can occur with lifestyle modifications. [145] /square4 However, it was in a tightly controlled environmen t (the Pritikin Longevity Center). /square4 A high-fiber (> 40 gm), low-fat diet with daily ae robic exercise led to significant improvements in total cholesterol (- 40 mg/dL), LDL (- 27 mg/dL), f asting glucose (- 31 mg/dL), fasting insulin (- 10 mcU/ml), insulin resistance, as well as indicators of oxidative stress, inflammation, and endothelial function in men with type 2 diabetes an d the metabolic syndrome. Exercise, Physical Activity and Fitness: Lifestyle Medicine Review American College of Preventive Medicine 28 Low cardiorespiratory fitness has been shown to be a powerful and independent predictor of mortality in people with diabetes. The Aerobics Ce nter Longitudinal Study showed that low fit men with T2DM have twice the mortality risk of moderate ly fit men. [146] /square4 The Nurse's Health Study found an inverse relation between hours per week of moderate to vigorous activity and risk for CVD events in women with T2DM (> 4 hrs/wk, nearly half the risk). [147] /square4 Walking at least 2 hours a week was shown to reduc e the chance of premature death from all causes or cardiovascular disease in diabetics by 34 % to 54%. [148] A systematic review of the effects of exercise on f itness in Type 2 diabetics found a 12% increase in VO 2max in exercise groups vs. a 1% decrease in control groups. [149] /square4 Higher exercise intensities produced larger improv ements in VO(2max) and greater improvement in HbA1c compared to interventions that tested larger exercise volume. Effect on Control: A 2001 meta-analysis of 12 aerobic exercise studies with no changes in diet in people with Type 2 diabetes found a modest reduction in A1c of 0.7%, i ndependent of any change in body weight. [150] /square4 Increasing exercise intensity had a greater effect than increasing duration or frequency of exercise. /square4 This led the ADA to recommend including some vigor ous exercise in interventions for glycemic control in those without contraindications. [151] /square4 Adding some resistance exercise to an aerobic prog ram has been shown to significantly improve glucose control and insulin sensitivity over an aer obic program alone. [152] A later meta-analysis (2006) of the effects of diff erent modes of exercise training on glucose control and risk factors for complications in Type 2 diabet ics found trivial differences among aerobic, resistance, and combined training on HbA(1c); for t raining lasting 12 weeks, the overall effect was a modest reduction of 0.8, similar to dietary, drug, and insulin treatment. [153] /square4 Combined training was generally superior to either aerobic or resistance training alone. A 2006 Cochrane review of 14 RCTs of the effects of exercise in type 2 diabetes mellitus found that the exercise interventions significantly improved g lycemic control (decrease in hemoglobin A1c levels of 0.6%). [154] /square4 Exercise significantly increased insulin response, and decreased plasma triglycerides. This was associated with a reduction in visceral and subcuta neous adipose tissue. No adverse effects were reported. A significant correlation has been observed between insulin sensitivity and the average number of steps taken in a day. The improved effectiveness of insulin is attributable, at least in part, to increases in GLUT4 protein, IRS1 and PI3-kinase pro tein in skeletal muscle. [155] Diet NHANES 1999-2002 data showed that diabetic patients treated by diet alone had the best glycemic control (66% in good control vs. 39% overall). [15 6] In terms of diet changes: [157] /square4 No single diet best for all diabetic patients. /square4 High protein diets (> 20%) are not recommended. /square4 A moderate carbohydrate intake (45-65% of caloric intake) is recommended, no less than 130 grams daily. For glucose control, a focus on total carbohydrates , whatever the source, is most effective; however, emphasis should be on carbohydrates from vegetables , legumes, whole grains, and fruits for fiber and nutrient density; foods high in sugar are usual ly nutritionally weak. [158,159] The strongest evidence supports an increased intake of whole grains and dietary fiber to improve insulin sensitivity and reduce the risk of complica tions. [160-165] Lifestyle Medicine Review American College of Preventive Medicine 29 /square4 While there is insufficient evidence to recommend a low GI or GL diet for primary prevention, there is evidence that it may assist the management of type 2 diabetes; low GI foods with high nutrient densities are encouraged. [166-168] /square4 Includes legumes, whole oats, apples, pumpernickel bread, low fat dairy, whole grain pasta, grapefruit and yams. /square4 Replacing saturated fats with monounsaturated fats , polyunsaturated fats or carbohydrates has been shown to improve lipid profiles in diabetic pa tients. [168] o Emphasis on MUFA is particularly beneficial in tho se who respond to higher carbohydrate intakes with increased triglycerides F. CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE A systematic review found that 4 lifestyle changes can affect mortality risk in CVD patients: [169] /square4 smoking cessation -- 95% CI, 0.58 to 0.71), /square4 increased physical activity -- a 24% reduction in mortality risk (RR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.59 to 0.98), /square4 moderate alcohol use -- a 20% reduction in mortali ty risk (RR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.78 to 0.83), and /square4 dietary changes -- a 44% reduction in mortality ri sk (RR, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.42 to 0.74). A Cochrane review of 63 RCT of the effectiveness of secondary cardiac prevention programs with and without exercise components showed that a wide variety of secondary prevention programs improve health outcomes in patients with coronary d isease. [170] /square4 The summary risk ratio for all-cause mortality was 0.97 at 12 months, but 0.53 at 24 months. /square4 For recurrent MI, it was 0.83 at 12 months. Effec ts were similar for programs that included risk factor education or counseling with or without a st ructured exercise component, and for programs that were solely exercise-based. A review of literature examining interventions to a ssist patients in achieving risk factor reductions through lifestyle change after myocardial infarctio n or coronary artery revascularization found that evidence supports: frequent follow-up, intensive d iet changes, individualized and group exercise, coaching, group meetings, education on lifestyle mo dification and behavior change, and formal cardiac rehabilitation programs. [171] Lifestyle Interventions: The Lifestyle Heart Trial (Ornish) provided conclus ive evidence that intensive lifestyle changes can regress coronary atherosclerosis. [172] /square4 Program included a 10% fat - whole food - vegetari an diet, aerobic exercise, stress management training, smoking cessation, and group psychosocial support. /square4 At one year, 23 of 28 patients experienced regress ion. [172] /square4 At 5 year follow-up of 48 patients with moderate t o severe CAD randomized to lifestyle change or usual-care: [173] o Average stenosis diameter decreased by 8% in lifes tyle group vs. a 28% increase with usual care. o 25 new events occurred in lifestyle group vs. 45 i n usual care group (with 8 fewer patients). The Multicenter Lifestyle Demonstration Project sho wed that significant improvements in diet (low fat, whole foods, plant-based), exercise, stress ma nagement, and social support can be achieved and maintained in heart disease patients, especiall y with spousal participation. [174] /square4 The program resulted in significant improvements i n medical (e.g., plasma lipids, blood pressure, body weight, exercise capacity) and psychosocial (e .g., quality of life) outcomes. Diet Changes: A Mediterranean diet pattern has been shown to be a n effective adjunct to pharmacotherapy for secondary prevention. The focus on good fats has b een suggested to be more effective than simply reducing total fat intake. [175,176] /square4 The Lyon Diet Heart Study compared a Mediterranean -type diet with a \"Western\" diet following an initial MI. [177] Lifestyle Medicine Review American College of Preventive Medicine 30 /square4 At 4 year follow-up, there was a 32% reduction in cardiac death and nonfatal MI in the Mediterranean diet group: o Cardiac death/nonfatal MI - 14 events vs. 44 in th e Western diet group, o Unstable angina, stroke, heart failure, pulmonary or peripheral embolism - 27 events vs. 90, and o Hospital admissions - 95 events vs. 180 Omega-3 fatty acids found primarily in certain cold water fish and flax are good fats and found to be protect against CHD events, including sudden death, in those with CHD. [178] /square4 Modest fish consumption of 1-2 servings per week o f species rich in omega-3 fatty acids can reduce CHD death by 36% and total mortality by 17%. [179] /square4 The consumption of 2 servings (about 8 oz) per week of fish high in EPA and DHA is associated with a reduced risk of both sudden death and death from coronary artery disease in adults. [180,181] Smoking Cessation: Smoking promotes the progression of CVD and, in CAD patients, is an important predictor of future CV events. [182] Several studies have shown that quitting improves l ongevity and reduces recurrent events. [183] /square4 A systematic review of cohort studies found that s moking cessation was associated with a 36% reduction in mortality risk in CAD patients. [169] /square4 Estimated to increase life expectancy by 2.8 years for men, 2.3 years for women. [184] /square4 Risk declines rapidly, approaching that of a nonsm oker in about 3 years. [185] /square4 According to the USPSTF, a combination of long-ter m behavioral support and pharmacologic therapy with bupropion, with or without NRT, should be offered to all CVD patients. [186] A systematic review of the effects of individual co unseling on smoking cessation showed that individual counseling for 6 months or longer result ed in a 1.6 times greater likelihood of successful cessation. [187] Weight Loss: Although the association between obesity and CVD is well established, there have been no large scale RCTs of the effects of weight loss on cardiov ascular outcomes. [188,189] /square4 Most of the evidence on the CV benefits of weight reduction has been obtained from observational studies where weight loss was a secon dary end point. /square4 Several studies show that weight loss in overweigh t or obese reduces CVD risk factors. Caloric reduction of 500 kcal/d or more is recommen ded for most overweight patients with CVD until they reach their ideal body weight. [190] Exercise: Several systematic reviews have shown the importanc e of exercise for patients with CVD. [191] /square4 An energy expenditure of about 1600 kcals per week has been found to be effective in halting the progression of CAD, and 2200 kcals per week has been shown to be associated with plaque reduction in patients with atherosclerotic heart di sease. [192,193] A systematic review of 48 RCTs (8940 patients) inve stigating the effectiveness of exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation showed that, compared with u sual care, exercise rehab was associated with reduced all-cause mortality (OR = 0.80) and cardiac mortality (OR = 0.74), greater reductions in total cholesterol level (WMD, -14.3 mg/dL), triglyceride level (WMD, -20.4 mg/dL]), and systolic blood pressure (WMD, -3.2 mm Hg); and lower rates of self -reported smoking (OR = 0.64). [194] /square4 No significant differences in the rates of nonfata l myocardial infarction and revascularization, or changes in high- and LDL cholesterol levels and dia stolic pressure, or health-related quality of life were observed. Lifestyle Medicine Review American College of Preventive Medicine 31 A prospective study of 773 men with known CAD follo wed for 5 years showed that those who engaged in light and moderate levels of activity ha d 58% and 53% lower mortality risks than those who engaged in minimal or no activity. [195] A RCT involving 62 patients with angiographically p roven CAD randomized to regular physical exercise or usual care showed that after 1 year, at herosclerosis progressed in those who exercised the least (mean energy expended, 1000 kcal/wk), whi le it modestly regressed in those who exercised the most (mean, 2200 kcal/wk). [196] Exercise Recommendations: [197] /square4 An Expert Working Group of the National Heart Foun dation of Australia reviewed the evidence for exercise with CVD since the US Surgeon General' s Report on Physical Activity and Health in 1996. The Expert Working Group recommended that: pe ople with established clinically stable cardiovascular disease should aim to achieve 30 min utes or more of moderate intensity physical activity on most, if not all, days of the week; les s intense and even shorter bouts of activity with more rest periods for those with advanced CVD; and regular low-to-moderate level resistance activity, initially under the supervision of an exe rcise professional, is encouraged. /square4 Benefits for people with CVD include augmented phy siological functioning, lessening of cardiovascular symptoms, enhanced quality of life, improved coronary risk profile, superior muscular fitness and, for survivors of acute MI, lo wer mortality. /square4 The greatest potential for benefit is in those peo ple who were least active before beginning regular physical activity, and this benefit may be achieved even at relatively low levels of physical activity. Excessive Alcohol Consumption: A number of studies have shown that reducing excess ive alcohol consumption to a moderate level reduces the risk of a variety of vascular diseases, including MI, PVD, and sudden cardiac death. [198] Psychosocial Risk: A number of psychological factors, including chroni c hostility, social isolation, and lack of social support have been linked to poorer outcomes in pati ents with CHD. /square4 A meta-analysis of 37 smaller studies showed that stress management and health education in patients with CHD may reduce both recurrent MI and cardiac death by up to a third. [199] /square4 But, this evidence is far from conclusive. [200] G. STROKE Exercise - Strengthening High-intensity resistance training has traditionall y been excluded from stroke rehabilitation programs because of concern that high-exertion activity will increase spasticity. /square4 A systematic review of 11 studies that met the cri teria to determine the effects of resistance training on functional outcomes and spasticity post -stroke found that resistance training can increase strength, gait speed, and functional outco mes and improve quality of life without exacerbating the risk of spasticity. [201] /square4 Another systematic review of 15 RCTs found that st rengthening interventions had a small positive effect on both strength and activity in st roke patients with no increase in spasticity. [202 ] Exercise - Aerobic A Cochrane review of aerobic exercise in stroke pat ients showed a consistent positive effect on aerobic capacity, regardless of the stage of recove ry. [203] /square4 Peak VO2, peak workload, walking velocity and walk ing endurance were all significantly improved. Authors concluded that aerobic exercise should be an important component of rehabilitation in people with mild and moderate str oke. H. HEART FAILURE Exercise Lifestyle Medicine Review American College of Preventive Medicine 32 A systematic review of 69 RCTs of exercise interven tions for HF suggested that exercise might slow the progression of HF. [204] Another systematic review of home-based exercise pr ograms for people with chronic heart failure produced 10 RCTs with 648 participants. [205] /square4 Programs increased 6-min walking distance by an av erage of 41 m and peak VO2 by 2.71 ml/kg/min more than usual activity. /square4 It could be valuable for those without access to h ospital-based exercise. A modified Philadelphia Panel rating method to eval uate the evidence supporting exercise interventions in patients with congestive heart fai lure (CHF) used a systematic review of RCTs and CCTs. [206] /square4 Aerobic exercise was shown to improve VO2 max, dys pnea, work capacity, and left ventricular function. Resistance exercise was shown to improve left ventricular function, peak lactate levels, muscle strength, and muscle endurance. A meta-analysis (14 RCTs) of the effect of exercise training on left ventricular (LV) remodeling in heart failure found that aerobic training reverses LV remodeling in clinically stable individuals. [20 7] /square4 Ejection fraction significantly improved (WMD = 2. 59%), as did end-diastolic volume (WMD = - 11.49 ml) and end-systolic volume (WMD = -12.87 ml) . /square4 Adding strength training did not improve outcomes further. Another systematic review (35 RCTs) of the effect o f exercise training on cardiac outcomes with CHF found significant improvements in systolic blood pr essure, heart rate, cardiac output, peak oxygen uptake, anaerobic threshold, and 6-min walking test . [208] /square4 The Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionna ire improved by an average of 9.7 points. /square4 Exercise training has clinically important effects on exercise capacity and HRQL, and may have small positive effects on cardiac performance durin g exercise. A 2004 Cochrane review (29 RCTs) investigated the e ffectiveness of exercise-based interventions compared with usual medical care on the mortality, morbidity, exercise capacity and health related quality of life, of patients with heart failure fou nd that exercise training significantly increased VO 2max by 2.16 ml/kg/min, exercise duration increased by 2.38 minutes, work capacity by 15.1 Watts and distance on the six minute walk by 41 met ers. [209] /square4 HRQoL improved in 7 of 9 trials that measured this outcome. A larger systematic review of 81 studies (30 RCTs, 9 crossover, 37 longitudinal cohort, and 5 nonrandomized controlled trials) found an average 1 7% increase in peak oxygen consumption in 40 aerobic training studies, 15% in 13 studies of comb ined aerobic and strength training, and 16% in the one study of inspiratory training. [210] /square4 Exercise training was shown to be safe and effecti ve in patients with heart failure; there were no reports of deaths directly related to exercise duri ng more than 60,000 patient-hours of exercise training. A meta-analysis of the effect of exercise training on survival in HF patients (9 datasets with 801 patients) found that during a mean follow up of nea rly 2 years there was an overall reduction in mortality: 88 (22%) deaths in the exercise arm vs. 105 (26%) in the control arm. [211] /square4 Exercise training significantly reduced mortality (hazard ratio 0.65). /square4 The secondary end point of death or admission to h ospital was also reduced (0.72). I. PERIPHERAL ARTERIAL DISEASE (PAD) Exercise A Cochrane review yielded 22 trials of exercise the rapy for leg pain on walking associated with intermittent claudication. [212] /square4 Compared with usual care or placebo, exercise sign ificantly improved maximal walking time: mean difference (MD) 5.12 minutes; with an overall improvement in walking ability of approximately 50% to 200%. Lifestyle Medicine Review American College of Preventive Medicine 33 /square4 Walking distances significantly improved: pain-fre e walking distance by 82 meters and maximum walking distance by 113 meters. Improvements persi sted for up to two years. An earlier Cochrane review (8 trials) of supervised versus non-supervised exercise therapy for people with intermittent claudication found that su pervised exercise therapy was more effective, with approximately 150 meters greater increase in walkin g distance. [213] Lifestyle Modification A systematic review of the effects of life-style mo dification on mortality and cardiovascular events i n patients with PAD found that despite the lack of RC T data, there is sufficient evidence to recommend some life-style modification as part of the overall approach to risk reduction in these patients. [21 4] /square4 There is compelling evidence to support smoking ce ssation, increased exercise and improved diet. J. CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE (COPD) Inspiratory Muscle Training and Exercise /square4 A summary of 16 meta-analyses of the effect of inspiratory muscle training (IMT) in pati ents with stable COPD showed that targeted inspiratory muscle training significantly improves inspiratory muscle strength, peak inspiratory flow rate, inspir atory muscle endurance, exercise capacity, Borg Score for Respiratory Effort, dyspnea, and qua lity of life. [215] /square4 Combining targeted inspiratory muscle training wit h exercise and/or pulmonary rehabilitation led to greater improvements in inspiratory muscle stren gth and exercise tolerance than exercise alone. [216] Comprehensive Pulmonary Rehabilitation A systematic review of the effectiveness of disease -management programs for COPD showed that the disease-management programs significantly impro ved exercise capacity (32.2 m), decreased risk of hospitalization, and moderately improved health- related quality of life. All-cause mortality did n ot differ. [217] A systematic review of 31 RCTs of the impact of pul monary rehabilitation programs on health-related quality of life (QoL) and exercise capacity in pati ents with COPD showed significant improvements in dyspnea and fatigue, emotional function and patient s' control over their condition; improvements were moderately large and clinically significant. [ 218] /square4 The effect on exercise capacity was small and slig htly below the threshold of clinical significance for the six-minute walking distance (WMD: 48 m; n = 16 trials). Another systematic review (6 RCTs) of the effect of pulmonary rehabilitation (with or without education) on anxiety and depression in patients wi th COPD found that rehab programs with up to three sessions per week of supervised exercise, alo ng with education and psychosocial support, significantly reduced anxiety and depression more t han standard care. [219] /square4 Education alone and exercise training alone were n ot associated with significant reductions in either anxiety or depression. /square4 Comprehensive pulmonary rehabilitation was also as sociated with short-term gains in both disease-specific and generic HRQOL, not sustained a t 12 months. Self Management Self-management of COPD is aimed at teaching skills needed to carry out medical regimens specific to the disease, guide health behavior change, and p rovide emotional support for patients to control their disease and live functional lives. /square4 A Cochrane review of self-management programs for COPD combined 14 trials and showed a significant reduction in the probability of at leas t one hospital admission in patients receiving self - management education compared to usual care (OR 0.6 4). The one year NNT was 10 for patients with a 51% risk of exacerbation, to 24 for patients with a 13% risk of exacerbation. [220] /square4 A small but significant reduction was seen for dys pnea, but no significant effects were found for exacerbations, ER visits, lung function, exercise c apacity, or days lost from work. Lifestyle Medicine Review American College of Preventive Medicine 34 K. OSTEOARTHRITIS Osteoarthritis is generally undertreated, and funct ional consequences ignored. [221] /square4 Undertreatment contributes to poor QOL, can lead t o other serious co-morbidities, including depression, sleep disturbances, anxiety, fatigue, i mpaired ambulation, dementia, aphasia, and decreased socialization. [221] /square4 Patient misperceptions that prescribed activity wi ll exacerbate symptoms may lead to a cycle of inactivity, depression and anxiety and worsening sy mptoms. [222] /square4 Addressing knowledge and skill deficits, perceived lack of self efficacy, and social support may mitigate perceived distress and improve QOL. [222] Non-Pharmacological Approaches In developing evidence-based recommendations for th e management of hip and knee osteoarthritis (OA) an expert panel concluded that there is no sta tistically significant difference between non- pharmacological therapies and pharmacological thera pies. [223] /square4 a combination both. /square4 12 non-pharmacological modalities had sufficient e vidence to be recommended: education and self-management, regular telephone contact, referra l to a physical therapist, aerobic, muscle strengthening and water-based exercises, weight red uction, walking aids, knee braces, footwear and insoles, thermal modalities, transcutaneous ele ctrical nerve stimulation and acupuncture. Lifestyle interventions: Weight loss, appropriate exercise, and avoidance of repetitive joint stress all have a positive role i n management; may even decrease rate of progression. [221,224] /square4 Growing body of evidence supports this approach. [ 225] /square4 Pharmacotherapy does not tackle the underlying dis ease process, and may miss the mark in as many as half of patients, and concerns about safety are common. [226] /square4 An individualized approach based on each patient's unique biopsychosocial needs is crucial for successful management [227] Exercise: Is a \"powerful mainstay in the armamentarium of phy sicians\" [228] /square4 Optimal prescription not identified, but consensus is that any increase in lifestyle activity is good ; a variety of activities ranging from aerobics to re sistance to those emphasizing balance and ROM can reduce pain, improve mobility and QOL. [22 2] /square4 Low impact exercise is more effective in reducing pain. [229,230] /square4 Stretching without strengthening, as well as isome tric exercise is less effective. Adults with arthritis experience significant disabi lity and co-morbidities due to reduced physical activity. /square4 A meta-analysis of physical activity interventions in arthritis patients included 28 studies and showed moderate positive effects on physical activi ty behavior and small positive effects on pain and physical function outcomes. [231] /square4 Another systematic review of 6 scientific reviews and 10 RCTs on the effect of exercise on OA management concluded that the weight of the evidenc e supports the effectiveness of structured exercise programs (either strength training or aero bic exercise) in the management of in middle- aged and elderly subjects with OA. [232] Another systematic review of RCTs and CCTs on the l ong-term effectiveness of exercise therapy for osteoarthritis yielded 5 high-quality and 6 low-qua lity RCTs. [233] /square4 The positive post-treatment effects of exercise th erapy on pain and physical function are not sustained in the long term. /square4 However, when additional booster sessions are incl uded after the treatment period the beneficial effects on pain and physical function are more like ly to be maintained. /square4 Benefits are transient - need to be performed regu larly, 1-3 times/week; some evidence supports a minimum of 3 days per week for about 35 min [234] /square4 Group programs have been shown to enhance motivati on, support, and compliance over home- based programs [235], but a meta-analysis found bot h to be effective. [236] Lifestyle Medicine Review American College of Preventive Medicine 35 Exercise - Aquatic Group-based water exercise has been shown to result in significant improvement in pain and physical function with knee or hip OA [237] A Cochrane review of the effectiveness and safety o f aquatic-exercise in the treatment of knee and hip osteoarthritis yielded only 6 trials (800 parti cipants). [238] /square4 For combined knee and hip osteoarthritis, there wa s a small-to-moderate effect on function and a small-to-moderate effect on quality of life; no e vidence of effect on walking ability or stiffness immediately after end of treatment. /square4 Aquatic exercise appears to have some beneficial s hort-term effects for patients with hip and/or knee OA while no long-term effects have been docume nted. /square4 May be useful as the first part of a longer exerci se program for OA patients. A 1 year RCT found that group-based water exercise can produce significant reduction in pain and improvement in physical function in older adults wi th lower limb OA, and may be a useful adjunct in the management of hip and/or knee OA. [239] Exercise - Knee OA A Cochrane review and meta-analysis of 32 RCTs exam ining the effectiveness of land-based exercise (as opposed to water exercise) for OA of t he knee found a beneficial effect on both pain and physical function. [240] /square4 Results were better with more direct supervision, but remained significant and clinically relevant at lower levels of supervision; authors concluded t hat there is platinum level evidence that land- based therapeutic exercise has at least short term benefit in terms of reduced knee pain and improved physical function for people with knee OA. The magnitude of the treatment effect is comparable to estimates for NSAIDs. A review of 23 systematic reviews published between 2000 and 2007 on physical therapy interventions for patients with knee osteoarthritis concluded that there is high-quality evidence that exercise and weight reduction reduce pain and impro ve physical function in patients with osteoarthritis of the knee. [241] A meta-analysis of 16 studies reporting exercise an d/or self-management interventions for patients with knee OA found that exercise regimens can impro ve physical health and lessen the overall impact of OA. [242] /square4 Self-management programs significantly improved ps ychological outcomes only; the overall effect of OA was not significantly improved. Exercise - Hip OA A systematic review of evidence for the efficacy of exercise for hip OA from 9 RCTs that met the inclusion criteria found a beneficial effect of exe rcise with an effect size (ES) of -0.38. [243] /square4 The exercise benefit remained significant when onl y the better quality studies were included (ES of -0.46). /square4 Therapeutic exercise, especially with an element o f strengthening, is an efficacious treatment for hip OA. Exercise - Tai Chi /square4 A systematic review of controlled clinical trials that investigated the effectiveness of tai chi for osteoarthritis found 5 RCTs and 7 non-RCTs. [244] /square4 Two RCTs suggested improvement of physical functio n, while two other RCTs failed to do so. /square4 There is some encouraging evidence that tai chi ma y assist in pain control with knee OA. However, the evidence is not convincing for pain re duction or improvement of physical function. Activity Recommendations /square4 A Cochrane review of 72 reports arrived at the fol lowing evidence-based conclusions: [245] o OA patients in general can pursue a high level of physical activity, provided the activity is not painful and does not predispose to trauma (grad e B). Lifestyle Medicine Review American College of Preventive Medicine 36 o Radiographic or clinical OA is not a contraindicat ion to promoting activity in patients who have a sedentary lifestyle (grade C). o Exercises and other structured activities for heal th improvement have a favorable effect on pain and function in the sedentary knee OA patie nt, when performed at a frequency of one and three times per week (grade B). o There is no scientific argument to support halting exercise in case of an OA flare-up (grade C). o The OA patient can continue to engage in recreatio nal sports as long as the activity does not cause pain (Grade C). o The OA patient who practices a sport at risk for j oint trauma should be encouraged to change sport (Grade C). o Factors such as high loads on the joint, unnatural body position, heavy lifting, climbing and jumping may contribute to knee and hip OA. o An occupational history should always be part of m anaging the OA patient (Grade B). Diet: No single diet prescription has been shown to be be st for OA; however, higher intakes of fruits and vegetables have been associated with reduced risk, thus should be recommended due to multiple other benefits to health. [246] Weight Loss: Weight loss in overweight patients is a key goal; 1 0 pounds of extra weight increases the force on the knee by 30-60 pounds each step; excess weight h as also been associated with higher rates of hand OA (suggesting a systemic factor as well). [22 1] /square4 Meta-analysis found that a 5% or greater weight re duction is associated with a significant reduction of pain and disability [247] /square4 The Arthritis, Diet, and Activity Promotion Trail (ADAPT) showed that modest weight loss (5%) combined with exercise is best approach [248] /square4 The combination improved functioning, pain, perfor mance, and endurance relative to either weight loss or exercise alone. /square4 Weight loss must include exercise to build strength, mobility, conf idence, joint stability, and muscle endurance /square4 Weight loss through exercise, with or without a hy pocaloric diet, improved symptoms and functioning in programs from 8 weeks to 6 months. [249-251] Unloading and Alignment Correction /square4 Reasonable evidence from RCTs suggests that therap ies to correct alignment across knee joint can improve pain and function [252] L. RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS Overall A review of the effectiveness of non-pharmacologica l treatment modalities for RA found that the evidence of effectiveness varies among the differen t modalities, with relatively strong support for exercise and self-management interventions, and mod est support for joint protection programs, specific orthoses and comprehensive care interventi ons. [253] /square4 However, few studies have compared different attri butes of non-pharmacological modalities or comprehensive care models for early RA, so the opti mal timing, intensity, duration and mode of delivery remain unclear. A Cochrane review of RCTs evaluating rehabilitation interventions for people with rheumatoid arthritis found that patient education and joint pr otection training using behavioral approaches; dynamic exercise therapy, hand exercises and hydrot herapy; and cognitive-behavioral therapy (in people with poorer psychological status) are effect ive in reducing pain and maintaining function over at least a one-year period. [254] A scientific committee evaluated the evidence from 198 publications, and arrived at four recommendations for nonpharmacological treatment of early RA: [255] Lifestyle Medicine Review American College of Preventive Medicine 37 (1) physical exercise and sports can be recommended ; muscle strength exercises are advisable; (2) metatarsal pain and/or foot alignment abnormali ties should be looked for regularly, and appropriate insoles prescribed if needed; (3) specific dietary measures and nutritional suppl ements are not indicated for early RA; (4) elimination diets, particularly with low intake s of dairy products, should be discouraged. Exercise -- All A systematic review of the effectiveness of exercis e interventions in improving disease-related characteristics in patients with rheumatoid arthrit is (RA) included 40 studies and found strong evidence that various types of exercise from low to high intensity are effective in improving disease- related characteristics and functional ability in R A patients. [256] Exercise - Tai Chi The major goals of treatment are to relieve pain, r educe inflammation, slow down or stop joint damage, prevent disability, and preserve or improve the person's sense of well-being and ability to function. /square4 Tai Chi has been recognized in China as an effecti ve arthritis therapy for centuries. /square4 A Cochrane systematic review of the effectiveness and safety of Tai Chi for people with RA found significant benefits on lower extremity range of motion, in particular ankle range of motion. The effect on pain was not reported. [257] M. CANCER - ALL Multi-component programs: Can reduce fatigue and associated symptoms. /square4 A systematic review of 57 RCTs investigating multi -component interventions for cancer-related fatigue and associated symptoms (vigor/vitality) fo und that exercise and psychological interventions both reduced fatigue, with no signifi cant differences between them. [258] /square4 Specifically, multimodal exercise and walking prog supportive- expressive, and cognitive-behavioral psychosocial i nterventions were most promising. Some evidence supports the positive effects of self -management programs and self-efficacy enhancing programs on health outcomes, exercise adh erence and later exercise behavior in cancer patients. [259] Exercise: Has many benefits for cancer patients. /square4 A 2007 review of the evidence of the effects of ex ercise on risk factors for adverse outcomes of cancer and its treatment showed that there is mount ing evidence that exercise improves fatigue, physical functioning, and cardio-respiratory fitnes s. [260] /square4 Preliminary evidence suggests that exercise also c ontributes to improvements in body weight and composition, metabolic risk factors, and immune function, and may even influence disease- free and overall survival in selected populations. A meta-analysis of exercise interventions for peopl e treated for cancer showed that exercise interventions resulted in small positive effects on health and well-being outcomes, including physical function, for symptoms other than fatigue, and for body composition. [261] /square4 More modest positive effect sizes were documented for mood, quality of life, and fatigue. Can help reduce fatigue. /square4 The strength of the evidence supporting exercise i n managing cancer-related fatigue is growing. [262] /square4 All patients with cancer should be encouraged to m aintain an optimum level of physical activity during and following cancer treatment. Patients wit h breast cancer and other selected patients should receive recommendations for moderate exercis e programs. A Cochrane review of 28 studies of the effects of p hysical activity in reducing cancer-related fatigue found that exercise was statistically more effectiv e than control interventions both during and following therapy. [263] Lifestyle Medicine Review American College of Preventive Medicine 38 /square4 Other reviews found more limited support for reduc ing fatigue, citing lack of research with heightened fatigue as an eligibility criterion. [26 4,265] Improves fitness and capacity. Evidence supports the positive effects of exercise on exercise capacity during and after completion of cancer treatment. [265] /square4 Evidence for the effectiveness of progressive resi stance training on muscle strength is also promising. /square4 A systematic review of physical activity intervent ions in cancer survivors during and after treatment found 22 high-quality studies that provid ed evidence of a small to moderate effect of physical activity interventions on cardiorespirator y fitness during and after treatment, physiologic outcomes and symptoms during treatment, and vigor p ost-treatment. [266] /square4 Regular physical activity has also been shown to b e associated with improved QOL and health status in cancer patients. [267] N. BREAST CANCER Exercise May improve survival. /square4 In breast cancer patients, physical activity equiv alent to walking at least an hour a week has been associated with improved survival compared wit h no exercise. [268] /square4 Greatest benefit was seen with 3-5 hours per week. Can improve function and quality of life. /square4 In women with breast cancer, a meta-analysis of 10 studies (N = 588) that met inclusion criteria, found that aerobic exercise significantly improved cardiopulmonary function and body composition. [269] A Cochrane review of 14 studies on the effects of e xercise on quality of life in women with breast cancer found that exercise significantly improved q uality of life. [270] /square4 It also led to significant improvements in physica l functioning, peak oxygen consumption and fatigue. Diet and weight control Can help improve breast cancer prognosis. [271] /square4 Several nutritional factors, notably vegetable/fru it intake and fat intake may modify the progression of disease and prognosis after the diag nosis of breast cancer. /square4 The majority of studies of vegetable and fruit int ake show a direct relationship with survival. /square4 On the other hand, nearly half of studies of dieta ry fat intake found an inverse association with survival. /square4 Overweight or obesity is associated with poorer pr ognosis in most studies. /square4 Treatment-related weight gain may also reduce dise ase-free survival and quality of life, while increasing the risk for co-morbidities. /square4 Healthy weight control with an emphasis on exercis e and a diet with adequate vegetables, fruit, whole grains, and low-fat dairy and low in saturate d fat may lower overall disease risk in breast ca patients. O. OSTEOPOROSIS Greatest known modifiable risk factor is excess wei ght; weight gain associated with development and progression of OA; can create a vicious cycle o f pain, inactivity and weight gain. An update of the evidence-based position statement of The North American Menopause Society (NAMS) in 2002 regarding the management of osteoporosis in postmen opausal women found that: [272] /square4 The primary goal of therapy is to prevent fracture s by slowing or stopping bone loss, maintaining bone strength, and minimizing or eliminating factor s that contribute to fractures. /square4 The most common risk factors for osteoporotic frac ture are advanced age, low bone mineral density, and previous fracture as an adult. Lifestyle Medicine Review American College of Preventive Medicine 39 /square4 Management focuses first on nonpharmacologic measu res, such as a balanced diet, adequate calcium and vitamin D intake, adequate exercise, sm oking cessation, avoidance of excessive alcohol intake, and fall prevention. /square4 Management strategies involve identifying those at risk of fracture, followed by reducing modifiable risk factors through lifestyle changes a nd, if indicated, pharmacologic therapy. Exercise: Resistance exercise can stimulate an increase in bo ne formation in younger adults and can slow bone loss in middle age. [273] A 6-month RCT showed that exercise training was eff ective in improving bone density in older women with low bone density. [274] /square4 A 2-year training program was also shown to be eff ective in attenuating the rate of bone loss in osteopenic women. [275] A systematic review of 28 RCTs of the effects of ex ercise on health related fitness in postmenopausal women included 16 trials that report ed the effects of exercise on BMD. [276] /square4 Based on these studies, early postmenopausal women would benefit from 30 minutes of daily moderate walking in one to three bouts combined wit h a resistance training program twice a week to preserve BMD and increase muscle strength. A Cochrane review of the effectiveness of exercise therapy at preventing bone loss and fractures in postmenopausal women yielded 18 RCTs. [277] /square4 Aerobics, weight bearing and resistance exercises were all effective on the BMD of the spine. /square4 The analyzed results showed walking to be effectiv e on both BMD of the spine and the hip. /square4 Aerobic exercise was effective in increasing BMD o f the wrist. Exercise - Walking A systematic review of 8 RCTs and non-RCTs of the e ffects of walking programs on bone mineral density (BMD) at the hip and spine in postmenopausa l women found no significant effect on lumbar spine bone density but significant positive effects at femoral neck. [278] Another meta-analysis of walking interventions in p ostmenopausal women and men and women aged 50 years and older found that walking had a si gnificant positive effect on lumbar BMD but not on the femur or the calcaneus. [279] /square4 Suggests that other forms of exercise be combined with walking for patients at risk for osteoporotic fracture. High Intensity Resistance Training - Postmenopausal Women A systematic review of the effects of progressive, high-intensity resistance training on bone mineral density (BMD) in postmenopausal women found that: [280] /square4 At the lumbar spine (LS), 14 RCT study groups were homogenous in demonstrating a significant increase in BMD of 0.006 g/cm(2). /square4 At the femoral neck (FN), contrast, there was m arked heterogeneity within 11 RCT study groups, but still a positive change in BMD of 0.010 g/cm(2). /square4 Subgroup analyses showed variability of BMD respon ses to resistance training based on participants' hormone therapy use. /square4 Treatment effects for study groups increasing all participants' calcium intake showed significant positive BMD changes at hip (P=0.007). Another systematic review of resistance exercise pr ograms in postmenopausal women yielded 20 studies and showed that weight training exercises w ere effective at increasing BMD of the spine and hip in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis. [281 ] /square4 The increases are site-specific and require high l oading with a training intensity of 70% to 90% of 1 RM for 8 to 12 repetitions of 2 to 3 sets perform ed over one year duration. High Intensity Resistance Training - Premenopausal Women Lifestyle Medicine Review American College of Preventive Medicine 40 A similar analysis in premenopausal women found tha t high-intensity progressive resistance training was effective in increasing absolute BMD at the lum bar spine but not the femoral neck. [282] /square4 The weighted mean difference (WMD) for six control led trials investigating the lumbar spine BMD change was 0.014 g/cm(2). /square4 In contrast, studies evaluating femoral neck BMD showed no significant BMD change (WMD 0.001 g/cm(2). /square4 The quality of included studies was quite low, so the modest treatment effects in premenopausal women may be biased and should be interpreted with caution. Women with functional hypothalamic amenorrhea /square4 Women with functional hypothalamic amenorrhea (FHA ) may not achieve peak bone mass (PBM), which increases the risk of stress fractures , and may increase the risk of osteoporotic fractures. /square4 A systematic review of RCTs, cross-sectional studi es, and case studies of the effects of pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventio ns on bone mineral density (BMD) or bone turnover in women with FHA showed that the most suc cessful, and indeed essential strategy for improving BMD in women with FHA is to increase calo ric intake such that body mass is increased and there is a resumption of menses. [283 ] P. DEPRESSION Exercise /square4 Exercise seems to improve depressive symptoms in p eople with depression, to a similar degree as cognitive therapy. /square4 A Cochrane review of exercise interventions for de pression yielded 25 RCTs that together showed a large clinical effect. However, when just the 3 highest quality trials were included the effect was only moderate. [284] /square4 A meta-analysis of the effects of exercise on depr ession in the elderly found that exercise was effective in treating depression and reducing depre ssive symptoms in the short-term. [285] /square4 An earlier systematic review and meta-regression a nalysis of the effectiveness of exercise as an intervention for depression concluded that, when co mpared with no treatment, exercise reduced symptoms of depression (-7.3 points on the Beck sca le); the effect was greater with shorter follow up. [286] Self Help A number of self-help interventions have promising evidence for reducing subthreshold depression. /square4 The evidence was evaluated in a systematic review of 38 interventions; the best evidence was for relaxation training, exercise, and pleasant act ivities (along with S-adenosylmethionine, St John's wort, bibliotherapy, computerized interventi ons, distraction, sleep deprivation, and light therapy). [287] /square4 A survey of patients found that many self-help str ategies rated as strongly as professionally recommended strategies, with exercise being rated e xtremely highly. [288] /square4 For patients who do not respond to initial medicat ion treatment, treatments such as exercise, light therapy, alternative medicines, and counselin g have demonstrated benefits over placebo and may enhance remission rates when used in combin ation with antidepressants. [289] Q. FIBROMYLAGIA Multi-Component Lifestyle Therapy There is growing evidence that a combination of int erventions (i.e., exercise combined with education and psychologically-based interventions) is the most promising means of managing patients with fibromyalgia (FM). [290] A systematic review of the efficacy of multicompone nt treatments (at least 1 educational or other psychological therapy with at least 1 exercise ther apy) yielded 9 RCTs (1,119 subjects) and found \"strong\" evidence for beneficial short-term effects on the key symptoms including reducing pain, fatigue, depressive symptoms, and limitations to he alth-related quality of life (HRQOL) and improved self-efficacy for pain control and physical fitness . [291] Lifestyle Medicine Review American College of Preventive Medicine 41 /square4 But only the positive effects on fitness were main tained in the long term (median follow-up 7 months). Exercise Most authors report a beneficial effect of aerobic exercise training for fibromyalgia patients with chronic pain or fatigue. [292] /square4 Muscular rehabilitation is useful for preventing d econditioning and the vicious cycle of pain, avoidance and inactivity behaviors, kinesiophobia, and psychological distress. A 2003 systematic review of exercise in patients wi th fibromyalgia found that low-intensity aerobic exercise, such as walking or pool exercise, can imp rove function, distress and symptoms. [293] /square4 Strength training can improve strength without exa cerbating symptoms. /square4 Patients tolerated low-intensity exercise well, bu t high-intensity exercise requires caution. In 2007 a Cochrane Review Group published a systema tic review of 34 studies found \"strong\" evidence for supervised aerobic exercise training o n physical capacity and FMS symptoms. [294] /square4 Strength training had benefits on some FMS symptom s, but too few studies /square4 A subsequent 2008 review of 6 aerobic studies prov ided \"moderate\" evidence that aerobic-only exercise training at ACSM-recommended intensities h as positive effects on global well-being and physical function and possibly on pain and tend er points. [295] The Ottawa Panel recommends both aerobic and streng thening exercises for the management of fibromyalgia as a result of the emerging evidence f rom their synthesis of evidence from 13 RCTs/3 CCTs for aerobic exercise and 5 RCTs for strengthen ing exercises in the management of fibromyalgia. [296,297] R. CHRONIC FATIGUE SYNDROME (CFS) Debate exists among health care professionals and p atients about appropriate strategies for managing chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). A systema tic review of interventions for the treatment or management of CFS found 44 studies meeting inclusio n criteria, including 36 RCTs. [298] /square4 Studies were grouped into 6 categories. Graded ex ercise therapy and cognitive behavioral therapy showed the most promising results with high quality evidence. There was insufficient evidence for pharmacological, supplements, immunolo gical, complementary/alternative, and other interventions. Exercise: A Cochrane review of 5 studies that that investigat ed exercise therapy for CFS found that, at 12 weeks, those receiving exercise therapy were less f atigued than the control participants (SMD -0.77). [299] /square4 Physical functioning was also significantly improv ed with exercise therapy (SMD -0.64), and depression was also improved (although non-signific antly) (WMD -0.58). /square4 Authors concluded that there is encouraging eviden ce that some patients may benefit from exercise therapy and no evidence that exercise ther apy may worsen outcomes. /square4 Using evidence from both the biological and clinic al sciences, they found that graded exercise therapy is safe in people with CFS with no detrimen tal effects on the immune system. /square4 Exercise programs should be designed for individua l physical capabilities and should take into account the fluctuating nature of symptoms. Self Management: /square4 Self-management for people with chronic fatigue sy ndrome involves encouraging patients to pace their activities and respect their physical an d mental limitations, with the ultimate aim of improving their everyday functioning. [300] S. DIABETES TYPE 1 Behavior Change Lifestyle Medicine Review American College of Preventive Medicine 42 A meta-analysis of interventions designed to improv e health behaviors including exercise among adults with type 1 diabetes included data from 1435 subjects showed that behavior change interventions improve metabolic control in type 1 d iabetes. [301] /square4 There was an overall reduction of 0.33 in mean HbA 1c levels between treatment (8.47%) and control (8.80%) groups. T. NON ALCOHOLIC FATTY LIVER DISEASE (NAFLD) Lifestyle Modifications A review of studies testing weight loss and lifesty le modifications for the treatment of NAFLD yielded only 14 studies that met entry criteria. [302] /square4 Only 3 studies included treatment that was consist ent with the guidelines of behavior therapy to reduce excess nutrition and increase exercise; in t hese studies, a remarkable effect on weight loss and an improvement in liver histology were rep orted, but the quality of evidence was weak. U. MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS (MS) Exercise A meta-analysis of the effect of exercise training on quality of life (QOL) among people with MS yielded 13 studies meeting inclusion criteria. [30 3] /square4 The cumulative evidence supports that exercise tra ining is associated with a small improvement in QOL in individuals with MS. V. PARKINSONS DISEASE (PD) Exercise /square4 A Cochrane systematic review of 7 studies evaluati ng the effectiveness of physical exercise on mortality, strength, balance, mobility, and activit ies of daily living (ADL) for sufferers of Parkinson's disease (PD) showed that exercise impro ves physical performance and activities of daily living in PD patients. [304] W. COGNITVE IMPAIRMENT/DEMENTIA Exercise /square4 A meta-analysis of 30 trials investigating exercis e for people with dementia and related cognitive impairments found that exercise training can increa se fitness, physical function, cognitive function, and positive behaviors in people with dem entia and related cognitive impairments. [305] X. CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN Exercise A systematic review of the effectiveness of exercis es in decreasing LBP incidence, intensity and impact yielded 15 studies that provided strong evid ence that exercise was effective in reducing the severity and activity interference from LBP. [306] /square4 Another systematic review of the effectiveness of therapeutic aquatic exercise in the treatment of low back pain included 37 studies. There was suffic ient evidence to suggest that therapeutic aquatic exercise is potentially beneficial to patie nts suffering from chronic low back pain and pregnancy-related low back pain. [307] A Cochrane review of the effect of unloaded movemen t facilitation exercises on outcomes for people with nonspecific chronic low back pain yielded 6 hi gh-quality RCTs. [308] /square4 There was strong evidence that unloaded movement f acilitation exercise, compared to no exercise, improves pain and function. Effects are comparable to other types of exercise, including effort-intensive strengthening and time-i ntensive stabilization exercise. /square4 McKenzie therapy, a form of unloaded movement faci litation exercises, was favored over intensive trunk strengthening for pain. /square4 Yoga produced comparable effects for pain as trunk strengthening and function. /square4 This challenges the role of strengthening for NSCL BP. Lifestyle Medicine Review American College of Preventive Medicine 43 A synthesis of systematic reviews of nonpharmacolog ic therapies for chronic low back pain concluded that there is good evidence that cognitiv e-behavioral therapy, exercise, spinal manipulation, and interdisciplinary rehabilitation are all moderately effective for chronic or subacut e (>4 weeks' duration) low back pain. [309] V. PRACTICE PATTERNS RELATED TO LIFESTYLE MEDICINE Despite consistent recommendations from the most re spected medical associations over the last decade, clinician practices regarding lifestyle med icine have not improved much. [1,2] /square4 Research has consistently reported that the majori ty of clinicians do not routinely screen or assist patients in modifying their health damaging behaviors. [3-13] /square4 Only 1 in 8 primary care physicians was even aware of the ACSM recommendations for physical activity. [14] ADVICE AND COUNSELING Smoking /square4 About half (48%) of smokers reported that healthca re professionals had advised them to quit in the past 12 months but only about 1 in 4 were of fered assistance in quitting. [15] Diet and Exercise /square4 Only 1 in 3 patients indicated that they had ever received even simple advice to increase activity. [16,17] /square4 The same proportion of hypertensive patients (1 in 3) was counseled about physical activity to help manage their hypertension. [17a] /square4 The 2000 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) s howed that fewer than 1 in 4 respondents received any physician advice on diet a nd exercise (21.3% and 24.5% respectively). [18] /square4 Even in higher risk, rates are low -- from 1992-20 00, diet and physical activity counseling took place in < 45% and 30%, respectively, of prima ry care visits by adults with hyperlipidemia, hypertension, obesity, or diabetes mellitus. [8] /square4 A review of general practitioner records form 42 p ractices showed that only half of patients with PAD received advice about exercise or had thei r body mass index checked. [18a] /square4 A chart review of 105 randomly selected patients w ith knee OA showed that fewer than 3 out of 5 had been advised to do any kind of exercise, only half of overweight had been advised to lose weight, and only 2 in 5 had been told about the benefits of strengthening exercise. [18b] /square4 Likelihood of receiving exercise counseling decrea ses with age. Of adults > 45 years, men aged 45-54 were most likely to receive exercise cou nseling from their PCP, but still just over 1 in 5 received such assistance. [19] /square4 Women >75 years were least likely -- fewer than 1 in 10 received exercise counseling. /square4 Low rates of counseling were substantiated by obse rvations of patient visits in 38 primary care practices by trained medical students -- physi cians counseled on dietary habits in 1 in 4 visits and exercise in 1 in 5 visits; new patients were counseled more often than established ones; counseling was more frequent when there were diet and exercise brochures in the office. [20] /square4 9 in 10 internal medicine residents were confident in their knowledge of exercise, but only 1 in 4 was confident in counseling patients. [21] /square4 Physicians counsel diabetic patients more frequent ly than those in a pre-diabetic state. Among Swiss primary care physicians, 91% of their d iabetic patients received counseling for dietary changes and 79% for physicial activity. Ho wever, the rates for pre-diabetic patients was 66% and 60%, respectively. [40] Weight Loss /square4 Only 2 of every 5 obese patients are advised to lo se weight in regular exams, even when they have chronic conditions made worse by their we ight. [22-29] Lifestyle Medicine Review American College of Preventive Medicine 44 /square4 Even fewer (< 1 in 4) overweight (not yet obese) h ad discussed weight with their physician. [30] /square4 Even when they advise patients to lose weight, phy sicians often provide insufficient guidance on weight management strategies, possibly because of inadequate counseling skills and confidence. [31] /square4 Patients were more likely to receive information o n the benefits of weight loss, but only 1 in 3 received specific weight control advice, and 1 in 4 were advised to increase physical activity. [32] /square4 Women more likely than men to be counseled - only 1 in 4 men vs. 2 in 5 women. [33] /square4 Even with obesity-related co-morbidities, weight l oss counseling occurred in only half of visits. [34] Advice alone is not enough. /square4 It takes more than simple advice to change behavio rs. The challenge remains converting awareness into behavior change. [16] /square4 Simple advice to increase physical activity was no t enough to produce long term changes in activity patterns. [35] Adequacy of Counseling Counseling is most effective when physicians presen t counseling as a plan or prescription and follow up with the patient on it. /square4 Overweight adults who were advised to exercise, an d provided a plan, were nearly 5 times as likely to meet physical activity recommendations . [36] /square4 Patients who recalled being counseled to lose weig ht were more likely to understand the risks of obesity, the benefits of weight loss, and were at a higher stage of readiness for weight loss. [31] But when counseling is given, it often does not inc lude a specific plan. /square4 Only 1 to 5 of every 20 obese patients was given s pecific fat loss counseling, especially a plan that includes an increase in physical activity . [31,32,37] Patients want more counseling Most patients (especially overweight or obese) want more help than they are getting. [38] /square4 Obese women report much less satisfaction with obe sity care than general health care. /square4 Almost half reported that they had not been given a weight loss strategy, and 3 out of 4 indicated they expected only a \"slight amount of he lp\" or \"none at all\" when it came to weight control. [39] VI. THE NEED FOR COMPETENCE IN LIFESTYLE MEDICINE Greater physician competence in lifestyle medicine might carry with it a number of positive downstream effects. It could: Change the image of lifestyle medicine - a central role in managing chronic disease. /square4 A culturally competent, patient-centered approach with interventions tailored to each patient's unique medical, psychological, and socio- cultural situation. /square4 Change the orientation to a chronic care perspecti ve -- a long term, on-going process; the Chronic Care model presents a guide for making this change. [1] /square4 Treatment plans focused on entire risk factor prof ile rather than on isolated risk conditions. /square4 The use of registries, multidisciplinary teams, co mmunity outreach, interventions that address care transitions, and telephonic outreach h ave all been shown to improve the quality of care for conditions such as hypertension, hyperl ipidemia, diabetes, and coronary artery disease. [2] Enable the practitioner to develop a profitable pra ctice using lifestyle medicine for some or all patients. Lifestyle Medicine Review American College of Preventive Medicine 45 Increase demand for training in delivering lifestyl e interventions. /square4 The scientific foundation for using diet and lifes tyle as a preventive and curative tool. /square4 Writing lifestyle prescriptions tailored to the un ique needs of individual patients and conditions. /square4 Provide training to address common misconceptions and questions about exercise, diet, weight loss, stress management, sleep and so on. /square4 Overcome time barriers by providing guidelines for brief consults, such as the use of the 5A protocol. [3] /square4 The kinds of support, coaching, and education requ ired to affect meaningful patient change can be accomplished in as little as a few minutes p er visit. [4-6] /square4 Address the vital role of negative emotions that u ndermine changing behaviors and adhering to regimens. [7-13] /square4 How to assess and address health literacy issues t hat affect nearly half of U.S. adults. [14] /square4 Few physicians systematically assess health litera cy and co-morbidities. [15- 17] Help overcome against obese, minoritie s, etc.; misconceptions regarding interventions, patient motivation and ability to ch ange if given the proper program and support, etc. /square4 Help overcome prevailing cynicism regarding the av erage patient's readiness and ability to change well established behavior patterns. [20,21] /square4 Physicians typically more pessimistic, often under estimate patient motivation. [22] Address patient misconceptions /square4 Tendency to underrate vulnerability (i.e., optimis tic bias) that lowers readiness to change. [23] /square4 Tendency to overestimate degree of change needed ( e.g., amount of weight loss or exercise). /square4 Emphasize a sense of partnership between clinician s and patients; better relationships and more intensive support helps change patient percept ions. [24] Promote proven behavior change strategies. /square4 The art of patient counseling and coaching, the us e of motivational interviewing, counseling based on stage of readiness, dealing with barriers, relapses. /square4 Time, effort and resources necessary for behavior change are often overestimated. [21] /square4 Physicians' poor self efficacy and lack of trainin g in behavior change has been shown to obstruct the implementation of lifestyle interventi ons in primary care. [25-29] /square4 Many studies have reported the lack of preparation and confidence to manage obese patients. [30-33] /square4 Communication -- how to discuss issues (e.g., weig ht) in a way that makes patients feel comfortable and increases confidence and motivation to make changes. [34] /square4 Assessing psychological comorbidities, address hea lth literacy skills, and clarify patient's understanding of messages. [35] /square4 Re-defining successful outcomes in terms of health ier behaviors. [36] /square4 Interrupting a \"quitting is not an option\" attitud e in patients, how to use relapses to increase commitment. [4-6] Increase the use of office systems that integrate l ifestyle interventions into routine practice. /square4 A useful model provides a 4-step plan, beginning w ith diagnosis and assessment, followed by a series of patient centered counseling sessions in 3-5 minute segments, to guide patients through the behavior change process. [37,3 8] /square4 Considerable effort has gone into developing and t esting systems that prompt communications, screening, interventions and follow -up to improve the delivery of appropriate counseling. [39,40] /square4 Develop leadership for integrating these systems i n a step by step plan. /square4 Assessing current practice needs, as well as ongoi ng needs (e.g., additional training) Lifestyle Medicine Review American College of Preventive Medicine 46 /square4 Developing a coordinated care system that involves a team approach, with staff training to carry out interventions. /square4 Development of patient roadmaps for assessment, mo nitoring lifestyle changes, facilitating off site care, delivery of tailored advice, follow- up, and linking to support and assistance at home. /square4 Staff training protocols that support the practice by teaching necessary skills for diet and lifestyle improvement. Lead to practitioners better informed of the latest guidelines and evidence. /square4 Keeping up with clinical information on LM is an i nsurmountable task for the average clinician; evidence is overwhelming. [41] /square4 Providing continuing education opportunities, such as offered by the ILM to keep abreast of best practices. [http://www.institutelifestylemedicine.net/home.htm l] Build stronger ties between physician and community . /square4 Establishing community partnerships, teams with ot her health professionals in the community /square4 Becoming a community advocate for LM /square4 Linking to community resources and programs to off er additional opportunities to receive support and reinforce healthy lifestyle messages. Provide a bridge for extending clinical trial findi ngs into every day clinical practice. /square4 A perception that rigorous studies, e.g. Ornish pr ogram, do not reflect real world practice has been cited as part of the resistance to implementin g evidence-based strategies. [42-45] /square4 Provide a foundation for instituting trials in act ual practice settings. [46,47] /square4 Integrating evidence-based lifestyle interventions into individual practices requires a process for incorporating and maintaining the strategies an d interventions over time. [38,48,49] Sets the stage for advocacy, on issues such as reim bursement. /square4 Lack of reimbursement is a huge barrier. Lifestyl e change is a long, time consuming process that is much less likely to happen if servi ces are not reimbursed. [50-52] /square4 Make behavior change the focus of visits. Relate the lifestyle issue to a specific risk factor or chronic disease. Counseling is more likely to occu r when patients make the issue the reason for the visit or explicitly ask for help, OR clinicians view the lifestyle issue (e.g., excess weight) as an exacerbating factor, i.e., \"me dicalizing\" the issue. [53-55] In order to achieve greater competence among physic ians, interested parties must work together to establish a set of competencies against which practitioners of lifestyle medicine can be measured.
