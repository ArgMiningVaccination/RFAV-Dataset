Willman, Jr'. -Ron Y. F. Chun INTRODUCTION This book is one of several products generated as a part of a Law Enforcement Assistance Administration discretionary grant. The project was designed to encourage and enhance citizen efforts to address critical, crime-related issues. Citizens have engaged in an amazing number of activities and this book is but a small effort to sam~le a variety of projects which have shown success. The Project The concepts underlying this project were strong enough to attract several national. citizen organizations to form a National Coalition. The coalition's representatives gave direction in the project's development and cooperated in implementing the community action components. The org:>nizations which comprise the National Coalition are: American G. I. Forum American Jewish Committee National Alliance of Businessmen National Association for the Advancement of Colored People National Conference of State Legislatures Nationul Council of Catholic Laity/United States Catholic Conference Each organization works singularly and in conjunction with other groups to further the social well-being of their constituents and society as a whole. The goals of this project are state~ in the grant application as follows: \" . is to bring citizens into a process which will facilitate thinking, stimulate action, and synthesize and disseminate knowledge about the formal and informal correctional systems in our society and about the ways in which citizen action programs may impact those systems. Crime and the fear of crime are major socio\u00ad political problems in our nation. Involving citizens VII in the process of learning about and interacting with the official systems of criminal justice will also impact the public's perspectives in such a way that attitudes and reactions we now see as ju~tified and self-protective will be discarded in favor of an action approach to addressi ng the needs of the fami 'Iy, the community, and social institutions.\" This goal is be'ing met through the hard work-and dedication of the organ\u00ad izational members of the National Coalition and their concerned constituents. Source Book: Citizen Action in Criminal Justice c/ The Source Book is intended to offer a set of program models which will serve as guides for action. Many of the programs contained within have \"succeeded\" in reducing crime, or at the very least, provided helpful services to people who encounter the criminal justice system. Other articles try to provide background on attitudes or offer \"tips\" for the lay public to use vlhen approaching a crime-related problem. Citizens can playa major part in the criminal justice system. Even though everyone cannot be a police off'lcer, judge, or correctional coun\u00ad selor, nor should everyone want to be. These professionals are merely the \"tip of the iceberg\". So many services remain to be provided, so many clients remain to be seen, so many issues remain to be discussed and resolved that.Q..l'llx citizen involvement can make an impression on the problem of crime. As you read through this book, identify two or three issues about which your community has grave concerns. Then decide whether your organization has a structure which will foster effective Qction on each issue. For example, some groups are able to commit considerable volunteer time activities such as juvenile tutorial programs. Other groups are able to analyze and comment on policy matters with consider\u00ad able force. Groups which are willing to address questions of fairness and equal treatment under the law are quite valuable in a democratic system. VIII The first section, COMMUNITY ACTION AND AWARENESS, offers a number of r~ items to be considered by an organization which is considering a project on a crime issue. \"How to Organize an Effective Citizens Group for Criminal) Justi ce Reform\" is a detail ed outl i ne di recti ng citi zen groups to choose relevent crime related issues. Tom Bradley, Mayor of Los Angeles, explains in \"A Court System in \\~hich'. All the People Have a Part\" exactly why the public should care about the pi\"ocedure and form of our criminal justice sy~tem ... The remaining articles in this section deal with a subject dear to all of us --money. Joanne Spitz in \"Criminal Justice Legislation: Economic Considerations\" tells us how to apply basic economic sensibility when investigating various issues. \"Restitution: An Acceptable Alterna\u00ad ti ve to Puni shment and Rehabil itati on?\" by Chet Chil es is a communi ty attitude resea.rch model which determined whether the publ i c will accept monetary or in-kind reimbursement by an offender or if they prefer to have the individual imprisoned. The COMMUNITY. BUSINESS, AND CRIME RESISTANCE section takes a long, ,,' hard look at the problems of crime in our neighborhoods and businesses and discusses what we can do about it. The F.B.I. is involved in a pro\u00ad gram called Crime Resistance wherein agents will equip law enforcement agencies with the information necessary to foster citizen-based activities which identify and develop a \"resistance\" to crime problems. We present four examples in this section of the F.B.I.'s efforts in Birmingham, Alabama, De Kalb County, Georgia, Norfolk, Virginia and Wilmington, Delaware. An overview of similar programs in \"Community Crime Prevention-\u00ad Research Briefs\" prepared by the National Institute of Law Enforcement and Criminal Justice. In addition, the U. S. Chamber of Commerce prepared a handbook entitled \"Uhite Collar Crime -Everyone's Problem, Everyone's Loss\". We have taken excerpts from this pUblication as an outline which any person may incorporate into their daily business practices. While dealing with VICTIMS OF CRIME may be of high concern to many people, few resources are allocated to them. \"A COlffilunity Response to Rape\" prepared by Gerald Bryant and Paul Cirel chronicles how a group recognized a significant problem and took action to a'lleviate some of the IX ; suffering experienced by rape victims. An appropriate companion (though broader in scope) to this article is the \"Aid to Victims of Crime -Vol\u00ad unteer Tl\"~ining Manual\" used by the Dallas, Texas Police Department.' How to approach the victim? What resources should be utilized? How to prepare them to deal with the criminal justice system? . are answered here. The largest section of the Source Book is INCARCERATION -~lJ\\Ir.S AND PRISONS. We sought articles which covered working with the system as well as people who are in jails, prisons, and in the process bf being released to the conmunity. \"The Wash'lngton Dismas Project Handbook\" is an overview of a \"third party custody\" program in which a citizen advocate will sponsor a county jail inmate in court and hopefully in early release from the jail. Adding to the problems of overcrowding in jails is housing the public drunk. Richard Finley revie\\~s several programs designed to deal with this problem in \"Treatment for the Chronic Alcohol Abuser - A Community Concern\". Both, the \"Offender Aid and Restoration (OAR) -Evaluation Report\" and \"Correcti ons and Community\" by Alexander and Suzanne Pa thy di scuss the ways and means of citizen involvement in prisons. The former is also use\u00ad ful as a guide to evaluating your own program, while the latter displays attitudes and perspectives of volunteers, inmates, and prison officials in their own words. Direct service and action which takes into consideration and involves the family are exemplified in the last two articles in this section, \"Women's Prison Association and Home\" and \"Citizens United for Rehabilitation of Errants (CURE): Organization for Action-Lobby for Change\". Women in jails and prisons often do not have their own families' needs met; Michele Smollar outlines a program which helps. The develop\u00ad ment of CURE into a state-wide organization of service to prisoners and their families has been chronicled by Charles Sullivan and myself. LeIst, too often, but not least in our perspective in YOUTH-JUSTICE AND NEGLECT. This first article, \"Volunteer Homes for Status Offenders: An Alternative to Detention\" deals with the process of recruiting and training of foster parents, both short and long term, to act as an alternative to incarcerating children who committed youth-specific x crimes such as truancy, running away from home, and violations of curfew. The \"Volunteer Probation Counselor Program\" is designed to deal with youth under community custody by pairing a volunteer with a child based on interests and interpersonal skills. Mary Lilly Sage in \"Volunteers . Adult and Youth . Bring a Fresh Dimension\", has designed a program full of fresh ideas for volunteers working in juvenile training schools and detention centers. Finally, one of the most exciting programs (for those\\involved in it) is reported in \"Homeward Bound: An AlternatiVe to the Institution\u00ad alization of Adjudicated Juvenile Offender::;\" by Herb Willman, Jr., and Ron Chun.

Denton Project Director NEH DIRECTIONS FOR CORRECTIONS Xl HOW TO ORGANIZE AN EFFECTIVE CITIZENS'GROUP FOR CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM National Council on Crime and Delinquency 5b1J~ In organizing a group of private citizens around any issue, a few basic principles should be kept in mind as they will be in3trumental in determining the success or failure of the group. These principles are .-eally just common sense, but they are commonly and ':onsistently broken. Planning The easiest way to lose your focus, impetus and to destroy a program of change is to negl ect pI\"oper pl annin!\"!. You must pl an evet\u00b7y detail of each aspect for every part of your program. This goes for defining your goals, gathering information, contacting people for support, organizing volunteers, writing letters, and even who will serve the coffee at meetings. The success of your group will be determined chiefly by tt,;] amount of planning and prp.paration done before you begin to act. Participation Facilitate the involvement of a11 persons and try to get as much involvement by as many people as possible. Remember that you are deal\u00ad ing with people who want to help. If someone is concerned enough to attend meetings and volunteer his/her time, then that person should par\u00ad ticipate in group decision-making. Failure to allow for this participa\u00ad tion will lead to disinterest and the eventual failure of your program. Patience A critical principle. You must not lose sight of the fact that your group consists of citizens, not experts on management or in dealing with governmental bureaucracies. Most citizens will respond to a request for their hp.lp in organizing an effective group with: \"What? Me? I've never organized anything in my life.\" In organizing this effort, every\u00ad one should recognize that they \\~ill be learning together, from mistakes as well as successes. Perserverance You must expect and anticipate setbacks. Some government agencies will be very helpful, others will be suspicious until you prove yourself. Do not be discouraged if your program is not adopt,ed immediately or funded within your expectations. A few more words before proceeding to outline citizen group organi\u00ad zation. Please consider the follo~ling as a framework which you can adapt to your particular needs. These recommendations and guidelines should not prohibit you from experimenting, adapting different approaches to meet your partic'Jlar needs, or seeking other sources of additional or specialized techniques. EFFECTIVE ORGANIZATION Establish a \"Core Group\" to help Y:',)1 organize the citizens' qroup Citizen action will usually be the result of efforts by a few central or core figures. to form this core group. It is cruci alto se,cure a few energeti c soul s Concerned i~dividuals may be solicited from any number of already established community groups (school groups, churches, civic or business clubs, etc.). Or it may be that a single club, church, or school organization is available to provide selected individuals for nucleus of workers. Consider the following steps for shaping your core: -Hrite letters to people who might share the same objectives announcing a meeting to form a citizens' group. Tell them why you feel such a group is needed. List problems Which you would like to discuss with them at an organizational meeting. End the letter by soliciting suggestions from them on how to resolve these problems and requesting their help in forming a citizens' group to carry them out. (See Appendix A for sample letter.) -Place an ad in your local paper and write a letter to the editor asking that other citizens contact you to help organize a citizen's group.)See Appendix B for sample advertisement.) 2 e Whether you work with an established group, or get together with the people whom you have contacted, it is important for this core group to acquire sufficient knowledge about your problem and the adequacy of community resources to cope with them. (A small, hard-working group with a single, well-defined purpose can usually get more done than a large,unwieldyone.) Gaining support for your citizens' group Once a core group has been established, its immediate aim should be to gain the support and assistance of the community at large. Even\u00ad tually you will want to contact such representative members of the com\u00ad munity as follows: -mayor, town manager and/or county commissioners -police chief, juvenile officers -judge, district attorney, public defender, probation department -local school district, university (both student body and admini-stration) -civic groups such as the Junior Chamber of Commerce, Khlanis, Rotary, Women's Cl ub, League of Women Voters, Council of Christians and Jews, etc. -various ethnic minority organizations \" representatives of religious groups local press (radio, television, newspapers) -state legislator and state senators -labor groups (labor representatives to United Way) -administrators and workers from a variety of social service agencies These individuals will help your core group gain the cooperation and support of the larger community. They may assist simply by knowing that you exist, by foreseeing what kind of help you will need, by suggesting further contacts who might be able to provide support, etc. It is important to keep all of these individuals and agencies informed Oil your program regardless of whether or not they are able to help you initially. Organizing a public meeting After the core group has laid the groundwork of contacting the various appropriate agencies and individuals, you will want to create a still broader base of support for your citizens' group. One of the best ways to accomplish this is through a public meeting. A public 3 meeting provides a means for reaching people you would never reach other\u00ad wise: those whose interests are unserved and who therefore cannot be reached through a public or a private agency. And these are the indi\u00ad viduals who may expect to derive the greatest benefits from the group's contemplated action. Below we outline tasks you must expect to undertake--again, as a group and through division of labor--for a smooth and successful meeting. 1. Before the meeting a. Define those issues which are to be covered at the meeting: * lack of facilities, services * quality of facilities, services * 1 ack of funds * possible strategies for resolving the problems b. Set a meeting date. Allow at least one month from the date of the organizational core group meeting. c. Set meeting place. Pick a centrally-located spot, easily accessible by public transportation. Churches, YMCA, youth or neighborhood centers, and some public and private agencies have meeting rooms which are made available to organizations free or at nominal cost. d. Arrange for babysitting, car pooling, etc. e. Decide on a format--a panel, workshop, or speaker format. One format with a high success rate is to use a panel composed of those officials who are responsible for providing the services you seek, together with a state legislator, two or three citizens expressing needs, a orofessional from the community, and to fol~ow it with questions from the audience. f. Arrange for speakers. Call and speak with them by phone, then immediately confirm by letter. g. Send special invitation letters to heads of private and public agencies, churches, etc. Consult the check list provided. (Appendix C.) 4 \\ h. Arrange for publicity. Contact local newspapers, community newspapers, radio and television stations, and distribute circulars in those neighborhoods which . are most affected. i. Make arrangements for a literature assortment table at the meeting with literature from other citizens' groups, private and public agencies, etc. j. Prepare a volunteer sheet for parents, for example, to undertake specific jobs in your citizens' group. (See sample Volunteer Sheet, Appendix D.) k. Allow sufficient time after speakers for questions from the audience. Be prepared with a list of your own questions to get things started, break the ice and stimulate conversation. 1. Prepare a plan of action to be proposed at the meeting. 2. At the meeting a. Appoint ushers who will seat the panelists and take care of their needs. b. Appoint ushers to give dir'ections to the audience, see that guestbooks and volunteer sheets are signed or dis\u00ad tributed, and then collected at the end of the meeting. This is crucial; you cannot form a citizens' group without the information obtained from volunteer sheets. c. Remind the audience, at the meeting's beginning and end, to fill out these volunteer sheets. d. Again, be sure to provide for questions and discussion from the audience, (Participation) e. Designate someone to propose a possible plan of action and ask support from the audience. f. Designate someone to announce the formation of your new citizens' group, with a suggested title. g. Announce or set the date of a follow-up working meeting, and urge attendance. 5 3. After the meeting a. Send thank you notes to all guest speakers. b. Compile a file from guest book and volunteer sheets.\" c. Set up appointments for personal visits to city and state officials and other public servants who attended the meeting to get their reaction, their cooperation in activities, and proposals for your citizens' group. d. Send notices to everyone who attended the meeting of the follow-up working meeting. e. Sent out newsletter to everyone who attended the meeting, keeping them informed on all plans for action, asking for their participation and membership. Enclose sign-up sheet, with check list of all possible tasks they could do; ranging from little or no time commitment to larger projects which would require active involve\u00ad ment and leadership. f. In order to defray some of the costs involved (postage, printing, etc.) you may want to ask for a one dollar donation at the door when you have your public meeting. FORMALLY SETTING UP YOUR CITIZENS'GROUP Once you have expanded your core group to include other citizens who have subsequently learned about the citizens' group, you are ready to begin setting up some formal structure for the group. Every organi\u00ad zation needs some kind of structure to keep it together. It is very important to remember, however, that you want your citizens' group to be action-oriented. Therefore, you will want to keep your organiza- tional structure as simple and effective as possible. Too many committees, or complicated bY-laws, will only defeat the purpose of your group; therefore, we repeat, keep your organizational structure as simple as possible. Officers At your first meeting you will need to elect temporary officers, to include a chairperson, vice-chairperson, secretary and treasurer. 6 By-laws You will need to plan or adopt certain by-laws, rules by which the organization agrees to live. Your group can avoid future dissension. and possible damage, if the rules are spelled out in written by-laws. Following are a few things by-laws generally contain: -name, purpose, membership requirements -rights and responsibilities of members -how meetings will be run -how voting will be handled -how directors and officers are to be elected -funding -amendment procedures -how many directors and officers there will be, what their duties are, and length of tenure Most organizations have the same basic rules; hence their by-laws are substantially similar. A sample of model by-laws is attached (see Appendi x E), ~ Articles of Incorporation The Articles of Incorporation comprise a state document verifying the existence of your organization. It will be necessary to obtain state approval of your articles, which show that you are a non-profit organization, before you are able to do any major fund-raising. It wiil be necessary to have an attorney fill out the forms and draft your Articles of Incorpo\\\"ation, since proper legal terminology must be used. You shoUld try to get an attol\"ney to volunteer h'is/her services to your citizens' group on a consulting basis. Also, your local legal aid clinic usually offers free legal services in this area. There is some filing fee required, but it is usually small. For further information, write or call your Secretary of State. Tax Exemption If your citizens' group is going to do any major fund raising, soliciting of bUsiness, foundations, etc. you will need to obtain a tax exemption status from the Internal Revenue Service. 7 -Get several copies of form 1023 from your local Internal Revenue Service office. -These papers should also be filled out by an attorney. Again, consult your local legal aid clinic for free legal advice and services. -The I.R.S. is forbidden to give a tax exemption to lobbying organizations. Therefore, lobbying activ'ities must appear minimal on your application. You should stress your group's other goals such as educational and informational activities. Affiliating with city, state and national organizations Undoubtedly you will eventually be asked, or you may wish, to affiliate with a larger organization in order to maximize your power. So we want to include a few pointers which may assist you in determining whether the affiliation is in your best interests. -Make sure your citizens' group will not have to sacrifice any of its goals. Check your potential affiliate's goals carefully, as well as the means they have adopted to reach them. Consider whether they will hinder or facilitate your work. -l~ake sure your parent group does not lose its autonomy: most important are the abi1 ity to make pol icy decisions and the ability to act without consulting the association. -Ensure that your citizens' group does not give up more than it gains in time, enel\"gy, money and power. If any affiliation will give your group greater power, by all means proceed. I f your group rnus t sacri fi ce power, do not. Conti nue to make it on your OWn. The above should outline the steps to be taken in establishing your citizens' group on a formal basis. The group should not hesitate to consult profeSSionals and to ask their assistance as you oy'ganize. To a degree, you will have to depend on them for specific advice; for example, a lawyer will be needed in drafting your Articles of Incor\u00ad poration. Beware, however, of depending too much on professionals. Their advice will be useful, but if they become too large a part of your group, they may tend to dominate it, and attendance of nonpro\u00ad fessionals will slack off. 8 Never forget who your own experts are: the individuals who have done the drudge work, who have spent long hours getting the group started. The majority of your board members and organizational leaders should be private citizens who have cared enough to involve themselves. Other\u00ad wise, you will no longer be a citizens' group. DEALING WITH THE BUREAUCRACI~S As previously mentioned, there will be some agencies who will prove extremely helpful, while others will view you with suspicion or wait until you have proven yourself. Hhether a bureaucrat greets you in a cooperative fashion or with hostility, you should bear in mind that he/she is a public servant, paid by you to provide services for you and the members of your group. A bureaucracy consists of public servants; you are the public. Individuals who keep this distinction in mind will usually elicit action from their public servants. If you feel guilty for having bothered a public worker with your problems, for having taken up his/her time or having created work for him/her, it will be neither useful nor appropriate. They should be concerned with your interests (especially as you are paying her/his salary through ever\u00ad spiralling taxes). Here are some reminders on Dealing with a Bureaucracy: -Apologies and begging for favors with respect to attentions to which you are entitled as a citizen are out of order. -Press beyond excuses such as: \"There i sn' t any money\", \"We need more time\", \"We've made a lot of progress, but . \" What are the real snags and why? -Set a reasonable time-frame within which you would expect the agency to respond, but see that this time-frame is honored. Also, recall the ancient wisdom that the more time given a bureaucracy in which to act, the more time the bureaucracy will use to get the job done; pressure accordingly. Remember that bureaucracies are slow creatures, bred no doubt in the lazy tropics. -Patience and tolerance ate not always in order, either, especially when it comes to bureaucratic inactivity. Hhen you are told \"We are doing everything we can\", request details of what has been done and try to pin down or locate the stale\u00ad mate. 9 In terminal cases of inaction, whether purposeful or not, do not hesitate to register your complaints with a bureaucrat's superiors, legislators, the mayor or the press. There is constructive end to the exposure of incompetence, inefficiency, dishonesty or other Ivrongdoings. The goals of your citizens' groups should ever be your primary motivating force, so keep a firm hold on their importance. Along these lines, it may be useful to distinguish both a legal entitlement and a moral entitlement. If you are seeking a service to which you are legally entitled, your best approach is the legal one. The agency or bureaucracy has no choice under 1 aw but to pl'ovi de services and execute res pons ibi 1 iti es ma:,Jated to it. If the services you are seeking should happen not to be required by law, but are none\u00ad theless needed, create as much public pressure as possible, and apply it where you feel the responsibilities should rest. Consider strategies towards legislative change. In summary, these guidelines are offered only as suggestions for setting up a citizens' group. Feel free to improve on them by adding your own ideas, but for assured success keep in mind the four basic rules of planning, participation, patience and perserverance. Be sure to use all the governmental avenues avialable, and for technical ,assis\u00ad tance, research material or advice, please contact the NCCD office nearest you.

I don't know why people say it's so difficult.\" The speaker i:s Mrs. ~largaret Moore Post; the attitude represents the the spirit tl'iat has made the recQrd of the Indianapolis Anti-Crime Crusade a model for volunteer organizations across the country. Sparked by indignation at the murder of a retired school teacher 14 years ago, the Crusade organized woman power to make a difference in their own community. Somehow the Crusade has always worked at the problem at hand--one reason it is still a viable volunteer organization. The school teacher was murdered by a young school drop-out; one of the first Crusade efforts focused on a program to return 2,000 drop-outs to school. Onf r' the country's first courtwatcher programs led to a dt,'en reforms i r. ~ourt procedures. Vol unteers sparked one of the nation's first street lighting improvement efforts; more than 12,000 new street lights have\"been installed across the city. Today police professionals emphasize the imperative for citizen involvement in crime prevention. Indianapolis was the first city in the nation to have 2,500 block clubs organized to encourage citizen responsibility for crime prevention. The process has a simple foundation: women focused on curbing one crime, putting one drop-out back in school, getting one new light an a dark street, observing one day in court, getting one father' a job. Over the years, some 60,000 women have been involved, and the program has de\u00ad veloped a bluepprint for volunteers that has guided similar efforts in dozens of cities across th~ country. The Anti-Crime Crusade is nationally recognized as a model of con\u00ad certed citizen effort to make a difference. A low-cost, high commitment program, with a particularly successful approach to mobilizing the sup\u00ad port of community leaders and the media. 20 A COURT SYSTEM IN WHICH ALL THE PEOPLE HAVE A PART Nayor TOin Bradley Los Angeles, California I~ 11;b The courts are among the last of our public institutions to respond to the growing national emphasis on citizen involvement in government. Many people do not question this delay, for the courthouse represents a system so sacrosanct, so dominated by highly-educated professionals, and so circumscribed by legal strictures that most citizens are filled with awe when they consider involvement in its processes. As one professional within the Los Angeles court system said recently, \"The average citizen's awareness of the court system--what the courts are, where they are, what they do, even how you find your way around the building - -is a big zero.\" This is an indictment of our system, for the courts do not belong to the judges, nor to the legal profession, nor even to the government. The courts belong to the people--all the people. As the President's Commission on Law Enforcement and Administra\u00ad tion of Justice point out in 1967: \"Crime prevention is the task of the community as a whole and . all parts of the criminal justice system can benefit from the special knowledge and points of view of those outside it.\"' The strong statements of the Presidential Com\u00ad mission were reiterated by the National Advisory Commission on Criminal Justice Standards and Goals and by the leadership of the Law Enforce\u00ad ment Assistance Administration (LEAA), which was created to administer the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968. Donald Santarelli, former administrato!' of LEAA, said 'in early 1974: \"Our goal is the reduction of crime in America. There are many paths we must follow simultaneously to reach that goal. One of them that has been overlooked in the past is the citizen-and the role he can play in helping to fashion advances in crime reduction.\" \"In much of the nation today,\" Santarelli continued, \"the criminal 21 justice system seems to be operating to serve its own needs, running things to suit its own preferences, carving out spheres of influence to suit its own convenience. But the criminal justice system must not be the master of the people. It can only aspire to be the servant of the people. Policemen. and judges, and corrections officials, and prosecutors cannot be in business for themselves. Their job is not to erect empires and operate outside of the gaze and control of the public.\"2 It is my conviction that until we can overcome the public's lethargy and feeling of helplessness against the rising t'ide of crime by actively involving our citizens in the complex systems which deal with that crime, lawlessness in our streets will continue to increase. It has been said that there is one thing better than good govern\u00ad ment, and that 'is government'in which all the people have a part.S I believe that, and I also believe that there is one thing better than good law enforcement, better than a good court system--and that is law enforcement and a court system in which all the people have a part. Only through citizen participation can citizen confidence in government and its institutions be restored. \"But exactly how,\" some will i31sk, \"can an individual citizen be\u00ad come involved in the. court system?\" There are a variety of ways, many of which are already operating with success in a number of cities. One of the best known of these efforts is a court watching project of the Indianapolis Anti-Crime Crusade, an organization formed in 1962 by 30 Indianapolis women in response to a cold-blooded attack on a 90 year-old woman on the city's streets. The Crusade, which has no dues, no membership cards, no minutes and no bylaws, now involves some 60,000 women, of whom 3,000 serve as court watchers under the gui dance of 30 key organi zers\u00b7. Armed with a guide, a report form and identification cards, these women attend court to observe proceedings. They note such things as whether the judge is present or whether there is a pro tem substitute, the number of delays and continuances, the age of defendents, etc. On 22 a rotating basis, Crusade women have observed hundreds of thousands of cases. Such observations have resulted in improved attendance by judges and arresting officers, in loiterers being cleared from the halls by bailiffs, in improvement in deportment and appearance of police wit\u00ad nesses, and in better preparation of cases by prosecuting attorneys' deputies. The women have also set up an information table in court halls, thus putting an end to soliciting by bail bondsmen. A similar court watching program, Women on Watch, operates in Mont\u00ad gomery County, MarYland, with particular emphasis on the disposition of juvenile cases. Other groups of housewives, professionals and business\u00ad men throughout the country have undertaken similar studies, and as a result have been able to recommend more efficient methods of selecting judges, reducing court backlog, and improving juvenile care procedures. Businessmen in other cities, such as members of the Economic Develop\u00ad ment Council of New York City, have volunteered their time to conduct extensive studies of the city's court systems. The judicial process in New York City has reportedly been accelerated due to the work of the Council, which found that court backlogs could be reduced without spending more money if businesslike methods were applied to court pro\u00ad cedures. Also in New York City, volunteers have worked effectively with juveniles and their families in the city's four family courts. Some act as social work aides; others assist the probation department in obtaining essential data about the family, still others offer referral service and active support in enabling clients to find help with problems not directly related to the court appearance. In Washington, D.C. the Pre-Trial Justice Program of the American Friends Service Committee attempts to insure that all persons arrested in the District of Columbia receive their rights relating to pretrial release, effective access to counsel, and a speedy and public trial. The program has al so conducted a court \\~atching project to study un\u00ad necessary delays in bringing cases to trial. And with the assistance of law students, program volunteers interviewed 600 men held in jail 23 on a given day to determine why and how long they had been detained and whether they had effective access to counsel. Many other innovative projects are in operation across the country. One, which operates in several cities, uses volunteers to work on a one\u00ad to-one basis with probationers. Another provides volunteer counseling to juveniles and their families., A project in Oakland integrates con\u00ad victed offenders into the referr~l process of volunteer bureaus for assignn~nt to wQrk in non-profit community agencies as an alternative to th1 puni shment of a fine or impri sonment. From this sampling, it becomes clear that the barrier to citizen involvement in the court system is not a lack of opportunities for participation but, rather,a rigidity on the part of both the community and court personnel which makes such involvement appear unfeasible to many. Such rigidity may manifest itself in open antagonism, as was dis\u00ad covered by a group of volunteer court watchers in Waterbury, Connecticut, in the late 1960's. In that city an organization known as JOE (\"Justice, Order and Equality'\" undertook a survey and observation project under the auspices of the Connecticut Council of Churches' Commission on Religion in Action. During their second summer of operation the group began to encounter a number of bureaucratic obstructions, such as being refused access to a copy of the court docket because it allegedly caused too much ~lOrk for the clerk. F'inally they were told by the judge in chambers that if they continued their activities they would be charged with contempt of court.6 This negative reaction is unfortunate. As Edgar S. and Jean Camper Cahn, co-deans of Antioch School of La\\~, and generally regarded as the initiators of the program of Legal Services to the poor have pointed out, there are three impol'tant advantages of citiz<;ln partici\u00ad pation in any undertaking) First, citizen participation is a means of mobilizing resources and energies not otherwise tapped. Second, citizen participation is a source of special insight information, knowledge and experience otherwise lacking. And third, citizen participation, in 24 and of itself, is the active expression of faith in the dignity and worth of an individual. The quest'ion then becomes not what citizens can do to improve the court system, nor whether their contribution is valuable--but, rather, how their participation can be initiated and en\u00ad couraged. In Los Angeles we are far behind many of the other great cities of the nation in achieving this kind of participation, and it is one of the goals of my administration to change this situation as soon as possible. But to do so it will be necessary to accomplish two pre\u00ad liminary objectives: first to allay any incipient fears on the part of the judiciary and the bar that public involvement may be disruptive, and second to assure interested citizens that their active participation is a valuable, unique contribution to the administration of justice and the control of crime within their city. The latter may prove the more difficult task, for in a city of nearly 3 million r'esidents, spr'ead over some 465 square miles, a feeling of close identification with the court structure, or, indeed, any governmental institution is difficult to achieve. One possible step has been proposed by Dean Dorothy Nelson of the University of Southern California Law Center. Dean Nelson suggests that court backlog could be reduced significantly by handling certain non-cr'iminal matters through neighborhood arbitration centers staffed by laymen from the surrounding community. \"If your child is being dealt with improperly at school,\" Dean Nelson said recently, \"or if someone breaks your window, your situation may call for justice but it doesn't necessarily require a court's attention. 1 think we should use qualified laymen in a neighborhood arbitration bureau.\"S Such an arbitration center, as envisioned by Dean Nelson, might be housed in a neighborhood center which would also include a referral bureau to assist people with other problems and a youth division, ad\u00ad ministered at least in part by young people. The staff of the center would be trained to fulfill their respective duties, and, in the case of the arbitration center, would include legal paraprofessionals, ar\u00ad bitrators, mediators, and ombudsmen, some of whom would volunteer their 25 ser'vices. The value of Dean Nelson's proposal is threefold: It would assure speedy redress for persons with problems not necessarily requiring a court's time, it would decrease court backlog, and it would involve citizens in the judicial process in an intimate way within their own residential communities. Another project which we in Los Angeles are seriously considering is the implementation of a pretrial release program as an alternative to the archaic and prohibitive bail bond system. Such a program could use citizen volunteers to process participants and check their records. It has also been suggested that we use waiting jurors in a volun\u00ad teer program of service within the courts themselves. Too often in the past jurors have been treated as second class citizens instead of public servants. They have been subjected to endless waiting, numerous delays, frequent postponements, all of which make them wonder if the courts are being run to serve the people or to serve the defense attorneys, the prosecutors, the judges. Our long range goal 'In Los Angeles is to set up new procedures to serve the public rather than waste the time of victims, litigants, jurors, and witnesses. However, it may be possible in the interim (and in instances where a certain amount of waiting is unavoidable) to inaugurate programs to use the time of jurors before a trial actually begins. A number of citizen programs, such as those now operating throughout the country, coul d integrate jurors into thei \\\" vol unteer staff on a short-term basis, thereby increasing their project's potential for service, and at the same time contributing to the jurors' sense of dignity and worth. Another way to encourage citizen participation, especially in Los Angeles with its large number of Spanish-speaking residents, might be to use special language skills which are available only from certflin members of the community. For instance, bilingual members of the public could monitor the translation of exchanges between clients and their attol'neys, or witnesses and the court. As Los Angel es attorney Herman Sillas pointed out recently, justice is uncertain for persons 26 who do not speak the English language.g In many court-related trans\u00ad actions, the only person who purports to understand all that is being said is the interpreter. If questions and answers are conveyed in\u00ad correctly, it is possible for a legal version of the Tower of Babel to develop without anyone's knOWledge, A bilingual citizen observer could serve as a double check on the information conveyed by the interpreter, and might also assist in the repetition of lengthy or complex statements. The National Advisory Commission on Criminal Justice Standards and Goals has taken a role of leadership in urging not only that citizens should participate actively in crime control within their communities, but also thRt criminal justice agencies should actively encourage such participation. This is the other side of the coin, and it ;s a matter in which the courts must take a much more affirmative role than they have in the past. A recent report of the National Advisory Commission urged: \"Criminal justice agencies can do much more, if they actively seek to explain their role to citizens' groups and show how citizens themselves may participate in community crime prevention.\" 10 This suggestion should become a challenge to the courts of our land, for the criminal court is the central, crucial institution in the criminal justice system. If the courts take the lead in encouraging meaningful citizen participa\u00ad tion, then that same kind of participation will follow in all other agencies dealing \\~ith the control of crime and the administration of justice. 27 FOOTNOTES 1.

Let's examine, for a moment, the astounding costs connected with crime: --From 1960 to 1970, the number of crimes reported in the United States was up 1BO per cent while the population grew by only 13 per cent. And, law enforcement officials estimate that there are two to four times as many crimes actually fommlttpd as there are reported. -~Some $1.5 billion is spent each year on the federal prison system alone. The tax burden for this expenditure affects every U. s. tctxpayer. --It costs from $5,300 to $14,000 to confine a person in prison for a year. --It costs governments throughout the country many millions of dollars to bring offenders to court. It also costs a king's ransom, nationally speak\u00ad ing, for private individuals to buy both insurance and security devices in an effort to protect themselves. --About 55,000 families in America are on welfare now because the husband or father is in prison. Thousands of othe.r families are receiving welfare because their breadwinner is an ex-offender who is shunned on the job market. The bill for this comes to hundreds of millions of dollars annually. (National Alliance of Businessmen) 30 CRIMINAL JUSTICE LEGISLATION Cost-Effectiveness Considerations Joanne Spitz Midwestern State University 5b 1/3 Policies for dealing with offenders and for deterring those who would commit crimes derive from theories of crime analysis. A psy\u00ad chiatrist might say a woman turns to prostitution because of a traumatic experience, such as rape, which may have occurred in her childhood. A psychologist might say she had a poor relationship with her father. A sociologist might believe she grew up in an overcrowded neighborhood. An economist might reason that a woman will turn to prostitution because she; can earn more money than she would in a legitimate pro\u00ad fession. The hypothesis we as a society adopt will determine our response to criminal activity. If we support the economist's theory, we may believe we can eliminate prostitution by making it less lucrative. This could be accomplished by raising fines (fines are the most commonly used sanction for prostitution), or by increasing the probability of apprehension (causing the prostitute to pay the standard fine more often). However, if we have made prostitution less profitable without increasing legitimate employment opportunities, we will not necessarily reduce crime; those who were prostitutes may simply find other criminal occupations. The rational economic solution would be to allocate more of our budget to career training and job programs rather than to a tougher criminal justice system. Legislators often appear to pass criminal justice bills without any consideration of economics. Operation Intercept exemplifies the narrowness of planning which can result in disaster. This program WaS an attempt by the Nixon Administration to reduce the quantity of drugs (mainly marijuana) smuggled into the U.S. from Mexico. The project began on September 21,1969, and was terminated on October 11, 1969, 20 days later. Federal enforcement officials who were most con\u00ad cerned with the problem said they were \"too sick to talk about it\".1 The failure of this project was predictable. The supply of marijuana 31 decreased while demand remained constant. This created an increase in the price of the remaining available marijuana as well as an increase ,in demand for substitute goods. , A study of this project conducted at UCLA revealed that in California, ... 76 percent of students and 84 percent of patients reported that they increased their consumption of one or more other drugs because of the unavailability of marijuana. 2 Operation Intercept had a similar impact across the nation. The marijuana drought took place at a time when, by coincidence, the available supply of heroin made sub\u00ad stantial in~Dads on a population far younger--and some\u00ad what more miadle-class--than that previously involved with the drug. Moreover, since heroin is strongly addictive the process was relatively irreversible, even after the end of Operation Intercept had made marijuana easily available again.3 A 1971 report 4 estimated that a heroin addict would have to ob\u00ad tain $25,000 in cash or $100,000 in goods annually to purchase needed narcoti cs. The shortage of marijuana not only caused an increase in the use of other drugs, but also an increase in crimes such as larceny, burg\u00ad lary, robbery, and prostitution., which are frequently engaged in to procure funds for narcotics purchase. Clearly, Operation Intercept was instituted without consideration' of all possible ramifications. The costs of this program, both human and monetary, exceeded by far any benefits it may have produced. Economic analysis assumes consumers are rational; that is, when they purchase a commodity, they have carefully evaluated the cost of the product and its utility to them. Yet each year we commit large sums of money to purchase services from the criminal justice system with little knowledge of either the cost to us or the benefits we will receive. As concerned citizens, we must broaden our interest in new programs; from our current concern with cost, we must move to an interest in cost-effectiveness. We must ask not only what crime prevention programs 32 will cost, but what benefits will accrue to us as a resuit ~f our expen\u00ad ditures, and how effective each program can be expected to be. Most of us could cut down considerably on our food budgets by eliminating costly items ( for example, sources of protein such as cheeses, meats, and eggs) from our diets, but in the long run, it would not be cost-effective. We would become sick more often, lose wages due to absenteeism, and incur greater medical expenses. The same kind of analysis can be applied to expenditures in the criminal justice system. Some programs will appear tc be real \"buys\"; some will be ineffective no matter hOI~ much money is poured into them, still others must be planned carefully so that enough money is spent to make them useful, without overspending. As citizens, we are frequently called upon to vote on issues such as local police budgets, mandatory sentences for convicted felons, and plea bargaining. These are all basic economic decisions. Should we spend more money for police then the value of the crime they deter?* Should we detain peop}e for three years in jail, at an annual average cost of $9,000, even though they will eventually be released? Increas\u00ad ing the length of sentences not only increases costs; it also increases the difficulty (and therefore reduces the probability of success) the criminal has in adapting to society upon his/her eventual release. At present, 90 percent of the c,~ses brought before the criminal courts are plea bargained. 5 If we reduced this by 10 percent, we would double eXisting court costs. Can we afford such a step? Many will argue that these should be moral decisions rather than economic decisions; however, history shows that moral considerations have not taken precedence over economic considerations. Probation was instigated and maintained by volunteers in 1841. Probation was first officially legislated in 1878 when Massachusetts passed a law *The diffi culty of these economi c ded s ions is great, because in order to make such choices, we must pl~ce a monetary value on things not normally purchased. 33 I providing for the appointment of a paid probation officer for the courts of criminal jurisdiction in the city of Boston.6 Criminals didn't become less threatening in 1878; rather, society realized that it was much less costly to supervise ex-offenders in the community than to incarcerate them. The same revelation has now occurred with respect to community corrections. Although most crimes are economic in nature, economic analysis of criminal activity has large~y been ignored in the past. It is our responsibility to demand that expen\u00ad ditures for crime prevention be evaluated carefully, in terms of their payoffs, before they are incurred. When money is about to be appro\u00ad priated, our legislators should be able to furnish us with answers to the following questions. 1. Is a similar program in existence anywhere else? If so, and if it has been operating for more than one year, informa\u00ad tion should be available on costs to date, as well as on pro\u00ad jected future costs. In addition, it may be possible to obtain an evaluation of problems, benefits, and predicted long-term results. A community \\~hich is contemplating a costly project resembling others which have not yet been evaluated might find it worthwhile to finance an evaluation of the existing project pri or to committi ng funds to its own. Example: Various states and institutions get caught up, as do individuals, in \"keeping up.\" Because one stilte has a program, planners in another want it too. Unfortunately, plans are often made without evaluation of programs in neighboring ,tates. In a 1976 national study of state women's institutions, cosmetology was the second most commonly cited vocational program offered by the responding institutions. The stated goal of training programs for prisoners is to increase the employability of the participants upon their release; but a total of 24 states restrict cosmetology licenses by either requiring \"good moral character\" or denying ali cense to an \u00a7pp 1 i cant convi cted of a felony 'j nvol vi ng moral terpitude. If a follow-up data on program participants had been maintained at one of these institutions, the others could have seen that this was not a cost-effective program; training people for jobs which they will not be allowed to hold is obviously a waste of tax dollars, as well as human energies. 34 2. What will the start-up costs of the program be, and what will be the total cost for the duration of the project (adjusted for inflation)? Can the program be guaranteed the entire amount? Frequently, very promising programs, involving large in'itial expenditures, are begun, and their funding is terminated before substantial progress can be made. This is one of the reasons many people who have been involved in the criminal justice system for a number of years show little en\u00ad thusiasm for new programs. A program without sufficient funds to see its objectives through will end with wasted dollars, disappointed supporters, and inadequate results. 3. If the program succeeds, will money be available to perpetuate it? This is an important consideration, particularly for pro\u00ad grams financed by federal grants, which often will support a program for two to five years, then terminate funding. At this point, the state must cover the costs of the program. Such demands on a state budget can be met only if they are recognized well in advance. 4. Are funds available to pay for a professional evaluation? 5. Who is paying for the project--federal, state, or local government? What are the opportunity costs of this program? Does creating a halfway house mean there will be less money for vocational training? Will taxes be increased to support the new program? Example: If land is used for a new institution, the state will lose property taxes in that area and may have to increase taxes on other property.9 This was one of the reasons that the residents of Cambridge, Massachusetts, did not want the JFK Museum in their city. If the need for' tax dollars remains con\u00ad stant, existing taxpayers will be required to increase their contributions as the tax base shrinks through dedication of previously taxable property to institutions which are tax-exempt. 6. What will the staffing needs of the program be? Could some of these positions be filled by volunteers? 7. What are the anticipated benefits, both tang'ible and intan\u00ad gible? Will the program involve a reduction in costs, as in the case of probation and halfway houses vs. total institutions? Will the program reduce crime and increase the community's feeling of security, as the Community Watch Programs do? 35 Rational economic decisions must be based on answers to these questions. It is only on this basis that cost and effectiveness can be evaluated, and informed choices made. It is our responsibility as concerned citizens to see that programs are well planned and efficiently run.

Chiles University of Texas at Austin 5~I)4 Punishment is apparently a normal, if not a universal, societal response to the convicted criminal offender. The c.t\\uses of punishment as a response to crime are not clear, but probably involved is a de:~~re for revenge as either a learned or innate response, a belief that punishment modifies undesirable behavior, and a belief that punishment will deter others from crime. Whatever the cause, punishment has deep roots in the customs and traditions of all major societies of the world. Indeed, it is difficult to imagine an organized society where there would be no unplea\u00ad sant consequence to theft, assault, tax evasion, traffic law violations, and other kinds of serious crimes. Social control mechanisms operating outside the criminal justice system provide penalties for socially dis\u00ad approved behavior. Parents use a variety of punitive measure for social\u00ad izing and training their offspring. Expulsion, ostracism, verbal dis\u00ad approval, discharging, fines, and sometimes corporal punishment are used by schools, churches, businesses and other social organizations to punish persons who engage in various kinds of disappi'oved behavior. There are people who believe that the wrongdoer deserves to be punished, and that it is the duty of the state to provide the punishment. This notion is a part of the Jydeo-Christian ethic with its concept of hell and a punitive God. St. Thomas Aquinas saw a need for punishment as indicated in the following statement: Even after the stain of crime is removed there still remains a need of punishment for the healing of the powers of the soul which were disordered by the previous sin. These powers are to be cured, as it were, by contraries. Again punishment is required to restore the equity of justice, and for removing the scandal caused to others, so that, just as they wel'e scandalized by the crime, so they may be edified by the punishment. (quoted from Friel, 1939:4l) Most modern criminologists, however, tend to see punishment as justi\u00ad fied, if at all, by its deterrent effect on others and its tendency to 40 modify behavior. The deterrent notion is well stated by former Chief Justice William Howard Taft: The chief purpose of the prosecution of crime is to punish the criminal and to deter others tempted tv do the same thing from doing it because of the penal consequences ... It is a mistake of huge proportions to lead cri~inals by pampering them, and by relax\u00ad ing discipline of them and the harshness of prison life, to think that they are wards of the state for their comfort, entertain\u00ad ment, and support. (quoted from ~lenninger, 1968:194) Van den Haag (1968:204) more recently wrote of the dettent value of pun\u00ad ishment, pointing out that rewards and punishments do modify behavior as shown in laboratory experiments. Responsiveness to danger, he pointed out, is found in human beings and we often refrain from doing what we woul d otherwi se l'j ke to do because of the danger i nvo 1 ved. As is well kno~m, \",Dwever, there are opponents of punishment as a part of the criminal justice system. Some criminologists, such as Barnes and Teeters (1959:286), have doubted the alleged deterrent effect of punishment and see the idea of deterrence as being inconsistent with the idea of Ilfree will\" upon which the derrent argument has frequently rested. r~enni nger (1968: 78-89), among others, bel i eves there is much i nj usti ce in our criminal justice system. Not only do many people who commit pun\u00ad ishable crimes go unpunished, but many people who commit crimes do so because they have 'previously been dealth with unjustly. Thus punishment often does not \"restore the equity of justice\" as Aquinas supposed, but often increases the inequity that exists in the social system. Punishment is often opposed because it is seen as being antithetical to \"treatment\". Treatment, or reformation of the offender, is apparently thought to have significant implications for preventing recidivism and reducing the crime rate. While most of the money that goes into dealing with the convicted offender is spent for largely custodial fUnctions, a significant amount is also spent for counseling, vocational training, education, and therapy of the offender. A significant amount of federal funds appropriated by the Crime Control and Safe Streets Act has been allotted to correctional programs, apparently in the belief that correc\u00ad tional programs may reduce recidivism. Chief Justice Warren Burger (1972:1) wrote, \"If we are to have any hope of c.orrecting, reforming, 41 rehabilitating, or changing imprisoned criminal offenders, we need a wide range of programs including diagnosis, c:ounseling, education and vocation\u00ad al training, and often intensive psychiatric therapy -and perhaps other steps not yet explored.\" Treatment professionals such as social workers, psychiatrists, psychologists, some sociologists, and some educators, tend to be primarily concerned with the needs and well being of offenders who become clients, or potential clients, through the correctional system. They tend to see punishment as being against the best interests of their client population. T~~tID~nt, as a major response to crime, h~s two limitations, (1) the majority of offenders, not being apprehended, run no more risk of being treated than they do of being punished, and {2} there is no evidence that mass treatment programs are effective in reducing criminal or delinquent behavior. The vast majority of offenders commit property offenses; robbery, burglary, larceny, and auto theft. In 1970 the arrest rates for these offenses were 29%, 19%, 18%, and 17% respectively (F.B.I. 1970:32). In addition to the reported offenses, a large portion go un\u00ad reported and many go undetected. Of the minority of offenders who are caught, convicted and sentenced to prison, a recidivism rate of about one\u00ad third obtains (Glaser, 1964:15); Norris and Hilwkins (1970:11) reported that the English prison system has a similar success rate, and stated: There is some evidence to support what Nigel Walker calls 'the hypothesis of the interchangeability of penal measures.' This is the hypothesis that of the offenders who do not repeat their offenses after a given type of sentence all but a few would have refrained similarly after most other kinds of sentence -in other words, that for most offenders penal measures are interchangeable. In a study of various correc\\;~onal programs in California; including imprisonment vs. probation, length of sentence, treatment programs in prisons, and intensity of probation supervision; Robision and Smith (1971: 80) conclude that \"There is no evidence to support any program's claim to superior rehabilitative efficacy.\" To further damage the case for treatment of criminal offender's is the fact that professionals are not in agreemtn as to the kind of treat\u00ad h;ent that offenders need. The question has not been resolved as to whethe\u00ad most criminal behavior is the result of inner maladjustments or abnormality 42 or the result of outer social circumstances, influences, and opportunities. Social ~lOrkers and psychiatrists tend to see the personal maladjustments of offenders, educators tend to see educational and vocational skill de\u00ad ficiencies, and sociologists tend to emphasize social conditions and re\u00ad lationships conducive to criminal behavior. There is difficulty, however, in linking any given mental problem, educational or vocational deficiency, and any given social condition to criminal behavior. Perhaps the sine ~ non of behavior which the actor knows to be injurious to the welfare and rights of others is in that instance a lack of \u00a3i1Y and probity as asserted by the Italian criminologist, Raffaele Garofalo. That view would make criminal behavior essentially a moral problem without begging the issue as to the. relative merits of punishment or treatment. In the light of the injustice and ineffectiveness of punishment and treatment as primary measures against crime and del i nquency, it is proposed in this paper that where a tort is also a crime, criminal and tort law procedure might be combined so that the amount of damages would be deter\u00ad mined in a criminal case and an order entered for l'estitution. The cor\u00ad recti ona 1 process, then, woul d not be to ei the;' puni sh or correct the offender per se, but rather to use the coercive power of the state to effect restitution, thus correcting the maladjusted relationship between the offender and the offended by correcting the wrong that has been done. Such a procedure would, it is held, be as nearly just as the realities of life permit. It would provide a rational but unpleasant experience for the offender which would relate the offense to the consequences as im\u00ad prisonment or probation alone do not do. At the same time it would negate the dilemma of what treatment program to use with what offender. If an offender has a mental problem or an educational deficiency, treatment or education should be offered him, but treatment or education should not be substituted for his primary responsibility to make restitution. Restitution as a consequence of criminal behavior is, of course, not a new idea. It is frequently a condition of probation in many jurisdic\u00ad tions. What is proposed here, however, is that s0ntences not be for a \"-. ~-~ ~ term of years or months on probation or in prison but rather be. for a specified amount of restitution. 43 Arguments against a system of restitution in lieu of punishment and treat~~~t~re\\ (i~) a rich person could commit crimes and go unpunished because he has'money to make restitution, (2) most offenders do not have resources to make restitution, and (3) there are offenses for which there is no adequate monetary compensation, such as rape and murder. The first objection can be met by pointing out the fact that the rich have an advantage under our present punitive criminal justice system in that the system is biased in their favor from arrest to sentencing. Further\u00ad more, under tort law punitive damages can be awarded, and the risk of financial loss through wrongdoing can be great, or at least as great as the rich person's present risk of being imprisoned for a crime. It is probably true that most offenders do not have resource to make restituion, but the purpose of the correctional system could be to assist the offender in holding or obtaining a job, and with budgeting, so that he or she can make restitution. If that can be done in the community, probation services could be directed to that end. If, for any given offender. restitution wi1l not be made with him at large, institutional opportunities for remunerative employment could be provided. When he has earned enough to make restitution, he ~hou1d be relea~od. If psychiatric or other treatment or educational services are needed while the offender is imprisoned 01' on probation, they should be provided. There are both ancient and modern precedents for a criminal justice system in which restitution is a major purpose. In the early middle ages a code of compensation of the victims of crime developed. The compensation was paid by the offender or his family to the offended or his family. Fines and penance were also used to rectify wrongs. Of these practices Barnees and Teeters (1959:288) wrote, \"Our barbarian ancestors were wisel' and more just than we are today, for they adopted the theory of restitution to the injured, whereas we have abandoned this practice, to the detriment of all concerned.\" Some of our states (California, New York, Massachusetts, Hawaii, Maryland) now have legal provisions for compensation of Victims of violent crimes, but the compensation is paid by the state. And some European countries, including l~est Germany, have legal provisions whereby a tort action can be joined with a criminal action, in which case the 44 court not only determines guilt or innocence but also the amount of damag~s if the finding is guilty (Morris, ed., 1966:7). THE STUDY As might be suggested by the above ideas, a research project was de\u00ad signed to determine (1) the relative success rates of probationers who make restitution and those who do not make restitution, (2) the attitudes of probationers toward restitution, (3) the relative satisfaction with criminal justice of victims who receive restitution and victims who do not receive restitution, and (4) the relative attitudes of the general public toward offenders who make restitution and those who do not make restitution. Research on the last question is the subject of this report. A punitive attitude scale was constructed consisting of a list of five first offenses intended to be progressively more serious. The five offenses were (l) drunk and disorderly, (2) property offense (burglary, robbery, larceny, forgery), (3) assault on a stranger necessitating hospitatlization ~ but causing no permanent injury, (4) forcible rape of a stranger resulting ~ in pregnancy, and (5) murder of a woman after having raped her. The re\u00ad spondents were given a choice of the following eight punishments for each offense: (0) reprimand and release, (1) probation, (2) a short j ail sen- tence (maximum 18 months), (4) a moderate state prison sentence (about 2 yea:rs), (5) a A'i/ere state prison sentence (3 or more years), (6) life imprisonment, ~nd (7) execution. Items 0 and 1 were scored 0, items 2 and 3 were scored 1, items 4 and 5 were scored 2, and items 6 and 7 were scored 3. Thus the total scores for the five offenses could range from o to 15. For purposes of this study two forms of the scaled offenses were used. Form A made no mention of restitution, compensation, or amends. Form B contained a statement for each offense that. the offender had offered to make amends, restitution, or compensation for the offense. The hypothesis ~ that the general public would recommend less punishment for the offen\u00ad der who made restitution or amends for his offense. The hypothesis was tested by comparing the mean scores of respondents completing For A and respondents completing Form B. 45 If the scale is unidimensional there would be an agreemtn among the respondents that each subsequent offense listed is progressively more serious than the preceeding offense and that each punishment listed is progressively harsher than the preceeding one. Thus a respondent '\"ou1d not recommend a harsher punishment for a less severe offense. Form A had 9 errors for 88 respondents, an error rate of 10.3%, and Form B had 10 errors for 93 respondents, an error rate of 10.8%. Using the Cornell scalogram, Form A has a reproducibility of 88.9%. Form B has a reproduc\u00ad bil ity of 86.1%. THE SAMPLE The sample was obtained in Austin, a city of a quarter of a million people located in central Texas. Austin is the capitol of Texas, and The University of Texas with 42,000 students is located there. There are some electronics and small manufacturing firms in Austin, but no heavy industry. There are three other colleges and one other university located at Austin. Thus there is a high portion of students, faculty, white collar and pro\u00ad fessional workers in Austin. Eleven percent of the population is black and fifteen percent have Spanish surnames. The sample was selected randomly from the pages of the Austin tele\u00ad phone directory. A telephone directory is somewhat bias-d in that not everyone has a telephone, and not all telephone numbers are listed. Thus, the study may not reflect the attitudes of the population of Austin as a whole, but the occupations of the respondents are listed and the samp'le is probably not significantly biased for student, white collar and pro\u00ad fessional categories. The selection of respondents to receive Form A and Form B is not biased. There were 20.7% more male than female respon\u00ad dent~. Respondents w~re co~tacted by telephone and asked if they would be willing to fill out a questionnaire stating their recommended punishment for each of five offenses. Two hundred seventy-one persons were contacted by telephone. Forty-six refused, and 225 questionnaires were sent out. corm A and Form B were sent alternatively to every person in the sample. 46 L An attempt was made to obtain an equal number of male and female respon\u00ad dent~, but finally there were approximately 21% fewer women. One hundred eighty-one questionnaires were returned -88 of Form A and 93 of Form B. That is a return of 66.8% of the total number of persons contacted, and a return of 80.4% of questionnaires sent out. Respondents listed age, sex, education, occupation, race, religion, and characterized themselves politically on a seven step scale from very conservative to radical. Ages ranged from 17 to 90 with the median age being 31. There were 82 women and 99 men in the sample. Fourteen respon\u00ad dents had not completed high school; 42 had completed high school only; 63 had more than 16 years of formal education; and 3 did not indicate the amount of education they had experienced. The sample included housewives, students, professionals, educators, clerical workers, laborers, military personnel, businessmen, salesmen, technicians, and retired persons. Sixty\u00ad seven were identified occupationaily with the academic community as stu\u00ad dents, teachers, or administrators. Three respondents did not list occu\u00ad pation, and it was not possible to categorize meaningfully many of the remaining 111 respondents. For purposes of this study the latter group ~lill be called \"the silent majority.\" Of the 181 respondents, 156 indicated they were white, 14 did not in\u00ad dicate race, 8 indicated they were black, 2 indicated they were Mexican\u00ad American, and 1 indicated being Chinese. The sample was predominantly protestant. Forty-one ~espondents either indicated nQ religious pre\u00ad ference, non, or left the item on religious preference blank. Politically, 89 respondents listed themselves as conservative, 83 listed themselves as liberal, 2 indicated they saw themselves as radical, and 7 did not indi\u00ad cate their political orientations. The sample was overwhelmingly white, protestant, well educa.ted, middle-class, and well balanced politically from very conservative to very liberal. FINDINGS There is sufficient evidence to accept the general hypothesis that ~he general public will have a less punitive attitude toward offenders who offer to make restitution. The mean score of respondents who com- 47 pleted Form A (no mention of restitution) is 6.50 whereas the mean score of those who completed Form B (compensation, restitution, or amends offered) is 5.94. With Ns of 88 and 93, and variances of 2.66 and 4.62 respective\u00ad ly, and using the t test the difference between the means is significant at the .05 level. There is also a significant difference (F 7 1.73~ 1.70 at the .01 level) between the variances of the scores of respondents who completed Form A and Form B, another indication that the offer of resti\u00ad tution has some effect on the punitive responses. The significant dif\u00ad ference in means, however, is contained in the men's scores and is absent from the women's scores. The mean for men on Form A is 6.75 whereas the mean for men on Form B is 5.86. With Ns of 48 and 51, and with variances of 2.4 and 2.5 respectively, using the t test the difference is signifi\u00ad cant at the .01 level. The mean for women on Form A is 6.20, and for women on Form B the mean is 6.02. With Ns of 40 and 42, and with variances of 2.8 and 4.6 respectively, the difference in means is insignificant. On the average do men or women tend to be more punitive? For respon\u00ad dents of Form A, the difference between the mean scores for men and women, 6.75 and 6.20 respectively, is significant only at the .10 level. For respondents of Form B, however, the mean score for women was greater than tre mean score for men, 6.02 and 5.85 respectively, but the slight dif\u00ad ference has no statistical significance. The possibility is that women may be less punitive than men on the average, but may also be less in\u00ad fluenced or impressed with an offer of restitution or amends by the offender. The highest mean score of any category tested, 7.23, was found for the age group of 25 to 34 inclusive for Form A. For this category the N is 17 and variance is 1.82. Using a two-ta11ed test there is a significant difference between this category and the 17 to 24 ages group (N = 27, - ? X = 6.14, s~ = 1.97) at the .02 level, and the 35-49 ages group (N = 25, X = 6.20, s2 = 2.66) at the .05 level. The 50 and older age group has a mean of 6.73, and N = 19, and a variance of 2.09. The difference in means of this age category and the 25 to 34 age group is significant only at the .20 level. For each age category, the mean scores of the respon\u00ad dents of Form B were lower than for Form A, a fact consistent with the 48 general hypothesis. For only one age group, however, the 25-34 year olds, is the difference statistically sigO'lficant. The mean for that age group for Form B is 5.89, N = 19, and s2 = 5.488. The mean score on Form A for this age group is 7.23, a difference which is statistically signi\u00ad ficant at the .025 level. There areno significant differences between age categories for respondents of Form B. The sample was composed primarily of students, teachers and faculty, professionals, white collar, and upper blue collar workers. The only de\u00ad finite categories that could be made ~Iere (1) stlldents, teachers, and faculty, and (2) otheY's, which for want of a better characterization is designated by the term \"silent majority.\" There is no difference in the means of group 1 and group 2 of respondents of Form B, each mean being 5.9. There is a significant difference in variances, however. The student, teacher and faculty group has an N of 36 and s2 = 7.7, whereas the \"sil ent majority\" group of Form B has an N of 56 and s2 = 2.8, a difference in variances which is statistically significant at the .01 level. The aca\u00ad demic community apparently varies more in its response to an offer of restitution than do others. There is no significant variance in the re\u00ad sponses of the \"silent majority\" and the academic people for Form A. For Form A the \"silent majority\" has an N of 55, X = 6.7, and s2 = 2.56. Students, teachers and faculty have an N of 31, X = 6.10, and an s2 = 2.65. The difference between the means is significant using the two-tailed t test, at the .10 level. The difference between means of Form A and Form B for the \"silent majority\" is significant at the .01 level in the direction predicted. Respondents were asked to characterize themselves politically and were given choices from very conservative to radical. Respondents checking any of the conservative choices were counted as conservative, and respondents checking any of the liberal or the radical choice were counted as liberal. For Form A, conservatives had an N of 39, s2 = 2.66, and a X = 6.84. Lioerals on Form A had an N of 46, s2 '\" 2.34,. and a X = 6.15. Conserva\u00ad tives might be expected to be more punitive in that concepts of confo~ity ~nd \"10,\"1 andorder\" have been associated with conservative politics. Using Lone-tailed t test the differencein mean scores between conservatives and 49 liberals is significant at the .025 level. For Form B conservatives had an N = 50, s2 = 4.07, and a X = 6.18. Liberals on Form B had an N of 39, and s2 = 4.56, and a X = 5.41. The difference in mean scores for conser\u00ad vatives and liberals on Form B is significant at the .05 level. Differences in means for conservatives of Form A and conservatives of Form B, and for liberals of Form A and liberals OT Form B, are also significant at the .05 level. Conservatives of Form A have the highest scores as expected, and liberals of Form B have the lowest scores as expected. The comparison of means scores of conservatives and liberals on both forms supports the general hypothesis that the public will be less punitive toward offenders who offer to make restitution. CONCLUDING OPINION Punishment of the convicted offender in some form \\~ill probably be a part of the criminal justice system in the future as it has been in the past. In recent years there has been an increase in the use of probation and parole in lieu of imprisonment. By 1969 California was committing to prison only 9.8 percent of persons convicted in Superior Courts (Smith, 1972:48). Imprisonment will no doubt be continued as a part of the penal system, however, and between 1967 and 1970 there was a slight in\u00ad crease in federal and state prison populations (NPS Bulletin, 1972). Treatment, education, and rehabilitation will continue to be a part of the penal system. Reform in the criminal justice system, however, will probably be in the direction of eliminating bail and pre-trial detention for most offenders, definite and equal sentences for equal offenses in place of indeterminate sentences, elimination of morai offenses from criminal law, a greater use Df fines in lieu of imprisonment, and ~ greater emphasis on restituti on to the victim .Ql ttie 'offender. Whereas the present concept of corrections is that of correcting the behavior of tha offender, the future concept of corrections may well be that of helping and/or coercing the offender to correct the wrong done to the victim. This study indicates that when restitution is offered the public will demand less punishment for the offender. If the system pro\u00ad vided for an assurance of restitution through the helping and coercive 50 powers of the state, the public might well accept restitution in lieu of any formal punishment of treatment of the convicted offender. 51 THE PRIVATE SECTOR CRIME RESISTANCE Federal Bureau of Investigation Birmingham, Alabama Pol ice Depa)'tment DeKalb County, Georgia Police Department Norfolk, Virginia Police Department Wilmington, Delaware Bureau of Police MESSAGE FROM THE DIRECTOR When we committed the Federal Bureau of Investigation to these crime resistance programs, I was aware that a significant reduction in crime could be achieved only in the long term. Our initial purpose was to demonstrate that communities would look to law enforcement for for guidance in setting up programs and in providing them with current information that would make them less vulnerab,e to crime. It was my hope that these task forces would develop guideiines that other depart~ ments could adopt to stimulate their own communities to engage in crime resistance programs-programs offering promise and yet able to be con\u00ad ducted within present budget limitations. This report clearly supports the view that citizens can and will be involved in individual and community self-help efforts that reduce the opportunities for crime. Helping citizens to resist crime is not another community relations program. It is, instead, a distinct law enforcement function. Educating and alerting people to how they can reduce their vulnerability to the crimes about them is a continuing responsibil ity of law enforcement, and it is as necessary as a patrol force. Like other selective enforce\u00ad ment techniques, crime resistance efforts can be concentrated when nec\u00ad cessary to address the vulnerabilities of particular sex and age groups and to alert people to specific crime problems in identified geographic areas of their community. 52 BIRMINGHAM Birmingham, Alabama, is al~ industrial aUt\" \"t 380,000 people loaated in the the stat\". The main in\u00ad dustry in city is the $8.692. The aity'B population Bworn offiaerB of the Binningham Poliae Department. Trafficking in stolen property was the target of the Birmingham task force, and they took on the problem with considerable speed and fanfare. Their efforts have been closely interwoven ~Iith the regular operations of the Birmingham Police Department, with bcmefits to both the department and the task force. The city haj been the site of heavy commerce in stolen property in recent years, especially television sets taken in home burglaries, stereos and tape decks stolen from automobiles, and most recently, citizens band radios. The police property room, as repeated crime re\u00ad sista,\\ce television spots have emphasized, has been jammed with un\u00ad returnable stolen goods. Thus, the task force launched a campaign to mark personal property in order to make it less likely to be stolen and more readily returnable if stolen. The city had been trying for several years to stem the flow of stolen property through a police-oriented marking campaign, but had met with little success: The effort had been characterized by public apathy. This time, with the particular neighborhood-centered approach of crime resistance, the effort appeared to be far more successful. Chief Parsons says he ~Ias doubtful at first, but found that there was\"a groundswel1 of volunteerism\" that had not been tapped before. r4any i ndi rect benefi ts seem to have ari sen from thi s effort, i ncl uding increased neighborhood cohesiveness, improved police-community rela\u00ad tions, and positive community action. Much of the job of community organization had already been accomplished, as the city of Birmingham is divided into 84-separate districts, each with elected nfficers. Th\u20ac!se organizations and the 53 crime resistance campaign seemed made for each other. Crime resistance fit in naturally with this neighborhood-oriented community structure and in fact gave it some direction. Presidents of the neighborhoods organized'groups of block and street captains. Armed with etching tools, these individuals headed teams that went door-to-door and des\u00ad cribed to residents the virtues of marked property. Citizens were ad\u00ad vised to use their Social Security or Alabama driver's license numbers for easy identification. For the elderly, who might have trouble with the etchers, the Boy Scouts volunteered to assist the marking campaign in their own neighborhoods. All B4 neighborhoods are now in\u00ad volved in a marking program. Task force officers drummed on the etching theme during evening hours at the monthly neighborhood meet~ngs. Speaking of the rise in thefts of CB radios -from 56 in August 1975 to 350 in December 1975- one officer told a neighborhood group that juveniles sell stolen CBs for $20 or the equtvalent in drugs. \"So if you have a CB radio and don't have it marked, you could be buying drugs for some kid,\" he said. \"But marked, the radios are nearly worthless. We'vE! had them drop them right down beside the car when they find the numbers. I don't believe they will steal anything that is marked.\" Another tactic has been to h~vc repair shops-85 of them throughout the city-mark television sets and stnreos with the customer's license number or Social Security number when they are repaired. In addition, major CB radio outlets are now etching the serial number on the chassis of CB radios and recording this same number on the company's business card, which is given to the CB radio owner to carry in his wallet. A police-sponsored group of CB enthusiasts stages its own marking program on weekends in various shopping centers. To encourage other CB radio owners to mark their radios, the same group, along with the Birmingham Traffic Bureau, has begun a campaign in which leaflets are placed on vehicles with CB antennas. 54 To aid in implementing the property identification program, fOUl' hundred etchers were purchased with the help of the Jaycees, a local bank, the Insurance Adjustors of America, and the city. House decals were purchased with assistance from the Birmingham Civitan Club. IN THE TIME IT TOOK TO PLACE THIS NOTICE ON YOUR CAR, A THIEF COULD HAYE EASILY STOLEN YOUR C8 RADIO.

It secured an agreement with the major department store chains to send the nam~s of their customers and the serial numbers of all television sets sold to the police department for entry into its computer. That wouid have been a major percentage of the 38,000 sets sold in the city every year, but the data processing people in the police de\u00ad partment couldn't handle the volume. With all of this marking going on, the Birmingham Police Depart\u00ad ment decided to try for a greater recovery of stolen property. It set up a fenci ng deta i1 a\" ows ci ti zens to call in I~ith anonymous information about stolen property and to check whether items they have received are stolen. Businessmen are aho taking advantage of the \"hot line.\" When a businessman is given the opportunity to purchase an item from a citizen, he may call the \"hot line\" giving his name, phone number-and serial number of the item. The operator then checks the serial number through the National Crime Information Center (NCIC) and calls the businessman back advising him if the serial number is listed in the computer. Local media have cooperated by publicizing the telephone number. It is obvious a thief could also use this \"hot line\" number, but to date the advantages seem to outweigh the disadvantages. The inquiries are aver\u00ad aging 15 a week. Anothel\" effort has been to co 11 ect seri a 1 numbers of bus i ness machines from repair shops and run them through the NCIC computer on a weekly basis. The cooperation from high volume \"walk-in\" repair shops was most valuable because those shops are most likely to receive stolen machines. The task force reported receiving three \"hits\" the second month th~ project was in operation. One objection that had to be overcome was a fear expressed by some shop owners that a customer, identified as a holder of stolen property thro~gh this effort, would find out who had reported him. The owners 56 1 _______ , were advised that this might occur, but that their identities would not be made public if at all possible. The owners were also reminded of their civic duty to help curb crime. Some -of the other achievements of the Birmingham task force are: A major department store agreed to place the crime resistance logo in its newspaper ads for television sets. The post office in Birmingham adopted the crime resistance slogan on cancellation of all letters for one month in the Fall of 1976 (see Appendix 7). One of the area's largest grocery chains has agreed to print the crime resistance logo on its grocery bags. The telephone company ran a series of articles about the crime resistance effort in its customer newsletter. The Birmingham Advertising Steering Committee agreed to develop an advertising campaign to encourage citizens to \"Join the Resistance\" and mark their personal items. The real key to a successful crime resistance program is citizen involvement. Birmingham aroused citizen interest through 20 television appearancl~s, 15 radio shows, 54 newspaper articles and 88 speeches before val'ious audiences. As interest in the pro'gram grew, four local companies published crirre resistance articles in their own publications. The telephone company published an article in its paper that reaches 3,200,000 subscribers, as did the power company, with 190,000 subscribers. 57 DEKALB COUNTY DeKal,b County, Georgia, is a warehousing distribution cel\"ter as ~,eZZ as a regional, headquarters for many businesses. This residential, c.ommunity l,oaated adjacent to and east of Atl,anta is a middl,e cl,ass suburban county with a popul,ation of 463,000, 33.5 percent of whom lIre youths, ages 1? and younger. The mean income per househol,d is $1?,016. The DeKal,b County Pol,ice Department empl,oys 364 sworn officers. From projects conducted in DeKalb County, it appears that the problem of crimes against youths can be addressed through citizen participation through many existing resources: the schools, the Parent-Teachers Associations, the parks and recreation department, and parents -and each one of these resources in DeKalb County was tapped. The number of reported crimes against youth in the county was relatively small in comparison with other crimes. Neverthe'less, the strategies tested there may well be applicable, with some adaptation, to most other parts of the country. An analysis of 1,160 reported crimes against youth showed that larceny (principally bicycle thefts) represented 43 percent of the crimes committed against youths; assault, 19 percent; sex offenses, 15 percent; and child abuse and neglect, almost 11 percent (see Appen\u00ad dix 8). Before crime resistance, the county had a block parent structure designed to provide a safe haven for children who felt threatened, but is was loosely organized and, like many other such efforts, hac' largely fallen into disuse. Rather than attempt to revive the entire system involving 82 elementary schools, the task force decided to con\u00ad centrate on one target area. The area the team selected had 15 schools and eXperienced 45 percent of the reported youth victimization. Nine schools had block parent programs, SOmf! more active than others. 58 Working through the safety chairman of the county PTA, the task force was able to persuade the principals and PTA presidents of five of those schools that were not actively involved in the program to adopt it and to join the others in a coordinated block parent operation throughout the area. The task force held meetings with each school's PTA or existing block parent group. As other task forces had found, the use of timely, accurate infor\u00ad mation is crucial in getting people to sit up and take notice. Discus\u00ad sion of the youth ct'ime statistics for the target area caused parents and school officials to realize that crime against youth in that area was a problem needing immediate attention. The block parent program appeared to be an appropriate vehicle to muster community involvement. Supervision of each school's block parent effort is up to either the PTA safety chairman or a designated block parent chairman who in turn seeks out mature, responsible block parent volunteers- preferably at least one per block. As a check on the volunteer's trustworthiness, each is required to undergo a cdminal record check. The community services unit of the DeKalb County Police Department coordinated the screening of prospective block parents. The task force assisted in the recruitment of approximately 100 block parents. One school failed to start a program because several PTA members were opposed to the screening process. They felt a volunteer should be accepted without screening. The county PTA executive council supported the police department in requiring the criminal records check. The task force wrote a carefully designed set of instructions for block parents. Among the duties spelled out for the volunteers are: Being aware of suspected and known criminal activity within the neighborhood, which may be directed at youth. Reporting such activity to the police department and other block parents. Providing their homes as a safe refuge for a child who has been threatened, attacked, or is in fear of being harmed. 59 Engendering among parents and neighbors leadership and responsibility in making a safe and secure neighborhood for children. Engag'ing actively in a telephone alert network among block parents to thwart victimization of youths. Creating responsible neighborhood action in assisting in crime prevention and detection. The task force designed and implemented a block parent telephone network within and among 14 participating school districts in the county. Either the block parent, the block parent chairman, the crime resis\u00ad tance officer aSSigned to the operation, or the school principal can initiate an alert. Among the causes for such an alert are: Unidentified or suspicious youths or adults roaming the neighborhoods during periods when younger children are at play or going to or from school. Unidentified or suspicious vehicles cruising the neighbor\u00ad hoods. Chil dren accosted by unknovin adults or 01 der youths. Situations which appear to reflect a child being enticed by a stranger. Any other incident suspected or known to involvp, the criminal victimization of a youth. The DeKalb block parent effort is in constant touch with one receives each police incident report involving a youthful victim of the crime resistance officers, designated as block parent analyst, who advises the individual chairman regularly about crin~ incident patterns in their neighborhoods. Every day, the task force analyst receives each police incident report involvi~g a youthful victim, and advises the ap.propriate block parent chairman of this information when that step is warranted. In this way the network is kept humming and the children are protected. 60 When on duty, each block parent has a large yellow sign with black BLOCK PARENT letters in his or her window. The parent receiVes instruction in first aid, emergency telephone numbers, procedures for reporting crime and suspected criminal activity to police, types of possible criminal situations that might occur, procedures for operating the telephone alert system, and procedures for assisting a child in need. As a result of the response of the participants, the task force is now in the process of spreading the block parent program throughout the entire county. Bicycle theft, although not a major crime, is a significant crime against youths in DeKalb County. During a l2-month period, there were 1,250 thefts representing a loss of $114,000. In many instances, the theft of a youth's bicycle marks the first time that the youth comes into contact with the criminal justice system. In attacking the problem of bicycle. theft, the task force used two tactics-a cqmpaign to get youths to lock them. Data showed that previously a large number of stolen bicycles had been recovered but could not be returned to their owners because the bicycles lacked identifying marks. Instead, the bicycles had to be sold at auction. To assist in identifying stolen bicycles, the task force developed a decal and a unique registration identification numbering ~ystem. Steel stamping dies that punch a registration number into the metal of a bike frame and decals with the corresponding registration number were used to mark bicycles. To get the registering and marking done, task force members held three bike roundups at which bikes were registered and marked; got all repair shops to mark the bicycles for free; obtained the help of a chain of national fast f<'od shops in publicizing the regis\u00ad tration campaign; and enlisted all 20 county fire stations and several civic organizations in the effort. After only 5,000 of an estimated 100,000 bikes in the county were registered in the first three months, the task force members decided to implement the campaign on the neighborhood level. The PTA, the block 61 parents, and the recreation associations were called upon to hold local registration roundups. The Boy Scouts agreed to register the bikes of all their members and also to offllr a special \"Official Crime Resistor\" card and a logo seglJll!nt for the district patch to any Scouts who could register five others (See Appendix 9). As an added bonus, if 80 per\u00ad cent of the members of a scout troop achieved their five bike quotas, the troop received a certificate of appreciation from FBI Director Kelley. A department store agreed to print 50,000 \"Lock and Register Your Bike\" brochures for a fraction of the regular printing cost. Finally, the school authorities agreed to consider requiring every student bringing his bike on campus to have it locked and registered. To enhance the car,npaign to encourage youths to lock their bicycles, the task force produced public service announcements, gained the support of the local parks and recreation department in selling locks at a reduced rate, and developed a symbol for traffic signs to remind youths to lock their bicycles. In the first half of 1976, only 64 percent of the nonregistered bicycles which came into the possession of the police were returned to their owners, while all of the registered bicycles were returned. The task force arranged to have a central registry for reported child abuse and neglect cases initiated in the Department of Family and Children Services. A Department of Family and Children Services\u00ad Police Coordinator was also established in the police department, be\u00ad cause the task force had discovered that the police were not always notified of these cases by other agencies, such as the Health Depart\u00ad ment and the Board of Education. Although single incidents of abuse or neglect might not appear significant, a pattern of such incidents might demand a prompt police or social agency investigation. Through these improved procedures much could be done to prevent child abuse or potential child abuse situations in certain families from continuing and growing worse. Cases of chil d abuse and negl ect are now reported to the pol i ce department. There was a 43 percent increase in reported child abuse 62 and neglect in the first half of 1976 over the number of cases re\u00ad ported in the same period in 1975. A strategy aimed at reducing these types of offenses has not yet been'fully developed. When the members of the DeKalb task force began operating, they conducted a youth victimization survey among 805 high school students to determine the students' attitudes' toward reporting certain types of crimes, their own victimization histories, their perceptions of the seriousness of different offenses, their suggestions for preven\u00b7 tion of these offenses, and their willingness to participate in an elective course in crime resistance. From the students' answers, the task force concluded, \"In gen\u00ad eral, youth have a fatalistic acceptance of the inevitability of crime. They underreported each of the crimes studied by the task force and appeared to have a confused understanding of the criminal justice system and law.\" On the other hand, 85 percent of the students said they would be interested in enrolling in a crime resistance course. As a result, in mid-October 1975 the task forc~ went to the ad\u00ad ministrators of one of the 23 DeKalb County high schools and asked whether a crime resistance course could be installed on a pilot basis. At the request of the instructional coordinator of secondary social studies, task force members designed a proposed curriculum, and by February 1976 they received approval to initiate the course during the spring semester. The proposed curriculum, drafted with the assistance of local attorneys, included material on Georgia law, criminal justice procedures, the rights of juveniles and adults and a full-scale mock trial in the classroom (see Appendix 10). The task force says the course was designed \"to educate youth re\u00ad garding their vulnerability to crime throughout their lives and the responsibility for reducing the opportunity for victimization.\" Thirty-five students enrolled in the course, which ran from March to June, five days a week. The instructor found that the students mastered even some of the very technical aspects of the law and did a significant amount of research on their own for special projects-interviewing lawyers, 63 judges, police officers, store owners, and so forth. Among the student projects: IIDesign and administer a questionnaire survey among the businessmen withi n the communi ty to determi ne what they can do to prevent and reduce crime against their businesses. \"Interview ten victims of crime regarding the circum\u00ad stances which caused their victimization and what they could have done to prevent the crime from occurring. \"Des; gn and admini ster a questi onnai re survey among twenty-five students to determine what they can do to reduce crime against themselves. \"Design and administer a questionnaire survey among twenty parents to determine what they can do to pre\u00ad vent crime victimization of their children.\" The students took great interest in a mock bank robbery trial. The deferise counsel and prosecutor interviewed witnesses and consulted with a local attorney to help prepare their cases. But because of lack of evidence, deliberately planned by those who prepared the course, the trial ended with a hung jury. County administrators believe that the course is a success, and it will be considered as a permanent elective after a year's evaluation period. The course wi 1 be made available to three additional high schools during the fall of 1976. One of the approaches that did not work in DeKalb involved the attempt to reduce larceny.from autos. Approximately half of the thefts of stereo tape pl ~yet\u00b7s, tapes, and speakers from cars occur on school property. To combat this theft problem, the task force pro\u00ad posed the creation of a crime resistance patrol. This patrol would consist of selected students who would patrol school parking lots during school hours, assist in the deterrence of thefts, and identify would-be thieves. But in this case the task force had been isolated from the school community in conducting its planning. The school principal thought the program was too complicated and the students felt it was a \"snitch\" program, and so it was abandoned. 64 To publicize the projects and to gain citizen support, the task force appeared on a number of television programs and radio 5hows. In addition, public service announcements were frequently aired on local television\"and radio stations. Thirty-five articles were published in local newspapers. Task force members also gave approximately 75 speeches to schools, block parents, PTA meetings and civic and neighborhood groups. What happens after these projects are over? Will crime resistance fade away like so many other programs? Chief Hand says he plans to make crime resistance a permanent part of his department. It \\~i1l be com\u00ad bined into a new unit called Community Services and Crime Resistance. Says Chief Hand, ill feel it is as important as patrol and criminal investigation. It fills a major gap in both. If we can get all of them tied together, then we'll do a much better job of crime control.\" 65 NORFOLK Norfolk. Virginia. is the site of the world's largest navaZ base and is one of the principaZ east coast seaports. With a population of 289.000. the city's average household income is $8.984. This ethnically balanced community is served by 622 sworn Officers of the Norfolk Police Depal'tment. At the outset of the crime resistance program in Norfo1k, the task force there found that its tliOSt difficult job was obtaining information about women as victims of crime. At first the four task force members pulled 4,000 offense reports for calendar year 1974, manually selected 2,419 reports Which indicated either mUl'der, rape, robbery, felonious assault, or purse-snatching, and culled 701 reports involving crimes against women. From these reports the team determined that 62 percent of these crimes occurred in an area inhabited by 29 percent of the city's population. In contrast to Wilmington's findings concerning crimes against the elderly, team members found that most of these crimes against women occurred dUring the period from six o'clock in the evening to midnight. They suspected a possible connection between the amount of lighting and the incidence of crime in a given area, but the data necessary to test this hypothesis were not available, nor was there any indication of whether the victims were alone. The task force unit decided it would concentrate on stranger-to stranger street crimes-rape, purse-snatching, and robbery-but they needed more information about the victims. One of the first things the task force did was to convince the Norfolk Police Department to expand its incident reports to a greater degree. Team suggestions for 20 new data points concerning victimization history. lighting at a crime scene, activities of the victim just before the crime. and precautions taken. or not taken, by the victim. 66 These data can demonstrate more clearly to women, the potential victims, the situations that present the greatest risk. The data should also provide women a wider range of the precautions they can take to protect themselves. Other changes the task force introduced addressed the fear and reluc\u00ad tance of rape victims to report to the police. Only 43 percent of the victims who sought help through a volunteer rape counseling service (Tidewater Rape Information Service) dudng the last quarter of 1974 went to the police. Lessening a rape victim's grief has no immediate effect on the number of victims, but it does increase the likelihood that rape vic\u00ad tims will come to the police for help, and will remain cooperative during the emotionally difficult time following the rape. That w.ean\u00a3 identification and prosecution of more rapists. The Norfolk unit developed public service announcements, taped a series of radio spots, and assisted in the production of dramatized television messages about crimes against women. Some examples of these messages are set forth in Appendix 11. Through radio programs, a crime resistance message reached an average of 141,000 households, through television an average of 236,000 households, and through newspaper articles an average of 460,000 persons. In addition, public service announcements reached an estimated three million people in the greater Norfolk area during a six-week period in May and June 1976. Because so many young people are involved, as both victims and perpetrators in crimes against women, it was the strong conviction of the Norfolk task force that the schools can playa major part in crime resistance. Says Chief Brown, \"We see crime as a deep social malady, and it's my personal belief that crime resistance has to be deeper than the development of a flashy button. It's got to be something that enfolds the enti re communi ty. \" 67 The Norfolk t\\ 1m in cooperation with the school system, organized a community committee of professionals and laymen that is devl.\"'oping a crime resistance curriculum for use throughout all grades in the school system. Twr; other strategies vlere also implemented. The school system, the courts, and the police cooperated in developing a procedure to deal with truants. Beginning April 1, 1976, after significant press coverage and letters explaining the procedure were sent to each student's home, the policE department assigned four patrol units, when not on call, to the task of picking up truants. All patrol officers wore also encouraged to check possible truants and the community was asked to assist in locating truants. Juveniles who were truants were taken directly to juvenile court where they remained until their parents or guardians arrived to take custody. In April, 205 juveniles were picked up for truancy. This policy also resulted in a truant being charged with possession of stolen property, another with contributing to the delinquency of a minor, five with armed robbery, three with grand larceny, and ten with burglary. The police did not keep a specific count, but they received many calls from citizens regarding possible truants in their neighbor\u00ad hood. The polic~ department assigned two police officers-a husband and wife team-tq. conduct workshops for females on personal snfety and awareness of street crimes. Forty of these class~s were given to senior girls in Norfolk's five high schools. The emphasis of these workshops was how to protect oneself against the possibility of rape, robbery, and purse-snatching, but they also included other street cI\"imes. These classes were given to approximately 3,000 female high school students. In addition, 200 female city employees were given time off to attend these workshops. The Norfolk task force recognized several continuing programs\u00ad three in particti~Jr -within the Norfolk Police Department that could aid in the implementation of its crime resistance effort. It was decided to piggyback three of these programs to bolster the crime 68 L resistance effort. One of these programs, the Civilian Radio Motor Patrol, involved <trea residents who used two-way radios, commercial1y or otherwise. Because these people ~Iere extra eyes and ears for the police oJ 'suspicious activities, including those relating to the crimes targeted by the task force. To aid these citizens in assisting the pulice, they are provided with appropriate information. The Officer Friendly Program, also an ongoing endeavor, was only a part-time function of a police officer. As a result, many schools did not receive an Officer Friendly visit. Before school administrators were l~il1ing to commit themselves to a crime resistance education program they asked for a further commitment from the police department for the Officer Friendly Program. To meet this request; two police officers have been assigned fUll-time to the program and are involved with curriculum planning. They are scheduling three visits to each primary public school in Norfolk during the coming year. They intend to em\u00ad phasize not only safety precautions but also appropriate crime resis\u00ad tance information. Another \"piggyback\" effort by the ta!:% force has involved arranging fur personal safety advice. to homeowners in residential anti-burglary surveys done by the Police-Community Relations Unit. The department recognized that this was ar. opportunity to make families aware of their vulnerability not only to burglaries, but also to other crimes, such as rape, robbery, and purse-snatching. 69 WILMINGTON Wilmington, DeZlZbJare, is Zoaated south of PhiZadeZphia. The ahe~iaal industry provides empZoyment for many of WiZmington's aitizens, whose median inaome is $8,050. Persons 60 years of age or oZder represent 20 aent empZoys 255 sworn offiaers. The Wilmington task force discovered that almost all of the street crimes against the elderly (individuals 60 and older) in that city were committed against women, and that a great mtijority of these crimes were hit-and-run purse snatches. As the task force said in its Decem\u00ad ber 1975 report, \"The purse in open view provides not only an easy target for the opportunistic street robber, but presents ... an open invitation which is difficult to ignore.\" Becaus(; most of the elderly women were attacked in their own neighbornoods, thE' task force concluded that, on most occasions, they could have avoided the crime by leaving the invitation at home and taking ?nly those items they needed for their errands. It sounds easy to tell women to stop carrying pocketbooks unless absolutely necessary, but altering a life pattern is a monumental task. Nevertheless, the approach had to be tried. The team used all the usual methods for disseminating information. Through public service announcements, talk shows, and news shows on local, area, and national television, free advertisements in local newspapers and mrrgazines, shopping b~g leaflets, articles appearing in local and Philadelphia newspapers, and a bookmark designed by a local business, the crime resistance message has reached the eyes and ears of half a million people in Wilmingt~n and the surrounding areas. Members of the task force have made personal appearances before nearly 5,000 people at senior centers, high-rise apartments, and civic and service organizations. 70 _n THf RISISTANCI CRIME TIPS FOR SENIOR CITIZENS WHAT YOU SHOULO DO TO REDUCE YOUR CHANCES OF BECOMING A VICTIM OF STREET CRIME This Bookmarker is given by The Wilmington Crime Resistance OHice ~OIn THI RISIRANCI III [PHONE 658-4300 Do These in Self Defense 1.

The team als,~ used the results of a survey of offenders done for them at the ferris School, a delinquent boys' detention center. Be\u00b7 sides advising people not to walk alone and not to carry pocket\u00b7 71 The task force emphasized what its survey revealed: that women who had been attacked and had stopped carrying purses were not being victimized again. The team also used the results of a survey of offenders done for them at the Ferris School, a delinquent boys' detention center. Be\u00ad sides advising people not to walk alone and not to CJrry pocketbooks, the youths, according to their interviewer, had these thoughts about women who carry purses: ... If someone was carrying a pocketbook, hanging down, just with their fingers, she didn't have any cash in there anyway, so you are just wasting your time. Look for the person that's holding onto her pocketbook, either hanging on her arm or holding it in front of her chest or stomach. If a woman knows that somebody is around, and has money in her pocketbook, she will put it close to her body--. that's one of the pocketbooks you need to hit because you can bet there is some cash in there.\" Asked what happens to elderly women who fight back, one youth replied, \"They get stepped on.\" The task force members realized that they had to offer a practical alternative to carrying purses. The unit conceived a \"pocket the purse\" project in which women would be shown how to sew pockets into their dresses, jackets, and coats. These pockets would hold all the items necessary for a particular errand. With the assistance of a sewing machine manufacturer, a group of volunteer seamstresses designed a pattern for such a pocket (see Appendix 12). This pattern was then distributed by the task force to all of the city's senior centers, community groups, and high-rise apartments for the elderly. A question frequently raised by elderly women is, \"Once the criminals find out about the hidden pockets, won't they start tearing our clothes off?\" Task force members are assuring these ladies that publicity concerning the pockets is being limited to groups of elderly persons and women and, moreover, that purse-snatchers look for obvious targets. 72 Another Wilmington project dealing with the reality of street crimes is an escort companion program. It evolved from recognition of the fact that a large majority of: reet crime victims are unaccompanied. A companio!!, even another elder,y person, helps to discourage \",ould-be purse-snatchers and. when a crime occurs, to increase the odds that the criminal can be identified. A task force considered a variety of approaches to develop the escort companion program. One approach involved the selection of teenage students or Scouts who vlOuld be given credit for accompanying the elderly to places where they must walk. This approach met with many obstacles, although what did work to a certain degree was the use of interested elderly persons to serve as escorts. One volunteer who lives in a high-rise apartment for the elderly said he makes a point.of approaching every elderly woman he sees alone in his neighborhood and asking if he can accompany her. He does it as a person committed to the crime resistance approach but, more important, he does it as a neighbor. According to this volunteer, It's a sin to have to sacrifice two-fifths of our daily lives-\u00ad that's what it amounts to. We've lost that time. The old folks are afraid to enjoy the lovely things that happen 'in the evenings: bingo part'ies, viSits with friends . Unless we accept the responsibility for a bit of the keeping of our brvther, we're just going to have to live in enclaves. Besides pedestrians escorts, the Wilmington task force line9 up volunteers to serve as escorts on wheels. These people are screened by the department and issued \"Join the Resistance\" stickers for their cars and identification cards for wallet or purse. The \\~ilmington Rotary Clubs both financed the printing of the stickers and provided the init.ial volunteers. With the exception of volunteers from reputable service clubs such as Rotary and Kiwanis, participants in this program are being limited to men and women over 50 years of age in order to emphasize maturity and responsibility. 73 To overcome the suspicions that elderly persons would have of volunteer escorts, each escort is issued identification by the police. Three communities in Wilmington, which contain several housing complexes for the elderly. were selected for neighborhood-based escort programs. r'n the p.rpcess of .Jele~ting escorts, each neighborhood established block watch organizations. T!1e block watch unit is an excellent vehicle for introducing other crime resistance programs into the neighborhood communities and for developing volunteers at a grass\u00ad roots level to be responsible for the operation of those program activities.. The payoff from the block watch program was almost immediate. In the same month that the organizations weY'e formed, a purse-snatch was ar-restec :JS a result of :thedescription given by block watch Badge idenafies volunteers who accompany elderly persons 01, errands. 74 As noted, the Wilmington task force initially assumed that most of the crimes against the elderly took place in the early evening hours. But, after reviewing the offense data, task force members realized they were wrong: The majority of crimes took place during school hours. In addition, most of the assailants were described as being in their early teens, and Wilmington has a high (28 percent) truancy rate. The conclusion as to a course of action was inescapable. The task force took its findings to the superintendent of schools, and obtained a commitment to begin, in the fall of 1976, to provide special programs for truants once they are returned to the schools. The inevitable problam of paying for the personnel, materials, and administration of the remedial instruction of truants appeared to be a stumbling block until the task force presented the program to the Delaware Agency to Reduce Crime as a legitimate crime reduction effOi't. As a result, plans are under~Jay for the agency to provide the funds needed to implement the program. The next problem, of course, was to get the truants back in school. That effort would require close cooperation from the Hilmington Police Department in apprehending truants found on the streets during school hours, especially in high vulnerability areas--a job that requires close crime resistance-patrol coordination. The family courts would also play a vital role in assigning truants to the special classes. There were many loose ends that had to be tied down if the truancy effort were to be in operation by the beginning of the school year, but the outlook seemed promising. Nearly every elderly person the task force met expressed deep con\u00ad cern about the courts, especially the ease with which young offenders were returned to the streets. It is the main reason, they believe, that the city has so much crime. In the words of the task force mem\u00ad bers, \"Discouragement and despair characterize a large segment of the elderly population in Wilmington when discussing the criminal justice system in the city.\" 75 e Most court monitoring efforts have been aimed at protecting the rights of the defendant and, perhaps as a result, these rights have been carefully guarded. Few attempts h~ve been made to monitor the ,courts on behalf of the victim to see that the sanctions of the law are not forgotten. As a result, Monitors Aiding Justice in Court (Operation MAJIC) was devised for just such monitoring by elderly volunteers in court cases involving elderly victims or witnesses. The volunteers take note of such things as the punctuality of witnesses and judges, the number of delay~ and continuances, whether or not the arresting officer was present, how well prepared the prosecuting attorney's case appeared to be, and whether or not the final judgment was fair and just from the victim's point of view (see form in Appendix 13) . The purpose of gathering this information is to determine whether reforms are needed to make the criminal justice system work effectively for the elderly. If reforms were needed, the ta~~ force says, the hope is that the information develuped by the volunteers will \"lay the foun\u00ad dation for a genuine citizens' movement whereby a united community may take action in an area vital to the assurance of safer city streets.\" A task force report continues: If the ordeal of prosecution can be made less strenuous for the elderly victim, if his fears and confusion concerning the criminal justice system can be aliayed by means of counseling and the offering of advice and information; if he can begin to see more positive r~Gults in the administra\u00ad tion of justice, the elderly victim will be mQre willing to cooperate fully and make the efforts necessary for success\u00ad ful prosecutions, thus sparing the streets of those criminals who otherwise would be returned to the community with nominal and ineffective punishments, or possibly no punish\u00ad ment at all. One major problem almost derailed the program before it got under way: The family court, where the great majority of cases involving elderly victims dealt with juvenile offenders, had never permitted out\u00ad siders to observe its proceedings. Members of the Wilmington unit met with the judges of the court and explained the purpose and objectives 76 of the MAJIC Program. The judges, believing that the volunteer moni\u00ad tors would gain an appreciation of the court's complex problems in dealing with juveniles if they were admitted to the courtroom, approved the plan unanimously. In addition, the judges requested that the vol\u00ad unteers share 'their findings and impressions with the: judges themselves. As a result of the data gathered by the task force during its study, the mayor proposed state legislation calling for minimum mandatory sentences for repeat juvenile offenders. This bill was passed and has been signed into law by the governor. CONCLUSIONS From what the task forc~ efforts have demonstrated so far, crime resistance appears to be one of the most promising law enforcement con\u00ad cepts to emerge in many years. To both the people who developed the tactics of crime resistance on a local level and those who coordinated it nationally, the concept could not be more logical: If citizen apathy breeds crime, then a reawakening of citizen involvement should curtail it. As simple as this concept sounds, however, such a reawakening re\u00ad quires a massive shift in the attitudes of uoth law enforcement authorities and the public itself. But the experience of the four pilot communities has shown that this kind of reawakening is possible, particularly if it is accomplished through intelligent planning and the use of solid, helpful information. The police chiefs in these communities believe that crime resis\u00ad tance is at least as important a crime-fighting tactic as any of the other operations at their disposal. They believe that crime resistance has the potential for closing major gaps in these other operations, gaps through which the criminal is allowed to slip. In each case, the gap is lack of citizen involvement. The four chiefs acknowledged that there is relatively little they can do to stop crime unless citizens can somehow be brought into the process. This involvement can be achieved after citizens find out from the police what they can do for themselves. The chiefs are en- 77 couraged enough from what they hav~ ,een to want to make crime resis\u00ad tance a permanent part of their operations. In the words of Norman Levine, Commissioner, Department of Public Safety, Wilmington, Delaware, \"Crime resistance, when institutionalized and properly integrated with traditional, police functions, can be an effective tool to inspire community involvement in reducing crime.\" Even though the task force members--both police officers and FBI agents-experienced some discouragement, they hold a strong conviction that the approach is valid. They knew that a significant reduction in crime could not be achieved overnight, and that was not the immediate objective of the task forces. Their short-term aim was to develop approaches through which they could make people in neighborhoods, in their own departments, and in other parts of the country recognize the value of crime resistance, and to motivate those people to make crime resistance an integral part of their lives. Quite a few of the citizens who became part of these efforts--the neighborhood president in Birmingham, the block parent chairman in DeKalb, the rape counselor in Norfolk, the elderly escort in Wilmington --all believe that the crime resistance approach, if given a chance, is certain to succeed. Furthermore, they say they have never sp,en any\u00ad thing quite like the response to the crime resistance message. For his part, FBI Director Kelley expressed an enthusiasm for the concept of crime resistance that seemed to assure its continuance as a national crime-fighting strategy. Kelley says he hopes to see, fi rst, The awakening of a great involvement in the work of law enforcement; second, some permanent structures within police departmsnts to keep this involvement alive; and, third, some significant reductions of crime. I can't help but feel that the major'lty of people will be responsive to programs which will make the~r lives happier, which will make their safety more assured and which will reduce the tremendous losses that this country suffers from the depre\u00ad dations of crime. It just seems to me that H's so reasonable that it should be successful. 78 There seems no doubt in Kelley's mind that the crime resistance approach will spread. \"Police departments are oriented toward progress,\" he says, \"and recognizing that this is progress, I think they'll buy it.\" One neighborhood orgdoizer expressed it a different way: We each owe a duty to our country to give of ourselves. The only way we are going to stop crime is for every indi\u00ad vidual to come forward. I think you are going to see this more and more, everywhere. I think y~tl are going to see it all around the country. First somebody has to light a fire that will catch and burn. 79 I The Police -Problem Identification Checklist -Administration and Operation U. S. Chamber of Commerce Crime Prevention and Control 1.

In study after' study, the picture that emerges shows the citizen -both individua11y and collectively -as the linchpin of the crime control apparatus. Unless citizens report crimes promptly, unless they come forward with information to help poIice make arrests, unless they testify i~ court, and unless they actively support crime prevention efforts, the criminal justice system operates undei' severe handicaps, The evidence suggests that citizen actions often falter: Many crimes are never reported. LEAA's victimization surveys show that nationally only about one out of every three serious crimes are reported. Even when they report crimes, citizens sometimes delay before calling the police. Researchers in Kansas City, Missouri, found that the likelihood of arrest drops with each minute of delay in reporting. Criminal cases often wash out because witnesses do not cooperate. A study in Hashington, D.C. found that half of all felony and misdemeanor arrests ended in dismissal, often because of witness problems. Community crime preventi '1 programs find it difficult at times to encourage an& maintain citizen participation. Why do citizens sometimes fail to act? Some of the reasons are apparent, An individual may not report a crime because he or she feels the police can't do anything about it. A victim or witness may conM sciously decide that getting involved in the cumbersome criminal justice process is simply not \\~orth the time and effort. Community involvement may be difficult to arouse or maintain because many urban residents live 81 i I. I /' ! I I I I in isolation from their neighbors. To gain a better understanding of these and other issues, the National Institute's Community Crime Prevention Division sponsors a wide\u00b7\u00b7ranging program of research on citizen and community action. In addition, re\u00ad search condutted in other areas -police, courts, corrections, criminal behavior -often can yield valuable information in this important area. Among the broad areas of inquiry are: The citizen and the environment; The citizen as an active participant in crime pre\u00ad vention and control; The citizen as victim and witness; Crimes of particular concern to the citizen and the community. The Citizen and the Environment In 1969, the Institute began a series of e'lploratory research studies that examined the relationship between the physical design of neighborhoods and buildings and citizen fear of and vulnerability to crime. Much of the research was done in public housing. The findings indicated that such physical design features as the height of buildings, the number of apart\u00ad ments sharing a common hallway, visibility in lobbies, positioning of entrances, and the 1 ayout of the bui 1 di ng site ~~\"l'\\:!i:ted both the rate of crime and the residents' perceptions of security. Defensible Space. The studies also suggested that phy~ical design could either encourage or discourage individual citizens to aSSllme respon\u00ad sibility for protecting their rights and property. In short, the research revealed the potential for dealing with various aspects of the physical environment in ways that would increase protective activities by citizens. The major concept that emerged from tile research was called \"defensible :;pace,\" which emphasized the importance of a heightened sense of terri\u00ad torial concern by neighborhood residents and increased opportunity for casual, natural survei11ance. The findings from this research were presented iiI a numbel' of publications. including an Institute report Architectural Design, for 82 Crime Preventi\"n, a commercially-published book by Oscar Ne\\\"man, Defensible Space, and a publication ~y the Department of Housing and Urban Development, Design Guides for Improving Residentiat Security. Design Guidelines. More recently the Institute (in cooperation with HUD) has published Design Guidelines for Creating Defensible Space to be used by architects, urban pl anners, and city managers interested in en\u00ad hancing security in housing developments. The Guidelines examine the suitability of various housin9 project building types -high rises, walk\u00ad ups, and row houses\u00b7 for various types of residents. Among the recom\u00ad mendations: High-rise buildings tend to have lower crime rates when they are occupied either completely by senior citizens or -when they have guarded entrances -by working couples and single persons. Children are likely to increase the hazards of high-rise living. They tend to be careless with intercoms and emergency exits, thus giving strangers easy access to the building. At the same time, vandalism by the young tenants in\u00ad creases because parental supervision is more difficult in these larger structures. Walk up apartment houses are cheaper to build and main\u00ad tain than other kinds of housing. They can be built for densit\"ies of up to 50 units per acre. Because they permit more adult supervision than high-rises, walk-ups can be desirable building types for families with a limited number of children. Individual row-houses afford the most opportunity for adult supervision and are strongly recommended for families with many children.- Assigning elderly residents to one building -preferably a high-rise -can reduce their chances of being victimized by crime. The \"senior citizen\" building need not result 83 in isolation of the elderly if it is placed adjacent to project buildings that house families and if there are common park areas provided for all residents of the larger development. To enhance the usefUlness of the Guidelines, the Department of Housing and Un'hl Development ha3 developed a training film based on its concepts for use by officials tnroughout the country who review and approve new housing developments. Environmental Design. Following these earl ier studies of publ ic housing, efforts in the area of environmental design were expanded both in concept and scope to include the development of comprehensive pro- grams for preventing and controlling crime in other types of urban environ\u00ad ments; larger neighborhood-wide residential settings, commercial areas, and schools. The pioneer res?~rch and demonstration efforts in this area coordinat~ three approaches for dealing with crime and fear: ~ physical and urban design . community organization and citizen action . law enforcement techniques Although none of these approaches to crime prevention is in itself new, they have never before been integrated systematically and brought to bear in the same place at the same time to tackle particular crime problems. Equally important, the environmental design concepts are cnly now being applied in large and complex urban\"areas and settings where the crime problem is llIost severe. Neighborhood Cr'ime Control. One major effort in this area has identified specific crime problems within a neighborhood in terms of the interaction of physical and urban design factors, citizen behavior and respc.~,ses, and 1 aw enforcement practi ces; and then des i gned a compre\u00ad hensive crime control program addressing those particular neighboY'hood problems. In this study, Institute research and evaluation funds, supple\u00ad mented by other Federal and local funds, are supporting a design/demon\u00ad stration/evaluation program in a Hartford, Connecticut, residential 84 -------------------------------------------------------------~ neighborhood. The problems in Hartford were defined as street crime -robbery, burglary and personal larceny, I'lith bi.:l\"glary viewed as the major concern of neighborhood residents. Dna of the environmental causes was a neigh\u00ad borhood almost open to strangers passing through. The strategy devised to counteract.this environmental problem was the \"neighborhood enclave\" Inodel. Interior streets were reconstructed as cul-de-sacs to reduce traffic into the core of the neighborhood. Non-residential traffic is channeled into preselected \"through streets\" where surveillance by both police and residents can be concentrated. To support this physical strategy, a number of community programs are being organized to promote neighborhood citizen action and increase community cohesiveness. In coordination with these physical and social action techniques, the Hartford program includes neighborhood team polic\u00ad ing, with special law enforcement emphasis on environmental and community resident concerns to complete this comprehensive approach to neighborhood cl'ime control. Evaluation of the program will be completed early in 1978, and the results should produce valuable documentation of the effects of a compre\u00ad hensive neighborhood crime control program and the process for carrying it out. Extending Envh'onmental Design Concepts. To further examine the premise that planners can devise more secure communities, the Institute is supporting a major demonstration program in three urban settings - a commel'ci al area, a school system, and a residenti al area. The demonstra\u00ad tions are designed to assess the effectiveness of this comprehensive approach that integrates a wide range of prevention techniques to deal with crime and the fear of crime. At the same time, the actual field experi ence will be useful in modifyi ng the underlyi ng pl'ogram concepts. In Portland, Oregon, the demonstration site is a declining commercial strip -Union Avenue. One strategy has been to make it part of bordering residential neighborhoods, enabling residents to exercise influence in an area previously devoid of citizen surveillance. In addition, security surveys were conducted in stores, offices, and homes along the Union 85 Avenue corridor, followed by \"target-hardening\" efforts -such as instal\u00ad ling more effective locks or equipping businesses with alarm systems. To attract residents from surrounding neighborhoods, \"night nodes\"\u00ad well-lighted,intersections that coincide with bus routes crossing Union Avenue -are planned. Street lighting improvements have been installed along the length of Union Avenue and two feeder streets. Other street improvements and beautification are planned to assist in the Avenue's revitalization. Efforts to reduce the need for citizens to carry cash on the streets are also being pursued. In Broward County, Florida, the target is four high schools with high rates of assault, vandalism and burglary. Subtle techniques have been employed to discourage loitering, eliminate hidden areas and prevent confltcts between groups of students. For exampl e, 1 urki ng pl aces in emergency stairwells which previously concealed young muggers have been sealed off. Color is used to emphasize zones of influence. The color scheme identifies which corridors \"belong\" to students in the arts, secretarial studies, etc. To discourage loitering, basement lockers are painted in hues corresponding to the specific time period when they are to be visited. Administrative changes in school procedures have been made to break up cl usters of students and 1 essen the chance of confl i ct. Parki ng lots;\u00ad often a haven for casual larceny-have been fenced so that they can be entered only through a school gate. Attractive places for studen.ts have been created in more easily supert'ised locations. In Minneapolis, the site is a deteriorating residential neighbor\u00ad hood with a high proportion of abandoned buildings. Demolishing these buildings or converting them to positive use is a priority. As in Portland, commercial corridors are being spruced up and street lighting improved. Citizen involvement in the planning process and community anti~crime activities -such as a \"neighborhood watch\" program -are other elements \"in the demonstration. Although local response has been good in the three demonstration sites, the pace of implementation has been relatively slow and costly. 86 Nevertheless, there appears to have been an improvement in neighborhood \"image\" in the Minneapolis and Portland demonstrations sites, suggesting that environmental design has already begun to help reverse the decline evident in those areas, and the reception in Broward County has been equally enthusiastic. Based on the experience to date, it seems apparent that neighborhood renewal and crime prevention and control tactics must go hand-in-hand. If this view is borne out after evaluation, then future efforts to alle\u00ad viate inner-city problems will require a coordinated approach that simUl\u00ad taneously addresses such problems as crime, housing, and unemployment. The Institute plans to give special attention to disseminating the findings of the demonstration and evaluation efforts to city planners, urban designers, the law enforcement community, community organizations, and others who are working to improve the quality of urban life. A program manual will lead communities step-by-step through the process of comprehensive environmental security planning and implementation. Urban Design Manual. In a related effort to build awareness of the expanding body of knowledge and experience in designing more secure envi\u00ad ronments, the gn Techni cal Manual. The manual will explore the process of planning and designing safe neighborhoods through a \"systems analysis\" approach to urban design. It will analyze past models -the urban village, urban fortress, defensible space, Oak Park, Illinois, and St. Louis -and it will present cast studies of the Hartford Residential Neighborhood Crime Control Study and a crime prevention planning approach us~d in the Chicago South Loop area. The manual is scheduled to be completed and published early in 1978. Crime and Stability. While the tests of environmental design con\u00ad cepts proceed, the Institute has continued to support research in urban housing developments. Thousands of dwelling units in buildings constructed with Federal funds have been abandoned because of high crime rates in the developments. Often, too, crime, deterioration, and abandoned housing have spread from the public development to the surrounding neighborhood. 87 To help salvage some of this massive Federal investment and to reclaim vitally-needed affordable housing for lower-income families, the Insti\u00ad tute is currently funding a study of crime and stability in urban housing developments. The research addl'esses the serious problem of crime and rapid turnover of tenants in Federally-assisted and public housing pro\u00ad jects by exploring the possible interrelationships between their physical, social and management features and their degree of crime and stability. The relationships may be more complex than they first appear. While increasing crime prompts res'idents to abandon a building or neighborhood, it may be equally tl'ue that residential instabil ity is itself a breeder of crime, one factor building upon the other in a spiral of decay, The study will collect data from police and housing authority records, from physical site surveys, and from interviews with residents, housing supervisors, law enforcement officials, and community leaders in three cities: Newark, St. louis, and San Francisco. Based on in-depth analysis of the data, researchers will attempt to identify the various mixtures of building type, housing management, and resident income and family characteristics that are most conducive to safe, stable developments. Street Lighting. Improving street lighting is often one aspect of a community's efforts to cope with'Co','ime in a particular neighborhood. Despite the prevalence of street-lighting projects, there is little reliable information available on effects of improved street lighting. To assess what is known in the area and map out plans for more intens'ive evaluation, the National Institute funded an assessment of street lighting projects. The study, conducted under the National Evaluation Program, reviewed the experience of 41 projects. Among the preliminary conclu\u00ad sions: -There is no statist'jcally significant evidence that st!'eet lighting has an impact on the level of crime, especially if displacement of crime to another location is taken into account. -There is a strong indication, however, that increased lighting --and perhaps uniformity of lighting--decreases the fear of crime. 88 The study emphasizes the fact that definitive statements about the effect of street lighting on crime would be difficult even with reliable information and sound evaluation techniques. Part of the difficulty stems from'the fact that a street lighting project is part of a larger environ\u00ad ment and must be viewed from this perspective. Expanded police patrol and changes in patrol strategies, for example, are often implemented along with improved lighting and other environmental alterations. Although the ongoing Crime Prevention through Environmental Design Program should tell us more about this issue, this study suggests that new analytic techniques or novel uses of existing techniques may be required to isolate the effects of street lighting as part of a broader \"synergistic\" pro\u00ad gram. As for immediate policy decisions, the study points out that the limited statistical evidence that street lighting decreases fear is bol\u00ad stered by the intuitive sense that lighting makes an environment less alien. The objectives of street lighting are not only safety and security, but also community character and vitality, traffic orientation, and identifi\u00ad cation. Thus, the study suggests that future street lighting projects should be jointly funded by a variety of agencies so that the full range of objectives are adequately considered. Target-Hardening. More mundane, but important, environmental im\u00ad provements fall in the general category known as \"target-hardening\" - making doors and windows more burglar-resistant. Laboratoy,y tests on doors, for example, have examined not just the lock, but the entire door, the jamb, and hinges to determine how well they can withstand ~~at kind of pressure. A companion effort performed similar tests on windows. The results of this research are now beginning to find their way into building codes and architectural practice. As the standards for doors and windows are implemented throughout the country, it should make life more difficult for burglars who used to gain entry to an apartment house armed with nothing but a credit card. FuCure Research. The Community Crime Prevention Division is planning 89 to fund a study of how offenders perceive and use the environment, from both self-reports and from analysis of crime reports and crime scenes. The study will also examine what police and citizens see as environmental indicators of risk and. safety, testing these indicators for their accu\u00ad racy against the offender and crime data. The research should have im\u00ad plication':. for police training and public information programs on crime prevention as.well as for environmental design. The Division's research plans also incluQe a synthesis of research on environmental factors relevant to crime prevention, which will sum\u00ad marize and evaluate the accumulated theory, research and maxims. This project should serve to guide both program development and future re\u00ad search. Research will also explore the relationship of environmental factors to informal social control mechanisms. This work will examine the condi\u00ad tions under which social and environmental factors influence surveillance crime reporting, mutual aid and other forms of \"public-minded behavior\" relevant to crime prevention. Crime-related factors in the process of neighborhood stability and change will be analyzed in terms of possible strategies for promoting safety and security that can be built into neighborhood/community development and revitalization. More long-range research plans include an examination of whether the variables manipu'lated by city planners and urban deSigners have an impact on crime. These include decisions affecting buildiiig size and layout, zoning and land use mixtures, street layout patterns and the deSign and location of major municipal support systems (hospitals, schoo 1 s, etc.). The Citizen as an Active Participant in Crime Prevention and Control Better deSigns for communities and homes will be effective only if the public accepts them. In the long run, the best deterrent to crime may prove to be greater public awareness of the role of the individual citizen in \"keeping the peace.\" This notion is very much a part of the Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design approach. It is also at the heart of a new LEAA 90 initiative, the Community Anti-Crime Program, designed to stimulate citi\u00ad zen action against crime. While this is not a research program, it will be evaluated by the Institute, adding to the store of knowledge on how to mobilize the community into effective anti-crime activities. The program also will draw upon Institute research on citizen in\u00ad volvement in crime prevention activities and in certain aspects of the criminal justice process, Citizen Patrols. A concrete example of citizen involvement is the resident patrols organized in many cities by individuals upset by crime and anxious to do something about it. An Institute assessment of such patrols, conducted last year found that approximately 800 citizen patrols were operating nationwide. Most came into being after 1970, usually in response to a local spurt in crime, and functioned on a low-budget, all volunteer basis. The study identified four major variations: building patrols, neigh\u00ad borhood patrols, social service efforts, and community protection groups. Of the four, build'jng patrols seemed most effective in reducing crime and increasing a sense of security. In addition, such patrols helped to buf\u00ad fer encounters between the police and the residents of public hous\"irlg projects. Lack of data makes it difficult to draw firm conclusions about the other types of patrol, although there is evidence that neighborhood patrols perform valuable services. Overall, those patrols with carefully selected, well-trained members, established procedures, affiliations with community organizations, and positive contacts with local police are most likely to succeed, These findings suggest that citizen patrols can be an economical way to help prevent crime in the community. A common concern about such groups -the threat of vigilante activity--was not borne out in the Institute study. It appears to be only an occasional problem, one that can be mini\u00ad mized by careful planning and review of patrol operations. Crime Reportinlg Projects. Victimi zati on surveys and research on police operations have highlighted the importance of citizen initiative in reporting crimes,to pol'ice. Thus, efforts to encourage citizen sur- 91 veillance and reporting could have a potentially significant impil.ct on crime by increasing the risk of apprehension and promoting greater crime prevention and deterrence. In reviewing the experience nationwide, Institute-funded evaluators reported that an increasing number of communities are promoting citizen surveillance and crime reporting programs of various kinds. Some of these emphasized cooperative surveillance by neighbors in \"Block Watch\" activities, while others encouraged the use of special telephone numbers for reporting to police. A third tjpe of program, \"Radio Watch -in which truckers and taxi cab dl'ivers use their two-way radios to report criminal activity observed in the course of their normal job routine--appeared to be an especially effective technique. In addition to increasing the number of crimes reported to police, crime reporting projects in some cases also appeared to help foster a more cohesive attitude among neighbors, improve relations with police, and reduce unwarranted fear of crime. Because they encouraged cHi-zen surveillance, crime ,reporting projects are a logical complement to the environmental design approach to crime prevention, which emphasizes open, observable physical space. Even if physical design changes are not pos\u00ad sible, however, reporting projects can lead to increased surveillance by encouraging citizens to take a more active roll in detecting criminal be\u00ad havior. Security Surveys. To reduce burglaries, police departments in more than 30q communities now offer to survey homes and businesses and reco\u00ad mmend appnlpriate security measures, such as improved locks or installa\u00ad tion of alarm systems. An assessment conducted last year confirmed the utility of security surveys: individuals who followed survey recommendations proved less likely to be burglarized. The study also s~lggested that the surveys help improve police-col1l11unity relations. A number of units have been established or maintained solely with local funds-impressive evidence of community support. Despite their benefits, security surveys are not being used to 92 fullest advantage. They are not well understood by the general public, and many police departments lack the resources to reach an entire juris\u00ad diction. To realize their full potential, continued experimentation is called for: first, to develop more economical and efficient means of de\u00ad ploying survey units; and second, to stimulate citizen participation through more effective promotion campaigns. Operations Identification Projects. Another burglary prevention tactic encourages citizens to mark and identify their valuables with a unique traceable numbrr or name. The number may be registered with police and window decal'S may be supplied to participants to advertise the fact that property is marked and t\u00b7egistered. An assessment of such projects in 1975 found that participants in Operation Identification projects had fe\\1er burglaries than their neighbors who were not enrolled. However, this did not lead to a reduction in the overall city crime rate, perhaps because the typical 01 project was too small to affect the total rate. Property-marking did not appear to in\u00ad crease the recovery and return of stolen property either, but this could have been due to ~he small number of 01 participants who were burgiarized. General conclusions. With regard to implementation, studies of citi- zen action programs suggest generally that: A nei ghborhood approach is ')'j kely to be more effective than city-wide campaigns, in which resources are dissipated and themes too general to be effective in different neighborhoods. A combination of strategies is likely to be more effective than anyone in isolation beca.use the individual projects reinforce one another. Personal contact with citizens -ill small groups and in their own homes -is the best way to stimulate citizen invol vement in crime preventia,n efforts. Mass-media publicity campaigns and large-scale community meetings seem distinctly less effective. Community Reactions to Crime. Much of the research on community 93 crime prevention has focused on specific programs. A majo,\" study now under way shifts the perspective to explore instead the urban locales that are the setting for those activities. The research is being carried out by Northwestern University, under the Institute's Research Agreements Program, which provides long-term support to selected universities and research organizations for mor'e basic studies of broad topics. Twelve n~ighborhoods in three cities-Chicago, Philadelphia and San Francisco- al'e being examined to probe such questions as: -Which ~ypes of strategies tend to be selected by which tyres of neighborhoods and organizations? -Do the areas have certain corrrnunal or integrated characteristics and what role do they play in the creation and the impact of programs? -Who gets involved, at what stages, with what types of responses? -Do certain kinds of individual reactions to crime lead to more or less participation in neighborhood responses. For example, are security-conscious people who've invested in locks or alarms more or less likely to participate in a local crime program? Other areas of inquiry include the relationship of police services in a neighborhood to the collective response; the relationships of the\u00b7 local ity with the city pol itical structure; and the characteristics of the specific neighborhood. The Northwestern research should help to identify programs most likely to fUnction well in a particular neighborhood and provide insights about how to mobilize- and maintain- citizen involvement. Future rese.arch. The Community Crime Prevention Division plans to examine more carefully the functions that citizens can and should carry out to aid in crime prevention and control. To be studied are various citizen actions that can help to reduce vulnerability to crime and assist the criminal justice system. Methods for mobilizing and sustaining mean- 94 ingfu1 forms of citizen actions and response also will be addressed. These research activities complement LEAA's Comnlunity Anti-Crime Program, which provides funds for action projects designed to reduce crime and improve security in neighborhood ~ettings. The research planned should provide a basis for improved mobilization of cit.iz,en crime prevention activities, for maintaining citizen participation in various program activities, and for s,v<;tematically assessing the impact of citizen and community anti-crime efforts. Also on the Con:rnun'ity Crime Preventiun Division's agenda: Research on factors influencing a variety of citizen crime prevention actions and response including crime reporting and both individual and collective forms of .~. t' Cl~lzen ac lon. Research on fac;tors influencing the effectiveness of citizen crime prevention efforts including the organi\u00ad zation and implementation OT citizen activities as well as recruitment methods and program administration. Research on the role of the mass media and other mecha\u00ad nisms for influencing citizen actions and behavior related to criminal justice issues. The Citizen as Victim and Witness For the victim or witness, encounters with the criminal Ju~tic~ system are often such a hardship that citizens go to great lengths to avoid them. Rather than repol't a crime to police and face rep..:ated de\u00ad mands on their time as the case winds slowly thl\"ough the system, many victims opt instead to \"cut their losses.\" Experiences with Crime and Criminal Justice. In Milwaukee, Wis\u00ad consin, for example, researchers found that 34 percent of the crimes experienced by a group of victims surveyed were never reported. For the victims, the most commonly-experienced problems were found to be property loss and mental or emotional suffering -plus lost time and income for those who subsequently became involl/ed in the croimina1 95 justice process. The researchers suggested that procedures be developed or improved for compensating these individuals, for reducing the fear of retaliation, and for more efficient scheduling of court appearances. One of the major recommendations was establishment of an Office of Citizen Justice Advocate on a c0unty-by-county basis, to be financed locally. It would serve as a victim-witness ombudsma.n, addressing such prnblems as loss of wages while testifying, transportation to the court\u00ad house, intimidation by defendants, and frustration with criminal justice procedures. Other recommendations included experimental use of fees to reimburse victims for lost income and transportation costs when testifying in court or being interviewed by police and prosecutors. This approach would C0m\u00ad plement existing victim compensation laws, which generally aid only seri ously vi ctimi zed persons, by servi ng the 1 a rger n:,-',ers of vi cti ms who have not been physical\"ly injured. The researchers also recommended that available victim and witness services in a community be given wider publ icity; that a single prosecutor handle a victim or witness throughout the judicial process; and that victims and witnesses be notified as early as possible of delays in trials. The survey, ~Ihich included 1,775 victims and 1,225 witnesses, provided a wealth of detail; Contrary to popular opinion, the elderly are not victimized more than other groups, nor d~ they take more precautions against criml~. Of those \\~ho took special precautions following their victimization, one-third bought a gun for protection. About half the victims feared they would be a victim of crime again within the next year. In general, persons who had been victims of more than one crime tended to view victimization as more likely and were somewhat more likely to have reported the crimes. Victim Compensation. The criminal law is based on the notion that a society is responsible for protecting its members from criminal v\u00b7ictimiza- 96 tion. When that fails, financial compensation is one approach to redressing the damage to the victim. State victim compensation programs were first implemented in the mid\u00ad si~ties. Currently, some 17 states have operational programs, and a Federal program has been proposed. A study of victim compensation is now underway as part of an inter\u00ad agency agreement with the Office for Improvements in the Administration of Justice of the Department of Justice. It will analyze the economic losses incurred by victims of assaultive crimes and assess the impact of compen\u00ad sation, both public and private (through insurance), on victim behavior. Because of the costs of victim compensation and the possibi1i1ity that compensation might possibly have the effect of making potential victims careless, whether or not to institute such programs and how to administer them become important questions. Restitution. In recent years, restitution has gained prominence as a means of redressing the victim's loss and as a tool for dealing with criminal justice offenders. An LEAA restitution initiative is supporting programs at various stages of the criminal justice process in selected jurisdictions, and the InstitutE is funding an evaluation of the programs. Other efforts. Research in other areas also has implications for citizen involvement -from police studies that reveal the need for prompt citizen reporting, to courts projects that have highlighted the problems facing jurors or the victim's frustration with plea-bargaining, to correc\u00ad tions research that examines community-based rehabilitation efforts. The Attorney General has launched a major Federal initiative that is experimenting with the concept of Neighborhood Justice Centers - a method for re501ving minor criminal or civil disputes outside the courts. In many such cases, citizens find that it takes too long and costs teo much to go to court, but they are unable to find a forum that satisfies their need for resolution and redress. Three pilot centers will be established with Institute funds -in Los Angeles, Kansas City, Missour, and At1anta\u00ad which will offer mediation or arbitration for disputes in which both par\u00ad ties are willing to participate. Where mediation is inappropriate, not 97 agreed to, or unsuccessful, the centers will provide referral service to the agency or court best suited to deal with the oroblem. Crimes of Particular Concern to the Community Forcible Rape. Forcib'le rape is the most rapidly increasing violent crime in the United States. Of all crimes, rape and other forms of sexual assault is especially traumatic for the victim. Despite these facts, how\u00ad ever, the criminal justice system's response to t~e crime often is inade\u00ad quate. Treatment of victtms has been sharply criticized by womens' oY'ganiza\u00ad tions. Police officers and prosecutors may be insensitive in their ques\u00ad tioning of the victim, medical examinations may take place in a cursory and even humiliating fashion, and the subsequent trial is almost always an ordeal. Consequently, many women fail to report their victimization or refuse to testify against the suspect in court. For these and other reasons-including unreasonably strict evidentiary requirements'and the tendency of jurie$ to assume provocation by the victim-many rapists are never brought to trial, and those who are tried are rarely convicted. To help the criminal justice system deal more effectively with rape cases, the Institute sponsored a major two-year study. The objectives were: -to develop effective law enforcement techniques and strategies, in such areas as evidence-gathering,apprehending Offenders, and responding to victims; -to develop effective prosecutorial procedures and strategies, including police/prosecutor interaction during the investigation; interrogation and treatment of victims and witnesses, and pre\u00ad trial and courtroom procedures; -to develop recommendations for legislators to use in designing rape laws, covering such legal issues as corroboration require\u00ad ments, admissibility of character testimony. cautionary jury instructions, and the establishment of multiple degrees and penalties for rape offenses. National Data. During its first phase, the project gathered the 98 the first national statistics on how criminal justice agencies deal with rape cases. Surveys of police and prosecutors confirmed the trend toward more enlightened treatment of,rape victims. Many police departments, for example, are assigning female officers to such cases or are providing special training to investigators. Al\u00ad though prosecutors' offices in many major jurisdictions have begun to adopt improved approaches, overall they have been slower than law enforcement agencies in responding ~o the victims' concerns. A Typical Rape. The survey responses also provided intriguing in\u00ad sights into the crime of forcible rape. Although individual responses varied, a general description of the \"typical crime\" can tentatively be made: The typical case involved a victim and suspect who were total strnngers. The victim was likely to have received physical injury. Although she had not known her assailant beforehand, the victim was able to identify him if he was seen again. The alleged assailant often was known by police since he had a prior record of sexual offenses. The victim probably re\u00ad ported the crime to police within an hour of its occurrence. Reports. In other actiVities, the project examined rape legislative issues and compiled a digest of state rape statues. A number of convicted rapists were interviewed to collect data that could be useful in prevent\u00ad ing the crime. In addition, a detailed study of Seattle's progressive program to assist rape victims was conducted on site. Finally, interviews were conducted with 100 rape victims in Seattle. One conclusion from the interviews was that police or prosecutors should give victims detailed information, telling them in simple and clear language what criminal jus\u00ad tice and medical procedures to expect as their case proceeds through the trial process and alerting them to available medical, legal, counseling and other social services. In response to this need, the project has produced an easy-to-use booklet to be published by the Institute this fall. In its second year, the project focused on responding to the defi\u00ad ciencies and needs identified during the first year. In addition to a final report and the victim handbook mentioned above, the project will 99 ----------------------------.-~--produce the following reports: A Manual for Patrol Officer A Manual for Sex Crimes Investigators Police Adm-inistrative and Policy Issues A Manual for Filing and Trial Prosecutors Prosecutor Administrative and Policy Issues An Analysis of Legal Issues Publication of the reports is expected by mid-1978. Fencing. Burglary is one of the most prevalent serious crimes. Eal'ly re:earch identified fencing as one of the critical links in the burglary chain, since most cases involve physical objects that must be illegally sold before the offender realizes a profit. Even in street robberies, thefts may involve articles, such as jewelry, that require the services of a fence. By viewing the fence as a \"businessman,\" a recently completed re\u00ad search project was able to take a fresh look at this major criminal justice problem. This analysis of fencing operations as commercial enter\u00ad prises led to some novel recommendations, including: -Prosecution of fences for violations of income tax laws (almost always committed in relation to fencing activities) rather than solely for the fencing viola\u00ad tions themselves. Many tax laws lack the strict evidentiary requirements of traditional \"receiving stolen property\" statutes, and the penalties, at least in a financial sense, are often more severe. -Strict monitoring and enforcement of licensing regulations against known or suspected fences who also operate legitimate businesses as \"cover\" for their fencing activities. This could be especially effective since revocation of license threatens both legitimate and illegitimate income for the fence. 100 Gambling. Laws against gambling have become less strict in recent years, with many states turning to lotteries and other betting operations to augment revenues. To provide policymakers with information on the effects of different types of gambling laws and the nature of gambling enforcement, Institute-sponsored researchers examined practices in 17 cities. Among the major themes highlighted were: The need fot setting and communicating priorities within crimi\"al justice agencies is particularly important in gambling law enforcement. Specialization in gambling cases by specific police officers, prosecutors and judges means increased expertise, increased likelihood of consistent policies and priorities, and perhaps most important, increased concern about the problem of gambling. Coordination among police, prosecutors and courts needs to be enhanced to achieve consistent goals and priorities. Accountability systems for prosecutors and police seem essential, particularly in larger organizations\"to insure that policies are carried out consistently. The researchers indicate that legalized gambling does not allow scarce police and other resources to be reallocated to more important crimes, because the level of resources allocated to gambling enforcement is too low to make any difference. Similarly, the view that enforcing current anti\u00ad gambling laws makes police unpopular is unfounded. Police lost public confidence by non-enforcement, not by enforcement. There is also little evidence for the assumption that legal games will take revenue away from organized crime. Rackets. Bookmaking, numbers and loansharking- these illegal opera\u00ad tions are among the most lucrative and least risky crimes. In addition, they pose special problems because of their corrupting influence on both . the criminal justice agencies and the community at large. Many \"law\u00ad abiding\" citizens regularly play illegal numbers games. 101 Research currently underway is investigating the operations of illegal numbers, bookmaking, a~d loansharking rackets in metropolitan New York, gathering data from police, prosecutor, and court records and from inter\u00ad views with criminal justice personnel and underworld informants. Also to be studied is the relationship of these illegal enterprises to each other and other illegitimate commercial operations, including an analysis of t~e penetration of legitimate business by racketeering operations and the movement of illegal capital into the legitimate economic community. Consumer Fraud. Institute research also is exploring crimes of deceit and guile that not only have a significant economic impact on the community but also can have a profound influence on public trust. Schemes to defraud consumers, for example, often prey upon the most disadvantaged groups in society. Research currently underway is collecting and analyzing information on the extent of consumer fraud and the types of businesses and consumers most involved. The project has just completed a general review of the state of consumer fraud law today. The report in\u00ad cludes an analysis of 67 con~umer fraud practices that states have targeted for regulation and 33 strategies used to prevent these practices. Future reports will describe the characteristics, frequency, and im\u00ad pact of consumer fraud, examine the effectiveness of existing enforcement approaches identify promising intervention strategies, and make recommen\u00ad dations about such matters as education programs to alert the public to consumer fraud. As this report has shown, research is beginning to suggest better answers to a number of longstanding concerns about community crime pre\u00ad vention. But many other avenues remain to be explored. One is the y'e\u00ad lationship between crime and other social problems in a community, such as unemployment. The Institute has just begun a long-range study of employment and crime, to be carried out by the Vera Institute of Justice. The researchers wi 11 try to determi ne: -which types of offenders are deterred from crime by employment; -which types of jobs are effective in 102 L \" -which types of jobs are effective in curbing crime; -which types of criminal activity are averted or reduced through employment. Other efforts will concentrate on expanding our understanding of how citizens and communities are motivated to participate i.n anti-crime efforts, and how their support can be mobilized and maintained. Research sponsored by the Community Crime Prevention Division will also deal with crimes that are of concern because of their personal as well as their social and economic consequences. This area includes studies of employee theft, illegal behavior by major corporations, and research addressing fraud in government benefit programs. The focus in this category of research is on crimes involving guile and deceit and their effects on the community and its economic resources. The interaction between the citizen and the environment, and th~ citizen and criminal justice agencies, will continue to be priorities. Additional knowledge in these areas is essential if citizens and communi\u00ad ties are to reassume their share of the responsibility for crime control. 103 CURRENT COMMUNITY CRIME PREVENTION PUBLIC~TIONS Many of the foll owi ng reports can be purchased from the Government Printing Office.

This is not to imply that most of those in business, industry, and the professions are unethical or dishonest. The oppos'ite is true, although too many are \"sharp,\" blatantly unethical, or just plain crooked. But more is required than a preponderance of honest men and women; they must take positive action, not sit passively on the sidelines. Unfortunately, honest executivE'.s and professionals are often asleep at the switch. How else can one explain this statement by a prosecutor: \"Let there be no mistake about it, there is extensive crime in the business world. Our office currently is prosecutinn scores of cases in\u00ad volving the payment of bribes, securities abuses, tax frauds, and numerous other violations. Virtually 81ery single one of these cases \\~as developed without any cooperation from the business comnunity. Infdct, most of these cases came about because of a look-the-other-way attitude by businessmen who could have prevented the crimes from ever happening in the first place.\" Nonetheless, the approaches and recommendations outlined herein to combat white-collar crime do not pretend to be all-embracing. Rather, they are important illustrations of the ~ of thinking and kinds of measures that readers can adopt, build upon, and mold to fit the special needs and problems of their occupations. Worthy of note at this point is that.';these recommendations are frequently nothing more than good management per se and can payoff even in the absence of white-col\u00b7lar crime. Methods, proce\u00ad dures, policies, and controls are emphasized .. measures whose implementation requires more ;n the way of willpower than manpower and expensive hardware. 109 THE PROBLEM AND ITS IMPACT Too few businesses and professions are squarely facing the problem of white-collar crime. This is also true of many law enforcement agencies, although he'ightened attention to such offenses seems to be a rapidly devel\u00ad oping trend. A principal reason why white-co lar offenses are often handled in an overly del i cate manner is an insufficient understandirig of what white\u00ad collar crime is, what its consequences are, and why the traditional response to the pl'ob 1 em is i nappropl'i ate. WHAT IS WHITE-COLLAR CRIME? The definition of \"white-cdllar crime\" is not purely an academic matter but, as noted later, has a very significant bearing on how best to combat the offense. Whi te-coll ar crimes are illegal act.s characterized by guil e, deceit, and concealment -and are not dependent upon the application of physical force or violence or threats thereof. They may be committed by individuals acting independently or by those who are part of a well-planned conspiracy. The objective may be to obtain money, property, or services; to avoid the payment or loss of money, property, or services; or to secure * business or personal advantage. By descri bi ng white-co 11 ar crime as \"i 11 ega 1 acts, 10 thi s defi ni t ion avoi ds the implication that only criminal proceedings and sanctions should be di\u00ad rected at such offenses. As ncted later, civil proceedings and remedies can be equally, if not more, effective. And by focusing on the nature of the violation, rather than on the na\u00ad ture of the violator, this definition of white-collar crime is considerably more encompassing than the traditional one, which tends to concentrate exclusively on top management and \"crime in the executive suite.\" As one observer comments, \"White collar crime is democratic. It can be committed by a bank teller or the head of his institut\u00b7ion.. The character of * The concept of white-collar cimre described here is based on, and closely parallels, the definition in The Nature, Impact and Prosecution of White\u00ad Collar\u00b7 Crime, written by Herbert EdeTfiertz for tne-Law Enforcement Assis\u00ad tance Administration, Department of Justice. 110 white-collar crime must be found in its modi operandi and its objectives (not) in the nature of the offenders'.\" Looked at in this light, embezzlement of $100,000 by a \"wh.ite-collar\" vice president who manipulated accounts payable records is not substantively different from the pilferage of $100,000 \\~orth of merchandise by a \"blue\u00ad collar\" warehouse clerk who tried to cover up by falsifying inventory re\u00ad cords or engaging in other forms of concealment. The same can be said about the offense committed by the housewife who fraudulently tries to use someone else's credit card -or about the young \"phone phreak\" who is guilty of toll fraud by utilizing a \"blue box\" in a phone booth to bypass the tele\u00ad phone company's billing mechanism while he places a $1,000 around-the-wor1d call to the adjoining booth. Obviously, what this is leading up to is not justification of white-collar crime at the executive level on the grounds that others also engage in the same type of offense. Rather, the point is that an eyes-open approach to white-collar crime does not limit its focus to the executive suite but is geared to counteract white-collar illegalities originating from a wide range of sources, within and outside of the organization. For example, white collar crime can be committed by, and perpetrated against, (l) corporations, partnerships, professi onal firms, nonprofit organizations, and governmenta'J units and/or (2) their executives, principals, and employees as well as such \"outsiders\" as customers, clients, suppliers * and other organizations or individuals. Failure to review and evaluate this range of possibilities is likely to result in countermeasures about as effective as baseball players whose manager has trained them to cover all bases except home plate. * This publication restricts its coverage to xhose white-collar crimes dir\u00ad ected at, Oi' committed by or within, business, i\\ldustry, and the professions. For example, embezzlement occurring within n union or government agency is outside. the scope of the Handbook. But soliciting bribes from business by government employees or union officials -and offering bribes to them by businessmen -are offenses discussed on subsequent pages. 111 FINANCIAL lIND OTHER CONSEQUENCES W.hite~col1ar crime not only results in an immed'iate and direct financial impact but also, and even more important, generates nonfinancial and long~ term consequences. Careful consideration of these effects will, help demon~ strate that the response to white-collar illegalities should be considerably more than writing them off as just another cost of doing business. How much does it cost? Although white-coll ar crimes, if and when de'~ected, are among the most underreported offenses, a reasonable approximation of their economic impact is possible. One way to assess the financial consequences is to reflect upon the implications of the following: 1. The yearly cost of embezzlement and pilferage reportedly exceeds ~ several bi 11 ion doll ars the losses sustained throughout the nation from burglary and robbery. 2. Fraud was a major contributing factor in the forced clOSing of about ~ 100 banks during a 20-year period. ,..., 3. An insurance company reported that at least 30 percent of all business failure each year are the result of employee dishonesty. 4. The annual bill for all purchases by a state is said to have dropped an estimated 40 percent following exposure and prosecution of businessmen and government officials for bribery and kickbacks. 5. Dishonesty by corporate executives and employees has increased the retail cost of some merchandise by up to 15 percent and, in the case of one com\u00ad pany, caused shareholders to suffer a paper loss of $300-million within just a few days. 6. Restitution in the amount of $696,000 was obtained by a state for its residents who were victims of a single consumer fraud scheme which operated nationwide. 7. Distribution of untaxed bootleg cigarettes throughout one eastern state during a recent six-year period resulted in a loss of $384-million in state and local revenue and in a loss of about $2-billion in gross sales to the legitimate cigarette industry. During the last four months of 1971, over 100 cigarette retailers went out of business because their customers preferred the cut-rate, untaxed cigarettes peddled by compe\u00ad titors. This problem exists, to some extent, in 36 other states. 112 8. Internal dishonesty, in addition to the adverse effect on profit~ re\u00ad presented by the amount of the pt lferage or ernbezzl ement, may res.u It in costs associated with the loss of one or more trained employees; the training of replacements;\u00b7 higher insurance rates and/or deducti\u00ad bles; reconstruction of destroyed, stolen, or altered racords; conta\u00ad mination of other employees who pick up where the apprehended thief left off; and lowered prod~ctivity when honest and valued employees fee 1 they are under susp; d on. ' As for a total dollar figure for those white-collar crimes falling within the scope of this article (as noted earlier, some offenses are not covered herein), the \"ball-park\" figure for the short-term and direct doll ar loss is estimated at not less than $40-billion arnually, which excludes the cost to the public and business of price-fixing illegalities and indus- ti'i al espionage (sati sfactory measures of these offenses wet'e not found). The accompanying chart presents more details. The \"not less than $40-billion\" estimate does not pretend to be the result of a rigorous, statistically valid survey and should not be regarded as \"tha cost of white-collar crime.\" No one has ever really computed even a reasonably accurate figure. The estimate cited here is based on (1) previous estimates by responsible authorities (even their figures for a given kind of crime may differ by many billions), (2) inferences drawn from reason\u00ad ably accurate loss ratios, and (3) the evaluation and adjustment of (1) and (2) in the light of research for this Handbook. Our estimate is presented to demonstrate only that the short-term dollar impact (whatever the amount might be) of white-collar crime is enormous, certainly not less than $40-billion per year. 113 THE ANNUAL COST OF SOME WHITE-COLLAR CRIMES* (Billions of Dollars) Bankruptcy Fraud Bribel'y, Kickbacks, and Payoffs Computer-Related Crime Consumer Fraud, Illegal Competitions, Deceptive Practices ** Consumer victims: Business victims: Government revenue loss: Cr,edit Card and Check Fraud Credit Card: Check: Embezzlement and Pilferage Embezzlement (cash, goods, services): Pilferage: Insurance Fraud Insurer victims: Policyholder victims: Receiving Stolen Property Securities Thefts and Frauds $ 5.5 $ 3.5 $12.0 $ 0.1 $ 1.0 $ 3.0 $ 4.0 $ 1.5 $ 0.5 TOTAL (billions) $ 0.08 3,00 u.10 21.00 1.10 7.0 2.00 3.50 4.00 $41.78 *** * The dollar amounts pertain only to that aspect of each listed crime which is directed at, or c0l1ll1itted by or within, business, industry, and the pro\u00ad fessions. These estimates do not include the ~~st involved in combating white-collar crilne. ** Estimates related to price-fixing and industrial espionage are not in\u00ad cluded. Among the schemes or practices that victimize ethically run bus\u00ad inesses are the following: advance fee, counterfeit products, illegal hiring of aliens, sweetheart contracts. etc. The figure for Government revenue loss refers to business-related tax fraud, which has been reported as relatively prevalent among the self-employed (especiallyin the medical, legal, and accounting professions). *** This total is more than the $40-billion referred to in the text because the listed crime categories are not necessarily mutually exclusiv~. For example, a portion of the embezzlement figure is also part of the estimate for computer-related crime. 114 Other consequences and implications Although the direct, short-tgnn dollar cost of white-collar crime is of great importance, the long-term an,.i/or nonfinancial consequences qre eyen more seri ous. For example, although the commission of white-collar crime is not de\u00ad pendent on violence or force, the risk, threat, \u00a3t-0ccurrence p~ physical injury \u00a3r psychological trauma can be a consequence. A task force of a Presidential Commission concluded as follows: \"Death or serious injury may result fY'om tainted products merchandised in violation of health laws, or from misconduct by doctors. Building code violations may cause fire or serious health hazards. Although offenses involving such risks constitute a small proportion of the total amount of white-collar crime, the potential number' of victims of such conduct may be very high.\" Some fonns of white-collar crim~ contribute to theexistenc~ severity, .Q!:JJrofitability of other fonns of criminal ~ivity. The same task force noted above said that derel ictions by corporat\u00b7ions and their managers \"tend to erode the moral base of law and provide an opportunity for other kinds of offenders to rationalize their misconduct.\" As a case in point, the task force cited testimony indicating that one motive for the Watts riot was \"retribution on merchants who were guilty of consumer exploitation.\" In 1973, an infonnant told the Senate Subcommittee on Investigations about enonnously profitable -and illegal -securities transactions he had conducted for organized crime figures with the knowing and indispensable participation of some members of the securities industry and financial community. The infonnant provided many examples to drive home his main thesis: \" I am trying to show you some highlights of the involvement of organized crime and white-collar crime and their collusion; for the or\u00ad ganized banks and stock brokers in the United States and their counterparts overseas.\" And too many businessmen are supporting and encouraging a variety of crimes against property. The Los Angeles District Attorney. in his 1973 testimony' before the Senate Select Committee on Small Business, describes the situation this way: 115 r------------------------------------------ -- \"The thieves .. felt completely safe in making an offer to an appar\u00ad ently legitimate store. In our investigations, this aspect has become very clear. Too many legitimate businessmen are willing to buy hot merchandise, if it assures them of a higher profit .... It is impossible to believe that businessmen do not know that they are supporting a multimillion-dollar, ille\u00ad gitimate industry. When a businessman buys meat, or liquor, or clothes, or office equipment and pays for it in cash to get a good price -he knows that the merchandise is hot. Yet, fences and ultimately burglars depend on the businessman who is successful enough to put cash out in front for such a deal.\" A major long-term impact of white-collar crime is loss of public confidence in business, industry, and the professions and debasement of competition. Three different surveys, for example, have indicated that public esteem for bUSiness, its practices, and its leadership is at an all time low. This Frompted the president of one survey organization to comment, \"The first (remedial) step is to be sure that business' house is in order.\" Consumer fraud, according to one study, has resulted in a \"lingering frustration by market consumers who, although they feel cheated, are con\u00ad vinced that justice is (not an) available mechanism to redress their griev\u00ad ances because the cost and time are too great. The economy suffers likewise because business ethics decline, fraudulent and dishonest tactics are viewed as incidents of doing business, ang new entrants to a market offering honest competition are hampered by deceptive practices perpetrated by their competi\u00ad tor!j'\" In addition to debasing compet)tion, insensitivity to ethical practices has, in some instances, retarded economic growth. In one state where payoffs to \"government officials were expected, many companies refused to conduct business there. This led a newspaper to comment editorially, \"In the midst of so much talk about changing the 'image' (of the state) and improving the economy through industrial growth, there could be no healthier approach than a clear demonstration on the part of the state's political leadership that it is determined to have decent government.\" One of the more frequent aftermaths of lost confidence in business and debasement of competition is pressure for new legislation or regulations in the absence of corrective action by the private sector. In connection 116 with securities thefts and fraud, a member of the Senate Permanent Sub\u00ad cormrtttee on Investi gations warned, \"If as the resul t of these hearings the financial community still refuses to take definitive action to clean house, then as a legislator I intend to seek every avenue of redress through the regulatory process to see to it that corrective steps are taken -and taken soon .. It is our duty to encourage and to do everything we can to have financial institutions do this on their own. If they won1t, we are going to legislate .... This is now the second warning we have given . and we mean business now.\" Of course, all too often business does not take the initiative and the resultant legislation and regulations saddle manal:/ers with a far more rigid and cumbersome set of requirements than probably would have been the case if industry had faced the problem squarely and instituted appropriate action itself. Such legislation is just one illustration of how white-collar crime can result in what one observer describes as \"greater inconvenience in effecting purchases and negotiating contracts, and carrying out (what previously had been) simple business transactions because of the awareness of fraud and danger of duplicity.\" Unfortunately, as a result of such a breakdown of trust the innocent often suffer because of the transgressions of the guilty. In one county, for example, the prose~uting attorney has, in effect, banned door\u00ad to-door salesmen because of numerous verified abuses. This policy is supported by local merchants, who justifiably fear that the unethical tactics of many of these salesmen would undermine public trust in local business and that fraudulent representations would erode local sales and mal'ket share. Ethical companies employing honest door-to-door representatives now have a much hard\u00ad er, if not impossible, row to hoe in that county. Other business transactions threatened with \"greater inconvenience\" because of \"the awareness of fraud and danger of duplicity\" include those which rely on the holder-in-due-course doctrine. If, for example, a finance company purchased an installment contract (and thus the right to collect the installment payments) from a home repair firm which initially negotiated the installment agreement with a homeowner who wantea to spread out his payments for needed roof repairs, the finance company -as a holder in due course - 117 would have the right to collect all remaining installments due from the homeowner even though the roof repairs were neyer done or impropertly done. In oversimplified terms, the holder-in-due-course doctrine can enable the home repair firm to get paid for a fraud by selling the installment .agree\u00ad ment to the finance company, and enables the finance company to collect from the homeowner, who is told that any problem or argument he has must be settled between him and the home repair outfit, Which would involve costly litigation, if, indeed, the firm could still be located. The villain is not the holder-in-due-course doctrine. It helps assure the availability of ready sources of financing to many businesses, which in turn are therby better able to grant credit to their customers. As applied to ethical businesses, the doctrine is a boon to all concerned. But because some firms are using it as a key element in schemes to defraud consumers, more and more legislation and court decisions are tearing down the barrier that hitherto has insulated the finance company from the homeowner's complaints and claims against the home repair firm. The net result is that even ethical and responsible companies are experiencing \"greater inconvenience\" in effect\u00ad ing hitherto simple business transactions \"because of the awareness of fraud and danger of duplicity.\" Reflection on the above examples of the less tangible and long-term consequences of white-collar crime leads to two major conclusions: 1. To combat white-collar crime is not merely a matter of ethically operated businesses continuing to operate that way. They must also take steps to weed out the irresponsible within their industry or profession, for the backlash created by illegalities of others is bound to affect even the most scrupulously run enterprise. 2. To face the issue of white-collar crime is to heed the words of a judge who had just tried a particularly significant case involving a white\u00ad collar offense: '!This is a shocking indictment of 11 vast section of our economy, for what is really at stake here is the survival of the kind of economy under which America has grown to greatness, the free enterprise system.\" n3 AN INADEQUATE RESPONSE Despite the emergence of many bright spots indicative of changing attitudes, the following responses to white-coll ar crime are sti 11 much too prevalent: accept it stoically as an unavoidable cost of doing business; ratilonalize failure to attack industrywide problems on the grounds that this is the job of law enforcement; maintain the view that \"if it were wrong, there would be a law against it\"; and refuse to admit the problem even though no one has ever looked very hard. Such a lukewarm set of responses has been motivated, at least in part, by fear that a more active and overt reaction to white-collar crime would result in unfavorable publicity, legislative and regulatory restrictions, numerous law suits, and additional expenses. But all this has occurreu despite the low-keyed response and probably has been much more severe, both quantitatively and qualitatively, than what would have resulted if business, industry, and the professions had been viewed by legislators, the public, and the courts as having faced the issue squarely through the implementation of appropriate policies and countermeasures. Basically, the real question to be settled is \\~hether business (1) wants to bear the cost of subsidizing white-collar crime by treating it with kid gloves or (2) wants to invest in a gloves-off strategy which, although not ~Iithout cost, promi ses to earn a much hi gher return over the long run. The first approach tolerates white-collar crime, places the problem at the door\u00ad steps of law enforcement agencies and legislatures, and abdicates responsi\u00ad bility for self-regulation. The second strategy leads to the development of aggressive policies and procedures that (1) anticipate and combat white\u00ad coliar crime within any given business; (2) weed out, through collective action, problems common to an industry or profession; and (3) forge cooper\u00ad ative relationships with law enforcement agencies. For its part, law enforcement is giving every sign of increasing its efforts against white-collar crime. Indicative of federal ~ is this statement in the Attorney Genera 1'2,. Fi rst Annual _Report: \"The Fodera 1 Government is committed to efforts to protect American consumers and busi\u00ad nesses from the ravaging effects of 'white collar crime. \"' The FBI, for example, recently announced intensified investigative activity in this area. 119 Among the state-level agencies giving heightened attention to white\u00ad collar crime is the Strategic Investigations Bureau of the Florida Depart\u00ad ment of Law Enforcement. One of the Bureau's objectives is to abort fraud before the full effect of the crime is felt or even before the scheme is put into operation. The emphasis is on prevention, not reaction after the fact. Receiving funds from the Law Enforcement Assistance Administration (LEAA), the Bureau is geared to uncover and probe hints of fraud, and to allocate the substantial amounts of manpower, money, and time so often required to piece together the elements of suspicious occurrences to deter\u00ad mine whether a fraud is indeed planned or in progress, and, if ~o, how it operates and who the principals and intended victims are. At the local level, the National District Attorneys Association has undertaken a nationwide demonstration project funded by LEAA and directed by the Economic Crime Project Center in Washington, D.C. The offices of 15 district attorneys are committed to developing the organization and techniques to prosecute economic crimes having a major impact on the public. ~ Priorities include all types of merchandising frauds; auto and major appliance ~ repair swindles; crimes arising from the energy crisis; housing and land development frauds; and health, welfare, and medical frauds. Also, attention is directed at computer-related crime and problems associated with intro- ducing computer-generated data as evidence in court proceedings. A forth- coming manual will document procedures, techniques, and model statutes. Adding to the interest of investigators and prosecutors in white-collar crime is the realizat.ion that investigation of one such offense is often tied to, and can help solve, other crimes. An investigation of a credit card fraud, for example, could lead to the arrest of not only the immediate possessor of the card but also a pickpocket~ burglar, cargo thief, or fence. Arrests in connection with an advance fee swindle (fees are paid for loans that do not materialize) may lead to the discovery that the assets of the \"lending company\" are really stolen, counterfeit, or bogus securities, which might be traced back to a fence, a dishonest broker's employee, or a number of other criminals or illegal operations. Also, law enforcement officials can be expected to become increasingly attentive to white-collar crime when the benchmark indicative of investigative and prosecutive skill is seen as 120 not so much the successful robbel\",y or murder investigation and prosecution but the arrest and conviction of those involved in intricate and complicated white-collar schemes. BASIC CAUSES AND OVERALL POLICIES Specific countermeasures for white-collar cime can be more intelligent\u00ad ly devised and can achieve better results (1) when implemented by those who are aware of some of the causes of white-collar crime and (2) when reinforced by the types of policies and pl'ocedures disclJ1ssed below. WHAT CAUSES WHITE-COLLAR CRIME? Some white-collar crime is attributable to those who are simply \"rotten apples.\" These are the people who seem to have an inborn predisposition to defraud whenever the slightest opportunity presents itself. Fortunately, individuals of this type constitute a small minority and account for a small proportion of internal dishonesty. Some persons, while initially honest, become subjected to pressures ori\u00ad ginating outside the firm and resort to various forms of dishonesty. Such pressures include unusual and sudden family expenses (extended illness, for example), unsuccessful stock market speculation, gambling debts, loan shark involvement, problems with a side-business, a drug or alcohol problem, or just plain high living. Dishonest'acts may be rationalized in a variety of ways -the company can afford it; the firm allows for a certain amount of dishonesty; the business can always raise prices and, in any event, insur\u00ad ance will take care of the losses. Another group of employees -usually larger than the previous two cate\u00ad goreis -are diverted from ethical behavior by various on-the-job irr'ita\u00ad tions: low and inadequate wage or salary, resentment against the company for alleged unfair or inconsistent policies, inordinately severe disciplinary actions, substandard working conditions, or a deep-seated feeling of not being appreciated by superior's. In one case, a hospital employee reported that his salary was so low that he was actually expected to steal from supplies to supplement it. At one company, lower-ranking employees were told to fraudulently inflate their 121 expense accounts so as not to show up the fat accounts of top management. Or access to company materials and services for personal use are granted to executives as a reward for extra effort, as a bonus for performing an unpleasant task, or as a peace'offering to salve defeats in policy battles or status tiffs. When this type of atmosphere develops, especially in con\u00ad junction with loose controls, employees are, in effect, extended an open invitation to pilfer, embezzle, etc. A survey of businessmen's ethics highlighted the \"many pressures for unethical conduct\" and noted that \"in\u00ad dustry environment\" was considered by respondents as \"more closely related to dishonest behavior than is the need for money.\" Inl effect, what can happe.1 is that, in contrast to a company being victimized by a few employees who were evildoers from their first Jay on the job, the firm itself subjects initially honest and well-motivated persons to a number of subtle and not so subtle pressures, so that mis\u00ad conduct is fostered, of not encouraged or even demanded, by \"the system.\" KEY MANAGEMENT POLICIES, CONTROLS, PROCEDURES, METHODS Management must squarely fa,ce this crucial question: Is internal dis\u00ad honesty the l'esult of a few bad apples that exist in an otherwise sound barrel, or is the barrel itself contributing to the contamination of the integrity of its contents? The answer requires an evaluation of basic policies, procedures, and controls -such as those briefly noted below. The role of leadership Strong evidence supports the contention that sound leadership methods constitute the most essential precondition for an adequate level of integ\u00ad rity within the firm. According to an authoritative survey, \"Close exam\u00ad ination of our data reveals a tendency in every age group, company milieu, and management level for a man to accept the values of his superiors. This tendency . should be acknowledged by every administrator as a part of hi s power for good or eVil.\" When asked to list those influences that lead executives to make unethi\u00ad cal decisions, survey respondents put the behavior of their superiors at the 122 top of the list. Conversely, when asked what in~luences them to make ethical deds.ions, the behavior of superi.ors ranked second; in first place was onels personal code. Almost anyone Nho has worked within the frame~/Ork of an organization will agree that there are individuals who perform at high levels of inte\u00ad grity no matter what pressures are exerted on them by internal or extel'nal sources. At the other end of the spectrum are the very few who are willing to engage in misconduct whenever a reasonable opportunity comes along. In between are a sizable majority that, depending on the caliber of leadership they are exposed to, make or break the organizationls reputation for inte~ grity. These are the individuals who, in varying degrees, are most suscept\u00ad ible to leadership and are ready to go Nherever the stream takes them. A good leader can control the direction of the stream, A leader who is unduly authoritarian and demands from subordinates unquestioned loyalty to him, instead of to values, ideals, and standards, runs a substantial risk of inducing a ment~lity that equates integrity with \\~hatever th~ boss says is right. Obviously, this is not to downgrade the value of strong leadership but'to highlight that a good leader, rather than seeking to promote undying loyalty to himself, should attempt to promote loyalty to a set of values which he himself scrupulously adheres to and publicly espouses. If a superior engages in mii~conduct and this is known to subordinates, a few of the latter may well seek to do the same thing, knoNing that their superior cannot stop them without subjecting himself to exposure as well. Performance standards A not uncommon failure of leadership is the assignment of too much work or the establishment of unrealistic performance standards in relation to the quantity and/or quality of employees. This may pressure subordinates into f.alsifying records to reflect attainment of objectives that are, 'in reality, utopian under the circumstances. Once this practice begins, al\u00ad teration of records for personal prDfit can be just a short step away. A division manager, for example, is quoted as saying he is unhappy over \"strong pressures for superior results which lead to a compromise of person- 123 al integrity in operations.\" Another manager has complained of how \"one's own ethical will must be subordinated to tnterests at the top not only to advance but even to be retained.\" De 1 egati on of res pons i bil i ty, authori ty, and accountabil ity Effective delegation of dec'ision-making is not only sound management but also good crime prevention. When responsibility and accountability cannot be fixed, neither can blame -an appealing situation to the dishonest employee and an unwarranted temptation for the weak-willed. However, not much is accomplished unless there is also delegation of the requisite authority or power to fulfill responsibilities for which subordinates are held accour.table. Lack of authority may foster a timidity among subordinates that manifests itself as an unwillingness to make decisions except by a complicated process in which so many participate in a given decision that no one person can be held responsible for it. Finally, responsibility, authority, and accountability should be dele\u00ad gated to the lowest level of the organization consistent with sound decision\u00ad making. (However, overall responsibility for security matters is frequently delegated too far down the management ladder.) This tends to preclude an unhealthy we/they dichotomy -where the minority \"we's\" are those in the upper and middle strata of the organization, where concern for integrity may be high but where significant delegation has halted, and the majority \"they's\" are lower-level subordinates who, because they have not been expected to assume significant responsibilities regarding integrity or anything else, develop a who-cares attitude that promotes dishonest beha\u00ad vior and, through peer pressure, affects new employees as well. Implementing basic controls and procedures The decision of whether to implement controls and procedures by which to combat white-collar -rime does not begin with a cost/benefit study but with an honest answer to this question: What kind of a company do you want? Hopefully, the answer is a company whose management sets and adheres to high standards and alerts employees and the pu~lic that the firm has a zero\u00ad tolerance policy regarding breaches of intp.grity. Once this basic course of 124 action is taken, then the appropriate time has arrived to decide how to utilize most effectively the company's resources to prevent and detect white-collar crime. More often than not, such efforts turn out to be justi\u00ad fied not only on the basis that management has a responsibility to society and is morally obligated to pursue them but also in telms of increased pro\u00ad ~ts. In other words, efforts to combat white-collar crime can be regarded as a profit-center type of activity: they involve costs but also generate a return that can markedly improve the bottom line. Measures to counter white-collar crime should seek to achieve the fol\u00ad lowing objectives: 1. Minimize company exposure to individuals with a predisposition or motive to commit white-collar offense . This can be achieved, for example, by appropriate screening of employees nnd by revising those personnel policies that cultivate a \"get even\" attitude. 2. Reduce available opportunities (securely store blank checks) and methods (apply the separation-of-duties principle) for white-collar crime. 3. Increase the probability of detection when frauds do occur, such as by conducting spot checks and unannounced audits. 4. Discipline those who are apprehended. 5. Obtain feedback to determine if promulgated countermeasures have, indeed, been implemented and are being properly followed by operating personnel. Failure to do this ,is widespread and negates an otherwise well-planned program. Countermeasures are easy victims of \"field attrition,\" which occurs when operating personnel bypass established procedures for convenience or other reasons. As someone interviewed for this report quipped, \"There are three sets of security procedures: Nhat they really are, what management thinks they are, and what is done by those who are supposed to apply them.\" Separation of duties Another criti ca 1 fraud control is adherence to the separati O,i; ,of-functi ons prindple. More often than not, implementation of this antifraud measure will be more of a matter of administrative changes than of cash outlays. There are four facets to this measure: 1. No individual should have total control over every phase of any significant transaction or sensitive job. (Those who maintain inven\u00ad tory records do not participate in physical counts of inventory.) 125 2. Work flows should proceed from one person to another so that, without duplication, the work of the second acts as a check upon that of the first. (Merchandise for shipment is picked by one employee, taken to the loading dock by another, and checked onto a truck'by a third - all of whose tallies should agree.) 3. Those who authorize the use of assets should not also be responsible for their custody. (The inventory clerk releases materials only upon receipt of an authorization from a department head.) 4. Recordkeeping and bookkeeping activities should be separated from the handling and custody of assets. (The accounts receivable clerk should not also open mail containing incoming payments.) If a business is so small that there are not enough employees among whom to divide responsibilities in a manner that would otherwise be desirable, job rotation might be considered,. Or assignment of dual responsibility for a given task could achieve the same purpose. As with any control, the application of separation-of-duties could be carried to such lengths that it creates a counterproductive atmosphere of mlJtual distrust among employees or generates such a labyt'inth of procedural red tape that various informal shortcuts are devised over which no contro'is exist. Detecting white-coll ar cl'ime - the audit and the computer Despite repeated warning to the contrary, too many businessmen still assume that a major purpose of ordinary examinations of financial state\u00ad ments by independent auditors is the detection of fraud. This is untrue. Such audits are for the purpose of enabling the independent accountant to render an opinion on whether the financial statements are presented in conformity with generally accepted principles of accounting and whether such principles have been consistently applied in ~e preparation of the statements covering the current period in relation to those of the corres\u00ad ponding preceding period. Discovery of fraud may well be a byproduct, but the normal independent audit cannot be relied upon to assure its discovery. As a publication of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants pOints out - 126 I \"The respollsi bil ity of the independent auditor for fail ure to detect fraud ... arises only when such failure clearly results from failure to comply with generally accepted auditing standards .. \"If an objective of an independent auditor's examination ~Iere the dis\u00ad covery of all fraud, he would have to extend his work to a point where its cost would be prohibitive. Even then he could not give assurance that all types of fraud had been detected, or that none existed, because items such as unrecorded transactions, forgeries, and collusive fraud would not ne\u00ad cessarily be uncovered. Accordingly, it is generally recognized that good internal control and fidelity bonds provide protection more economically and effectively.\"* Frequently, when smaller businesses engage outside accountants, the latter are told to perform limited work only -to see that the books are kept in accordance with the law, that expenses are charged to the right category, and that tax returns are filed properly. Financial statements are neither audited nor certified.. Thus misunderstanding of the outside auditor's role and/or his under\u00ad utilization can leave firms seriously exposed to undetected fraud. Hhat is often required as a supplement is what might be termed the investigative operations audit. Such an audit attempts to (1) verify that promulgated procedures, controls, and policies are being followed by operating personnel, (2) determine if there are problems or signs of developing trouble, and (3) probe for and then investigate possible irregularities. For example, ABC Co. pays $20,000 monthly to XVZ for the rental of construction equipment. A normal audit of ABC would, among other things, involve the comparison of bills received by ABC with the corresponding checks sent to XVZ. XVZ may even be sent a notice requesting that it verify the issuance of its bills. Everything checks out. Those conducting an investigative operations audit, however, might well pursue the matter further. Knowi ng that XVZ subcontracts mill ions 0\"1' don ars. of work to ABC, the auditors may want to confirm that the $20,000 is, indeed, for equipment rentals and not a kickback. In an actual case where this' situation pre- * Statement on Auditing Standards No.1, p. 3. 127 vailed, auditors did not find the alleged equipment and determined that the payments were payoffs. Therefore, the investigative operations audit, which may be conducted by the internal staff or by an outside firm, helps provide management with feedback on the extent to which procedures and controls are being followed, serves to deter attempts at fraudulent activity, and constitutes an effective measure by which to detect fraud. Such audits can achieve maximum effective\u00ad ness when there is good communication with, and c\"lose cooperation among, the independent public accountant, the investigative operations audit staff, and the company's security personnel. Owners of very small companies can achieve a semblance of an operations audit by conducting unannounced spot checks of operations. This could be done in conjunction with the deliberate injection of errors into operations to determine if they will be detected and corrected in a timely manner. For example, resubmit paid invoices to determine if they are approved for payment a second time. 01' have a package pass signed by someone not authorized to do so to see if the gate guard is on his toes. Companies possessing computers have a potentially strong weapon by which to detect fraud. As one observer notes, \"The computer is ideally suited for detection techniques because it has the potential for continuously checking the smallest details in randon fashyon with high frequency .... It is possible to design mechanisms that will detect unusual activities on the part of those who are served by the system.\" Once an abnormality is detect\u00ad ed, this could trigger an exception report. For example, the computer could be programmed to detect the following: * Out-of-character purchases or consumption of materials in a department (false purchases from a fictitious supplier?). * Payroll expenditures in excess of what is known to be the true figure (embezzlement?). * Abnormal spending patterns (stolen credit card?) * Unusual trading patterns on stock exchanges (manipulation?). * Customers whose credit limits have been exceeded by a given amount (scam?). 128 * Out-of-line ratios, such as raw materials u\u00a3age in relation to units produced (high ratio might indicate theft of materials). * Sudden fluctuations, such as in expense accounts (padding?) or in commissions (kickbacks?). computer utilization for auditing and detection purposes can be expected to increase substantially in the years ahead. Reporting and prosecuting \\~hite-collar criminals Company policies regarding reporting white-collar crimes to law enforce\u00ad ment and pressing for the prosecution of the offenders vary from invariable prosecution, except when requested otherwise by the court, to the procedure of a firm whose manager said, \"It is my company's policy under no circum\u00ad stances will we ever sign a criminal complaint against anyone who commits a criminal act against persons or property in our care.\" The following are among the reasons offered by executives for not alerting authorities to wen serious white-collar crimes for which ample evidence is available: 1. The firm obtains restitution in return for a promise not to inform law enforcement. 2. An executive covers up his protege's illegality so that chances for a promotion will not be tarnished. 3. The company covers up an embezz'lement for fear it might be found action\u00ad ably negligent in having not detected the crime sooner. 4. The company may be exposed to bad publicity and its image may suffer. 5. Executives are afraid of countersuits for libel, malicious prosecution, false arrest, etc. 6. The criminal justice process is so fraught with delay and other foul-ups that defense attorneys can prolong a case for two years or more and con\u00ad stitute a substantial drain on managerial time. 7. The end resul t of adjudi c~ti on will be a mere sl ap on the WY'i st -an outcome not worth the trouble to achieve. 8. The firm is interested only in eliminating the cause of profit loss - that is, in terminating the employee, perhaps on a collateral issue (poor work, absenteeism, etc.) 129 9. Mi\\na,gement feels sorry for the offender. While there can be considerable sympathy for' some of these reasons - such as Numbers 6 and 7 -none is. SUfficient to support a no-prosecution policy and many could, in themselves, be outright illegal. For example, in some states, failure to report afelony is itself a crime. And granting the offender a promise not to prosecute in return for restitution could, in some jurisdictions, be considered as compounding a crime, an act which entails criminal liability. Also, such a deal might enable the offender successfully to claim duress or to assert that his statement of guilt was not voluntary and thus is invalid. Acceptance of restitution may also jeopardize a company's recourse to third parties, such as banks that cashed forged checks or outlets that received stolen merchandise. Finally, if an employer accepts restitution from, or conceals a crime by, someune covered by a blanket bond, the in\u00ad surer may have grounds to deny future claims occasioned by this individuaJ. Regarding fears that the company image will suffer by pressing for prosecution, that court actions are too time-consuming and are bad for employee morale, and that the matter is best left to insurers and bonding companies, etc., reassessment of this view is long past due. For one thing, an overt, well-publicized drive by business\u00b7to weed out and pursue prosecation of white-collar criminals would probably be regarded as a breath of fresh air by a public long since fed up with policies that cushion the consequences of breaches of integrity. As a committee of industrial secur\u00ad ity officers concluded, \"Experience by those company leaders who have made the decision to prosecute shows that most of their fears never materialized.\" Worries over the shortcomings of the criminal justice system should stimulate efforts to improve it, not avoid it through a no-prosecution pol icy. According to those interviewed, both within and outside of law enforce\u00ad ment, company fears of suits charging false arrest, libel, malicious prose\u00ad cution are greatly exaggerated and blown way out of proportion to the like\u00ad lihood of their occurrence. This is particularly~ue when a little advance planning 'with your legal counsel and/or security advisor covers procedures 130 relating to inyestigati,ng fraud? interrogating suspectS1 gathering evidence, and determing its sUfficiency. Obviously, avoidance of a no-prosecution policy does not necessarily imply that all offenses should be'reported to law enforcement, which does not appreciate being used as a collection agency. The intent of the offender and the dollar amount involved are conunon criteria on which the decision to press charges is based. Neither justice nor the problems of an over-burdened criminal justice system are best served by reporting every petty offense (theft of pencils, paper, etc.) to police. Internal discipline should suffice in such cases. However, with regard to substantive white-coll ar crimes that can be documented with sufficient evidence, the best interests of the company and public dictate disclosure to law enforcement. The policy of one firm is as follows: * Employees will cooperate in the investigation, detection, and prosecution of criminal offenders. * Those cOl1lT1itting crimes will be \"aggressively prosecuted.\" * Except for incidents of petty theft/dishonesty, all misdemeanors and felonies will be reported to police. However, police are not to be used as a collection agency. * Restitution will in no way alter the company's above-stated policy to prosecute. Advance planning in this area is essential. As noted by a group of industrial security specialists, when policies and procedures have been prepared ahead of time, \"the company's best interests and its obligations to society can be scrutinized quickly and thoroughly. Frantic research and consultation can thus be replaced by a well-oiled, decisive machine attending to the merits of the case at hand thoroughly and with dispatch. Questions of prosecution, whether rare or' frequent, large 01' small, will then create little or no disruption within the organization.\" 131 TAILORING COUNTERMEASURES TO THE CRINE In contrast to the generally applicable policies and procedures outlined in the preceding chapter, the following controls and preventive measures zero in on specific frauds. However, the suggestions below are presented primarily for illustrative purposes. That is, they are far from complete and do not constitute an all-purpose remedy. They must be built upon and tailored to fit the needs and dimensions of a given business. REDUCING EXPOSURE TO BANKRUPTCY FRAUD Paramount to implementing a preventive program to combat scam operations is an awareness by your credit and sales personnel. Your sales force is often in a position to detect early warning signals first -such as changes in management, the overly easy sale, orders involving goods unrelated to the customer's business, etc. Next rev.iew the dollar cut-off point demarcating when you order a credit check and when you routinely shi p the goods. Bankruptcy pl anners:often depend on high cut-off points. Seek assistance of a credit-rating organization. Be sure that the service you receive involves something more than an unverified repetition of what th~ rated company told the credit burea,u. Review your policy on rush orders. If one arrives from a new account, do you omit a credit check? If one of your salesmen alerts you to a change in management at a cus\u00ad tomer company, do you take steps to find out whom you are now dealing with? Are customers assigned credit limits? If an unusually large order from a customer exceeds his limit, is shipment delayed until further information is obtained? Is too much reliance plac~d on commissions for salesmen's compensation? If so, the sales force may be tempted to book orders despite strong suspi\u00ad cions about the customer. Shipping department personnel cao be instructed to report destinations that seem incompatible with the product reing shipped. For example, a load 132 of stereos destined for, or rerouted tOI a machine shop should_.~aise questions. With regard to C.O.D. orders, instructions could be issued to drivers not to accept checks,even certified checks (the \"certified\" stamp Gal1 be, and ha,s been, counterfeited). HOl~ TO COMBAT BRIBERY, KICKBACKS, PAYOFFS Aside from ethical considerations, there are persuasive economic grounds favor-ing implementation of antibribery policies. For example, one company reported a sales loss of $lO-million during a ten-month period after its officers were indicted for bribery. Also, many courts have ruled in the negative regarding the question of whether a firm whose employee has given a bribe is entitled to collect for the work done or goods delivered. A recent decision indicated that a city could recover $689,000 previously paid to a contractor because the contract had been legally voided by the taint of bribery. Countermeasures applicable to business-government dealings Management should prohibit gifts, no matter how small, to public officials. A gift of a bottle of scotch, a free pass, or a discount can be construed as directed at thE; same end as would be a \"gift\" of $10,000. Businesses must ban all activities that are breaches'of integrity in appearance as well as in fact. This policy should be publicized to all government-related custom\u00ad ers. (Of course, this is applicable to private-sector customers, too.) For its part, government should adopt a similar policy. For example, a letter circulated by a city's police department to various local businesses warned that offi cers are not to be given a ti p, gratuity, or other benefit for the perfonnance of dt1ty. The department also implemented a policy of arrest\u00ad ing not only bribe-taker!! but also bribe-givers. Such a policy should be encouraged by the business conmunity. Appropriate action should be taken to promote the establishment of a statewide commission, or, if necessary, a city-based agency, which is in\u00ad sulated from political pressures and whose primary responsibility is the investigation of official corruption. Those in the professions can take immediate and resolute efforts to 133 convert their often rusty disciplinary machinery into a well-oiled apparatus. Today, for example, the American Bar Association shows strong signs of doing just that, no doubt motivated by the harsh conclusion drawn from its own merctl ess examination of di sciplinary procedures: liThe COfl111ittee has found that in some instances disbarred attorneys are able to continue to practice in another locale .. that lawyers convicted of serious crimes aremt disciplined until after appeals from their convic\u00ad tions have been concluded, often a matter of three or four years, so that eyen lawyers convicted of serious crimes, such as bribery of a governmental agency employee, are able to practice before the very agency whose represen\u00ad tative they have corrupted .... \"* Finally, solicitations of payoffs by public officials should be re\u00ad ported to appropriate law enforcement agencies. Preventing bribes and kickbacks among those in the private sector Assure that receiving operations are separated from purchasing so that buyers, except through collusion with receiving personnel, will not be tempted to accept short deliveries in return for kickbacks. Whenever practicable, competitive bids should be required. An executive from outside the purchasing department should review bids and inspect the quality of incoming goods to determine if specifications have been met. Vendors should be informed that they will be granted a hearing if they have any complaints about the fairness or impartiality of purchasing pro\u00ad cedures. Purchasing agents and buyers should be required to report monthly regarding whether they have received any gifts, gratuities, or any other consideration from vendors and, if so, the details. Receipt of substantial gifts should be prohibited. Some companies forbid employee~ to receive any gifts, regardless of value. If management wants to allow acceptance of token gifts during the holiday season, vendors should be instructed to deliver them to the employee's business address, not to his home. * American Bar Association Special Committee on Evaluation of Disciplinary Enforcement, Problems and Recoll1l1endat;ons in Discipl ,nary Enforcement, June 1970, p. 1. 134 If a supplier other than the low bidder is selected, the reasons should be documented and sent to top management for review and approval, Purchases from financially shaky suppliers should be prohibited without written approval of top management. If possible, a \"shifting system\" for purchases should be utilized - that is, rotate purchasing agents and suppliers perioJica1ly, Insltruct employees tCl refuse and then report any demands by customers for payoffs, Policies pertaining to company gifts, gratuities, etc\" to employees of other firms should be strict. If the sending of token gifts is pennitted, reports should be required regarding the description of gifts sent, their value, and the recipients ' names, titles, and office addresses. When a buyer's taste, rather than a set of specifications, must enter into the purchas i ng deci si on -as in l\"eta il i ng -one way to di scourage kickbacks is to set high standards of performance. Buyers whose lines sell are rewarded, while those whose purchases too often wind up in the bargain basement are dealt with accordingly. Indeed, objective, visible, and measurable performance standards for personnel throughout any organiza\u00ad tion can help preclude payoffs to superio~either for an undeserved promo\u00ad tion or for a cover-up of inferior work or short hours. Development and monitoring of standards costs and/or usage rates can help deter kickbacks in some areas. For example, fail\"ly accurate projections for fuel-oi1 consumption in relation to outside temperature can discourage your janitor or boiler room personnel from receiving kickbacks for accepting less heating oil than indicated on the bill from the oil distributor. Policies should be developed to maintain an armis-length relationship with unions and sources of financing. Bribe paymentsare frequently recorded on the books as \"commissions,\" and honest employees are occasionally duped into believing the payments are legitimate. Procedures should be developed so that management is alerted (1) when paymentsof \"commissions\" are not documented by the\"usual paperwork, such as canceled checks and invoices (often bypassed if a payment is illegal); (2) when the alleged commissions are not in line with widely recognized trade practices; and (3) when the payments are made through banks not used in connection with normal transactions of the business. 135 COUNTERING COMPUTER-RELATED CRIME An authority on computer crime has observed that the IIpossibility of exposure represents a real threat to the computer criminal, who has an investment in hi s professi ona 1 life that woul d be ru\" ned if hi s acts be\u00ad came known to his associates. For this reason detection should get at least as much attent10n from the system designer as prevention.\"* Development and ~:fTedive implementation of such measures are particular\u00ad ly important when one considers the explosive growth in the number of com\u00ad puters, minicomputers, and remote terminals predicted for the next six years or so. The importance of appropriate counter-measures is further under\u00ad scored by the pivotal role assigned computers in the heralded less-cash, less-check society, involving as it might the ele~~ronic transfer of funds. With this in mind, warnings regarding threats to teleprocessing assume added importance. The number and sophistication of protective measures to combat various threats depend on several factors, such as the type of computer system (batch or integrated, in-house terminals or remote terminals, etc.), the sensitivity of the data (the seriousness of disclosure or alteration), the principal applications of the computer, and the reliability of the users. The following measures are illustr~tive of various types of controls. Overall procedural guidelines Separation of responsibilities is a basic control -e.g., programmers should not also be computer operators and vice versa, of course. A possible alternative is dual control over certain functions, an approach that would help avoid proliferation of narrOl'/, uninteresting jobs. Rotation of pro\u00b7\u00b7 grammers and operators among different programs and machines is a possibility, too. Computer operations must be independent of other departments -e.g., EDP personnel should not have access to such assets as cash and inventories and they should not be in a position to authorize checks, purchase orders, * Donn B. Parker, \"Prottle of a Computer Criminal,\" Data ~1anagement, July 1973. (Reprinted from Investments in Tomorrow, Stanford Research Institute.) 136 shipping documents, and the like. RI.~quire EOP personnel to take their vacations ~ hopefully during a period coyertng month-end activities. Use of computer equipment, particularly when overtime is involved, should be by explicit permission and recorded as such. After-hours processing should be subject to the same controls and pro\u00ad cedures that apply during the normal work day. TranMctions that are listed as exceptions because they did not pass one or more control points should be investigated and resolved promptly. Unexplained stoppages or interruptions should be logged, as should errors and action taken. Physical and data socurity measures should be reviewed and audited periodically. Access to computer facilities should be on a need-to-know basis. Program-related controls Programmers should give written -not oral -instructions to computer operators. Programs should contain a statement of ownership. This will help deter program thieves or, if not, will facilitate their later prosecution. Controls written into programs should not be indiscriminately over\u00ad ridden. Overrides should be reflected ;n exception reports. The responsibilities of writing, authnrizing, modifying, and running programs should be separated whenever pMsible. Threat-monitoring can be built into progr?~s whereby suspicious devia\u00ad t'ions from standards or from normal patterns can be detected and recorded in exception rlllorts. If, for example, the weekly payroll is $150,000 but the total came to $175,000, the program could cause this fact to appear in a special report. EDP auditors should be consulted regarding appropriate tests and checks to incorporate into application programs. When possible, divide responsibility beb/een two or more persons for the maintenance of programs vital to those applications that could be frau\u00ad changes to progra.ms. Documentation of pro\u00ad grams should include a written record of all changes, reasons therefor, dates, authorizations, and cross references to other affected prog~\u00b7ams. Program debugging should be separated from production activity. Data controls: input, output, tapes, disks Documents sent to the computer room for input processing should be a.ccountul for -that is, the number sent is compared with the number received .. Corrections on source docuPJents for input processing should be made by the originating department only. Retain source records for a sufficient period so they can be related to output documents if necessary. Vendor checks, payroll checks, and other negotiable items, as well as important fonns (e.g., purchase orders), should be numbered sequentially. Errors in processed data spotted by user departments should be promptly reported to the appropriate person or group within the EDP facility. A method of controlling both the number of records processed and the accuracy of the processing itself involves the development of various totals. By detennining the sum of purchase order numbers, stock item numbers, account codes. etc . and comparing such \"hash\" totals from time to time throughout the processing, various errors (omissions, duplicate processing, etc.) can be detected. Sequence checking can detect gaps in sequential numbering (as might occur in a check-writing run) and duplicate numbers can be located. Output should be logged and stored in a secure fashion until routed to authorized recipients. The tape and disk library should be either manned or' locked, and account\u00ad ability for the maintenance of the library should be clearly fixed. A physical count should be made periodically of the inventory of all tapes, disk files, programs, and supporting documents. How do you safeguard data communications? . Consider use of machine-readable cards or badges by which terminal users can identify themselves to the system. Collect such cards at the end of each work period. 138 Passwords and individual security codes used to identify terminals and their users, respectively, should be changed periodically, Relatively new devices by which to identify terminal users are products enabling recognition of fingerprints and hand dimensions. At sign-off, telininal users could be required to indicate when they will return to an active status. Entry attempts during the interim are thus flagged as those by possible imperscnators. If data are considered highly sensitive, scramblers and cryptographic devices could'be used to safeguard the privacy of information during trans\u00ad mission. The computer could be progranned to disconnect terminals after a spe\u00ad cified period of inactivity by the terminal user. This helps guard against problems caused when a user leaves the terminal without signing off. Devices and procedures are available to limit access of a valid ter\u00ad minal user to certain files only, to allow him to read certain files but not to modify them, etc. Lockwords, which a terminal user can change at any time, can protect his file from being read by others. The system could record unsuccessful attempts by terminal users to gain entry to the computer -e.g., invalid codes, requests to access files that the terminal user is not authorized to use, etc. Users could be automati\u00ad cally disconnected in such cases. The audit of EDP operations An essential component of an early warning system for the detection of potentially destructive frauds is the EDP operations audit. According to one source, \"EDP is of such economic and procedural importance that pro\u00ad bably no system other\u00b7 than the financi alone shoul d be more heavily audited.\" Such audits may be performed by an internal group, by an outside or\u00ad ganization, or both. In any event, the EDP auditor is a combination accountant-programmer-computer analyst and functions as a friendly gadfly or devil's advocate. He keeps the data-processing staff alert by probing, testing, and evaluating procedures, controls, audit trails, safeguards, programs, security, etc. 139 Since computers have become such an integral part of both. small and large business enterprises; the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants has recognized that skills additional to those needed for audits of non-computer systems are necessary. t~embers of the accounting professions across the country have been alerted to the necessity of acquiring these additional skills. Also, the AICPA provides training programs and SlM'ces of information as well as leadership by providing solutions to ttle computer audit problem. Businessmen should check with their public accountants to determine if they are qualified to handle computer audits. Audits should be scheduled at appropriate intervals. During the interim period, the EDP system and its personnel could be monitored on a random basis, which would tend to keep the potential computer criminal off-balance and stimulate or heighten fear of detection. COMBATING CONSUMER FRAUD, ILLEGAL COMPETITION, DECEPTIVE PRACTICES The most effective measures by which businessmen can help prevent and combat frauds and other illegalities directed at consumers by the unethical are those undertaken through colle~tive action. However, there are a number of appropriate questions pertaining to inter'nal operations that management can ask itself: 1. Are sales goals and other performance standards so difficult to achieve that they encourage use of deceptive practices against consumers? 2. Do complaints from customers receive intelligent evaluation in terms of how they might be indicative of borderline tactics? 3. If salesmen or other employees spot signs of consumer fraud within the industry, such as price fixing, are they instructed to report this to management, who in turn inform the proper authorities? 4. Are sales personnel so dependent upon commissions that they might be tempted to employ deception to secure an order? 5. Has the company supported and encouraged the creation of a consumer protection unit within the district attorney1s office? 140 6. Does the firm encourage feedback from customers? 7. Does the management from time to time take a firsthand look at operations to compare printed policy a~d procedures vlith what actually goes on? 8. If the firm employs a debt collection agency, are its tactics aboveboard? 9. Do management personnel attend the occasional senlinars and conferences conducted by FTC regional offices to inform companies of the scope of the Commission's role? 10. Are infonnal opinions from FTC regional offices, or the more formal advisory opinions from the Commission itself, requested to obtain guidance on the legality of proposed action or practices contemplated by the company? Regarding the competitive illegalities and deceptive practices aimed at those in busi ness and the professi on, ill ustrati ve countenneasures ay'e as follows. Advance-fee frauds. Do not seek loans through brokers who deal with offshore or other foreign lenders unless detailed investigation rev7als the legitimacy of such sources of funds. If the institution offers you a Dun & Bradstreet report purporting to substantiate its financial state\u00ad ments, obtain independently another 0 & B report and, if one exists, compare the two. Do not deal with a lender who is not prepared to provide an audited financial statement certifi,ed by an accountant whose integrity those in the profession are willing to confirm. Verify that the executives listed as board members of the lending institution really occupy such positions. If the lender is an insurance company not well-known to you, check it out with your state's insurance commissioner. If the broker is willing to put his advance fee in an escrow account until you receive the loan, 1.erify that the bank where the fee will be deposited is 'itself not a dummy corporation created by the lender. Ponzi game. Do not place your investment funds with someone whose reputed financial wizardry is based on hearsay, not documented proof. This proof should come from those who are not cUY'rent clients of his. Any scheme that promises a fantastic return at minimal risk should be suspect. Verify claims made by the investment specialist that he handled the funds of vari ous \\~e ll-known personal i ti es. 141 f~anchlse-related frauds, including pyramid sales. If you are approached about purchasing a local franchise or distributorship, obtain the names and addresses of a representative nllmber of franchisees located near the area where you would operate. See them and become familiar with their operation, detennine their success, their ,opinion of the franchisor, and their problems. Have nothing to do with a franchise whose major money-making appeal is the sale of other franchises or of lower-level distributorships. Determine whether the franchise product or service is a proven one, or just a gimmick or an appeal to a transitory fad. Ask to see certified profit figures of franchisees who operate on a scale similar to what you are contemplating. If you do not have experience, verify the type of training, if any, the franchisor will provide. Check the franchisor's reputation with a Better Business Bureau or other consumer protection organization. Consult a lawyer and have him review all aspects of the proposed agreement before you si gn it. Land sales fraud. Read the disclosures contained in the developer's Property Report. There is no law preventing someone from selling you a house lot that is a swamp or is nowhere near a 'water supply if this is dis\u00ad closed in the Property Report. One purchaser bought a house lot -sight unseen -which turned out to be marshland; to drain it would require a Corps of Engineers pennit, the grantingofwhich is doubtful. All this was dis\u00ad closed in the Property Report, which the purchaser did not read. Ask a lawyer to review the Property Report and the agreement you are expected to sign. Do not purchase the property without personally inspecting the site. Do not waive the cooling-off period provided forin c0ntracts. Do not base decis\u00b7ions to purchase on promises -only on what is spelled out in 'the contract you sign. Check with the Office of Interstate Land Sales Registration (HUD) to see if litigation is in progress against the developer. Among the preventive measures th~t a land sales firm can take are (1) put salesmen on salary plus a limited bonus, which reduces commission-induced pressure to engage in deceptive practices and (2) instruct potential cus\u00ad tomers through advertisements to report any instances of sales puffery or other abuses to the company. 142 As for any of the many FTC-related offenses by which a company might be vic~imized, tlley should be described to key managers and employees, who should be instructed to inform top management whenever competitors are suspected of employing these anti competitive or deceptive practices. Often these illegal tactics are not brought to management's attention because those in a position to first detect them do not recognize the practices for Hhat they really are. If well-founded, reports of such illegalities should be forwarded to the proper authorities, just as should attempts at tax fraud. HOW TO REDUCE FRAUD BY CREDIT CARD Regarding credit card ~, they should safeguard their cards as they would cash. They should not leave cards in desk drawers at the office or on top of bureaus at home or in the glove compartmen~'of cars. When cards are lost or stolen, they should be promptly reported as such to the issuer. Upon receipt of a letter from an issuer indicating a new card was mailed recently, the user should Y.'espond immediately if the card has not arrived. Accept2T~ of cr~dit cards -especially their money-handlers, such as cashiers -can playa particularly critical role in preventing credit card fraud and in enhancing an establishment's reputation for being \"no pushover:\" * Check the dates on the card indicating when it becomes valid and when it expires. * Refer to issuer's card cancellation bulletin. * Note if the card appears altered or defaced. * Compare the signature on the card with that on the sales slip. * Can the issuer's special authorization number if any of the danger signals noted arouse suspicions -even if the purchase does not exceed the amount that would normally trigger such a call. * Keep card imprinters and blank charge slips under tight control. * Drop floor limits, in retail operations, to zero 'in selected departments occaSionally. * Keep cashier areas well-lighted to discourage unauthorized transactions and to reduce errors. 143 * Select as a cashier someone who has basic intelligence and who has been well.trained, * Do not allow waiters to imprint charge slips. * Investigate customer allegations of mishandled credit card transactions. Issuers of credit cards have taken steps rangi ng from the simpl e to the highly elaborate to detect and deter fraud. Credit card applications, for example, receive close scrutiny. One issuer requires six to eight weeks to complete such investigations; Shortly after cat'ds are mailed, a follow-up inquiry is sent to determine if the card arrived. This simple procedUl\"e has cut fraud losses substan\u00ad tially, thanks to the timely information it elicits. To reduce even further the possibilities of theft from the mail, some issuers us~ registered mail when cards are sent to \"high riskll Zip Code zones. Various security features are built into cards on a periodic basis as an anti counterfeiting measure. Computers of many card issuers can alert officials if a cardholder's spending departs from his traditional pattern; if so, the cardholder may receive a phone call from the issuer and be asked to confirm if his card is still in his possession. Depending on an acceptor's fral,ld-4oss record, he may be required to seek authorization -via phone -from the issuer before honoring a user's card in transactions above a prescribed amount. Computers of some issuers are able to relate the fraud-loss experience of an establishment to that of others in the same area. Where losses seem out of line, investigators may be sent to the scene. Card cancellation bulletins, which containthe numbers of stolen or lost cards, are sent toocceptors periodically and rewards are giVen to those who pick up up-expired cards listed in these bulletins. Experimentation is now under way with regard to computer-linked terminals that employ scanners to validate cards at the point of sale. The policy of one issuer dictates that the prosecution of a credit card criminal is never dropped unless so requested by the court. Necessary ex\u00ad penses to transport witnesses to court in order to testify are often paid 144 by the issuer. If a cardholder-witness refuses to testify, his card 1S re\u00ad voked. Finally. users, acceptors, and issuers all can check to see if thei.r re\"-pective states have enacted legislation based on the model State GredH Car~ Crime Act, Which resulted from an American Express Company-sponsored study of state and federal laws as they related to credit card fraud, The study determined that because of major weaknesses and loopholes, many ex\u00ad isting laws did not afford legal redress against the sophisticated techniques of today's credit card criminals. PREVENTIVE MEASURES FOR EMBEZZLEMENT AND PILFERAGE Though the warning may seem overly cynical, it warrants repeating here: the weakest link is your most trusted employee because he is in the best position to inflict the greatest damage. This should be kept in mind during the application of such preventive measures as the following. Illustrative embezzlement-related controls Cash Controls. Receipt and disbursement of money should not be performed by the same department that handles the accounting therefor. Over-the-counter cash sales should be supported by prenumbered sales slips. Refunds in cash should be prohibited; returned mershandise should be inspected by a supervisor and a check mailed to the customer. The person depositing money at the bank should be different from the individual preparing the deposit slip. Check cash receipts records against duplicate deposit slips. The employee who balances the day's cash against sales slips or cash register tape should not be involved in sales. Reconciliations of monthly bank statements should be done by an employee who does not handle the receipt and disbursement of cash. Small business owners should have bank statements sent to an address other than that of their businesses, should personally reconcile such state\u00ad ments, and examine all canceled checks and endorsements for clues to possible irregularities. Prenumber petty cash slir,s. Keep petty cash separate from other funds. Do not use petty cash funds to cash checks or for loans. 145 Disbursements. Pay bi 11 s by check. payment authorizations shoul d be invalidated (as with perforations) after payment so the~ will not be reused to support a fraudulent disbursement. Prenumber all blank checks and keep them under lock and key. Prepare checks with check-wriHng machines. Do not presign checks. Signed checks should not be returned for mailing to the person ~Iho prepared them. Compare canceled checks with invoices or vouchers regarding names of payees, dates, and amounts. Accounts receivable and sales. Correspondence related to accounts receivable should be handled by an employee other than the one who prepared the monthly statements. All adjustments (credits for returned goods, pricing errors, etc.) should be approved by an executive not having access to cash, Collection of past-due accounts should be assigned to someone outside the bookkeeping department. Invoices should be numbered sequentially. Bad debt write-offs should be approved by an executive outside the bookkeeping or sales departments. P~rchasing, receiving; accounts payable. Separate receiving from pur\u00ad chasing and both from accounts payable. Prepare purchase orders on pre\u00ad numbered forms. Send purchase order copies to receiving and accounts pay\u00ad able. Approve invoices for purchased materials only if accompanied by the purchase order and receiving report. Purchasing personnel should not be given responsibility for checking on the condition of goods received nor for storage and withdrawal of inventory. Typical pilferage countermeasures Physical inventories should be taken regularly and by a person not connected with the maintenance of perpetual inventory recor'ds. If inven\u00ad tories are at more than one location, physical counts should occur on the same day. Removals from inventory should be by reqUisition only. Do not permit drivers to put goods into, or remove them from, storage. Remove received materials to storage areas promptly. Have warehousemen check inventory arrivals against receiving records. Check for careless storage of valuable metals, such as copper, nickel, and brass. Inspect rubbish piles or other places of concealment near the 146 property's perimeter. ~lark with company name such tools as spray guns/ acetylene torches, electric drills, etc, Tool cribs and stockrooms should be checked for the presence of unauthorized or suspiciously acting employ\u00ad ees. The presence of property that is out of its customary area or appears to be placed for misappropriation should be reported immediately. Tools should be checked back into the tool crib at the end of each shift. Some companies report that since adopting a policy of lending tools to employees for home use, losses have decreased. When returned by the local driver, delivery receipts should be compared with control copies. Periodically rotate drivers among runs. Require pos\u00ad itive identification from pick-up drivers; record license plates, especially on rental vehicles. Segregate shipping from receiving areas. Delete ad\u00ad vertising from shipping cartons. Strap small cartons into one unit for pickup. Route truck shipments in a way that minimizes the number of inter\u00ad line transfers.* ~ A package control system can be effective in preventing pilferage of inventory, supplies, tools, and other property. But package pass fonns should be carefully regulated and charged by number to those authorized to issue them. Sample signatures of those authorized to issue passes should be available to guards at exit gates. Package passes should be Signed only at time of issue. Passes collected and then canceled by guards should be returned to the issuers for verification and destruction. Product components used on the assembly line may be desirable targets for pilferers. Some finns help control such losses by storing the main supply in locked cribs and distributing only those amounts required for the day's production. Once controls such as the above are implemented in a coordinated fashion, a more intelligent decision can be reached regarding the need for security personnel and such hardware-oriented controls as alarms, surveillance systems, etc. * For additional suggestions about how to reduce pilferage of cargo, see Cargo Theft and Organized Crime (October 1972). Available from the U.S. Government Printing Office, Washington, D.C. Price is 70 cents. 147 COUNTERMEASURES FOR INSURANCE FRAUD Countermeasures applicable to the false-claim racket include the following: 1. Check the claimant's name against the files of the insurance industryls Index System, a nationwide clearinghouse of injury claims. A lengthy claims history of an accident \"victim\" could indicate fraud. 2. Do not be beguiled into accepting a hasty settlement. 3. Secure independent medical evidence regarding alleged injuries. 4. Insist that the claimant document his case fully. As for preventive measures to reduce exposure to swindles by paper insurance companies, a basic precaution is to check the insurer with your state insurance commissioner -particularly when the company is based off\u00ad shore or overseas. Such alien insurers are screened with regard to their in'tegrity, and state insurance commissioners have access to the results of this screening. To guard against dealing with an insurer whose parent, if any, has weakened its stability through one or more of the tactics described in Chapter III, the prudent course is to seek the advice of your banker, in\u00ad surance consultant, or investment counselor to determine the corporate status of the insurer, the history ,of its financial dealings with its parent, if any, and an overall assessment of its stability. Your state insurance commissioner may also be of help in this regard. The same procedure could be followed to determine whether an insurer is authorized to sell the type of coverage being advertised. RECEIVERS OF STOLEN PROPERTY - SONE PREVENTIVE STEPS In the words of a former fence, the placement of identification numbers on products \"would stop a lot of burglars from burglarizing, a lot of receivers from receiving.\" Indeed, the greatest problem confronting prose\u00ad cutors and police officials in apprehending and convicting receivers is that stolen merchandise frequently cannot be identified by its owners. If a 148 businessmen is unable to distinguish between his goods that ~Iere legitimately marketed and those of his that were marketed as the result of a theft, his plant or store presents a tempting target to the thief-fence combination. Manufacturers have a particularly vital role in devising methods by which identification ntlmbers can be stamped on, or otherwise affixed to, products and merchandise. But product iaentification per se will achieve little if manufacturers, wholesalers, retaiiers, and consumers do not take the time -and expense -of recording the identification numb~rs of products currently in their possession. Such numbers are invaluable to law enforce\u00ad ment officials, who car. enter them into computerized criminal information systems, such as the FBI's Nationa1 Crime Information Center, which contaiiis data on a wide variety of stolen articles. Company personnel -especially the sales force -could be instructed to remain alert for the sale of company products at abnormal discounts or through unusual channels or outlets. They could be given the serial numbers of stolen goods. In one instance, a typewriter repairman noted that the serial number on the equipment he was servicing was on his employer's hot list. Management should not put so much pressure on buyers and purchasing agents that they resort to dealing with cut-rate underworld sources. Rather, they should carefully study the g09d bargains that may be offered from time to time, especially if the item to be purchased is drawn to their attention by those who operate outside the distribution channels usually associated with the product. Frequently theft victims -or their insurers -are approached by re\u00ad ceivers who offer to sell back the stolen merchandise. Though such offers may be tempting, they should be rejected. For a company to became the prime market for the merchandise. Though such offers may be tempting, they should be rejected. For a company to become the prime market for the merchandise stolen from it is hardly in the finn's best long-run interests -nor in the best interest of crime prevention. Routine inspection of outlets considered as capable of peddling stolen merchandise 'may reveal problems that your firm's internal controls failed to detect. If certain types of out'lets are commonly associated with selling 149 stolen property, attempts might be made to convince local government that it should outlaw or at least regulat8 them. In one ctty, the police are charyed with enforcing comprehensive regulations directed at over 50 dif\u00ad ferent types of businesses which are considered to be likely outlets for fencing or other undesirable activity. Some forms of business are banned altogether, such as flea markets. Business can support proposed federal legislatioli designed to permit civil suits (governed by less stringent rules of evidence than apply to criminal proceedings) by transport carrier5, shippers, or others lawfully in possession of goods moving in interstate commerce to recover tre~ damages from any person who buys, receives, or possesses such goods pro\u00ad viding such a person knows or should have known the stolen character of the goods. Themll, proposed by the Senate S01ect Committee on Small Business, would supplement the present criminal law in this area. Support for compar\u00ad able legislation at the state level &lso merits serious consideration. WHAT CAN RE DONE TO COUNTERACT SECURITIES THEFT AND FRAUD? There is a disturbing sufficiency of evidence to indicate that many within and outside of the securities industry assiduously avoid raising the necessary questions about the legitimacy of the certificates they handle. Indeed, in one reported case, a bank which learned that it was stuck with a stolen security palmed it off on <\"nother institution, which subseqLlently discovered the true nature of the certHicate. Reported apathy to subjecting securities and those who tender them to a thorough cros~\u00ad examination is the result of a combination of factors, accor~ing to many interviewerl fer this publication. * * * Naive trust. Greed which triumphs too frequently Qler reason. The commission is too appealing, or the deal is too tempting; as a result, questjons that should be answered are never even asked. Fear by some banks and brokers that by checking the authenticity of certificates with various stolen-security master lists -computerized and otherwise -the protection afforded by the ho:,ilr-in-due-course doctrine will be jeopardized. tn oversimp1ified terms, the doctrine 150 can protect a bank or broker from claims of ownership by prior holders of a securtty 1f the bank or broker accepts a negotiable instrument \"(n good faith and without knowledge of any IIproblems\" associated ~Iith the security, ~ltholJgh coming under increased attack, the case is made that if a banker or broker fails to chel:k exist'lng information, even when it is readily available on a timely basis, regarding the legi\u00ad timacy of a security, tili s does not sho~1 alack of good faith, etc. and the holder-in-due-course protection is not affected. However, so some would argue, once the banker or broker subscribes to a system or service that provides such information, failure to use It in a given case negates due-course protection and opens the floodgates of potential litigation with regard to the possible claims of prior holders of the security in question, Clearly, this problem -assuming it is a valid problem - must be resolved before a wholehearted attack on securities fraud can CO!llT1ence, * Insurance will take care of theft and fraud losses. * Fear that if an institution's inventory of securities is checked against a list of lost, stolen, and missiug certificates, a substantial number of these would be found on the premises, having been unwit'tingly or carelessly accepted during the course of various fraudulent transactions. One respected authol'ity has stated that hundreds of mi 11 ions of dollars worth of such securities are probably in the vaults of the nation's fi~ancial institutions. This raises a question whose answer is still relatively murky: Who is going to get stuck? The current holders of these securities? The insurers of those holders? Or those who owned the securities prior to their loss or theft (and to whom replacement certificates were probably issued)? For a variety of reasons, therefore, one of the most effective counter\u00ad measures for nipping securities fraud in the bud (and re~ving the reason fOI\" the related thefts) -that is, the cross-examination of \"paper\" -is often honored more in the breach than in its observance. Businessmen should mail1tain an attitude of constructive skepticism with regard to transactions involving offshore firms. The same also applies to , little-known domestic compani~E whose financial statements indicate signi\u00ad ficant assets in the form of securities of equally little~known firms. Credit reports which merely parrot the representations of those reported on should not be regarded as proof of anything. Financial institutions and brokerage houses should establish clear lines of acco~\u00b7tability for adherence to well-thought out procedures regarding the handling and storage of securities. When a theft does occur, an \"accounta\u00ad bility audit trailll will exist. 151 Banks should not accept street-name securities as collateral, Brokerage houses should not stamp their street-name endorsement~ on securities to be held in inventory. Shareholders should not keep their securities at home but in a safe\u00ad deposit box or with a reputable, financially stable brokerage house. Re\u00ad gardless of where securities are kept, their owners should record the certi\u00ad ficates' numbers, denominations, and issuers, and file this list in a separate location. Sypport should be considered for legislation, already recommended by a Congress'ional committee, that would make it a federal offense for anyone with intent to defraud, to create, write, possess, use, or exhibit a finan\u00ad cial statement, brochure, credit reference, or business report reflecting. assts of $l-mi 11 i on or more, if such document contains i nforma ti on ar.j\u00b7 figures that are false or fraudulent. Other legislat' n that has been recommended pertains to authorizing the Securities and Exchange Commission, by court order, to seize and attach illegally obtained funds believed to be the product of securities fraud or manipulation, in order to prevent secretion and dissipation of these funds so they eventually may be returned to those who have been defrauded. Physical inventory counts should be compared with records of not only number of shares on hand but al~o the identification number on each certificate. The 1atter aspect could be conducted at least on a random sampling basis. Proposed transactions involving the sale of securities at bargain\u00ad base(TIent prices should be regarded as inherently fraudulent. Those security transacti ons i nvo 1 vi ng numbered S~1i ss bank accounts or secreti ve forei gn trusts must be regarded as suspect until proved otherwise. Be wary of \"getting in on\" an hitherto obscure stock whose price is suddenly increasing -particularly when most of each day's increase occurs near the close of trading. Since many securities are beaY'er instruments -and thus are as good as cash -some observers have recommended that al'l securities be of the regis\u00ad tered type, which are not as easily negotiated. To sum up, the application of healthy cynicism can dividend of all. 152 result in the biggest e APPENDIX l/SOURCES OF ASSISTANCE The following list is not all-inclusive but merely notes some of the likely sources that could be expected to assist victims of white-collar crime.

Int.roduction Gerald Bryant Paul Cirel A rape victim is usually brought into an emergency room of a large public hospital which is crowded, confused, understaffed and over\u00ad worked ... Police, doctors, nurses, and clerks all are trying to get information from her, but no one asks how she is feeling. She is treated as an accused, as if she did something wrong. She leaves the hospital alone to return home frightened, confused, dirty, and distraught. She was raped in private during the crime; she has now been raped in public.' The effects of rape on the victim are both physical and psychic. First, she faces physical peril: the immediate danger of being beaten, maimed, or even killed, and in the longer run, the possibility of contracting venereal disease or becoming pregnant. Second, she is subjected to psychological stress (Rape Trauma Syndrome); only recently has it been acknowledged that this condition requires special treatment. Compounding the victim's feel ings of gUil t, anxiety, and fear are prevail ing community attitudes towards the victim of rape: the role of victim is viewed with ambivalence (\"She got what she asked for\"). Even her family and friends may suffer some trauma. A final psychic stress is caused by the often oppressive legal aspectsof the definition of rape -proof of force, penetration, and lack of consent. All these factors contribute to the victim's personal feelings of humiliation and ostracism. The Uniform Crime Reports made available by the Federal Bureau of Inves\u00ad tigation indicate that over 56,000 forcible rapes were reported to the police in 1975 -one every nine minutes. Victimization surveys indicate that the number of actual incidents may be twice as high as the number 156 reported to the po1ice.2 In the same year, the FBI estimates that 26,670 arrests for rape occurred, or roughly one for every two reported cases. Convictions, however, were much less frequent. \"Guilty as charged\" was the verdict for B.B percent of the offenses; another 2.5 percent resulted 'in conviction on lesser offenses.3 No one really knows what happens on a national level after that. In one state that maintains offender-based transaction statistics, only 31.5 percent of the convicted rapists were sentenced to prison.4 Clearly, the odds favor the rape offender. In the overwhelming majority of cases, the rapist is not likely to spend even a day in prison for his crime. Yet until very recently the crime of rape and its consequences for the victim received little attention. For instance, the medical community was not particularly prepared to meet the rape victim's needs. The public hospitals to which she might go for treatment tended to be overcrowded, underfinanced, and bureaucratized. Private hospitals often lacked emer\u00ad gency or special facilities and charged the rape victim up to $75 for 1heexamination. Hospitals in general did not employ Standard Operating Procedures for treating victims. Thus only haphazard consideration was given to the collection and preservation of the medical evidence necessary for prosecution, and rarely was any consideration given to the mental well-being of the victim. The former problem was aggravated by the lack of coordination between police investigators and medical examiners. Evi\u00ad dence was literally washed away, as clothes and bodies were cleaned rather than examined for semen, pubic hair, or blood. The rape victim's experiences with the criminal justice system were also often unpl easant. If she reported the crime, she ,ni ght encounter pol ice skepticism and insensitivity and might have to repeatedly describe the details of the attack to a series of officers and detectives. Further\u00ad more, rape received low priority in police investigation assignments. More often than not, the detectives were not from bureaus that investi\u00ad gated assaults and homicide (which usually are staffed with more experienced personnel) but rather from juvenile, vice, and/or prostitu- 157 tion bureaus. Many of these detectives were accustomed to investigating crimes in which both parties willingly participated. If she wished to takethe matter to court, she found that the prosecutors, working independently of police and hospitals. put her through the ordeal of repeating the story yet again. If the proseGutor's office was typical; there was no continuity of assignment, and therefore the victim was forced to relive and retell the incident at every change of assignment and at the various stages of prosecution (probable cause/arraignment, grand jury, and trial). Again due to the low pri~rity assigned to rape cases, those that managed to get to trial often suffered from limited prosecutorial attention. Proving that the rape occurred \\~as only the first step. Several legal and circumstantial issues played a large role in prevent~ng the suspect from being found guilty of rape even when the forcible sex act had been proven. Juries questioned any case where the victim voluntarily placed herself in a situation where a rape could occur, particularly when the victim got into a car with the offender, or let the offender into her apartment. Corroborating testimony was sometimes required, and evidence concerning the vict'im's lifestyle and prior sexual conduct was usually relevant and material. Finally, the myths and peculiar rules of evidence that marked the trial were often buttressed by such jury charges as the one recently struck dmm ill an Iowa Supreme Court case, liThe charge of rape against a person is easy to make, difficult to prove, and more diffi\u00ad cult to disprove.IIS During the past few years, however, rape has become more and more the focus of national attention. Rape crisis centers have sprung up around the country with the intent of treating victims, educating the public and/ or aiding in the effort to apprehend and prosecute rapists. Since late 1974. the Polk County Rape/Sexual Assault Care Center (R/SACC) has provided th~ greater Des Moines area with all of these services. LEAA's National Institute of law Enforcement and Criminal Justice has designated the Polk 158 I County R/SAAC an Exempl,dry Project in recogniti on of its efforts to bring about law reform j to improve medical treatment and to institution\u00ad alize medical, police and prosecutorial prccedures designed to increase the quality and quantity of victim services and the likelihood of success\u00ad ful prosecution. This manual is intended to aid the staff and planners of the many rape crisis centers now or 500n to be in existence across the nation, in developing techniques and procedures that addl'ess the problems discussed in this introduction. In addition to this document, which focuses on the procedures employed by the Polk County R/SACC, a related LEAA publi\u00ad cation o:;~ould be consu'ited for information on particular techniques em\u00ad ployed in police departments, hospitals, prosecutor's offices and commun\u00ad ities in several other states: * Ra~e and Its Victims: A Report for Citizens, Health Facilities, an Criminal JU!s11ccAgencies, A Prescriptive Package, Center-for Women's Policy St~dies (Available in single copies free of charge from the Nationai ~.~minal Justice Reference Service, Washington, D.C. 20024. Multiple copies are available from the Government Printin~ Office, I~ast ~/}';''l, D.C. 20024; order number 027-000- 0036-0.) 1.1 Project Overview The Polk County Rape/Sexual Assault Care Center is a single program de\u00ad signed to deal with the multiple problems of rape and sexual assault. Providing victims with counseling support, reforming state statutes, coor\u00ad dinating with the prosecution, training and assisting police and medical personnel, and educating the public are the Center's prime objectives. Although funded primarily by the Central Iowa Al'ea Crime Commission through the County Board of Supervisors, the Center is a truly commun'ity-oriented facility, working with and being supported by hospitals, schools, and vol\u00ad unteers as wr-ll as law enforcement agencies. Ihe Center is organized for maximum community participation. There are currently 75 agencies and organizations represented on the Center's Board of Directors. As a result, officials of almost every public agency in the 159 community are Center volunteers. Consider what this community support means to a victim. She is shocke.d, hurt, stunned. But anextensive public relations campaign -local television, radio, newspaper, even a special \"rape awareness\" program in the public school system -has made her aware of the Center. The telephone number has been widely advertised; the operator also has it. A public education program has helped make her aware of the importance of doing something. She calls the Center. Twenty-four-hour phone and contact service ensures that help is on its way to her within minutes. The contact worker meets the victim at the hospital, where another special education program and the worker's expertise have helped to make sure that the victim receives appropriate car~ and that physical evidence is proper\u00ad ly handled. Through R/SACC's Boarr. of Directors, the contact worker is in touch with a full range of community service agencies; she arranges for additional counseling if needed. From initial contact to hospital to coun\u00ad seling, the worker 'is always available. always there when needed, a pro\u00ad tective buffer ag~inst furthe'/ shocks. And throughout, while avoiding a \"hard sell,\" she urges the victim to report the assault to the pol ice. Once the victim has agreed to report the as~ault, the most intensive part of the contact worker'stask begins. She prepares the victim and helps her deal with the stress of each next step. Her familiarity with the victim is extremely helpful in painlessly extracting pertinent information, thereby aiding law enforcement personnel, who themselves will have re\u00ad ceive'd special training for dealing with rape victims. When the case is transferred to the County Attorney's Office, the contact worker accompanies the victim to the prosecutor. A single (in Polk County's case, female) prosecutor is assigned to ~ rape cases. The combination of the special prosecutor and the contact worker creates an expecially good working relationship with the victim which has resulted in a significant increase in the quality of rape prosecutions. 160 I Hllen the case finrdly comes to trial, the victim (accompanied to court by the contact wor!,er) faces an educated jury. The Center's public educa- tion progrulll has worked to teach the community that rape is not the victim's fault, that victims do not \"ask\" for it, and that rape is crime, not fantasy. The route outlined above is not the only one possible. If a victim goes directly to a hospital, the Center is immediately notified. If the r~port is made to the police, again the Center is notified. In either case, the contact worker goes directly to the hospital to be with the victim. In all cases the final result is the same: victims receive improved medical care and counseling, and law enforcement agencies have available better evidence, better and more reliable witnesses, and improved prosecution. 1.2 Summary of Results Since the Center was created, police clearance rates for rape cases have risen from 50 percent to 69 percent. Even more significant changes have been seen in the Special Prosecutor's Office,where victims show an in\u00ad creasing willingness to press charges. Before the program began, charges were filed in only a third of cases where the offender was identified; th,\"t figure has now jumped to three-fourths of those cases. An equally dra\u00ad matic rise in conviction rates has occurred: while only 40 percent of the cases tried in the pre-project period resulted in conviction, the figure rose to 65 percent in the project's first year and is now up to 82 percent. Contributing significantly to the improved record of convictions are le\u00ad gislative changes in the 1974 Iowa Criminal Code that disallow any irre\u00ad levant testimony involving the victim's past sexual history and eliminate the requirement for corroboration beyond the physical evidence and the victim's testimony. These reforms were stimulated by the individuals who went on to create the Rape/Sexual Assault Care Center as a necessary step in gaining the victim cooperation so essential to successful prosecution of rape cases. 161 Finally, but most important, there is no doubt that the R/SACC has suc\u00ad ceeded in both coordinating service activity and decreasing victim trauma. The quantity and quality of the Center's services are limited only by the quantity and quality of those available in the entire community. In short, they are the best available. 2. Project Development and Organization Rape makes no distinction along political boundaries, and the cooperation of all government units wiil enhaoce the effectiveness of the services which the Center can deliver.6 From its inception the Polk County R/SACC has enjoyed the active support of the greater Des Moines community. This support has been carefully sought and actively maintained. Founders and supporters were committed to the notion of creating a community-wide service agency that would not only be accessible to all victims but that would be able to attract victims. A non-partisan, broad, community-based effort was undertaken to accomplish that goal. Section 2.1 presents a chronology of the events that led to the formation of the Polk County RISACC. 14hile particular individuals are cited for their foresignt and diligence, the section's main purpose is to demonstrate one successful method for the formation of a rape crisis center. It details how one community utilized a resource available to every community -active, concerned citizens -to respond to needs equally present in every community. 2.1 History In 1973-1974 the Iowa Women's Political Caucus emerged as a respected, influential organization. Allied with established political interests, to a large 'degree it helped legitimize the feminist movement in Iowa. Politically active and concerned women who considered themselves feminists were not viewed as a fringe group but rather as an integral part of the political process. This identification was clearly helpful in establishing a climate receptive to the development of a rape crisis center. 162 In November, 1973, the Metropolitan Criminal Justice Center (MCJC), an LEAA-funded Pilot Cities project located at Drake University in Des Moines, was engaged in a crime assessment program with the city of Des Moines. Among the target crimes of the study was rape. It became obvious to MCJC staffers that the greater Des Moines community WaS not equipped to handle the problem adequately from either a law enforcement or social ser\u00ad vice viewpoint. This fact was brought to the attention of Betty Durden and Anne Schodde, the director and coordinator of the Drake University Women's Center. Ms. Durden was also a member of the Iowa Commission on the Status of Women and both women \\~ere known and respected members of the Des ,Hoines community. They agreed that some immediate community response was necessary. They were also aware that there was currently a movement in the legislature, spearheaded by Assistilnt Iowa Attorney Gener\u00ad al Roxanne Conlin (also chairperson of the Iowa Women's Political Caucus), to amend the state's rape statutes. It was decided that efforts in both areas should be coordinated. With the hope of obtaining broad community involvement, this group of women approached Des Moines Mayor Richard Olson in December, 1973. Mayor Olson was receptive. The meeting resulted in tentative plans fOI' holding a Mayor's Conference on Rape in the spring. An advisory board was formed, and with Anne Schodde as the chairperson, the membership planned to organize a conference that would make immediately implementable recommendations so that Des Moines could swiftly address the problems of rape. The advisory board decided to appeal to the entire community. Recommen\u00ad dations with a broad, appl'oval clearly stood a much greater chance of being implemented. The conference planners, therefore, proceeded to amass a group of cooperating sponsors in hopes of publicizing the conference and mobil izing support for conference recommendations. Thei r success is i 1- lustrated by the following list of sponsors and cooperating sponsors: 163 SPONSORS: M.C.J.C. Drake University. Univers1ty L~llege, Women's Programs Mayor's Office, The Honorable Richard Olson COOPERATING SPONSORS: Polk County's Women's Political Caucus Homen's Law Caucus -Drake Law School American Association of University Women, Des Moines Y.W.C.A.

Thus, the two-day conference was organized in the following manner: Day One -Problem Identification Presentations would be made by expert speakers (from within and without Iowa) concerning national trends, Iowa problems, rape victims' reactions and victim t!\"eatment. 164 Day Two - Problem Solving: Defining Areas of Needed Change On day two the conference delegates were to divide into workshops, a format which would facilitate an action approach. Each workshop was to have a speci fi c type of COnC(lrn, and was to include experts in that fi e 1 d, a ch;drperson, a recorder, and a \"catalyst.\" Three workshops were planned: * The Iowa Law -Criminal Code revision, assistance to the victim, court procedures, cooperation between police and the courts. * The Rape Victim -reporting procedures, police investi'jation procedures, cooperation between hospital personnel and private agenC\"ies aiding the victim, and an affective alternative for victim assistance. * Community Education -assaults on women, me3sures needed to i'educe hazardous conditions in the city, educational efforts in the public schools, community organizations, self-defense. At the close of day two, each workshop was to present its recommendations to the Mayor and his advisory board for implementation. The r Jtlference was pl anned for l~ay 6 and 7, 1974. On r\u00b7lay 2, the legi sl a\u00ad ture provided the participants with an added impetus for pr~gram develop\u00ad ment. By a vote of 44-0 the S~nate repealed the laws allowing wide ques\u00ad tioning of rape victims concerning their past sexual conduct and requiring corroboration of a rape victim's testimony. The iss,ue of past sexual conduct was of particular concern; as long as it Vci~; relevant and material testimony, the defense attorney would attempt CO paint the victim as a temptress or a woman of loose moral fiber. Even if the procedure was not always effective with the jury, it was quite traumatic to the victim. One of the fears of reporting is, of course, that such practices put the victim on trial.7 Thus, the new Iowa Code 782.4, Evidence of Past Sexual Conduct in Trials of f:npe, opened the door for more victims to pursue their assailants to court: 165 Evidence of Past Sexual Conduct in Trials of Rape. In prosecuti ons for the crime of rape, evi do: ~,~ of the prosecuting witness' previous sexual conduct shall not be admitted, nor reference made thereto in the presence of the jury, except as provided herein. Evidence of the prosecuting witness' previous sexual conduct shall be admissible if the defendant shall make application to the court before or during the trial. The court shall conduct a hearing in camera as to the relevancy of such evidence of previous sexual conduct, aod shall limit the questioning and control the ad\u00ad mission and exclusion of evidence upon trial. In no event shall such evidence of previous sexual conduct of the prosecuting witness committed more than one year prior to the date of the alleged crime be admissible upon the trial, except previous sexual conduct with the defendant. Nothing in this section shall limit the right of either the state or the accused to impeach credibility by the showing of prior felony conviction. The issue of corroboration w~s particularly bothersome to prosecutors. The former law had provider, that more evidence than the victim's testimony was necessary to link the defendant to the crime: Corroboration in Rape, Seduction and Other Crimes. The\u00b7defendant in a prosecution for rape, or assault with intent to commit rape, or enticing or taking away an un\u00ad married female of previously chaste character for the purpose of prostitution, or aiding or assisting therein, or seducing and debauching any unmarried woman of pre\u00ad viously chaste character, cannot be convicted upon the testimony of the person injured, unless she be corro\u00ad borated by other evidence tending to connect the defendant with the commission of the offensd. No other charge required such corroboration. Clearly, this law tended to prevent rape cases from reaching the highest prosecutorial priority, and its repeal was welcomed. The conference was held as planned in the wake of these legislative suc\u00ad cesses. Over 400 delegates from vi rtually every servi ce-re 1 ated agency in the county were present as were the police chief and the county prose\u00ad cutor. The workshop format was particularly successful and resulted in 166 the formulation of a series of recommendations. These are presented here in their entirety for two reasons. First, they suggest the variety of services unavailable to rape victims prior to R/SACC's creation. Second, they indi cate the progress made in two years: vi rtua lly every acti on recommended has since been realized. WORKSHOP 110. 1 RAPE AND 1'HE LAW The cO<lll1Unity, Including local and county governmental units, should work to: 1. Change unifonn jury instruction to elimil1ate prejudicial fE-ferenees. 2. Provide public money to pay for the medical and rehabilitation ex\u00ad penses of the rape victim. 3. Urge a legislative review of the penal code and sentencing structure with regard to crimes of sexual abuse. 4. Upgrade law enforcement personnel and the County Attorney's staff, including special t~ainlng for persons handling the specific problems of rape and se).ual ubu3e. 5. Reconmend to the board of the Lall Enforcement AcadeJ1\\Y that its structure be changed to include representatives from other disciplines (such as psychology, sociology, etc.), women, and members of minority groups. 6. Recommend to the Iowa Crime Commission that its structure be changed to include representatives from other disciplines, women, and members of minority groups. WORKSHOP NQ. 2 EFFECTIVE TREATMENT FOR THE RAPE VICTIM The comJunity police and medical procedures for assistance to the rape victim should inclUde the following: 1. Immediate medical treatment for the victim before any investigative procedures are initiated by authorities. 2. On. deSignated place for medical care of the victim where confiden\u00ad tl.1iling Is guaranteed and the victim has the freedom to decide whether or not t!) report to authorities; a cooperative effort to develop and provide effective and sensitive treatment to rape victims at all hospitals; inmediate legal assistance, medical care, and coun\u00ad seling available to the rape victim. 3. Initial contact with authorities who are specifically trained in dealing with sex crimes; a special squad. including women members, with specific training In handling sex crimes. 4. A police .questionnaire whid has Deen shortened to eliminate any irrelevant and unnecessary questions I and '.I rept5rting procedure reqUiring onl:l one interview so the vlctl,n Is not subject to repeated questioning. 5. A TRAINED COUNSELOR AVAILABLE FOR HELP AT ANY TIME AT A CENTRAL PHONE IIUMBER. THIS MIGHT BE OONE THROUGH AN ESTABLISHED RAPE CRISIS CENTER OR THROUGH AN EXISTING COMMUNITY AGENCY WHICH WOULD PROVIDE COUNSELORS AIID SERVE AS A CLEARINGHOUSE FOR COI!PLAINTS OF VICTIMS. 6. Individual and/or group support counseling available to the victim and her family after the initial contact. 167 The City of Des Moines should support a cOMprehensive \"funded\" plan that \\!,.'Ould include measures for edu.cation , prevention. self-defense education I and revision of the laws concerning rape. The County Attorney's Office should hire women prosecutors to serve on its staff. The Mayor should set up a women's task force on rape to coordinate and implement a comprehensive conmunity program aimed at all aspects of the problem. WDRKSHDP ND. 3 COfot1lJNITY EDUCATION AND PREVENTION PROGRAMS The conrnunity should develop education programs which: 1. erevide training in self-defense. including attitudinal, physical,. and legal aspects, for both boys and girls in school physical edu\u00ad cation classes. 2. Provide school classes in health. sex education, and possibly human relations taught by carefully selected and trained teachers. Make fam11y life education classes co-educational at all levels. 3. Publicize available cOfl1l1unity I'esources for crime preventiort and education such as \"Crime i c' s 4. Set up a future conference dealing with the psychological implications for the rape victim and the m?ist. 5. Provide more adult education programs on the subject of as saul t and rape and establish a conrnunity advisory board to disseminate in\u00ad formation to pa.r~~ts and teachers. 6. Support federal legislation, Title 111 of public Law 94-63. which Would create a National Rape Crisis Center. Of particular importance is Recol1l1lendation #5 of ~Jorkshop 2, the establish\u00ad ment of a rape crisis center. This recommendation led to the establishment of Polk County R/SACC. Other proposals had included establishing either a special prosecutor's office or a special police investigation force with victim care components. Both of these ideas were rejected, however, due to the concern that project identification with a law enforcement agency might dissuade victims from coming forward. Ultimately, the Board decided the best approach would be 'to attend to the emotional needs of the victim. If an agency or program first dealt with the victim's trauma and helped her re-establish her self-confidence, confidence in the criminal justice system would then be more easily engendered. Treat the victim and then prosecute the r.1Ipist. 168 To the credit of criminal justice agencies in the Des Moines area, this approach was accepted. County Prosecutor Ray Fenton who had initially intended to seek funds for a special sex crimes prose~_tor, cooperated with the advisory board by allowing funds to be sought for a separate crisis center through those funds earmarked for prosecution by the Iowa Crime Commission. He further promised to provide the in-kind services of one full-time prosecutor to coordinate with the center and to assume the re\u00ad sponsibility for prosecuting all assaults. Funds being avai1b1e, the ad\u00ad visory board was then faced with the task of organizing a rape crisis center. The lesson of the previous six months was not lost on the advisory board: the entire community must be involved to elicit maximum support and achieve the best results. Rather than affiliate itself with any single existing agency, the advisory board chose to form a non-profit corporation with a Board of Directors composed of representatives from all major social ser\u00ad vice agencies in Des Moines. That B0ard would be responsible for setting up, staffing, and promoting a Rape/Sexual Assault Care Center. The R/SACC was incorporated on August 8, 1974. In conjunction with the Iowa Crime Commission. the funding agency, the incorporators established the R/SACC by-laws. These by-laws state: The purpose of this organization shall be: a. to provide immediate and continuing counseling for the victims of rape and sexual assault and referral to appropriate medical. legal, and psychological services, upon the request of the vic\u00ad tim; b. to cooperate in every way possible with law enforcement agencies, including the Polk County Sheriff's office, the police depart\u00ad ments of the cities and towns within Polk County. and the Polk County Attorney's office, to bring about a greater arrest and conviction rate for the crimes of rape and sexual assault; c. to educate the public and law enforcement personnel about the crimes of rape and sexual assault and-their effect on victims; 169 d. to educate people to protect themselves effectively against attack. The by -laws also established the make-up and mandate of the Board. As can be readily seen in the following excerpts, total community involvement is the goal: Article III: Board of Directors Section 1. The Board of Directors shall consist of: a. one elected or appointed representative from every interested organization in Polk County; b. one representative of each police department in Polk County; one representative from the Polk Countj Sheriff's office; one representative appointed .py the Pol k County Board of Supervi sors; c. two representatives appointed by the mayor of the City of Des Moines, and one representative appointed by each of the mayors of the other cities and towns in Polk County; d. two representatives appointed by the Des Moines Scho01 District and one representative appointed by each of the other school districts whose geographical jurisdiction lies within or partially within Polk County; e. five members selected at large by the Board of Directors at its first offlcial meeting, and at each annual meeting thereafter; f. any organization in Polk County which may desire represent'l.tion on the Board of Directors, and has not applied for such represen\u00ad tation! before September 5, 1974, shall submit its application for membership in writing to the Board of Directors .. Section 3. The Board of Directors shall have all necessary and rea\u00ad sonable powers to carry out the purposes of the corporation as set out ab.ove. 2.3 Administration The intent of the Center to involve and gain the support of as many organi\u00ad zation and inst~tut;ons as possible has been successfully accomplished, for the gover'ning board is composed of 75 representatives from 26 Polk County organizations. The Center's executive functions are conducted by the Board's 170 executive corrmittee which meets on a monthly basis with the program (the full Board meets four times a year). The rest of the Board members are assigned to cG\"littees usually according to tht:ir particular expertise. The functions of each corrmittee are outlined belc~i: * By-laws -study and recorrmend any changes needed to help obtain the objectives of R/SACC * Finance and BUdae} -establish budget needs; recorrmen 'uture funding sources * Nominating -recommend slate of candidates for officers for the following year * Office Facilities -e:tablish needs and reco~~end ways to improve appearanc,i of office; help office staff in any appropriate way as need$ adse * Personnel -advertise, interview, and recommend hiring of personnel; develop Job descriptions and review perfonnance; research need for any ,ncrease in staff * Inter-Governmental Relations -provide corrmunicrtion between R/SACC and the governmental units that the corrmittee members represent regarding concerns, needs and information * Corrmunity Educat'lon -develop materials for R/SACC or vlsual material and recorrmend it if applicable for use by Center; help develop resource library. initiate publicity via mass media * Supportive Services -develop Speaker's Bureau; initiate contacts for speaker's Bureau and schedule speakers; coordinate orientation of Board members and Speaker's Bureau; coordinate workshops sponsored by the Center; develop resource persons for student infonnation re\u00adquests * Victim SeY'vices -develop guidelines for coordinator regarding: m scope of Center's role in dea'iing wtth clients. (b) det,ennining referrals to other agencies; provide resources for coordinator and/or deSignated counselors in improving interviewing and counseling skills; work with the coordinator to develop guidelines for use of othel\" coun- selors, part-time staff, and/or volunteers . * Lorg-Ranae Planning -determine services to be provided and area to tie serve; detennine the Center's relationship to other institutions and agencies; explore sources of future funding. 171 The importance of the Board of Directors' broad cOl1l11unity base cannot be overstated. Representing a wide spectrum of organizations, the Board has \"legitimized\" Polk County's rape crisis ce(lter in the eyes of the legal, medical, and social institutions of the city. Moreover, the Board's commit,\" tee functions have provided R/SACC with a,n extraordinarily expert and in\u00ad fluential cadre of volunteers. The co~nittee functions are further support\u00ad ed by members of a Speaker's Bureau composed of Board members of individuals recruited by the Board because of some particular expertise. Here are a few examples of the committee/member pairing, which will provide insight into just how helpful this volunteer staff call be: * Dudget and Finance Committees/representatives of Polk County Board of Supervisors * Inter-Governmental Rel ati ons/representatives of County D.A., ten pol ice departments, blo mayor's offices and the County Sheriff * COl1Jl1unity Education/Des District nes Mayor's office and an at\u00b7,l arge member who is also an Assistant Attorney General. 2.4. Staff The Center has three full-time staff positions - a program coordinator, a victim contact worker, and a secretary. In addition, a fllll-time prosecutor is linked to the Center and is responsible for prosecuting all Center cases. The program coordinator, Corinne Whitlatch, shares victim contact work (on a 24 hour alert basis) with the victim contact worker, and is responsible for coordinating activities with the special prosecutor and the Board and its cOl1lllittees. The victim contact worker, Carole Meade, in addition to her contact and counseling activities, has been active with the Speaker's Bureau, and conducts in-service professional training. The special prosecutor, Karla Fultz, is rega ded as one of the top attorneys in the Prosecutor's Office. She is also chairperson of the Inter-Governmental Re,lations Committee and during R/SACC's planning stages, co-chaired the committee created to form 172 the Center. Karla and Corinne have held their positions since the Center began operations. Office space for R/SACC (three rent-free rooms) has been donated by the Iowa Lutheran Hospital, and has been in use since October, 1974. Much of the contact with victims, however, takes place in other locations. since the support provided by the victim contact worker is not limited to a clinical setting or to clinical topics (both potential sources of discomfort), vic\u00ad tims are more willing and able to provide information. In fact, victim support often takes place over coffee at the victim's house or business. This personal, informal approach usually begins during the first encounter. 2.5 Funding The RISACC is currently completing its second year funding cycl~. During the first two years, program funds have come from the Iowa Crime Commission as LEAA State Block Grant Funds earmarked for prosecution. The following chart illustrates both the funding and project OI\"ganization. ~.~ Central Iowa Area Cl'ime Commission (State Planning Agency) 173 The Polk County Board of Supervisors, which is responsible for budgeting and administrative operations for the County has served as a clearing\u00ad house for the SPA funds to the R/SACC. Now that the two-year fJJndi ng cycle has come to a close, the County Board of Supervisors (as of June 30, 1976) has assumed fiscal responsibility for the R/SACC. The Board's Office of Administrative Operation is currently in the process of planning the future administrative organization of the Center. Currently, that office has committeed County funds for the next two years without administrative changes, and is considering the future development of a wider, community service agency of which R/SACC would be one component. In any event, the County is committed to the Center's goals and basic method of operation for the foreseeable future. 2.6 Replication Although R/SACC's goals are closely aligned with those of mcst other rape crisis centers, the actual goals of a center are commonly dictated as much by external as internal factors. Of crucial concern in defining project goals are the community's level of awareness and the existing laws and agency procedures, the financial resources available, and the project's political identification. Often, the more activist feminist groups want no contact wi th criminal justice agendes and 1 imit their activity to lobbying for law reform or providing victim services (i.e., crisis and follow-up counseling). Indeed because of their limited contacts, centers with a' militant orientation are apt to have an additional goal -to create a context in which women help themselves and each other. They may earn the reputation of being anti-male, anti-professional, and difficult for mOl'e conver.tiona1 groups to work with. On the other hand, the more establishment-oriented projects \".re not only willing to work more closely \u00b7with community agencies (and vice versaO; they also tend to have direct aCCess to these agencies by virtue of their political affiliations. Thus the political identification of the project is often the most crucial variable in determining project orientation. 174 RISACC is a creation of the Iowa feminist movement, which is largely composed of professional women with established political ties. Unlike many centers that are spin-offs of consciousness-raising women's organizations, the wide scope and non-parti san nature of 'R/SACC' s Board of Directors and the active involvement of its Committees have made the Center known and respected throughout the cOllJllunity. Such a structure could be replicated in a community with the size and stability of Des Hoines (201 ,000 in the 1970 Census). In i\\reas of more than 500,000 or with a more transient population, reliance on volunteer support may be more difficult. This is not to say that Des Mp'ines has some unique degree of homogeneity, but that there is a sense of \"home\u00ad townness\" and community stake that may bel imited by size and mobil ity. In addition to stimulating community respect and support, the active parti\u00ad cipation of R/SACC's Board of Qirectors also eliminates the need to subcontract service components. Such an organization is cleal'ly less costly and perhaps ultimately more effective in promoting community,respon\u00ad sibility for the treatment of rape victims and offenders. 175 ENDNOTES lLEAt\\ Prescriptive Package, Rape and Its Victims: A Report for Citizens, Health Facilities and Criminal Justice Agencies, p. 55. 2* LEAA, Criminal Victimization Surveys in 13 American Cities (1975). 3** Federal Bureau of Investigation, Crime in the United States, Uniform Crime Reports (1975). 4*** California Department of Justice, Bureau of Lriminal Stutistics, Adult Prosecution Program Report (1973). 5 Struck down in State v.

OF CRIME VOLUNTEER TRAINING MANUAL \"A helping hand to aid a neighbor\" 5b \\ \\ b Before discussing what is \"Aid to Victims of Crime\", it is helpful to have a handle on the concept of victimization. \"A victim of crime is a person who has been injured in person or property by another person, or throughihe instrumentality of another person\". The victim of crime is also a victim of the imbalance of the scales of justice. There are those of JS who think that the victim's maze should be changed. Mr. Paul Rothstein, in an article for the American Bar Associa\u00ad tion Journal, spoke very eloquently on this matter. Justification for such an act is variously stated. Some persons say the state owes this to victims having induced citizens to lay down their arms in reliance on state protection and then having failed to prevent crime. Others urge parity between the expensive concern soci ety 1 avi shes on offenders -constituti onal safeguards, f:'ee coun\u00ad sel, prison accommodations -and the concern shown their victilllS ... Probably the principal explanation for the burgeoning interest in this kind of act is simple humanitarianism - a recognition that we all share an interest in the well-being of our neighbors and an in\u00ad creasing willingness to distribute the cost of a catastrophe. PURPOSE OF AID TO VICTII~S OF CRIME It is our mission to make the criminal justice system more responsive to the citizenry by developing a program Cif assistance to crime victims by use of citizen-volunteers. Aid to Victims of Crime has been formed to provide EMERGE\"CY supportive services to victims and their families. The intent is to help the victim regain control of his/her life. The specific goals and objectives of AVC will be discuss&d later in this manual. We provide a structure for citizens to initiate action concerning victimization. Through your voluntary actions, we can give aid to a person devastated by crime, help stabilize and unite our neighborhoods, and make the city of Dallas a safer, more responsive city in which to live. 178 PURPOSE OF TRAINING The most outstanding reason for training volunteers is to promote quality services to people who h.ave been devastated by violent crimes. Durin~ our training sessions, special emphasis will be placed on commun\u00ad ication skills, feelings ond the emotional impact of being victimized, information gathering, information handling, community resources, and agency guidelines. One basic pOint to remember while you are undergoing training is that most victims are in a state of crisis as a result of the victimization. Being robbed, raped, or assaulted puts a person under severe stress physically and emotionally. The family of a murder victim will also feel the same stress reactions. Most victims will express feelings of shock and disbelief followed by fear, anger, and anxiety. By the time you are seeing the victim, he/she may have calmed down from the initial shock of being victimized, but he/she may still be quite tense and agitated. He/she may be eager to relate all the facts concerning the crisis or he/she may be suspicious and reluctant to share his/her feelings. Do not press that victim. Emphasize the confidentiality of your visit. Be patient. If you can express genuine concern fOI\" the victim he/she will usually reveal their feelings. Crying or sobbing is not an unusual reaction when a person is under severe stress. A crisis tends to make a person feel helpless, and the victim may need help or direction from you. You are there to guide and offer alter\u00ad natives. There are many decisions that must be made in order for the person to get back in control of his/her life; that is, whether to see a doctor, contact the employer, etc. The best help you can give a victim is to let the victim see the choices and alternatives open to him/her and to let the victim make his/her own decisions. Be encouraging and supportive. With your help, the person can regain control over his/her life and the crisis will pass. 179 HISTORY OF AID TO VICTIMS OF CRIME Aid to Victims of Crime is a joint venture between the Dallas Police Department's Community $r ,ices ,Division and ACTION, the federal agency for volunteer services. The need fer emergency supportive services for crime victims in Dallas was recognized and initiated into a program in July of 1976. Since crime is a problem of every individual, Aid to Victims of Crime is a citizen/volunteer program based on the idea of neighbors' helping neighbors. Aid to Victims of Crime is one of a few citizen/volunteer programs across the nation that provice supportive services for crime victims. We were fortunate to visit a model Aid to Victims of Crime program in St. Louis which services the city of St. Louis with 250 volunteers. We have these same goals for our city. 180 AID TO vICTIMS OF CRIME GOALS AND OBJECTIVES It is our mission to make the criminal justice system more responsive to the citizenry by developing a program of assistance to victims of crimes by use of citizen-volunteers which aids victims whi1e researching and identifying the most effective methods by which to deliver services to victims and leads tothe ultimate establishment of the optimum private or public; program to aid victims of crime. Goals 1. To aid vic.tims of crime by greater citizen-volunteer participation in the crim'lflal justice system. 2. To pronlo\"te tile awareness of victim centered programs in existing criminal justice and social services agencies. 3. To identify the most effective methods of delivering services to victims and to establish those methods in a permanent private or public agency. Objectives 1. To establish a corps of 35-50 trained citizen voluntEers to aid victims of crime in Dallas. a. The recru'itment, training, retraining, and deployment of volunteers; b. The use of volunteers to deliver direct services to victims of crime in the form of transportation services, child care services, home care services, contacting of employers, arrangement of funer\u00ad als, aid with insurance claims, emergency food and clothing, relocation of victims and family, I\"eferral to public and private agencies, and to provide such other services as may be warranted by the individual victim's needs. 2. To build a great public awareness of crime prevention techniq'.I.\u20acs in these particular areas of Dallas by means of counseling victims in preventive measures and referring victims to other agencies in the community which have crime prevention programs. 3. To conduct research in the availability of resOUrces for aiding victims and to identify the needs for which reSOUrces are unavilable Or de\u00ad ficient by mea!lS of: a. The collection of data regarding the needs of victims; b. The co~lection of data regarding services available to victims provided by 'i.!>e criminal justice al1d social services system. 181 4. To promote the establishment of resources to fill victim's needs by: a. Contact with criminal justice and social service systems; b. Advocating and generating resources to fill the needs of victims by programs to educate the public and seek support from existing public and private agencies. 5. To establish a stable interdependent relationship with the components of the criminal justice and social services systems through the sharing of data, resources, training, ideas, etc. 182 THE VOLUNTEER SELECTION Each volunteer while still classified as a \"potential\" volunteer goes through an intake interview. This is not only for the benefit of the AVC progra.m, but also for the benefit of the indiv\"idua1. After the interview, and bElfore the initial training session, the volunteer may aecide that this is a program in which he/she does not wish to become involved. CONTRACT A copy of the contract which BOTH the volunteer and the Ave represen\u00ad tative signs follows this discussion. It is placed within this manual so that all wlil deliberate upon it more at home. The contract is divided into three parts: (a) the volunteer individual pledge, (b) the AVC repre\u00ad sentative pledge, and (c) the joint pledge. The contract is a formal declaration of the expectations held within the Iwe program. Briefly it is two things - a statement of what the AVC program expects from each volunteer and what the volunteer can expect from the AVC staff. First, what is expected of the volunteer is both definite and reason\u00ad able. These expectations are as follows. 1. A minimum time commitment of five (5) hours per month. T!;is is only the MINIMUM expected. An hour of this time is to be allotted to the monthly RecUl'ring Activity Period (RAP). It is not unreasonable to anticipate that as you, the volunteer, become more confident in handling the various crises that you will encounter, the more enthu\u00ad siastic you will become, and hopefully, the more time you will set aside to helping your neighbor in coping \\~ith his tribulations. 2. Attendance at the monthly RAP session is ~IANDATORY! It is at these sessions that new procedures (if required~information, guest speakers, and feed-back will occur. The AVe program can be a succe$S only by being constantly sensitive to the needs of both the victims and the volunteers t~ho work with them. 3. Certain \"office\" procedures lOust be completed by the volunteer. These are kept dt a minimum in order to allow you to do what you volunteered to do -HELP. One procedure lihich has to be followed without fail is the returning of the case card (which you will receive-through the mail) after you have helped the victim. These cards MUST be returned to the Ave office within two (2~ weeks from the date of mailing to you. 183 4. In order to help the victim, you must become familiar with the agencies from which the victim may be referred, and also of the resources avail\u00ad able to the victims. The resources which are now known are given in the back of this manual. It will be helpful to AVC if you will keep yOloi' eyes and ears open to new resources. If you come across one, contact the Case Coordinator at once with the information. 5. WHENEVER you are unsure as how to handle a case, or need assistance ~.nling one, contact the AVC office staff illlnediately. It is to / be expected that these things will occur from time to time; try to'\" not let it throw you any. 6. Finally, but not the least in importance, is the maintenance of con\u00ad fidentiality. Plainly put it means, \"KEEP YOUR ~10UTH SHUT\" when talking with persons outside of AVC. You may talk about what you are dOing -that is natural and expected -but do not, repeat DO NOT, mention specific information, such as names, addresses, employ\u00ad ment, or anything else that might indicate the identity of a victim ~Iith whom you are now working or have worked. Second, the other side of this contract coin is what you can expect from AVC. 1. An open door policy is always in effect with all staff coordinators. If you have a problem, are confused, are uncertain as how to proceed next in a case, or if you are in need of some moral support, call one of the coordinators. The volunteer-staff relationship is a crucial factor to the ongoing of the AVe program. The maintenance of a good working relationship is the responsibility of the volunteer, as well as the staff. The staff is not psychic; they cannot second guess your needs Rnd/or problems. You must tell us. 2. The AVC will provide an initial training session. This session is MANDATORY!! Each volunteer must attend and complete a training session before being allowed to handle cases. The sessions are designed to equip the volunteer with the arsenal of information from which he/she will draw. 3. The!l'e will also be monthly ongoing support training, known as RAP session (covored earlier in this discussion). In order to provide \\~hat i nformati on the volunteer will need to perform hi s/het' duti es the staff is constantly in search of such facts. A part of the RAP session will be volunteer-feed-back. That is, having the volunteer tell AVC what they need; and, the AVC-feed-back portion where AVC staff personnel gives the answers they have found out about questions raised at the last RAP session, plus giving additional information which they feel the volunteer will need. 4. AVC staff personnel, namely the Training Coordinator, keeps all re\u00ad cords on the volunteers, namely their applications and number of hours worked each month (so that we don't overwork any volunteer). 184 This information is kept in strict confidence among the three staff coordinators ONLY. No one else will see the volunteer applications, or the case cards. Please read and then sign the copy of the Contract which follows next. This is your copy for your own private meditation thereupon. One final word before proceeding to the next section, remember that each one of the coordinators cares about you and the work that you are doing. If you ever need one or all of their help, either as a working volunteer or as a friend, just call or drop by the office. 185 I AID TO VICTIMS OF CRIME CONTRACT I, th~ volunteer, hereby a~ree that I shall fill a minimum of five (5) hours ~(.r month, follow office procedures, and that I shall attend each monthly in-service training. Since the work that I shall be doing is of gre:at value and the agency is depending on me, my absences wi 11 be 1 imited to illness, fami1y emergency, and/or absence from the city, and that I will notify the AVC office as far in advance as possible. I, the representative for Aid To Victims Of Crime, hereby agree that I will provide the necessary initial traming, support monthly training, and that I shall always have an open door for one-to-one contact with you, the volunteer. We both hereby agree that all information cbollt the victims, and the volunteers shall be held in strict confidence. We both pledge to do as much for the victims of crime as we can in their time of crisis, and that in order to do so 11e shall keep seeking additional information with which to help them help themselves. l~e acknowl edge that there wi 11 be times of frustrati on, anger, joy, and confusion as we express our humanity to our fellow sharers of this life. We acknowledge that at times our efforts will seem in vain but we also acknowledge that this is a transit feeling and that also we may never know if our efforts have failed or succeeded. Finally, but definitely not last place, we -the volunteer and the representative -pledge our loving care and concern for one another, the victims, and the AVC program. Volunteer Signature Volunteer Signature Date of Signing 186 COf4MUNI CATIONS All the services we offer are based on communication. This includes the victim communicating to you his or her problem, your understanding of the problem, and the both of you deciding what 'action is needed. We feel the best way to communicate is to know when to talk and to listen -when to give information and when to ask questions. Some points to remember are: 1. Empathy: The ability to understand the feeling of the victim, or how you would react in the same situation. ,We b~lieve that you should place yourself in the victim's shoes in order to understand him or her. 2. Respect: A regard for their feelings by being courteous and consider~ ate. Avoid intl\"uding in areas of privacy. Don't pressure. If re\u00ad spect is not shown, then all of your other activities ~lill be wasted. 3. Genuineness: Being sincere and real inward as well as outward; not being a \"do-gooder.\" It is simply dealing with the person in an honest fashion. 4. Concreteness: We should all try to be specific with others to de\u00ad termine their exact needs. Questions should pertain to the problems of the victim and services needed. 5. Exploration: Exploring areas of concern in a fashion that is not offensive to the person. 187 WAYS TO GIVE SERVICE We believe there are basically three ways that you as a volunteer can give services to people who have bep,n'victimized. 1. Broker: A broker ~s a volunteer who can help the victim define his or her problem and work with him or her to find the appropriate resources or alternative. For example: Mrs. Brown's purse was snatched. Her food s.tamps were taken, and although she was bruised, she refused medical attention. When the vol\u00ad unteer saw her, Mrs. 8rVNn complained of pains in her back and shoulder. The volunteer pointed out the need to see a doctor as soon as possible, and encouraged Mrs. Brown to make an apPointment with her doctor or go to the local cl inic for a check-up. ~lrs. Brown agreed and the vol unteer offered to assist ~Irs. Brown with transportation when she mentioned the difficulty of getting to her doctor by herself. Mrs. Brown ViaS also worried that she and her children would not have enough food to last out the week. The volunteer checked wi th the food stamp off; ce and found out Mrs. Brown would have to wait five days before she could buy her next stamps. The volunteer checked the food resources section of the manual, called a few resources and was able to obtain emergency food assistance for the family. 2. Advocate: An advocate is a volunteer who will promote the cause of the: victim to acquire services even though the volunteer may have to con\u00ad front people, agencies, or institutions. For example: Mr. Miller was robbed of $50 in cash. He had just cashed his paycheck, and was planning to use the money to pay his rent and util\u00ad ity bi.lls. When the volunteer saw him, Mr. Miller was still upset about being robbed. He was afraid to tell his landlord he could not pay the rent, and he was sure his gas and electricity would be turned off as he was several months behind on his bills due to illness. With Hr. Miller's permission, the volunteer contacted the landlord and explained the situa\u00ad tion. The landlord agreed to an extension on the rent. The volunteer then contacted the credit department of both the gas and elect~ic com\u00ad panies and managed to get an extension on the payments. 188 3. Counselor: A counselor is a volunteer who will aid the victim by helping him or her adjust to a new situation or problem. Example: Mrs, Carter was raped. She has had nightmares and was now afraid to leave her home. The volunteer noticed how nervous Mrs. Carter was and offered her support and encouragement. Together, they reviewed all of the safety precauti ons Mrs. Carter coul d take when she had to 1 eave hel' home. Mrs. Carter began to relax a little and related to the volunteer her feelings about being raped. They talked for an hour, and at the end of the visit, ~1rs. Carter felt well enough to plan a shopping trip with her daughter for the next day. PREPARATIONS Most people, organizations, businesses, etc, are successful in their undertakings if they are prepared. This is true with you, the volunteer. You will be successful with the victim if you are prepared. The follo~ling are some general questions you should ask yourself when you meet the victim, followed by speclric questions to ask each type of victim: 1. What are the needs? 2. What are the available alternatives and resource~? 3. What can we (volunteer and victim) do to change the situation? 4. How can it be done best? 189 ASSAULT AND/OR ROBBERTY VICTIMS VOLUNTEER TAKE-ALONG SHEET /l,sk Victim: Telephone # Income 1. Were you hurt? Doctor been seen? Employer contacted? Would you like us to?

Every human being has a 'level below which they can SllC\u00ad cessfully deal with challenges. When events are too great for this ~hres\u00ad hold, a person experiences crisis. There are a variety of resources used to cope with crisis. The first being the familiar ones such as friend, keeping busy, previous helpful behavior. When this fails, a second stage of crisis occurs and people will turn to secondary resources which are less known persons who are seen as poten\u00ad tially helpful such as acquaintances, ministers, social agencies. If these fail, feel ings of helplessness, personal fa'ilure, and lO~iered self-esteem develop. The individual has reached another level and will turn to the terti ary resources. These are unfami 1 i ar i ndi vi dua 15 and institutio\"s. These are the end of the line type of resources such as the police, hospitals, emergency telephone services, etc. The more advanced the stage of crisis, the more dependent the individual is upon strange and unfamiliar sources of help. Guidelines: The resolution of any crisis is reached by a decision towards some action. A crisis will not be resolved without some decision, including the decision not to decide. Crisis is time limited. It can be short duration if the intervention is effective. Change and feelings will continue even when the immediate cri\u00ad sis is resolved, but when a decision is made, the first step has been taken towards a resolution. Crisis produces a whole range of feelings. How is a Crisis experienced: The most common and universal feeling is 1. Anxiety -This is an appropriate response which can mobilize a person for action; however, great anxiety produces confusion, poor judgement, questionable decisions and sel{',\u00b7defeating behavior. This is the time when the best service given is through concreteness, through information and through a helpful ability to listen. 193 2. Helplessness -is a common characteristic where leading a person through some action can be extremely helpful. 3. Shame -This is mainly due to feelings of incompetence and the need to depend on others. 4. Anger -This is often hidden behind other expressions of feelings and then may be directed at another pe\u00b7rson such as the volunteer or turned inward producing depression. 5. Ambivalence -caused by the need to retain control wh11e there is a loss of control. Reaching out for help while trying to manage by oneself produces a de\u00ad crease in self-esteem and leaves a victim extremely vulnerable. Since normal coping ability is challenged in crisis, the victim finds his or her world shaky and uncertain. In rape cases, fears which may have been hidden are now on the surface, i.e. nightmares, fear of going out, etc. All these fears bring on uncertainty, discomfort and the feelings listed before. There are several phases in he'iping a person in a crisis: 1. Calming the individual so that he/she regains some measure of control. 2. Exploring the problem and alternatives. 3. Making decisions after studying all the alternatives. You can be helpful by just being there to listen and empathize. You can let the victim know thatheror his feelings are often realistic due to the events that caused them. The best tool you have with a victim is your own sense of caring and desire to help. This will come across to the individuals in need. As he1pers it becomes important to realize that you too have feelings and they can be drained. Be open about these feelings with your fellow volunteers, share the experiences and the problems. You will find that this will help you to understand your reactions, to find new ways of dealing with the situations and to also realize that often there are no answers and you did everything you could. Most of the time you will find yourself helping and growing. 194 ----- - --- - -----r------------------------------------------------------------------- RAPE VICTIMS AND THE VOLUNTEER Rape is an act of violence committed against a woman. It incorporates elements rf forced sexual behavior, surprise, and invasion of a woman's innermost physical and psychic privacy. Because rape is a highly personal\u00ad ized crime, it is a very sensitive and emotional subject to talk about. As a volunteer, you may feel uneasy about visiting a rape victim. This is normal. To help you, we have prepared the following paper on the subject of rape. It cannot answer all your questions, but if you feel the need for fur\u00ad ther information or literature, our staff will be glad to provide it. Please feel free to ask. What can you, the volunteer, do to help a rape victim? First, when you visit a victim, make a clear statement of why you are there. Tell her immediately who you are, where you are from. This paves the 11ay for openness and understanding. By the time you reach a victim, she has already been seen by the police, hospital, and most probably some friend or relative. She may have encountered distrust and disbelief about her rape. She will naturally be extremely sensitive to who believes her. Don't come in search of a true story. The victim's account of her rape can be a tool to openness only if you, the volunteer express enough interest in the victim's feelings. Having told the story before, the victim is likely to give the \"police rendition,\" a story void of feel ing und full of detail. You can interrupt with questions like, \"weren't you scared?\" or \"How did you keep your head?\" Nake supportive comments while she is talking. It may be helpful to .reflect back to her the feelings she is getting across, or to summarize what she is saying to help clarify her feelings and thoughts. Get involved with the victim to the point of honestly offering your own \"gut\" fears and reactions. You may get a strong feeling that the woman is blaming herself for what happened, and if you are right. it is important to help her recog- 195 nize and cope with this feeling. HO~lever, you need to be careful not to plant the idea of guilt where it does not exist. Check out the victim's feelings. She may be tired of talking about the rape and need help in deciding what to do next. DO NOT press her to talk about it, but DO help her make decisions about housing, transporta\u00ad tion, and other immediate concerns. Rape is traumatic because the victim loses control over her body. Feelings of helplessness that result can be overcome by giving her the opportunity to regain control of herself, rather than by having someone else take care o'f her. If you begin to feel that you do not know what she wants, the best way to handle it is to let her know you are not sure what she wants you to do. If she still does not respond, you may need to ask her specific questions, such as does she have a prescription that needs fi 11 ing, does she need babysitting services, etc. Help the woman clarify her problems and focus on actions that need to be taken in regard to medical problems, police reporting, or other prob\u00ad lems that may have developed as a result of the rape. This focusing on problems will help the woman tQwer her anger level by regaining a sense of control over her life. Feelings of Fea~ Help the woman express and specify her fear. Encourage her to list all the things she could do to protect. herself, including things that are unacceptable to her, such as staying home all the time behind heavily locked doors. The range of ideas may be from triple~locking all doors and windows to not gQing out alone at night or during the day, not drinking alone, or not hitchhiking. Again, this is another opportunity to point out that there are a range of choices, each with its price. Awareness of choices gives a sense of control, which reduces the fear. 196 Counseling Do not rush a woman into menta-( health treatment, unless she is anxious to have it. It is not helpful to imply that being raped drives one crazy, but it is helpful to note that nightmares and interpersonal problems can be more easily dealt with in a counseling relationship, and she may want to share some of these feelings with an understanding person. At this pOint you might want to give her the phone number of the Dallas County Rape Crisis Center for' further counseling. Summary Before you start feel ing overwhelmed by all these do I s and don I ts try to remember that rape is a crisis like other crises. It forces persons to focus on themselves, their lifestyles, their fears and anxieties. Your counseling skills and common sense will help you help this woman. Do not hesitate to seek consultation with any of our staff or the Rape Crisis Center with rape victim cases. Rape is an emotionally charged situation, and you may find yourself over anxious with your own feelings about what has happened. Remernber, very little has been substantiated about how rape victims react. You may find this particular victim acting contrary to what you have just read. You are relating with a real person and real fears. You will gain a feeling of having helped if you have patience, perseverance, and sensitivity for the victim's feelings. 197 OFFICE PROCEDURES There are a minimum of forms which the volunteer must complete. Following are the volunteer office procedures for compliance with the requirement to file these forms. A. The Application Form. This is completed at the time of the initial interview. The Training. Coordinator will complete any additional fon~s needed relative to this area. A. Case Cards The top portion of this form will be completed by the AVC Case Coordinator, and mailed to the volunteer. The volunteer will complete the lower portion and return the form to the AVC office within two (2) weeks from date of referral. If additional contact with the victim is necessary please indicate this on the form. A Sample of these forms is included at the back of this manual Again, if you have any questions about procedures, contact the AVe staff. 198 PROCEDURES OF AID TO VICTHIS OF CRHlE The first step in our process is securing the names of the victims from the Dallas Police offense reports, which list all the major offenses for the previous 24 hours. Next we 1'1;11 screen it for appropri ate cases: rape, robbery, hami ci de, and as saul t. The second step involves you, the volunteer. Our Case/Victim Coor\u00ad dinator will call you and give you the name of a victim in your immediate neighborhood (you define your neighborhood) who might need services. If we are unable to contact you by telephone we will send the information by mail. On the following page is a picture of the information sheet that needs to be filled out by you and mailed back to our office. Next you visit the victim and make the determination of services that should be given, what services they are, and who should give them. After this visit and the initiation of action, you write the information down on our information sheet and mail it back to us. This is a very important step for us because we must have this information as quickly as possible. If you need help anywhere in this process, call us at 421-7483. Remember, all we are, are people lending a hand to people.

About 350,000 children are under the custody and supervision of juvenile correctional agencies. Tens of thousands of men and women are, on any given day, awaiting trial for crimes. In addition, hundreds of thou\u00ad sands of ex-offenders are trying desperately to get themselves back into the mainstream of the American economy. Four out of six of those will be back in prison. They will tell the heart-rending story of a lonely year which began with high hopes. They will t'elate how the few dollars with which they left prison quickly evaporated in the same inflation that is affecting all of us, how the new suit of clothes they were given soon became overworn, how the bus ticket to their old home town was also a ticket to the same bad ~ld neighborhood, itself troubled by unemployment. And they will tell of the stigma. A few will have admitted to a prospective employer that they had just come from pri son .. only to see th\u00a3 smil e of a personnel officer turn to stone. One ex-offender describes how quickly he was considered \"i\\. '-Iumphrey Bogart-l ike character with a contagious disease.\" Another tells of sensing immediate fear from his interviewer, although the man applying for work had served time for a \"white collar\" infraction of the tax laws. Few are articulate enough to make the case that al\u00ad though murderers and rapists are probably the most frequent source of fear to the public, less than one ~ cent of ill criminals are incarce\u00ad rated for these crimes. In all, their reactions will point up one key fact: that poor civic response teaches ex-offenders that crime pays---only because nothing else does! The cycle then repeats itself. Return to crime. Return to prison. Begin the cycle again. The fate of the repeat offender-- the \"recidivist\" --takes on the character of serving a life sentence on the installment plan ... (National Alliance of Businessmen) 204 THE WASHINGTOIl DIS~1AS PROJECT HANDBOOK Rilnald Simpson )0J)7 Dismas is the nam00f the good thief crucified with Jesus and is the name traditionally adopterJ by Catholic groups Vlorkingwithoffenders and ex-off~nders. In 1972, the Washington Dismas Project .,!:egan as a service program of the Josephite Pastoral Center. It was soon apparent that the problems that were being so~ved were being caused by tile pre-trial incarceration of a family member. Ar. office was opened at Holy Comforter-St. Cyprian Rectory on East Capitol Street. In October, 1972, two Josephite seminarians were assigned to assist the Catholic Chaplain at D.C. Jail. They assisted the chaplain in counseling inmates, calls to families and lawyers, assisting at religious and social programs. The Dismas staff person and the two seminarians began to work closel:; together in meeting the needs of those imprisoned. With support from the Community Release ;:rganization, a third party c.ustody program was started by Dismas in July of 1973. (Third party custody is a form of release that offers to a judicial officer an al\u00ad ternative to releasing any person charged with an offense: 1) on his personal promise to return to court; 2) to imposing a cash or surety bond on an arrested person; or, 3) detention in D.C. Jail. The law states that, \"a judicial officer, to reasonably insure the appearance of the person for trial, can place the person in the custody of a desig\u00ad nated person or organization to supervise him.\") A decision was made to focus on arrestees from the Northeast section of Washington because this was where most of the Josephite parishes were located. The core of the program was to be ~lunteers. They would perform the following functions: cover arraignment court to ascertain which arrestees were from the area; supervise and provide counseling for the releasees; and make referrals for employment and other community services. They would 205 also serve as custodians, assigned on a one-to-one basis to a releasee, who was required to maintain regular phone and pet'sona1 contact with assigned custodian. Dismas has t~o volunteers go to the D.C. Bail Agency in Building A of Superior Court each day. Once at the Bail Agency, the court volun\u00ad teers identify the arrested persons residing in one target area. After identifying these persons, the court persons interview each arrestee from the area and explain Dismas requirements, and the services offered by the Project. When an arrestee is released to Dismas, he/she is asked to return to our office so that: 1) our requirements and those imposed by the court can be explained in more detail in a relaxed, informal, and non-threatening setting; 2) they can meet and talk with the person, called custodian or standby, who will be working and maintaining contact with them. Dismas, in brief, tries to establish a relationship of friendship and personal support for the client and family. Dismas holds a monthly meeting for volunteers and i'1terested citizens. We also publish a newsletter and serve as resource persons for the Arch\u00ad diocesan Office of Criminal Justice. All of the aforementioned activi\u00ad ties, plus resource people in specialized subjects dealing with Justice and Corrections, and our monthly meetings, serve to heighten the awareness of the community to the needs and problems of those persons involved in the criminal justice system. COURT INTERVIEl~ PROCESS Guidelines for Court People A brief summary of what a court person's duties are and the places he/she will go. (If you can't make it to court, let someone in the office know in advance. 1. Bail Agency A) Carry with you ... 1. 1. D. card 2. Street list 3. Glossary of abbreviations of charges 4. Phone numbers 206 B) Check the Bail Agency folders for the addresses of defendants in Dismas area. C) When you find a Dismas area resident's folder ... 1. Be sure the address is Northeast or Southeast, and not Northwest or Southwest. 2. Copy all informction on the folder onto the interview form as neatly as possible. 3. The Bail Agency cannot recommend a defendant's release if it cannot veri fy hi slher address or contact any of hi slher references. You then call the office and we will try to get the necessary verification. 4. Call Dismas. Tell a staff member the number of Dismas area residents in the lock~up and give any information relevant to the verification of information on Bail Agency report or any other problems that might arise. 5. Be extremely aware of any extensive criminal record, drug abuse, alcoholism, or mental problems. We 11ant to be very sure that we will be the best custodian and provide the best type of service for the client. 11. At the Lock Up A) You will need your I.D. card to get into the lock-up. B) Interview 1. YELL out the person's name. 2. Tell them who you are and where you're from. 3. Explain what Dismas is and what it offers: a) Third pa,'ty custody and job referrals: explain that third party custody is a form of conditional release that requires the defendant's personal promise to maintain contact with another person or group and to return to court in the future. 4. Briefly explain what will happen in court that afternoon. 5. Ask the person the following questions; a) \"If we were to offer third party custody to you would you be willing to cooperate with Dismas by 1) coming back to the Dismas office for a brief interview; 2) make three phone contacts per week and personal contacts once every blo weeks; 3) do you have a place to live and a means of support?\" 6. Give a Di\u00a3mas card to all Dismas area arrestees. 7. Do not, repeat, DO NOT promise to take the person out. 207 III.Decisions Regarding Whether or Not to offer to T&ke Third Party Custody A) The decision should be based on the following factors: 1. The arrestee's willingness to cooperate with the program. 2. The arrestee's likelihood of showing up for future court dates (check his/her previous record of showing up while on bond). 3. Your own intuition about the person. B) The decision is entirely yours --the only policies of Dismas to temember are: 1. Person must reside in Dismas area at time of arrest. 2. Be extremely aware of drug or alcohol abuse, prior' con\u00ad victions, and mental problems and how extensive they are. 3. That they return to the Dismas office with you. 4. That we always interview any prospective clients before offering third party custody. IV. Before Court A) Look for arrestee's lawyer either in the Bail Agency or Lawyer's Lounge on the third floor by the elevators. Tell the lawyer that Dismas is willing as a third party custodian for their client if needed, but not to offer third party custody if it is clear that the person will be let out on personal recogn'i zance. If you don't know the lawyer by sight, ask one of the other lawye'rs in the la~lyers' lounge to point him or her out. Prepare a note for the attorney if it seems that you won't be able to talk to him before arraignment begins. V. In Court A) Don't be intimidated by the formality and ritual. Keep in mind that this is a public event and you have as much right to b~ there as the persons do who make .q living in court. If cal'l.crl upon to speak, think, act, and 5peak with deliberation and care. Don't let fast-talking lawyers or overbearing judges talk you into a position where you end up rioing something contrary to what you had intended to do. As an example, you might be asked to provide twenty-four hour custody, a service not provided by our program,or to take custody of someone not in our area. 208 B) If the person is released to us, sign the release form by writing Dismas Project on the line that says custodian's name and your name on thE' signature line. Our copy will be the gold one. The client will also be given a copy of the re\u00ad lease conditions. Because our copy will often times be un\u00ad readable, ask to see the client's copy as soon as possible and copy onto our gold form all the conditions of release. The date at the bottom of the form will be extremely important. It is the time and date of the client's next court appearance. (It is most important to record this information accurately). C) Please record as many arraignment dispositions on the Marshall's lock-up list as possible. If possible, take note of the attorney's conduct (attitude, quality of service to client, etc.), and re\u00ad cord on the back of the Marshall's list. Do the same for the judges. D) Note results of any case involving defendants from Dismas area. Inform any Dismas area defendant released on their own recog\u00ad nizance that they can contact Dismas at any time for help with any problems tbey might have. VI. After Court A) Call the office immediately and tell whether or not ailyone was released to Dismas. B) If so, bring them to the office for an interview. C) It may be necessary, however, before coming to the office, to check in with the Narcotics Treatment Administration (NTA) on the first floor of Building A. It may also be necessary to go to the Central Cell Block (301 Indiana Avenue, N.W.), where some arrested persons spc:nd the night, to pick up the client's belongings. It is very important that the client is then brought back to the Dismas office. There, the program can be more fully explained to the client in an easy and non\u00ad threatening atmosphere and specific arrangements for contact can be made. VII,At the Dismas Office A) Client meets standby and staff. B) All forms and notes are turned into a member of the office staff for proper filing and recording. 209 VIII. Training for Court Interviewers A) When persons are interested in being a court person, they are trained individuallY, both in an office setting and on the job, so that they learn theory and see its practical application. The court coordinator always accompanies a new court person during his/her first few court sessions. The !:oordinator makes sure that the new person has the written court guide\u00ad lines, an area street list, and a list explaining what the abbreviations for different crimes mean. During the office training session, the volunteer is taught the theory of Dismas, duties and responsibilities of a court interviewer, and given certain situations to react to. Some examples of these situations are: 1. Relatives or friends are arrested as co-defendants but only one resides in our area. After we interview the person from our area, you are asked to take the co-defen\u00ad dant. What do you do? 2. What do you say to the attorney of a person who you've interviewed, when it appears the person will be released on personal recognizance? 3. A judge asks a Dismas representative to take a person who doesn't reside in our area. What do you say to the judge? 4. A defendant asks you to do a number of things for him. Do you do them? 5. A Dismas area resident is arrested for assault, the com\u00ad plaining witness is his wife, and as a condition of re\u00ad lease he has to stay away from the complaining witness. The Bail Agency has recommended Dismas as a custodian but the defendant says he has no other place to stay. What can you do? OFFICE PROCEDURES 1. Hand1 i ng Telephone Messages from Cl i ents A) When clients call the office, an office member will ask the client: 210 1. If there are any problems he would like to discuss; 2. Has he had any ~ontact with his attorney; 3. How he is dojng on job/school; if he is employed or a student; . 4. Why he is calling the office instead of the standby; 5. Remind the client of his next court date. B) After doing the above, the office person will: 1) go to the contact board and change the date of the last contact and record the date of the next court appearance if this is applicable; 2) go to the active files and record the date of the last contact, how contact was made(in person or by phone) on the client's contact sheet, and any pertinent comments (i.e., nature of call, request for some type of assistance) in the comment section of the contact sheet. II. Handling Requests and Calls from Standbys A) When a standby calls, it is usually for one of two reasons\u00ad either he is having difficulty reaching the client, or his client has asked a question or made a request that the standby can't readily answer or fulfill. B) The office person must then make a special effort to contact the client and when making contact explain to the client the importance of maintaining contact with his/her standby (possi\u00ad bility of bond revocation, the long-term possibility of pro\u00ad bation for a good compliance record, etc.). C) In the case of questions and requests: If the office person can't find the answers in the files and information books in the office, he/she should take the specific information from the standbY. He/she should then ask one of the other staff members to look into the matter and get back in touch with the . standby with the answer. III.Things to be Included in Clients' Files A) Interview sheet to be filled in as accurately as possible. B) A gold release order from the court that lists all the re\u00ad quirements of the court. C) A copy of the names, dates, phone numbers sheet (a copy of this form should go to the cl ient). D) A copy of the client contact sheet. E} Any correspondence between office and client, the court and client, the Bail Agency and client, and anything pertaining to the client. 211 F) Any time a request is made either by the client or his/her standby, a request/referral (pink) form is filled out listing the nature of the request, who the client was re\u00ad ferred to and what the office follow-up shows as the result. All requests are to be recorded in this way and these sheets are to go into the client's file. VOLUNTEERS FROM THE COMMUNITY Standbys Standbys are community people who volunteer to work one-to-one with a person when the court releases them to the third party custody of Dismas. In conjunction with the client, they --the standby -\u00ad arranges a specific schedule of phone and personal contact with the client. The standby makes arrangements to attend scheduled court hear\u00ad ings for the client, contacts staff for any needs or problems, and makes a progress report to the office. The ideal situation is to recruit standbys from the areas that the organization selects as its target area. The standbys are recruited in two ways: 1) speaking to church, business, and community; and, 2) word of mouth from other volunteers. Training for the standby takes place at monthly meetings where speakers from varying parts of the criminal justice system talk on relevant subjects, and films on criminal justice and corrections are shown. The standby is also trained in problem-solving and counseling techniques through role-playing and experience sharing sessions in an in-house training program. When a client is released to the custody of Dismas, arrangements are made for his/her assignment to a standby and hopefully the stand\u00ad by can be present when the client is brought to the office. The client and standby then work out a schedule for contacting one another and the client can be given a fuller explanation of his or her requirements and a more detailed explanation of the Dismas program. The staff of Dismas, is available to talk to standbys and clients, to offer support and assistance, and to make referrals to appropriate 212 service organizations. Staff should contact the standby at least once a week to get a record of the contact with the client and tell about the client's progress. If the client fails to maintain contact and we cannot get in touch with him/her, the Bail Agency is notified and cus\u00ad tody is relinquished. Unless there is a loss of contact and other attempts to contact fail, no client is surrendered. Involvement with a client technically ends at the disposition of the client's case; however, we hope that a standby would continue to show an interest in the client. If a case should end and the client is given a prison sentence, the standby can be very supportive by corresponding and visiting the person to show that someone does care about his/her welfare. What a standby should do: 1) get to know the client as a person, not just as a Client 2) explain Dismas and its resources and what we might be able to do to help the person meet some of his/her needs. 3) explain the importance of complying with us and consequences for not complying (i.e., bench warrant, etc.). 4) make your role of standby clear. 5) makeit clear about reporting any and all chClnges in status, e.g., address, telephone, job. 213 FLOH CHART Flow chart of different court hearings in criminal cases ;n D.C.

The proceeding where defendant: a) sees his attorney; b) is advised of h'is rights; c) is told the charge or charges on which he will be prosecuted; d) pleads guilty or not guilty to charges; and, e) has a date set for his/her trial. 2) Felony -After the grand jury returns an indictment in a felony matter, the accused returns to court where the formal charges in the indictment are read, the defendant pleads guilty or not guilty, and the case is continued for trial. 215 Personal Recognizance -The type of bond which allows a defendant to be released on his promise to return for all of his/her court dates. Plea -What a defendant says,to a Judge when asked if they committed the crime they have been charged with: eithergui1ty, not guilty, or no contest. Plea Bargaining -An agreement that is worked out by the prosecutor and defense counsel whereby the prosecutor offers to charge the defen\u00ad dant with a lesser included offense or fewer counts of the indictment in exchange for a guilty plea. A plea cannot be made ~lithout the de\u00ad fendant's approval. Preliminary hearing -(felony cases only). The purpose of a pre\u00ad liminary hearing is for a Judge to decide whether the government has enough evidence against an accused person to send the case to the grand jury. If the Judge decides there is sUfficient evidence to send the case to the grand jury, he says \"probable cause\" is found. If \"probable cause\" is not found, the case will be dismissed. But a defendant may be indicted at a later time anyway if the government attorney takes the case straight to the grand jury. Presentment -(felony). Similar to the arraignment proceeding as described in \"Arraignment -~lisdemeanor\" except the defendant is not required to plead guilty or not guilty at this time. Sentencing -The action after a trial or a plea of guilty by which the Judge imposes punishment on a defendant found guilty. Station House Bond -Money bond posted at the police station house which allows arrested persons to walk away from the police station and go on his QII'!1 ttl t;'je court the next morning. Cash Bond or Court Percentage Deposit Bolld \"' CBsh mOM:! t-;;posited directly with the court, and returned in full if the defendant appears for all scheduled court hearings. Frequently, Judges use the option to require the deposit of only a percentage of the face amount of the bond. The' maximum is 10 percent. 216 Surety Bond -This is a bond obtained through a bail bond agency. The defendant pays a legally defined percentage of the face amount of the bond set by the court, as interest or fee to the bondsman. This money is not refundable. On large amounts, the bondsman might ask for co 11 atera 1 . Citation Release -At the discretion of the police, backed by a recommendation from the D.C. Bail Agency, a defendant is released on personal recognizance directly from the police station rather than going downtown for an appearance in court. Eligibility for this type of release is limited to misdemeanor and traffic type cases and is used only when, in the judgement of the police, the defendant is not con\u00ad sidered a threat to th,e community. Status Hearing -This court proceeding is to determine whether a case is ready for trial, ~Ihether something has come up that means the trial should be postponed, or whether there will be a disposition (i .e., a plea of guilty) of the case before the trial date. Third Party Custody - A condition of personal recognizance release that requires someone released awaiting trial to stay in contact with a person or organization approved by the Judge. This person or organi\u00ad zation agrees to notify the court if contact with the defendant cannot be maintained. 217 AG\\.I ADP AR ATT.ROB.

United States Magistrate 219 STARTING A RELEASE PROGRAM A) If your local courts accept the principle of releasing defen\u00ad dants on third party custody, most of the previous information will apply; however, if the local courts do not utilize the third party custody release, then the first step is to determine the types of release the court uses. If the court in your community does not release defendants on personal recognizance, your group can introduce the idea to your com\u00ad munity and work for its acceptance by the courts. For those defendants who might not be eligible for release on their recognizance and who cannot afford to post a money bond, third party custody is a way to bring about the release of many who would otherwise be held in jail during the pre-trial period. A third party custody program offers the courts another alternative release mode which most Judges are happy to have. B) Things to be Done Before Starting 1. Finding out which methods of release are used by the 1 oca 1 courts. 2. Creating the interest in the community for the need for a release program. 3. Once the interest has been generated, recruit volunteers to perform the preliminary research. C) Preliminary Research To determine how many people get arrested from your community, you will have to check the arrest records for a given time period. You must then map out the area you want to work in and give this area some type of boundaries. After this, prepare an alphabetical listing of the streets within this area with addresses where appropriate (e.g., G Street, 200-1999). When this research is done, notes should be made of the bond set by the court for the defendants from your area. The total number of people arrested from your area divided by the number of days checked 220 -. should give your group an estimate of the number of people in your target area you will possibly need to interview daily. The number of people held on money bonds w~ll give you some idea of the number of people you could offer to take out on third party custody. Not all of them would be granted third party custody release. Your research will reveal many cases where some defendants could have been released had a third party custodian been available. D) After yOlJr initial research is completed, you should go to the courts with your program and ask that they look very carefully at it a-nCi hopefully give your group the authorization to function as third party custodians. If the local courts give this approval, your next step is to have the persons who did your preliminary research act as your court intl~rviewers, if possible. You then try to have your standbys available for the clients. The standbys shaul d have been trai ned and ready for thei r fi rst clients while your preliminary research was-being done and the case for third party custody was being presented to the courts. \"If our brothers are oppressed, then we are oppressed.

Many adults released by the court on pro\u00ad bation do not receive adequate supervision and heip. Yet such help can make the difference between developing a worthwhile, law abiding citizen, and a crime repeater. The volunteer counselor cannot supplant the probation officer, who usually is a highly-trained professional. But the volunteer can, in a significant number of cases, function so helpfully as to be a ma,;or aid to the court. The Task: The volunteer counselor is needed to devote at least an hour a week to guiding one probationer assigned to him by the court. He gives the court's chief probation officer a periodic report on the person he is helping. The kind of assistance he will give varies. He may help the probationer get a job or complete his education ... he may give advice on marital or family pl\u00b7oblems. Sometimes, what a probationer needs most is just a sympathetic 'ear to let him know that someone cares. At other times, the counselor will bring in the assistance of community social agencies. Always, with any serious problem, he will call in the chief probation officer. , Even before he begins, the volunteer counselor must be willing to obtain gu'ldance himself -from the chief probation officer ... from a school of social work . or from some other source which will acquaint him with the kinds of problems he can expect to encounter. It's desirable that the volunteer pledge himself to this much-needed task for,at least a year. Only in this way, will the court realize a worth\u00ad while return on the investment of training given to him. 228 Racine Tavern-Keepers Trained in Referral -An idea which was announced by CSA Director Leo Perlis at the 1957 National AFL-CIO Convention, has reappeared in a program now operating in Racine, Wisconsin. The Mental Health Association there, directed Ms. Ruth Weyland, is training owners and employees of bars as commu~ity social service referral agents. The program takes advantage of a traditional bartender's talent, sympathetic listening, and equips them --via a 4-sessio~ course which covers legal responsibil iti es, 1 i stening, and agency resources --to refer \"patrons .. for assistance before their problems (become) crisis-oriented.\" The Racine MHA is planning a similar program for beauticians, \"to open up another area of referral especially for women with problems.\" For further information, contact Ms. Weyland at the Association, 824 6th Street, Racine, Wisconsin 53403. (The Community -AFL-CIO, June-July, 1977) 229 TREATMENT FOR THE ALCOHOL ABUSER - A COMMUNITY CONCERN Richard W. Finley Texoma Regional Planning Council Programs designed to treat the chemical abuser outside the criminal justice system do not happen simply by coincidence. Only through the coordinated efforts of community citizens and leaders will such programs be developed. The need for \"diversionary\" programs has long been recog\u00ad nized by professionals in the fields of criminal justicf, alcoholism and drug abuse. Thomas F. A. Plant, author of Ah:ohol Problems: A Report to the Nation, a document prepared for the Cooperative Commission on the Study of Alcoholism states clearly: The traditional handling by the police, the court. and jail systems of the very large number of person~ found drunk on the streets is inhuman as well as in\u00ad effective. There is general agreement that the current \"revolving door\" system of repeated arrests and jailings does not alter the drinking behavior of any Significant number of problem drinkers, and thus is not effecti ve ei ther as a deterrent or treatment. Many questions have been and are being raised about the constitutionality of treating such persons as criminals. If a man's drunkenness is part of his illness-and thus a non-voluntary act-he should be treated as a sick person and not as a criminal. Clearly it is not a crime to suffer from alcoholism, a characteristic of which is the inability to control one's drinking, thus it seems bizal're, inappropriate, and unconstitution~l to punish an individual for being intoxicated.\" \" , Plant further points to the demoral izing effect the present ir:mdl ing of the public inebriate has on police, judicial and jail personnel, in\u00ad cluding the tremendous waste of tax dollars to support such a system. The lack of alternati'ves to deal with the chemical abuser outside of the criminal justice system is a key element in the needed development of \"diversionary\" programs. To emphasize this fact, the National Ad\u00ad visory Commission on Criminal Justice Standards and Goals has rec\u00ad ommended \"that every State enact legislation which provides authority 230 for civil commitment and court diversion of persons who, because of alcoholism or drug addiction are in need of treatment and who should be dealt with outside the Criminal Justice System. Legislation should pl'ovide funding for treatment centers where such persons can receive both detoxification and follow-up care\".2 In 1971 the National Con\u00ad ference of Commissioners on Uniform State La~ls drafted, approved and recommended for enactment in all states the Uniform Alcoholism and In\u00ad toxication Treatment Act. The Uniform Act has proven very popular; more than half the states and territories have enacted versions of it, many others are about to follow suit, and Congress has authorized special incentive funds. The best known of the Act's provisions is the decriminalization of public drunkenness. Other provisions, however, may prove in the long run just as significant; the Act represents a major shift in the attitudes and resources which states may direct toward the treatment of alcoholism as well as of intoxication. The mujor policy intentions of the Act are as follows: \u00b7 .' :ton-criminal, voluntary, treatment-oriented approach to the control and care of alcoholics and intoxicated p~rsons is desirable and required of the state. \u00b7 Treatment programs must be fostered by a state al\u00ad coholism agency with necessary authority and broad res pons i b il ity. \u00b7 The quality of alcoholism treatment services must be assured by enforcing minimum program standards. \u00b7 States must undertake to establish a statewide com\u00ad prehensive and coordinated structure of alcoholism treat\u00ad ment servi ces. \u00b7 Services and procedures for the immediate care and iimited control of alcohol-impaired person must be provided. \u00b7 Services and procedures for long-term and/or involuntary care of dangerous and/or incapacitated persons with con\u00ad tinuing severe alcohol impairment must be provided. 231 Clearly, thE development of a more responsive mechanism for deal- ing with the chemical abuser within our communities is being undertaken. A question remains; Who Can Initiate the Programs? A review of case studies on the experiences of existing programs demonstrates \"that any interested and invested individual or community group can initiate the steps necessary to implement diversionary programs.,,3 The initial im\u00ad plementation process however, will not be successful until a sufficiently motivated individual or group interested in the problem pursues the initial mobilization of community and extra-community resources. The following is a list of helpful \"Do's and Dont'sJl to consider during the beginning stages of \"diversionary\" program supplementation. 1. Begin where the community is -fo;--:nlJ1ate your program objectives so they are in conjunction with your community's desire and/or capacity to ~upport such a program. 2. If possible, visit successful programs in other com\u00ad munities in order to \\1ain insight into initial program implementation. 3. Make sure your pl'ogram goal sand objecti ves are wen defined. A clear picture of the proposed program must be developed before seeking community and/or state, federal support. 4. Involve the community's power structure in the initial development of the program. In this manner, the successful implementation of the program becomes a vested interest of the power structure. A critical point of advice, never allow the program to become a \"Political Football\". 5. Early in 'the program development process gain the support of the human resource-allied health community. These are the individuals and agencies who will work closely with the progl'1il'1 once it is implemented, their support is crucial. 232 r The following are brief case histories on the successful development of \"diversionary\" programs: The St. Louis Detoxification4and Diagnostic Evaluation Center The St. Louis project has the distinction of being the first operative detoxification program in the United States. It was begun toward the end of 1966 under a one-year grant from the Office of Law Enforcement Assistance (the predecessor of the present Law Enforcement Ass'istance Administration-LEAA). Its budget was $200,000 and its caseload 1600 cases per year. Prior to the inception of the program the St. Louis police force followed a policy of de-emphasizing public drunkenness, and arrest rates were low. In 1964-65 arrest rates in St. Louis did not .exceed 4000, while in Washington, D.C. for the same year, 40,000 arrests were made (the cities are roughly comparable in size). The three major goals of the program were to provide medical assistance, to faci 1 itate rehabi 1 itation of the patients., and to re\u00ad duce pub1'ic expenditures. Since the arrest rate was already low, the program is somewhat difficult to evaluate. The program did demonstrate the needs of the derelict inebriate and the failure of the law enforce\u00ad ment approach to reach everyone in need of medical attention. The program consisted of a seven-day stay at the treatment center. The men arrested were given the chance of becoming patients at the detoxification center or being processed through the courts. Few chose to be prosecuted o~' to leave the facility without permission. After admission the patients were given a medical examination and if serious ailments we.re found, were transferred to a local hospital or mental health center. The patient was showered, deloused if nec\u00ad essary and assigned to a bed. He would remain in bed for two days and would receive vitamins, forced fluids, tranquilizers and high prot~in diet. He would be urged to participate in phys'ical therapy and a psycho-therapy program which included socio-drama, group therapy, lectures and counselling. 233 The center was centrally located initially at St. Mary's Infirmary, which provided a convenient and friendly location. However, when the grant expired the program obtained state funding and was moved to the St. Louis State Hospital, which 'necessitated an hour's driving time to deliver patients and return. The hospital was also in a middle class residential area which seemed to the police officers unfitting for dere\u00ad lict men. There were a',so difficulties with regard to patients being refused admission. The patrolmen reacted against the center, not only because of its in\u00ad convenient location and the fact that drunk arrests had never had a high priority in St. Louis but also because they were skeptical that the program really rehabilitated. This latter may have been the price of overemphasizing the curative potential of the new system. A study of 200 patients made through interviews (by patrolmen) four months after discharge showed the following: 1. 19 percent of the group had abstained from drinking following discharge for at least 4 months. 2. 47 percent had shown \"marked improvement\" in drinking patterns. 3. 49 percent had shown \"marked improvement\" in health. 4. 15-18 percent had shown \"significant improvement\" in housing, income. and employment. Fur a group of men who were chronically ill and addicted these results could be regarded as showing a fair degree of success. The other objective of the project was, of course, to reduce expenditures within the criminal justice system. The projected savings to the syste~' for 1967 were'fepo~ted as $64,000. Since the project cost $200,000, no reduction could be demonstrated. 234 Pittsylvania County Honor Court5 Individuals charged with crimes related to alcohol misuse have the opportunity to learn new job skills in addition to receiving treatment for alcoholism as an alternative to jailor a fine under the cooperative Virginia project called the Pittsylvania County Honor Court. The program is sponsored by two Pittsylvania County courts, the Danville Alcoholism Treatment Center and the Virginia Department of Vocational Rehabilitation (DVR). Under the plan, after an alcohol-related arrest, a counselor is assigned to determine the person's physical state, get information on the arrest, and ascertain whether the individua1 has an alcohol problem. This information is presented to the judge, who can then offer the person the option to join the Honor Court program. If the individual refuses to participate or fails to comply with the regulations of the program, the judge can then opt for traditional sentencing. Individuals who agree to join the program are sent to the Danville Alcoholism Treatment Center, which offers medical facilities. The re\u00ad habilitation regimen at the center includes individual and group therapy, 12 weekly meetings, featuring speakers on alcoholism topics, films and rap sessions. Honor Court meetings are modeled after Alcoholics Anony\u00ad mous meetings and are regularly attended by AA members. Alfparticipants are referred to the Department of Vocational Re\u00ad habilitation, which provides job counseling and job training for clients, who remain under the supervision of parole personnel. Some vocational facilities exist at Danville and use is also made of local community college resources. Furthermore, local employers are paid to train in\u00ad dividuals in such areas as welding, cosmetology, auto mechanics, mainte\u00ad nance and upholstery. The project, funded by a grant to DVR from the Rehabilitation Ser\u00ad vices Administration\u00b7 of the U.S. Department of Health, Education and Wel\u00ad fare, has been in operation since January, 1976. About 18 people regis\u00ad tered during the first month of operation, and program officials report that 150 people were served during the first year. 235 The District of Columbia Detoxification Program6 The District of Columbia Detoxification Program was first located in the basement of the D.C. General Hospital, where 25 beds were made available. It was relocated in April, 1968 and authorized a broad re\u00ad habilitation network for alcoholics. A center for women was also opened in the D.C. General Hospital in 1971. The project has had many difficulties. There is a vast dif- ference between they way the patrolmen interpret the new system and the way the reform elements within the criminal justice system see it. There has been no attempt to instruct patrolmen in their role. No course on detoxification is offered at the police academy and the public health personnel have shown no interest in implementing such a course. The program has been evaluated by a research team from George Washington University. The team felt that the program has demonstrated that a nursing care service is feasible and economical, but notes that the program makes inadequate provision for patients after release in terms of shelter, c10thing, and food, and that the program is in\u00ad effective in keeping patients long enough for complete withdrawal from alcohol. Of the patients in the evaluation sample who volunteered for treat\u00ad ment, 43 percent left before their treatment term was finished. The effort at referral to other agencies was a1~0 largely unsuccessful. Only 16 men handed in referral cards to the Alcoholic Rehabilitation Clinic (ARC) out of a total of 1,282 men referred. The total cost of the program has been roughly estimated at $1.7 million per year. Previously the cost to the criminal justice system was $3 million, half of which was spent on the costs of incarceration. The detoxification center has been able to eliminate this expense by releasing each patient within 3 days of admission. In order to continue grassroots development of diversionary programs, an evaluation systenl should be built into the network of services so as to determine the effectiveness of services and the need for improvements. 236 Needed imformation dealing with the program's effects on the clients and the community, including its role in diversion, is directly pragmatic in securing additional funding and justifying a program's existence. \"The effectiveness of services may be assessed when data are available concerning the kinds and the volume of ser\u00ad vices which are being provided. Services may be related to cost. Information may be gathered which indicates the kinds of patients or clients who are receiving services, referral sources, presenting problems at referral and the relationship of need to availability of services. The effects of individual treatment when treatment goals have been established may indicate the need to develop or modi- fy existing treatment methods\". Citizen involvement in the evaluation of a program is just as, if\u00b7not more crucial to a program's success than involvement in the implemen\u00ad tation process. Only through evaluation can we determine a program's effectiveness. Such evaluation, if practical and realistic, \"becomes the basis for change, re-orientation and further development of al- cohol ism services within the total commun\"ity health and welfare system.\"S 237 FOOTNOTES 1 Thomas LA.

To the maximum possible extent, citizens have been systematically excluded. In addition, the general public never has been well informed about corrections and correctional issues, and this lack of information has led to apathy and lack of understanding, occa\u00ad sionally to indignation and hostility. 56119 It is obvious that community support is required if community corrections is to become a reality. Volunteers should be introduced on a large scale into the traditional institution and its community extension activities. They are an invaluable source for development and implemen\u00ad tation of further areas of community participation.\" National Advisory Commission on Criminal Justice Standards and Goals, 1973. Since 1970, Offender Aid and Restoration (OAR) has been actively introducing volunteers to county and city jails. Community Programs have been established at nine sites from North Carolina to New York and new Community Programs are being developed at an accelerated pace. ~letaMetri cs conducted an eva 1 uati on study of the overa 11 Offender Ai d and Restorati on Program in accordance with the OAR priori ty em\u00ad phasis for reliable feedback on OAR activities. The evaluation assessed program impact; identified program strengths and weaknesses; analysed OAR activities and policies; and recol11T1E!nded functional com- 240 munication and administrative procedures. 1.1 Program'Description OAR's primary objective iS,to assist persons in jail to help themselves. This is accomplished by the recruiting, training and assigning of citizen volunteers who counsel offenders on a one-to\u00ad one basis. In some cases, counseling continues after release from jail. Secondary objectives are: To educate citizen volunteers to establish an informed constituency for correctional change. To focus the services of existing community agencies on authenic services to clients and to coordinate such services with the volunteers' work To find and implement effective diversion and alternative programs in addition to OAR's primary jail program The program foundation of OAR is the One-to-One component which ~ stresses the establishment of a helping relationship as contrasted with the condescending or religious orientation of many volunteer efforts institutions. The volunteer gains insight into the operating criminal j'ustice system as the counseling relationship is established. The client has an additional person in the community to visit with on a weekly basis and a valuable contact for assistance upon release. In addition to the One-to-One component, OAR staff and volun\u00ad teers operate formal programs in institutions which include tutoring of clients and group special interest meetings for alcohol and drug thera~y. Formal programs in the community include court probation volunteers, halfway houses and special juvenile programs. OAR staff provide other services to clients in institutions and the community. These services range from referrals to other agencies to intensive aid in finding employment or acceptance into educational and training pro\u00ad grams. 241 \\ \\ _____________ ~I'--------~---------- 1. 2 Program Development and Organization In December, 1968, a Conference on the Church and the Correc\u00ad tional Svstem \\~as sDonsored bv the Virginia Council of Churches. the Catholic Diocese of Richmond, the Salvation Armv, and the Chaplain Service of the Churches of Virginia in response to work stoppages and other issues raised at the Virginia State Penitentiary. In 1969, a Task Group on Cor~ection of the Virginia Council of Churches was established as a result of the concern expressed at the Conference and the Offender Aid and Restoration program grew out of their efforts. Following the establishment of six operating community programs through\u00ad out Virginia, OAR of the United States was launched in September of 1973. By 1975, the United States was launched in September of 1973. By 1975, 2 additional community programs were fully operational and state offices were established in Maryland, North Carolina and New York. Table 1-1 summarizes the growth of community programs and state offices. From 1970 to 1975, 1,563 volunteers were trained and assigned to 2,967 clients.

A related objective is to impact on the criminal justice sy~tem through staff and volunteer efforts. With these guidelines, Community Programs have structured their efforts in accordance with staff and community perceptions of problems, issues and priorities. The community setting ranges from semi-rural Washington County, Virginia to New York City. The client population usually consists of detained for trial and short term sentenced adult maJes. The metro\u00ad politan Fairfax County, Virginia Community Program clients consist of detentioners who are convicted and released on probation (25%); detent'ioners who are convicted, serve sentences and are released on parole; and a group of detentioners and sentenced persons (50%) who are released other than on probation or parole including charges dis\u00ad missed and found not guilty. New York City clients consist wholly of detained adolescent males charged with serious felonies such as murder and armed robbery. The OAR Community Program effort is supported by public and pri\u00ad vate funds comprising the annual budgets. Full-time Community Program staff ranges from 2 persons for Anne Arundel County, Maryland to 11 persons for Richmond, Virginia. Vista Volunteers constitute 36% of full-time OAR staff, The time contributed by volunteers is the largest program resource. Including the Vista and volunteer efforts, each dollar contributed to OAR annual budgets results in a total program effort valued at $3.78. Program emphasis varies for the Communi ty Programs. Only New York City devotes all staff to the One-to-One component. Three other Community Programs assign more than half of the full\u00ad time staff to the One-to-One component. Overall, 52% of full-time OAR staff is allocated to the One-to-One component, 26% to formal programs and 22% to client services. 243 1 .4 Program Impact The impact of OAR over the past 4 years has been on OAR clients; public awareness through staff contrasts and volunteer involvement; and the criminal justice svstem throuah staff, client and volunteer efforts. 1.4.1. Client Impact Over the past vear, a total of approximatelv a thousand clients were involved in the One-tCl\u00b7~One program and an additional two thousand were provided some other assistance varying from program referral to intensive job development. Interviews conducted with clients in insti\u00ad tutions consistently showed that these numbers, while indicating total contacts, cannot reveal the total value of the weekly meetings for in\u00ad carcerated persons. Clients were very positive about the One-to-One program irrespective of the race, sex or background of the volunteer. Clients support the program and actively recruit new clients. Volun\u00ad teers served as 1 iaison Nith defense attorneys, assured the presence of a supportive person at court hearings and trials and provided continuing support to the client after his release. The OAR One-to-One program is expected to affect the lifestyles and potential for recidivism or return to crime of the clients. Meta\u00ad Metrics conducted a folloN-up analysis of parolees and probationers a Community Program to determine OAR impact on recidivism. Additionally, the analysis provided insight into the OAR program and data procedures. Fifty OAR clients 11ere matched with fifty probationers and parolees who were released during the same month. The follow-up period ranged from one month to 48 months. All arrests, probation and parole vio\u00ad lations, and dispositions were recol'ded. Perfectly matched groups Nere not selected because of the limited case load from Nhich to draw the comparison group. Characteristics of both groups were analyzed and differences were found as shown in Table 1-2. OAR clients had longer criminal histol'ies and a higher proporti on of property offr,lses. Property offenders tend to red di vate at a higher rate than those convicted of person or other crimes. 244 Previously Convicted Previously Committed Property Offenses Table 1-2 Characteristics OAR to the proportion of overall incidents, 30% for the OAR group and 28% for the comparison Group, there was no statis\u00ad tical difference in performance. A time analysis, however, showed that OAR clients had an incident rate of 10.7% at the end of 9 months compared to 20.8% for the compal'ison group. Usingtiie proportion actually convicted and incarcerated rather than arrests and violations, CAR clients had a 2.4% rate at the end of 18 months compared to 10.7% for thle comparison group. o Considering that OAR Glients as a gro~p may tend to recidivate because of their characteristics, the time'analysis is conclusive and shows a better performance of the OAR clients for the first 18 months. Beyond that time, OAR client performance matches that of the comparison group. 1.4.2 Community and System Imnact The general public is ill-informed of the system of criminal jus\u00ad tice, its components and actual operations. A brief exposure to police, courts and institutions is insufficient for comprehension of the system. The OAR program requires the commitment of one year of all volunteers in the One-to-One program. The volunteer learns court and institutional procedllrr:s from the client and from contact with the components. This exposure has resulted in a cadre of 1,500 citizens that has first hand knowledge of cl'iminal justice and is equipped to differentiate between the avowed purposes and actual realities .. f jus\u00ad tice. 245 Through staff, client and volunteer efforts, OAR has ~ffected change in all Ocf the Community Program jails and in criminal justice components at several sites. T~.is change ranges from introduction of services to inmates in jails to the establishment of new programs in\u00ad cluding halfway houses and court volunteers. Selected examples are shown below: Roanoke, Virginia: A recently introduced juvenile court program is expected to result in improved cooperation with the court and probation officers. rlewport News, Virginia: OAR staff and volunteers questioned certain activities at the prison farm which resulted in media and public awareness of prison con\u00ad ditions and subsequent administration citange~ and improvements. Fairfax, Virginia: OAR has helped introduce many program changes in the jail including a 24 hour para\u00ad medic, staff psychologist, GED program, work release program and library. Charlottesville, Virginia: OAR was instrumental in establishing the only citizen directed jail in Virginia which required special legislation from the Virginia General Assembly; the Jail Board of Directors is chaired by an OAR volunteer. Richmond, Virginia: OAR operates a halfway house and a new OAR Court program utilizing volunteers rather than probation officers is evidence of a growing criminal justice system cooperation with OAR beyond the Ri chmond Jail. Washington County. Virginia: Relations with the jail administration have improved in recent months and the new Juvenile Court/Wilderness Ventures program may help alleviate antipathy to rehabilitation. Anne Arundel County, Virginia: OAR impact in the jail has been an improved library, assistance with the work release program and an art supply program. New York City: Volunteer response to this new program and community acceptance has been phenomenal which re\u00ad sulted in a grant to quadruple the staff for the next year's program 246 1.5 Findings and Recommendations In five years, OAR has grown from a local volunteer effort in several Virginia conmunities to a national program with eight estab\u00ad lished Community Programs in three states. By the end of 1976, Community Programs will be operational in three additional states. Diversity of programming is the basic strength of OAR. Each Community Program has a Board of Directors which determines the em\u00ad phasis to be placed on program activities. OAR staff make adjustments to needs of clients and opportunities for program development. Meta\u00ad Metrics recommends that OAR, in the development of neW Community Programs and the support of existing Community Programs, build upon the grass roots concern of the community and bring to bear the col\u00ad lective experience and expertise of the OAR organization. Program flexibility should be an explicit strategy with the One-to-One concept providing a core program. Over the year ending June 30, 1975, approximately one thousand cl,ients were involved in the One-to-One program. An additional 400 were participants of OAR formal programs and there were approxi\u00ad mately 2,000 instances of services rendered to clients. The OAR annual budget expenditures per 12 month One-to-One relationship was $250. Equivalent services provided by paid probation, parole or institutional counselors would cost over $1,000. Clients consistently praised the OAR program and aided in the identification of new clients. In addition to the visits by vol un\u00ad t~ers, valuable services in terms of community contacts and monitoring of justice procedures were provided. Individual citizen volunteers have become well informed of the criminal justice system and issues of justice. They, in turn, have affected actual systems operations and procedures in several OAR communities. OAR doas affect the rate of recidivism of clients. On the basis of new convictions and incarceration, OAR clients performed better at a statistically Significant level over the first 18 months after release 247 from institutions. In addition, OAR clients tend to have longer crimi\u00ad nal records, more time in institutions, and more potential for recidi\u00ad vism than the comparison group of probationers and parolees. OAR Community Programs are achieving their objectives and are affecting their communities and criminal justice agencies and institutions. 248 ,', ~ THE COMMUNITY ASSISTANCE PROGRAM FOR EX-OFFENDERS (CAPE) DES MOINES, IOWA AFL-CIO/NCCD Experience shows that the period immediately following release from prison to be the most crucial time in an offender's career. If he can locate a job quickly he has a chance. If he cannot find gainful work ~he opportunity for slipping back into lawbreaking is dramatically increased. Des Moines' CAPE project, sponsored by the South Central Iowa Federa\u00ad tion AFL-CIO and the United Way of Greater Des Moines, has been easing the transition from prison to private life: CAPE staff provide counseling, career development, and placement. Founded in 1974, it placed more than 250 parolees and 150 work-re1easees in local well-paying jobs. Most of them are doing well. The CAPE program is staffed with VISTA employees. It goes into the corrE'ctio,la1 institutions and it helps prepare the individual offenders for the time when they are to be released. It does so by training them on how to present themselves for jobs, how to be interviewed, how to develop a positive attitude toward seeking employment. It also helps locate job possibilities. It is both a matching process ~nd a prepara\u00ad tion for a work career. CAPE's program has been funded by the Iowa Department of Social Services, the National .Alliance of Businessmen, and ACTION. 249 The Alston Wilkes Society: An Inside Look. What Is It? There are many men and women in prisons in Columbia, South Carolina who receive no visitors from the outside world. Perhaps they are from out-of-state, have no living family, or have no ties with their family and friends. The Prison Visitation Program (PVP) matche~ volunteers from the com\u00ad munity on a one-to-one basis with these inmates. The volunteer visits and corresponds with the inmate regularly. *** Who Are The Volunteers? There is no \"average\" volunti:er. I:.ilch one is a special person who cares about others and is willing to give of his time to a lonely inmate. Dependability, sensitivity, and the ability to be a good listener are good qualities for a volunteer. There are no requirements of education or experience. *** Who Are The Clients? The inmates. They are also volunteers and must request an Alston Wilkes visitor before they are eligible for PVP. *** How Does The Program Operate? Prospective PVP volunteers attend a special training session where they are oriented to the program. A Department of Corrections official talks to the group and a volunteer visitor and his inmate friend tell about their match. The prospective volunteers are given a chance to ask questions. *** All inmates who request a PVP visitor are interviewed and screened prior-to being matched. Males always visit males and females always visit females. The specific needs of the inmate and the specific abilities of the volunteer are considered and a match is made. (Alston Wilkes Society Newsletter, Columbia, S.C.) 250 CORRECTIONS AND COMMUNITY Equal Justice Institute Introduction Confronted like everybody else with the problem of rising crime, 1 have, over the years, observed the steady erosion of our criminal just; ce system. During and after the 1968 presidential campaign when the slogan \"Law and Order\" started its confusing and confused career, I felt a sense of utter impotence in the face of the mounting rate of violence and crime. I became concerned restl ess, and finally ashamed of my sil ent and passive bystander role. When challenged by a wanting self-image, I resorted to the usual sim\u00ad plistic rationalization. What after all can the average person do in the face of a national crisis of such magnitude? Somehow, I instinctively rejected this easy way out and in time became convinced that any constructive plan conceived by anyone coul d induce others to share and improve on it. The fit'st task I assigned myself was to try to relate causes to Effects to find an opening for action. It thus became clear, from researching the mass of liter\u00ad ature, studies, reports, and recommendations developed since the publication of the president's report of 1967-68 that our administration of criminal justice is not only conceptua'(ly and functionally out of step but also that its con-' stantly rising wot'kload excludes a prior qualitative performance. This pre\u00ad liminary research also brought to light that the century-old attempts to streaml ine and modernize our system of corrections have never received -nor could they have for lack of sufficient information -the needed support of the general public. Ironically enough, most of the suggested but st'ill pending reforms originated from wi thin the institutions. Of course we need institutions to carry out the.burden of dispensing justice. But history and experience prove that institutions, when left to themselves, when not inspired, directed, and controlled are prone to become stale and self-serving. I became vividly conscious of the fact that we are burying our heads in the sand. We consider the offender to be an institu\u00ad tional problem and overlook that he comes from our ranks and return to us. It bec~me obvious to me that all efforts to reform our system of corrections are d~stined to fail unless and until reform starts by reforming the commun\u00ad ity. Reforming the cOfllnunity hinges on finding ways to change its perception and enroll its moral and material support to .deal with the problem. This 251 realization was the door opener for the formulation of a concept based on the following observations: 1. The public at large is unaware of the far-reaching issues involved in corrections and the untapp~d potential for active community involvement. 2. The offender's isoldtion in prison leads to his alienation fl'omsociety and undermines his functional ability when released. 3. Rehabilitation of the offender cannot be the function of prisons but is the responsibility of the community. Formulating a concept is the first requisite for any program. Trans\u00ad lating the concept from theory into practice serves the purpose of verifying the concept's feasibility and effectiveness. Thus the Equal Justice Institute(EJI) was born to structure and conduct two pilot projects destined to provide the participants with the needed in\u00ad formation on our present criminal justice system and initiate them into an active participatory role at the same time. This book has been developed to serve as an educational instrument and become .the blueprint for citizens' organizations based onthe findings of the two successful pilot projects. This book offers no magic formula. It is a message to my fellow citizens who share my feeling of impotence, when individually confronted with the mag\u00ad nitude of the problem. With our cumulative collective perception and efforts, we can reverse the worsening trend of events. Alexander F. Pathy 252 L~~ _________ _ EJ I 'S PROGRAM THE PILOT PROJECTS EJI researched, conceived, and structured a program destined to involve the community directly in ~e process of corrections. The basic concept con\u00ad sists in reestablishing communication with prisoners behind bars, to develop human relations with them while in prison, and to serve as their link with the community in the postreleaseperiod. The program places the volunteer in the center of the action and enables him to receive first-hand infor-na\u00ad tion of the issues involved and help end the offender's isolation and alien\u00ad ation from society. The functional aspects of the program, described in detail in Part II of this book, were tested by two pilot projects in two New York City institu\u00ad tions, namely, in the House of Detention for Men in Queens and in the New York City Correctional Institution for Women on Rikers Island. The pilot projects were planned for a period of 18 ~onths, from October 1972 to April 1974, with an additional phasing-out period of two months. Volunteers were recruited from a cross-section of the community. After adequate orientation one volunteer was assigned to one prisoner for a weekly one-hour visit in prison for a period covering an average of 10 to 12 consecutive visits, the last of these coinciding with the scheduled release of the prisoner. Detainees awaiting trial or sentencing, while often in need of assis\u00ad tance, are not included in the program because of the uncertainty of the dis\u00ad position of their case and the time and place ofthei~ultimate release. EJI's program is furthermore restricted to sentenced qdult prisoners scheduled for 1 iberation within a period of three to five months from 1he beginning of the visiting program. Forty volunteers participating in the two pilot projects serviced about loa prisoners. About halfof the volunteers stayed with the program from start to end and would have liked to continue had the experimental pilot projects not come to an end. All the volunteers who quit the program at any time did so for valid personnel reasons, such a transfer of their job to another city or pre.sure from work or stUdies. None of them left. before completing their visiting schedule. The program was also able to keep 253 trac!< of about half of the serviced inmates. To our knowledge two of the serviced inmates returned to prison. This apparent low recidivism rate is certainly unreliable and not intended to prove the program's statistical results. In uct. statistical achievement or success is not one of its ob\u00ad jectives. VOLUNTEERS' PERCEPTIONS Host of the pilot projects' volunteers had never been 'involved in prison\u00ad related activities, had never been in a prison, and had never met a prisoner. Most of the volunteers had at best a sketchy notion of the issues involved and sh\"lred someof the general prejudices relating to CI')nvicts and prison guards., As the pilot projects proceeded, volunteers soon realized that nei\u00ad ther prisoners nor their guards were basically different fromfuem, and once a reasonable level ,!f communication was established, they experienced no difficulty in relating to them as one human being to another. Most of the volunteers were Oipprehensive of their first contact with a prisoner and needed to be reassured of their own adequacy. Volunteers were given the choice of continuing their relationship with their serviced prisoner after their release or letting the staff take over post release relations and services. If they chose to continue to maintain relations with their re\u00ad leased inmates, they were advised preferably to meet \\1ith them in the staff's office or to keep the staff informed of the time and place of their meetings. In Part II of this book, recruiting, orientation, staff supervision, and guidance are amply described. So are the functional and procedural means and deVices used to observe, monitor, and register volunteers' per\u00ad ceptions. One of these devices to measure these perceptions at the end of each visiting period coinciding with the prisoner's release was to submit both, the volunteer and the prisoner separately, to a staff evaluation in\u00ad terview. We reproduce hereafter a few random answers by volunteers to the inter\u00ad viewer's question. Question: WHAT DID THE VISITS MEAN TO YOU? * \"The visits meant for me starting out with the feeling that I was 254 talking to a vacuum, and then coming around to a relationship of openness and trust.\" * III think they gave me a better understanding of something that did not comprehend before. I enjoyed talking to someone that I would never have met and I could understand what people like Robert go through.\" * \"Learning to deal with people, and finding out why or whether there are any special reasons why these people get in jail.\" * lilt was a chance to talk to somebody who came from a completely dif\u00ad ferent background and had compll?te1y different experiences. It helped me to beg'in to understand how to look at another person's problems in a different light. Someone who had grown up in a different community would look at things that I consider handicaps in a different way.\" * \"I felt mostly it was a chance to talk to someone who was lonely and didn't get much of a chance to talk to people, and who didn't have much in cOlll11on with the other prisoners.\" * \"Further understanding of prison life in a lot of subtleties, and learning of black and white relationships.\" ~ Question: WERE THERE ANY DISAPPOINTMENTS? * \"Yes -the Correction Department policies ana red tape.1I * IIDisappointment with the system and with the prisoners. The more I learned about the population and the guards, the more depressed I became. The way things are run in the system. Some of this is based on comments about other prisoners by I1\\Y inmate.\" * \"The only dispapointment is the uncertainty of learning the aftermath - is he going to be able to stay away from drugs. That was one of our main discussions -his using drugs and Where it got him.\" * \"No, I saw him as, an individual caught in a web.\" * \"1 would say it never makes you feel good to be not needed when you think that you are. One's feeling of powerlessness when you realize that there is not much you really can do to change people's lives. To see self\u00ad defeating attitudes in people is sad.\" * \"No, I don't think so. Frustration, sometimes, because I sometimes felt 111 equipped to deal with problems I had never experienced.\" * \"None, relating to him; but what shook me was to see to what lengths other human beings can go trying to make things hard for another person who has never done them any harm.\" 255 Question; DO YOU THINK THAT THE SEX, COLOR, OR NEIGHBORHOOD OF THE VOL - UNTEER WOULD MAKE A DIFFERENCE? * \"It was advantageous that I di d not come from the same soci oeconomi c background. He got a new rea,1ization of white people from me.\" * \"Yes, r have a feel ing that a volunteer from an economically better class. and who has had better advantages evokes a certain amount of cynicism. Color is a factor also, as Abigail said, there aren't many white people in prtson. This is proven if the inmate is black and the volunteer is white.\" * \"I think it Was easier for him to talk to a female, who was white. As far as education, his vocabulary, and way of expressing himself improved a lot. I don't think the neighborhood made that much difference. His enjoyment of my visits made an escape from prison.\" * \"Yes, definitely, all three would have made a difference, but not insurmountable. Sex was most important to JOhrl - a man would have gotten qUicker straight answers.\" * \"There was a misunderstanding at the beginning about the meaning of community, he thought I was going to be from his neighborhood in Queens -it took a little while to get over that. In time he came to my that the fact that I was white, female, and not from Queens did not matter -although it ~ could have. II _ * \"I don't know -some people think so -I think for a learning ex\u00ad perience the differences are good.fl Question: OlD YOU HAVE ANY DIFFICULTIES HI COMMUNICATING WITH THE INMATE? * \"Most definitely, yes. First, the language difference, vocabulary, sentence structure, intonation. Then completely different life experiences and backgrounds had to be continually translated.\" * \"After the first few times everything was fine. He was a talker and I am a 1isterner.\" * \"No, there was occasional difficulty with 1anguagE( but this was overcome in many ways. At times Cecilia was able to un6ut'den as much or more than any of the others.\" * \"No, not too much. Maybe I talked more. I did want to lift her feelings and play down her depressed feelings.\" * \"I did at first and it could have been me but I think it was his personality. Afterward I was glad because I felt that when he did open up it was more sincere.\" 256 Question: DO YOU THINK YOU HAVE A BETTER UNDERSTANDING Of PRiSON LIFE BECAUSE OF YOUR VISITS? * \"Yes, the boredom, the futility of falling into a t'outine, lack of decision making, I think he also felt a lack of rapport between himself and other inmates, and the total lack of psychological preparation for release,lI * \"I had a first-hand view of officer harassment, baiting, and repress\u00ad ive action on an inmate. On the other hand, there are some fine officers who maintain a humane attitude and are helpful to inmates. 'I * \"I do. He gave me a great deal of information about the daily life, he gave F.~ his schedule and I have no reason not to believe he was telling me the truth,\" * \"Yes, I do. Any amollnt of small details give one a greater under\u00adstanding. Also toward the end of visits he began telling me more of his perceptions of other inmates I did learn a lot and was very much struck by his perceptions.\" * \"Yes. Everybody should step into a prison and experience the separ- ,r ateness, ant! everyone should meet a prisoner to see the deadening effect prison has. on human beings. Rehabilitation in prison is a foolish idea that a lot of people beHeve in.\" * \"Yes, because she was a foreign-speaking person, she impressed me with the problems of foreign-speaking people, and older people in prison. I learned any chronic disease, any physical problem, makes it more diffi\u00ad cult in prison.\" Question: IN YOUR OPINION, WHAT IS THE ONE BEST FEATURE OF THIS PROGRAM? * \"It ga~\", me the opportunity to know him, a unique individual whom I probably would never have had the chance to know otherwise. I was also able to glimpse what it is like on the other side of the wall.\" * \"1 think it's the opportunity it gives us and the inmate to believe that someone does care that both parties can count on and look forward to.\" * \"The 1ink oetween outside world and sentenced prisoners, Incar\u00ad ceration should not meanlosing touch with the outside community, points of correction could still occur.\" * \"Communication. There are several Arnold Moodys in every prison, who are sensitive and aware, and given enough strength Will maintain their sanity,'\" * \"The interrelationship, interweaving of all the visits during the week; they meet each other and the other clients and other volunteers, a natural litt'ie fellowship -it didn't feel like an isolated situation for any of us.\" 257 * \"The fact that there are people in free society who care enough to take time to 'go and visit and that way you have two people who benefit.\" Question: WHAT WERE THE GOOD RESULTS OF THE PROGRAM FOR YOU? * \"Finding from him, as a first offender, fresh insights into prison life. Finding a natural relationship with a person I,~ho didn't have the 50cial problems of the major:ty of inmat,;;;s.\" * \"It was the fact that I was able to earn this man's trust and respect, h~.vi ng come from scratch.\" '\" \"I felt that it was re~larding to have this opportunity to develop person~' reiationships with someone who had a rough timein life. By visiting this p~:son, ~ was able to encourage hope for better things in the future.\" * \"Th':nking that maybe it makes me a little more human by seeing how someone el~e is human - I hope so. Someone like me who had a streak of bad ci rcumstanc,~s, whi ch if I had had mi ght have caused me to end up where he did.\" * \"To see how a man, faced with a great many handicaps over which he ha:! no control, can manage to keep going -as a result of strong character.\" e * \"That I had found new fr-iends; finding out that after a while the girls trusted me, that they we' ~ telling me ~hings they wouldn't tell other people.\" At one of the periodical volunteers' meetings, towa~'d the end of the pilot projects, volunteers wel'e asked to try to describe or l'edefine in their own words, based on their acquired eY,perience, the terms \"Volunteer\" and \"Prisoner\" and \"Volunteer-Prisoner Relationship.\" The individual contribu\u00ad tions of all participating volunteers led to the following general consen\u00ad sus in formulating as clo!\",~~y as poss'jble a r.ollective answer. WHO IS A VOLUNTEER? \"A concerned person outside the walls, a committed person, a person who wants to learn and be more aware, a person who shares experiences, has a direct relationship with another, has a sustained, con\u00ad sistent, nonprofessional relationship, is sensitive, emphatic.\" WHO IS A PRISONER? \"A person whQ!Jroke the law and got caught, gen\u00ad erally of low income, low educational level, often has unrealistic values and aims.\" 258 ._-------WHAT ARE THE GOALS OF THE INMATE VOLUNTEER RELATIONSHIP? \"Mut.;!/ trust, mutual insight, change of attitlJde to a more positive one. Inside~ outside communication, mutual respect (including for differences) a sense of worthwhile investment -'something in it for me' -new perceptions and perspectives, creation of the definition of the relationship (applicable after the inmate's release as well as during incarceration).\" As it will be seen in a following section called \"Volunteerism,\" EJI's structured program brought to the fore distinctive dormant personality development characteristics of its volunteers both in terms of their own growth and as proof of their fitness to discharge delicate and important community functions and responsibilities. PRISONERS' PERCEPTIONS Prisoners serviced by EJI's pilot projects can be said to have belonged to the same category of stereotype offenders found in U.S. prisons in gen\u00ad eral. ~Ihile the pilot projects werp. dealir.g with offenders sentenced to not more than one or two years in the two respettive prisons serviced, almost all of them were recidivists having previously been prosecuted or imprisoned in various state institutions. Also many were offenders whose offenses were reduced by plea bargaining. When given the opportunity to join EJI's program, prisoners were told only that a volunteer would visit them once a week on a one-to~one basis to di scuss thei r problems, with the purpose to work togethel' for a better community for all. Those who wanted to join the program w<>re asked to mark their inte~tion by signing a bilingual flyer distributed to them by the prison administration. Those who did sign the flyer were subsequently interviewed by the pro\u00ad gram director and requested to fill out a questionnaire related to their vital statistics, family relations, education, work and drug history. '(he first prisoners who joined the program would probably have joined any other program if for no other reason than to find out what personal ad\u00ad vantage they could derive from it. But very soon, as the program unfolded, this approach gave way to genuine cooperation and more often than not dev- 259 eloped into a meaningful and at times deep relationship. Prisoners realized that their volunteer was but another citizen, also having problems, receiving no compensatin and having no other motivation than to establish normal, friendly, and helpful ties with another, less fortunate citizen. What most impressed the visited prisoners was the continuity and stability of the pro\u00ad gram. As confidence between vOlunteers and prisoners grew, the relationship became a two-way street and sometimes volunteer and prisoner discussed the volunteer's problems rather than the other way al'ound. In one case the pri\u00ad soner confided after release that whenever his volunteer came for the weekly visit without pulling out his notebook, he understood that the volunteer wanted to talk about his own problems. Of the close to 100 prisoners serviced by the pilot projects, not one exp' dssed any desire or compulsion to stay in or return to prison. This would tend to contradict the theory that a number of recidivists return to prison by choice to benefit from its sheHered life. To the contrary, it became clear that the recurrent major concern of all serviced prisoners was how to hasten theil\" release. We reproduce, as in the case of volunteers, some of the prisoners' random representative answers to the evaluation in\u00ad terviews conducted by the staff at time of their release. Question: WHAT DID THE VISITS MEAN TO YOU? * \"I guess they gave me a practiq1l1 idea of how life would be after I left \"he institution. They were beneficial in that I got peace of mind and at the same time I had to face reality about when I left.\" * \"A great deal. The personal attention gave me a feeling of belonging. I didn't feel left out any more.\" * \"It means there was som'=one showing concern. Someone taking an interest.\" * \"That I really needed help when I got out. It used to make me feel good, those minutes that we used to talk.\" * \"It was a way of ollercoming an inner fear. Bernice made me aware that I ~~as hiding my secr'et self from myself. There were things that I always wanted to do but never did because I was afraid.\" 260 * \"I was able to discuss probH!ms that were on my mind that I was not able to discuss with others and it cleared up some dark spots. The volunteer suggested plans for getting a job.\" * \"It was a way of rl~lating and cOl11Tlunicating.\" Question: WERE THE VISITS JUST A BREAK IN THE PRISON ROUTINE OR DID THEY DO MORE? * \"It was having some person to talk about your perSQnal vie'lis and what you are trying to do.\" . * \"They were very helpful. I got from her how the outside was going and she got from me about the inside.\" * \"They did more -few visits from my family since February -only two times. Every week someone who cared came.\" * \"They did a lot more. There were a lot of things that came of the visits that I could not have done without.\" * \"They did more -they helped me to learn more about the various pro\u00ad grams available to inmates.\" * \"r~ore to me because I was having difficulty contacting my people and I was getting depressed.\" * \"It takes the pressure off your mind. There is the problem of what am I gonna do \\~hen I get out. By her calling these different places, it helped me decide what to do.\" Question: WHAT WERE THE GOOD RESULTS OF THE PROGRAM FOR YOU? * \"1 really don't know. I guess it gave me a feel ing that somebody cared. I found out that he doesn't get paid and I found out that there are good people in the world. If everyone would care, everything would be all right.\" * \"I got somebody that really did understand me.\" * \"It helped me understand myself better.\" * \"When I go out of here I have positive think'ing on not coming back here ~ EJI people set a pattern for me.\" * \"It was inspiration -it was knowing someone cares.\" * \"Being able to talk to somebody who is willing to listen and seems to understand -it helps to keep you going.\" 261 * \"Established renewed hope and confidence in the future. I was helped by advice, guidance, new friendship -someone listened to my needs,\" * \"It set up communication -it removed the barrier that was there iT my mind.\" Que~tion: WAS EJI ABLE TO HELP WITH A SPECIFIC PROBLEM? * \"Yes they got to the root and foundation of specific problems. They found information for me.\" * \"Mr. B, writing to the Board about my Conditional Release and then finding out about it and telling me - I still have not been told officially.\" * \"Yes. M. helped me a lot of times. I used to have trouble with speaking. She told me how to speak out.\" * \"When my mother di ed I was able to contact my family through EJ I and my wife was able to get my clothes from Mr. C.\" * \"She gave me advice about a lot of things. We talked about my job and how to keep out of trouble.\" * \"Yes, finding out and letting me know about my warrant and knowing what I was faced with. It made the bed easier to lie in.\" * \"The visiting helped me to do my time easier.\" * \"The most specific problem was what I would do when I left here and I got lots of help. I came toa rational solution because of t.he intelli\u00ad gence and help of EJI people.\" Questi on: THERE ANY DISAPPOINTMENTS? * \"No, I enjoyed them -they were something to look forward to - I am the type of person that is not able to talk to others about my problems, but she was easy to talk to.\" * \"No, only that you did not have a prison party while I was in the program -you had one two days after I got here and I was not in the program yet.\" * \"No only one, she went on vacation for two weeks and I didn't see her.\" * \"No, it was an outlet -it was someone I could confide in.\" * No, because Miss P. presented the program in such a beautiful way - she made me understand that it was up to both of us to try hard to make it work.\" 262 * \"No, except when she didn't come on time.\" Question: UP TO NOW, WOULD YOU SAY THAT THE EJI PROGRAM WAS ABOUT WHAT YOU EXPECTED, WAS ~IORE THAN YOU EXPECTED, OR LESS THAN YOU EXPECTED? * \"More, because I got a lot of thi ngs done that I tii dn' t look forward to having anyone deal with. I thought they would shift them to someone else, but EJI people did it themselves.\" * \"l tell you the truth, it was more. When I first went upstairs I felt it was just another program. It made me feel real good when I called up the other day and right away you knew who I was.\" * \"i~ore. There was cotmJunication and there was understanding~ II * \"H. was there to help someone that wanted to be helped. It can only be successful if you want it to be successful and you really try tv make it successful.\" * \"It was better than I expected. Any problem I could tell Miss B. and she would try to help.\" * \"110I'e. The fact of the counselors themselves -you don't expect someone that can cope with your problems, but they do.\" Que~tion: DO 'tOU THINK YOU WERE ABLE TO HELP THE VOLUNTEER TO,BETTER UNDER\u00ad STAND PRISON LIFE? * \"That was my main concern -to enlighten him as to what was really going on.\" * \"Yes, by eXllressing the operation of the system. What,the men are look'lng for from the administration and are not getting. what they sl10uld be getting. I had more access to information of all kinds because I was on the inmate council.\" * \"Yes. I told G. the things that really go on in here.\" '* \"Yes. B. is ,very interested and very concerned about what is,:goi,ng on in the prison. * \"Yes. What the prisoners are going tl:lrough. How prisoners cOflJnun\u00adicate with the other prisoners. I' , * \"We communicated -she knows lbout both sides of the fence.\" * \"Yes. By talking about how it feels to be in prison.\" 263 ... 'H * \"Yes. By talking about the.tllings that happen here and the fact of being isolated here.\" Question: IN YOUR OPINION, WHAT IS THE ONE BEST FEATURE ABOUT THIS PROGRAM? * \"If everybody would get somebody to talk before they leave jail, their mind would clear up and they would be better outside,\" * lilt seems as if all of it is good. It's good to have someone come to help with the outside. When I came here I was Y'eally upset and it helped my mind.\" * \"I think that it gives inner vision, willpower, and understanding. It makes you deal with what must be faced The program woke me up to real\u00ad ity. It makes you think ~nd deal ~lith self and that is the main thing you have to deal \\\\ith.\" * \"Communication. Communicating with someone from th~ outside, showing concern for the person in pri son, to take their' time out to ;:;ome and see and 1 isten.\" * \"Everybody in the program is for real and wiints to do something and _ is looking for a change. If the Correction Department wants to do a service, ~ they must change because now they are just adding oil to the fire.\" * \"I think that it is a beautiful thing to be able to get in touch with the outside world.\" Indicative of the impact of the community's presence inside the prison walls on prisoners' potentiC<.l motivation 01.\" remot'ivation were two \"parties\" t.eld in the Queens HOUSe! of Detention for Men with the participation of about 30 volunteers and as many prisoners, some ex-convicts, and the staff. Pri\u00ad soner's views on 1I1e value to them of such community involvement were tabu\u00ad lated by EJI's research director and summarized in a chart. The great major\u00ad ity of the participating prisoners recognized having gained new perspectives, felt their sense of self-worth and of personal effectiveness enhanced, PRISONS' ?ERCEPTIONS EJI's pilot projects' experience does not differ in substance from the findings'afthe abundant literature on prison conditions. Looked at from the outside, prisons are secure places for holding 264 ~ffenders. What happens to the offenders duri ng confinement is 1 eft to the so 1 e judgement of thei r keepers. The community, be it becaus(~ of its ,i gnor\" ance or indifference, expects released prisonersto become suddenly law\"abiding citizens and dOf!s nothing to pelp them in 1heir, struggle to survive. To the contrary, their chances of survival are seriously handicapped b~' restraining legislation and the cOlTAl1unityJ\u00b7s hostile attitude. Looked at from the inside, prisoners have to adjust and bend to prison life and more often than not look at their keepers with fear and hatred. In the reverse, custodial personnel use and abuse their unchecked authority in the discharge of their custodial functions and also, more often th~n not, live in cQnstant fear of their numerical inferiority and often treat their wards with contempt. They are jealous of their prer'ogatives o.nd resent out\u00ad side inter'ference or control. They apply prison rules with utter strict\u00ad ness for fear that prisoners would take advantage of any relaxing of such rules. While it is fortunate that, of late, courts are finally accepting to deal with prison conditions and prisoners' rights, it is submitted, based on EJI's pilot projects' findings, that meaningful changes in prison rules and especially prison practices can 'only be forced on prison administrations by massive and constant community pressure and control. EJI's pilot projects' continued attempts to alter or at least soften prison rules were met with variable success. When its efforts were rewarded by some favorable res,ponse from the upper hierarchy, they were often challenged by the lower echelon. When one warden made certain concessions, the succeeding warden backtracked. Nevertheless, and in balance, EJI's pilot projects' findings clearly demon\u00ad strate that even isolated community efforts can produce innovations and induce spme degree of genuine cooperation. We reproduce two messages addressed by two different wardens to two \"Prison Parties\" held in the Queens House of Detention for Men in June 1973 and March 1974. Warden's message to the June 1973 prison meeting: To: Concerned Citizen Participants, Sentenced Residents, and Former Residents: 265 Whether imprisonment has an extensive or limited future in a free society is dependent on a multitude of factors. What is important is that the penal system should not compound or aggra\u00ad vate the very problems that brought you here. The frustrati ons and cruel ti es of pri son 1 ife can i ntens i fy mental, physical, and emotional instabilities. The initial involvement of the Equal Justice Institute has been brought to fruition by this, your first\u00b7 combined meeting of volunteers, residents, ex-residents, and staff. An evaluation of tonight's meeting will in a larger part determine the futUre directions of the Equal Justice Institute. To move forward is a necessity; to move forward together is a require\u00ad ment. Good luck and good health. ALBERT GLICK Warden Warden's message to the March 1974 prison meeting: First, I would like to take this opportunity to extend to everybody participating in the Equal Justice Institue ProgY'am welcome to this meeting. It has been a source of good feeling to me and many members of my staff to be able to cooperate and be a part of a program of this nature. When I 5ilY \"program of this nature,\" let me explai.) what I mean by that, and the significance this type o'i' program has. Equal Justice is a \"program wherein a one-to-one relationship is esta\u00ad blished between a volunteer worker from the community and one of our resi\u00ad dents. The worker will visit the inmate on a continuing basis. This is good on the institutional level because it helps to raise the inmate's morale. It demonstrates that the community, through the volunteer worker, is inter\u00ad ested. In turn the inmate feels he is not \"cut off\" from the free world and that someone is interested in him. More importantly, the relationship once established continues upon the release of the offender to the cOllillunity, and it is here that the most val\u00ad uable part of the program comes into focus, on the ex-offender. There are many programs taking place in prisons throughout this country; some are good, some are better, some a waste of time. 266 Numerous inmates do well in prison programs, but most prison prOtf'llms end at the prison gate. Tbe failures take place in the commJnity even after the prison program proved successful. What good is there, if we success\u00ad fully educate or orientate an offender, if once in the community he cannot cope with and faces the same problems he did prior to his imprisonment. How\u00ad ever if, as in the Equal Justice program, a released offender has a friend in the conmunity, someone he can rely on, someone he can trust, who knew him, knows his abilities, his weakness~s, his preferences, someone who cares, then we have more than just a program. We now have a relationship that can be used to full advantage to try to prevent a relapse. As a Warden of an institution, I feel that the wave of future is before us, I feel that programs have to be more than just prison based, t.hat the community and all its resources must be brought to bear on the common problem. I feel that a program like Equal Justice can succeed because it is a pro\u00ad gram of personal relationships that cuts across all technical and profession\u00ad al lines. People make the program and this is the special. ingredient in the Equal Justice program. In conclusion I wish all of you good luck, especially those of you now incarcerated. ARTHUR RUBIN Warden To illustrate lower\u00b7 prison echelon~ almost fanatic and absurd adherence to prison rules, we produce pertinent extracts from a EJI letter to the war\u00ad den of Queens House of Detention for Men dated January 5, 1973. Prison wardens' authority can be compared ~o a ship captain'~ on the high seas. Because of the power vested inthem, d warden's personality de\u00ad termines his management philosophy. This was vividly demonstrated during the relatively short lifetime of EJI's Queens pilot project when no less than five wardens were successively in command of the institution. Breaking through strict prison rules and practices, exploring new avenues or granting any privilege are conceivable only at the warden's lev~1. Even at that level a privilege granted by a predecessor is subject to review by a new w~rden. A case in point.was an experimental privilege granted by one warden for 267 Christmas contact visits of our serviced inmates with their closest rela\u00ad tives. Although this was a bold innovation in New York City institutions, and which was supervise~ by our volunteers instead of prison guards, there was no objective reas~n for a,new warden to refuse the same privilege the next holiday season. Whatever' the success or failure rate of EJI's efforts to humanize pri\u00ad son life, the program had a favorable effect on the general atmosphere of the prison. The last warden in command and anumber of his ~taff members expressed concern and regret when the experimental project ended. The acceptance of EJI's program by the prison ~aff was an uphill undertaking and no signs of approval and cooperation were visible in the early stages of the pilot projects. To enroll theprison.staff's under\u00ad standing and goodwill, EJI conducted two meetings with two different groups of officers. At the first meeting a month after the start of the Queens pilot project, participating prison staff members listened politely to EJI's staff without expressing any personal views. The second conference, si x months _ later, showed signs of improvement to the extent that the prison staff offi-,..., cers spoke out freely and uninhibitedly. In this way, EJI gained insight into their feelings and philosophy. In an effort to establish greater cooperation, EJI also invited several correction officers to different volunteers' meetings, which gave them an opportunity to better size up the program's functional objectives and dis\u00ad cuss matters of common interest with volunteers and staff. Prison staff members were asked to cooperate in organizing two VOlunteer/inmate mass meetings in prison that we have already mentioned. They did so with apparent enthusiasm. As the project unfolded, most of the officers cooper\u00ad ated with the program's resident coordinator. 268 VOLUNTEERISM Volunteerism is by no means a new concept in the administration of criminal justice. Volunte\u00a3lrs.are used with excellent results to help unburden overloaded profe~sionals. An example is the VIP organization that provides volunteers to assist probation and parole officers. The one-to\u00ad one approach for prison visitation is practiced, if only sporadically, in some communities. In Bucks County, Pennsylvania, for example, community volunteers have visited county jails for many years. Volunteers in the correction system perform auxiliary tasks without being integrated into the mainstream of\u00b7corrections. EJI's program is de\u00ad signed to develop volunteers' perceptions and prepare them for active creative and independent tasks in the corrections process. EJI's program reverses the roles of the professional and the auxiliary in~e sense that the volunteer becomes the field operator while the professional stays in the background to provide guidance and supervision. The volunteer, as the community's representative, crosses the prison wall to establish meaning\u00ad ful and lasting relations with one of the resident offenders. The volun\u00ad teer's working tools are his natural human resources, rnostneeded by the offender to regain his self-esteem and lose his frustrating and paralyzing feeling of rejection. The volunteer acquires first-hand knowledge of prison conditions and prison life. He observes the various shortcomings of the process of punishment and prevailing legislation, and understands the fal\u00ad lacy of the concept of rehabilitation in prison. Most importantly, he realizes the negative attitude of the co~\u00aeunity. EJI's program keeps its protective umbrella over the offender during his last period of confinement and extends its assistance to the released offender. But as long as the community remains fearful. hostile, and noncooperative, the benefit derived by a released offender from EJI's or any other program remains an isolated action lost.in a giant vacuum. Sporadic beneficial results are not enough to justify the dedicated efforts of a few citizens, nor can they create the driving force necessary for a meaningful change in our system of cor\u00ad rections as a prerequisite condition to try to control crime. EJI's progra~ if carried out by a sufficient number of local organizations allover the country, could produce the desired snowballing impulse for community action. 269 ORGANIZATIONAL STAGE FUNCTIONAL SETUP There are no prescribed rules for efficiently running a successor organization. The structural setup might be determined by the size of the organization, its financial ability, and other local factors. As a rule of thumb, no successor organization should function with less than 10 and no more than 25 visiting volunteers. It should also have a few back-up volunteers in reserve to replace visiting volunteers or to per\u00ad form social services for prisoners. Corporate status is required by law to have a board of dirertors. This board can delegate its power to an executive committee or to one of its members. It is also recommended that an advisory board be composed of one or more members of the board and of the staff to decide on ut'gent matters and on questions of policy. EJI's Advisory Board held regular weekly meet\u00ad ings with an agenda prepared by the staff. Its decisions were recorded for ready reference and follow up. RECRUITING OF VOLUNTEERS AND THEIR DUTIES There are a number of ways to recruit volunteers frQmte community. The initial survey will have led the sponsors to establish the areas in which their recruiting efforts will concentrate. In FJI's concept, prison-visiting volunteers should belong to a cross-section of the community, without need for any special credentials and regardless of the volunteer's age, educa\u00ad tional or professional background, sex, C010l', creed, or political affilia\u00ad tion. All volunteers have to be carefully screened as to their motivation and stability. It is recommended that the recruitment 'of volunteers start in local church congregations because of their moral standing in the community. No religious undertone should, however, be injected into the volunteer's function. Presentation of the progr~m can take a variety of forms. EJI's pilot projectst~ro~J\\'am vias 'introd(jced to church congregations after services or in lieu of ~ermon or submitt?d to the board or session of different churches. 270 ....... \"' ... ~ program was also discussed at religious or political meetings or clubs. Recruiting volunteers has also been tested by way of distributing fly\u00ad ers at group meetings and finally by selective mailings. Volunteers have to pledge to follow the program's rules in terms of prison visits and written reports. Volunteers are not required to perform any other function than regularly visiting their assigned prisoner and wr<ting promptly their visiting report. Prisoners' requests are followed up by the social services of the program, unless the volunteer expresses the wish to take care personally of the prisoner's requests. In such cases, however, the volunt~er first has to obtain cEarance from the head office, which has to be kept informed of the volunteer's progress. Volunteers ara not required to continue their relations with released prisoners unless they so desire. All after-release activities are to be performed by the program's ~ocial services. Those volunteers who \\~ant to continue to relate to the released prisoners are advised to use the office for their meetings with ex-prisoners. Volunteers are advised not to let themselves be carried away in their relations with their serviced prisoners. EJI pl'ovides volunteers' guideli'1es to deal in detail with this aspect of the volunteer-prisoner relationship. ORIENTATION OF VOLUNTEERS Volunteers for EJI's program coming from a cross-section of the com\u00ad munity have, in general, limited knowledge about prison, prisoners. and the function of the ~riminal justice system. Most have never been in a prison or met a prisoner. Because prisoners are isolated from free society, EJI's basic concept rests on the cOllll1unity's responsibility to establish permanent cOllll1ull\"lcation with imprisoned wrongdoers. It was first assumed and then verified by EJI's pilot project that the establishment of permanent links benefits in\u00ad mates. volunteers, prison personnel, and all parts of the large cOllll1unity. No attempt is made by EJI's program to \"train\" its volunteers to be\u00ad co~ professionals. To the contrary, it is part of EJI's basic concept to 271 preserve each volunteer's self-expression and personality. To conform to this notion, EJI's program of training volunteers is limited to educating them about prisons, prisoners, and prison life. This training-orientation consists of a few group sessions prior to visiting prisoners and by continuing this process of education during their visiting period. In the previsitinq orientation sessions, volunteers receive comprehen\u00ad sive briefing on the goals and objectives of the program and are given the opportunity to ask questions, discuss answers, and dispell frequent doubts and fears of inadequacy. During this stage, volunteers are given relevant reading material, including guidelines developed by EJI as well as a copy of the rules and regulations of the prison to be visited. Before starting their visits, volunteers are taken on an extensive tour of the prison they will serve. Possibly the warden or his deputy should con\u00ad duct the tour. There is no rule as to the number of orientation sessions to be held. Two or three orientation meetings and one prison visit should normally be the orientation target. SOCIAL SERVICES AND SOCIAL SERVICES REFERRAL EJI's concept, based primarily on \"communication,\" recognizes that people cannot be separated from their problems. It is therefore part of the volunteer's function to help in solving the prisoner's problems without becoming his keeper or advocate. It has been EJI's pilot projects' repeated experience that simply listening by the volunteer to the prisoner's problems helps relieve tension and a frustrating feeling of impotence. No single small organization can respond to all possible needs and requests of prisoners during their confinement and after their release. But a small organization can build and maintain channels of co~nunication to other specialized, public or private agencies or institutions to perform services beyondits own resources. Social services to be performed for prisoners during their confinement and after release can range from a simple request for a telephone call to 272 family members, to helping in the intricate procedure for applying for parole, to finding educational or job training opportunities, shelter. health or drug treatment facilities after release, etc. In EJI's program the volunteer is not asked to personally pel\"form any of the inmate's reque~Ls. In practice many volunteers prefer to tend to some of the inmates' requests to the point that they sometimes have to be restrained .. All prisoners' requests and volunteers' recommendations are recorded by the volunteer on the second page .of the visiting report. These requests are immediately entered chronologically into a speicia J social services book divided into two columns. One of the two columns lists requests of a routine nature that present no special problem. The second column registers requests requiring policy decisions. In both cases, the pri50ner is informed. possibly by the next visit of the volunteer, about the disposition of the request. VOLUNTEERS' PRISON VISITS In most penal institutions, visitors are not allowed contact visits. Visits t.ake place under guard super-vision, visitors and inmates are separ\u00ad ated by a glass shield. They can only communicate with each other by tele\u00ad phone. In principle, only lawyers and clergy have contact-visit privileges. EJI's prison visiting concept is based on unsupervised contact visits. In both instH .. ,'tions where EJI has conducted its pilot projects, ar\u00ad rangements were made with the prison warden for granting the privilege of contact visits conducted either in the lawyers' booths or in appr'opriate open spaces such as t.he prison's library. Because most of EJI's volunteers are working people, visits were scheduled at different times during the day or the evening, including week-ends, to fit the convenience of volunteers, prisoners, and prison administration. During their orientation period, volunteers were briefed on prison rules and directed to observe them strictly. It is made clear to the volunteers that even insignificant deviation fromfue rules might produce seri~us con\u00ad sequences and alienate the goodwill of the prison administration. Appendix J contains the job descriptions of. the resident coordinator. The presence of this staff member in prison during all visits of volunteers 273 wi til pri soners is a great help and comfort to the volunteers and very often to the prisoners. The resident coordinator meets the volunteer~ at their al'rival at the prison and escorts them to their meeting place ~ith the pri\u00ad soner and remains available for advice, information, help, or assistance. He escorts the volunteers to the prison gate at the end of the visiting period. The resident coordinator writes a weekly report dealing with the visits and important happenings in prison during the period covered by the report. OPERATIONAL STAGE SCREENING OF PRISONERS Any prisoner scheduled for release within a period of three to five months from the start of visiting qualifies for the program, which is always optional for the prisoner. Either the resident or the volunteer coordinator should, as was the case with EJJ's pilot projects, be given access by the prison administra\u00ad tion to the inmates' files to extract from them all available vital statis\u00ad tics. The information thus collected is handled confidentially and not re\u00ad leased to the volunteer. Recruitment of prisoners is made by distributing among those to be re\u00ad leased within three to five months a flyer giving a summary description of the program. Prisoners-desiring to join the program return their flyer with their signature. The program director or coordinator interviews all applicants, in groups or individually, to explain the program in greater detail and ttl get an impression of the candidate for matching him or her with a volunteer. At the conclusion of this interview, the prisoner is asked to answer a written questionnaire about his or her family relations, schooling, skills, etc. 274 L-________ -.J VISITING SCHEDULES Volunteers, inmates, and the prison administration have to know about and agree in advance to the schedule of each planned visit. It is recolll11end\u00ad ed that volunteers keep to the same schedule throughout their service to an inmate. Both volunteer and prisoner will. in principle. expect to meet every ~ieek, on the same day, and at the same hour. Neither has to be advi sed un\u00ad less one or the other, for some valid reason, cannot keep to the schedule. It is the function and the responsibility of the volunteer coordinator to prepare a weekly schedul e one week in advance. The ~Ieekly schedule is sent to the prison administration in writing. The volunteer unable to keep a scheduled visit has to advise the volunteer coordinator or headquarters if a prisoner is unable to keep to schedule. One of the functions of the resident coordinator is to occasionally replace a visiting volunteer unable to keep to the schedule. VOLUNTEERS' VISITING REPORTS One of the important features of EJI's prison visiting program, dis\u00ad tinctive 1r::.:n other known prison programs, is a comprehensive visiting report written by each volunteer after each weekly visit. The primary ob\u00ad jective of the report is to create a permanent record of the developing relationship between volunteer and prisoner, permitting the staff to follow up, evaluate, and provide guidance when needed. The report, written illl11e\u00ad diately after the visit and promptly mailed to headquarters, helps the vol\u00ad unteer to recollect and formulate information ?nd impressions gathered during the visit, to list the prisoner's requests, and to make person,l1 sugges\u00ad tions. Whatever the prisoner's requests are, reasonable or not, it is most important that the followup and disposition of the request be made known to the volunteer and by the volunteer to the prisoner as soon as practicable and if possible by the next weekly visit. In the early stage of the visiting process, the volunteer informs the prisoner of the existence 0f the visiting report, which is handled confi\u00ad dentially by the staff. Each report when received by headquarters is coded and the names of the volunteer and the prisoner are blocked out. The prisoner is also informed that whatever is confidential is not going 275 -------------------------------------------------------------- --to be made part of the report. The volunteer's report is divided into two parts. The first serves to list topics discussed, statements and the state of mind of the prisoner, and finally the volunteer's impressions and perceptions. The second part deals with the pri soner' s Y'equests and states the volunteer's suggesti ons and reccmmendations. When the volunteer has established working relations w'ith the prisoner, usually after the first two or three visits, the volunteer is asked to fill out, with the help of the prisoner, a \"social service\" questionnah'e designed to gather useful first-hand information about the prisoner's family relations, educational background, skills, job history, drug history, and after-release needs and plans. The volunteer explains to the prisoner that th~ informa\u00ad tion requested serves the sole purpose to be helpful to him or her and that he or she is free to answer any part of it. VOLUNTEERS' MEETmGS Volunteers working on a one-to-one basis with prisoners have different experi ences, probl ems, frustl'ationc, fail ures, or successes. Shari ng these different impressions and reactions is of great benefit to all volunteers and to the staff. Regular periodical, possibly monthly, volunteers' meetings with the participation of the staff are the best occasions for exchanging infolwation and for discussing general and specific problems. These meetings also offer the best occasion for professional lectures On various aspects of the criminal justice system in operation. At a more advanced stage of a successor organization project, it is recommended that ex-convicts serviced by the project and from time to time a correction officer of the serviced prison should attend and participate in discussions at the regular monthly meetings. This was the case with EvI's pilot projects. Periodieal volunteers' meetings as well as individual briefing of volunteers, when requested by a v01unteer or when initiated by the staff, represent the ongoing orientation of volunteers. 276 ----~---------------------.--------------------------------.----------PERFORMANCE EVALUATION OF PRISONERS AND VOLUNTEERS TO~/ard the end of the period of confinement a member of the staff, preferably the social services coordinator, conducts a performance evaluation interview with the prisoner to be released, recording verbatim the answers received. Its objective is to measure the program's impact on the prisoner, to evaluate the relationship between prisoner and volunteer, and to ask the prisoner for suggestions for improving the program. After release of the interviewed prisoner, the volunteer is also inter\u00ad Viewed by a staff member to verify the program's impact on the volunteer- and evaluate the relationship built during the visitation period between the volunteer and the prisoner. The superposition of the two final performance evaluation reports permits the staff to draw pertinent conclusions. The performance evaluation interview reports remain intlle prisoner5' and volunteers' files for future reference. PRISON 14EETINGS OF VOLUNTEER AND PRISONERS The one-to-one relationship is at thg base of EJI's concept of commun\u00ad ication between free and captive society. Conducting from time to time meetings in prison between groups of volunteers and prisoners enlarges the scope of communication and represents a significant step toward greater cOImlunity presence and impact in prison. Within a period of eight months EJI organized two such meetings with the participation of about 15 vOlunteers each, as many prisoners, a couple of ex-prisoners, and the staff. These meetings took the form of informa~ social gatherings between citizens on\\;)pposite sides of prison walls to discuss matters of cOlTl!llon interest and exchange impressions and suggestions. The parties were held in the prison officers' dining room, decorated for the occasion, and refreshments were provided by the prison administration. In both cases the warden sent a welcoming and appreciative message while the meetings we)'e in progress. The participants were informally seated at 277 three conference tables, the prisoners assuming the role of hosts. The prison meetings were preceded by written invitations sent to prisoners and volunteers requesting suggestions for discussion at the sche\u00ad euled meeting. All participdnts \\~ere also asked for their written im\u00ad pressions and evaluation of the meetings. A special newsletter, repro\u00ad ducing verbatim all the unedited corrnnunications received, was thereafter distributed to all participants. It is reco~nended that successor pro\u00ad jects hold similar meetings as frequently as practicable. MEETINGS OF E,l!' S STAFF WITH CORRECTIONAL STAFF . Starting from the premise that communication between free and captive society is the first and utmost basic necessity to pave the way to community\u00ad based corrections, it is evident that weighty consideration has to be given to the role and status of the custodian or correctional personnel positioned as a kind of third society between free and captive society. Correction personnel are the free citizens who discharge their functions inside prisons. They derive their authority from and are paid by the free society. In theory they are the natural link between free and captive society, but in practice they are the impenetrable iron curtain dividing and isolating one society from the other. Traditionally they are opposed and even hostile to any outside communication with their wards. It is also part af \u00b7EJI's program to extend its efforts of corrmunication to the correction personnel. To achieve this goal it is important to acquaint prison personnel in general, and involved correction officers in particular, with the program. At. different occasions members of the prison staff were invited to the volunteers' monthly meetings and were given the opportunity to participate in the discussions and answer questions from volunteers. EJI's chairman and program director periodically visited the institutions served by its pilot projects to discuss with the wardens and their staff matters of common interest. 278 POSTRELEASE FUNCTIONS The final objective of EJI's program is to induce the community to help the released prisoner stay out of trouble and adhere to social standards and rules. EJI's efforts start with the establishment of simple communication with the prisoner and lead to progressive building up of relations and reci\u00ad procal understanding of realities. All possible and necessary planning of the after-release period is to begin ;n time to become operative when the prisoner i~ released. When released, the prisoner is encouraged to remain with the program, ask for advice and assistance, and when leaving the com\u00ad munity, either voluntarily or for other reasons, to remain in contact with the program. If the prisoner is released on parole, contact for the purpose of cooperation is made with the parole officer. Possible activities of the prisoner to be released are in principle varied and numerous, actual opportunities are very much iacking. Prevailing community reluctance to employ ex-convicts, compounded by restrictive em\u00ad ployment legislation, is certainly the greatest obstacle to successful re\u00ad habi 1 itation. While it is true that most released prisoners confronted with the shock period following confinement are not immediately ready for steady employ\u00ad ment, the mere knowledge of their employment handicaps produces increased insecurity and anxiety. Released prisoners are induced not to disclose their criminal record. Discharge from employment often happens when their prison background is discovered. Here is the most striking example of the necessity for the community to understand the root of the problem and its remedy. Only the community can generate the necessary pressure to change restrictive emp'!oyment legis- 1 ation, and provide wor/( oppoi'tunities for released pri soners. NEWSLETTERS, SOUVENIRS, GIFTS, AND CERTIFICATES OF ACKNOWLEDGMENT A periodical newsletter circulated among all those involved in the program is a useful tool for expanding comwunication and creating a spirit of emulation and cooperatioll. EJI's pilot projects published a monthly 279 newsl e:tter in which staff members, vol unteers, prisoners, ex-pri soners, and professionals contributed articles, poems, personal experiences, statis\u00ad tics, and suggestions. Each issue commented on the events of the previous month and on the events planned for the following month. After one of the two prison parties held between volunteers and pri~ soners, a special newsletter reproduc,!d the unedited comments of e'lch I'ar\u00ad ticipant. At the first of the two pY'ison meetings, with the permission of the warden and after obtaining written waivers from all participating pri\u00ad soners, a great number of photos taken by one of the volunteers were assem\u00ad bled in a souvenir folder, a copy of which was presented to each participant. At Christmas time a token present was given to each serviced prisoner. The present itself was of lesser importance than its presentation in taste\u00ad ful wrapping accompanied by a warm greeting card. Because of the str'lct pri\u00ad son rules prohibiting introduction into the prison of any uncensored package, special permission was asked from and granted by two different wardens at two Christmas seasons to avoid censoring the gift packages. EJI, to obtain this privilege, took upon itself to proceed with the wrapping of the gifts under its staff supervision and responsibility. A certificate of public service acknowledgment was presented to each visiting volunteer having served for a period of a year. Similar certifi\u00ad cates were also delivered to lecturers, correctional personnel, and ex\u00ad prisoners having actively contributed to the program. The certificates for the volunteers were presented to them at a dinner ceremony to which present and former prison wardens and captains and their representatives, volun~ teers' husbands or wives, and special friends of the institute were invited as guests. PUBLIC RELATIONS AND FUND RAISING Public relations and fund raising are the responsibility and function of the project's management, which can delegate these functions to a vol\u00ad unteer public relations coordinator. Any successor organization should in the early organizational stage develop a basic flyer with a motto or logo describing the program and solicitating moral and material support. EJI's pilot projects used such a basic flyer. They also used special flyers to 280 recruit prisoners for the program. EJI's pilot projects avoided using political contacts and stayed away from all publicity, as a matter of policy. EJI's position in not claiming or accepting any preferential treatment was prompted by its intention to meet the same difficulties and obstacles any future successor organization would be confronted with and use its own limited resources for solving prob\u00ad lems. We do not recommend this same policy to successor organizations. On the contrary, we suggest that contact be made with local political leaders, church managements, educational and charitable institutions, etc., for the purpose of stirrin'il up tr,e maximuhl interest and support. We also recommend the use of press release!; and press i ntel\"vi ews in 1 oca 1 pub 1 i cati ons, in church reports and newsletters, and all other means to improve public aware\u00ad ness and induce community participation. Also as a matter of policy, EJI did not solicit public funding in order to retain its complete independence and maximum flexibility for its two pilot projects. EJI's private fund-raising efforts resulted in almost total failure. While agreeing with the program's objectives, none of the many foundations, banks, o'r corporations, or for that matter churches, solicited expressed willingness go make fina.ncial contributions to an experimental project. EJI's financial needs were covered by the pledges of its original founders. 281 HELPING THE EX-OFFENDER -CLEVELAND, OHIO AFL-CIO/NCCD Recognizing the need to help men and women who have been involved in the criminal justice system, Cleveland's United Labor Agency estab\u00ad lished the Leo Per1is Remotivation Center. The Center's function is to counsel ex-offenders, to train them in marketable ski11s, and then to help them find good jobs. But recognizing the connection between poverty and crime, the Center also wisely assists Clevelanders whose income is below the poverty level. It seeks to forestall the tendency to break the law out of economic necessity. Among the Center's clients are ex-offenders, probationers, parolees, fur10ughees, pretrial-diversion candidates, and juvenile delinquents. In addition to counseling them -vital for those who have family problems or drug or alcohol problems -it trains them for such jobs as auto mechanics, building maintenancemen, meat cutters, optical workers, shoe repairmen, office machine repairmen, and salesmen. The Center has not yet been open a full year. But it has already served more than 900 persons, dramatic testimony to the need for its services. More Clevelanders have been applying to the Center than could be readily served, and the Center has been seeking to expand its progi'am to fill the obvious need. In the short time the Per1is Center has been functioning, it has won cooperation and acceptance from the city and state governments and from industry. Indicative of its support by C'leveland's business comn:unity is the recent gift to the Center of a building by the Cleveland Trust Company. The structure, formerly a branch office of the bank, win be remodel ed at a cost of more than a half a mi 11 i on doll ars to provi de comprehensive restaurant and food management training. When completed it not only will be a needed training program but may function as a restau\u00ad rant open to the public. The Perlis Center has been operating on funds provided ny the Com\u00ad prehensive Employment and Tra'inin'g Act (CETA), Social Security Act Title XX, and the Law Enforcement Assistance Adminis;tration. The Center's officials expect it to be virtually self-supporting within three to five years. 282 283 \\~OMEN IN PRISON WOMEN'S PRISON ASSOCIATION AND HO~'E Zelma A. Henriques, M.S.~1. Project Di rector The Children of Offenders Project is one of several programs adminis\u00ad tered by the Women's Prison Association, a non-p~ofit, publicly supported organization which was founded over 125 years ago to serve women who come into conflict with the law. Recognizing a woman's role as mother repre\u00ad sents a considerable segment of the Agency's services. This three-year experimental and research program for the children of female offenders has as its objectives to determine the effects of a mother's delinquency and incarceration on a child's development and to find improved ways of interrupting the cycle of neglect and delinquency. Financed by the Vincent Astor, {the Nathan) Hofheimer and Ittlesom Family Foundations, the Children of Offenders Project has proceeded in its aim to prov; de comprehens i ve servi ces whil e exami ni ng the spec~a 1 pl'Ob 1 ems of children arising from the mother's delinquency and her complicated legal and social situation. Hhile working with other public and private agencies in the helping process, the project found great gaps in the City's network of services, but al so lack of knowl edge on the part of parents and guardians on how to reach the resources that do exist. The previous report on the fJr~t phase of the project focused on women offenders connected with the Isaac Hopper Home, the residence of the Women's Prison Association. They were women who had been convicted; had served all or part of thei r sentences; and were in the communi ty, either 1 i ving in the Home or connected with it for more services. This report concentrates on female offenders still incarcerated, most of the,) from the Women's House of Detention on Riker's Island, Ne'<'/ 'York State's Bedford Hills Correctional Facility, as well as Alderson Federal Reformatory.in W~st Virginia. 284 _. ------------ SERVICES TO CHILDREN Visits with children in their homes are mostimportant since through such contacts, the home situation and living.arrangements of these chil\u00ad dren can be evaluated. In addition, home visits enable project staff to make general assessments regarding family relationships. In a number of situations, counseling relationships have been established with families where the need has been found to exist. On-going contact has been established with schools. Project staff has met with principals, teachers, guidance counselors and other school per\u00ad sonnel in an effort to obtain information on how children are progl'essing. In a number of situations, we have been able to provide information re\u00ad garding some of the problems that confront children in their homes. As a result, supportive he1p has been made available by the school. We are usually notified regarding actions that will be taken in advance of t'.eir occurrence because of the relationship that has been established with schools. We have, therefore, been able, in a number of situations\" to bring together parents, guardians, children and school personnel around difficult problems, enabling and suggesting more feasible and satisfactory solutions. By conferring with school authorities, I'le have been able to request deferment of school suspensions while attempting in lheinterim to see that the situation improved. We have, through the use of the program's psychiatric consultant, obtained appropriate advice and direction on matters pertaining to a child's need for psychological and psychiatric evaluation and therapy. It has been necessary for us to work closely with the Bureau of Child Welfare as well as agencies under contract to the Bureau for the provision of supervision and care to children in placement. Because of our on-going contact and involvement with many mothers, we have been able to provide useful and necessary information to agencies. We have also served as the link between agency, mother and children in instances where mothers are incarcer,atcd and her children are in placement, and in instances, where mothers have been present in the cOlllT1unity and needed help in establishing contact with an agency and with her children. 285 We have been able to obtain information which clarified for mothers the fact that they still retained legal custody of their children in instances where children were in the temporary custody of agencies during the period of their incarcer~tion. Information has been made available to mothers regarding their legal rights as well as the legal course of action that they must pursue in matters relating to custody. Often, mothers who come to our residence following their release from Alderson Federal Reformatory, West Virginia, have described situations in which they were asked to sign forms relative to their children. They have stated that in a number of instances, they refused to sign such forms but were fearful that the authorities had nevertheless proceeded to insti\u00ad tute action to take their children from them. In such cases, we have con\u00ad tacted the Bureau of Child Welfare and have been able to clarify for mothers the fact that they still retain custody of their children. We have arranged fOI' mother, children, and agency representative to meet and discuss issues relating to custody. Such meetings have resulted in the establishment of working relationships between mothers and child caring agencies as well as reunions between mothers and children. Contacts have been made with hospitals, clinics, and other medical facilities in an effort to determine and verify whether children are in receipt of medical care. In cases where such care has not been sought, we have made appropriate referrals. The following figures indicate the number of physical contacts with and on behalf of children included in this project. Telephone contacts are not included in these statistics. Interviews with mothers Interviews with children Home visits Agency visits Visits to court Visits to schools Visits to Health facility Counseling relationships established 286 273* 150 124 65 15 28 72 NOTE: *Tcital number of mothers interviewed is 116. However, in some instances it has been necessary for a number of interviews to be held with a mother before complete information was obtained. In other instances, more than one interview was necessary as problems developed. CONTACT WITH CHILD LOST AFTER MOTHER'S ARREST Linda T.: B/C 1/25/65 Ida L., Mother, at N.Y.C.C.F.W. Rikers Island On may 24,1972, Ida L. (also knows as Dorothy T.), a res.ident at the Women's House of Detention, Rikers Island, requested of us that we obtain a current address for her daughter. She informed us that she last saw the child three years ago at the home of Mrs. F. (We 1 ater found thi s to be an incorrect name), who lived in the Bronx and was receiving public assistance. Miss L. stated that she wished to find the child and to put her in the care of Linda's maternal grandmother who livesin Atlanta, Georgia. Miss L. indicated that she planned to return to Atlanta when she was released from prison. Based on our i nformati on about the 1 ast known address of r~rs. F., we contacted the five appropriate welfare centers, none of which had any record of either the child or the woman. A call to the central office of the Bureau of Public Assistance elicited the information that their records are not availble to us. A letter sent requesting information was not answered. \\~e \\~ere able to verify the fact that Linda was cared for at Morrisania Hospital after birth. A letter to the hospital brought us the information that Miss L. had been referred to the Tremont Health Station for further care for Linda. Tremont had no record and referred us to MottHaven which also had no record. A letter to the Child Health Bureau of Records brought no reply. We requested a forwarding address from the local post office. We were told that they have no current listing and that they usually destroy these re\u00ad cords after three years. We called appropriate listings in the telephone 287 directory, but this was unsuccessful. Meanwhile, since Linda was of school age, we were attempting to trace the chil d through the Board of Educ~ti on. The Board has no central 1 i sti ng of all pupils. They did, however, give us the locations and principals' names of all appropriate schools. We contacted the principals of ten schools. Most of them informed us immediately that Linda was not listed. Several asked that we write for information. One principal stated that Board of Education regulations prohibited his giving information to any but a public agency. We asked a worker from the House of Detention to request the information.' None of these letters was anS\\1el'ed. A member of the Police Department with whom we had had previous contact checked to see if we could report this case as a missing person or a kid\u00ad napping. We were told that we could not. We were referred to a member of the Special Investigation Section who had access to the files of the Bureau of Public Assistance. Linda and Mrs. F. were not listed. We wrote to the director of the Office of Review and asked to be listed as an agency to whom the resources of the Special Investigation Section and the Bureau of Public Assistance would be available. We were told that this would be illegal; all requests must go through the Police Department. Sirt;e it seemed possible that Linda might be listed with the Bureau of Child Welfare, we contacted the Bronx office of the Bureau of Child Welfare. They had no record. The Central Registry of the Bureau of Child Welfare had no record. The Division of Inter-Agency Relations of the Bureau of Child Welfare had no record, but it was suggested that \\~e re-contact them after we had verified the facts on Linda's birth certi\u00ad ficate. We had written to the Board of Health asking to be 1 isted as an agency which could examine birth records. We received that permission and visited the Records Division. We found that Linda was listed under the name \\~e had been given. A repeat ca.ll to the Division of Inter-Agency Relations led to our calling the Bronx Bureau of Child Welfare again. This time, we were told that Linda T. was l'iving in foster c.are with Mrs. F. (a name di fferent from the one we have been gi ven) . l~e were 288 given her address and the name and telephone number of the social worker assigned to her case. The date was June 30, 1972. We informed Miss L. that Linda had been located and told her how to contact Linda's social worker. We shared information with the Bureau of child Welfare worker who had been trying to locate Ida L. At present, Linda's placement with her grandmother in Atlanta has been approved by the' agencies of both cities. Transportation and an escort are being arranged. Miss L. has been released from prison. She is en\u00ad rolled in a drug program and is planning to return to Atlanta when she is permitted to do so. HANDICAP UPON HANDICAP Regina P., age 14 Regina P., mother, currently incarcerated at New York Correctional Facility fOI\" Women, Rikers Island 'Ms. P. asked us to check on the welfare of her five children, paying particular attention to 13-year old Regina. We found that these children were known to the Bureau of Chil d Welfare and that the'j r custody by Court order was assi gned to Mr. P. and r~rs. H., hi s common 1 aw wife. Regina has a history of school truancy and running away from home. In November, 1972, after a preliminary hearing on a Person in need of Supervision petition in Bronx Family Court, she had been sent to Euphrasian House, a residence for psychological evaluation. At this agency's re\u00ad commendation, application had been made fO!' Regina's enrollment in St. Germain School. The school rejected the application. A second Court hearing was scheduled on November 30, 1972. This worker agreed to attend the hearing. After discussion with Mr. P., Mrs. H. and Regina in the waiting room of the Court, this worker agreed to try to find a residential school place\u00ad ment for Regina. Meanwhile, we would try to arrange a school transfer so that she could attend school while waiting for placement. 289 We contacted St. Germain and were able to obtain an appointment for a personal interview for Regina on January 2, i973. After a full interview, they said they would rev;,ew their original rejectioh. As a result of the interview, Regina was accepted for a four month trial period. The social worker estimated that there would be space for Regina in about two months. TI~o weeks later, on January 18, 1973, this office was informed that Regina had run away again. Since she could not be found, t~rs. H. and thi s vlOrker returned to the Bronx Fami 1y Court to request that a warrant be issued. After issuance of the warrant, this worker attempted to share information with the Warrant Squad. We were informed that a period of two weeks would probably elapse until they wou,d receive the warrant and act on it. On February 6, 1973, we were informed that Regina was ho~pita1ized because of a severe blow on her head, reportedly caused by an automobile accident. On arrival at the hospital, she also showed evidence of heroin use. There had been no previous indication of use of drugs. Atter several weeks of treatment, Regina was found to have appreciably recovered the use of her limbs, but she was judged acutely psychotic. The Psychiatric Section of the hospital was not able to find space for her until she stole seme pi 11 sand I'las judged a danger to the Perli atri c Section. Regina has now regained the use of her 1imhs completely and her mental condition is judged to be about the same as it was before the accident. Since St. Germain school had indicated, a few days after the accident, that they had space for Regina, and since they had stated that they would accept her as soon as she was well enough to attend their school, St. Germain was notified that she is now ready. 290 The main areas studied and focused on are: * What happens to children at the time of their mother's arrest: * Services provided to children through the Children of Offenders Project; * \"(he role of the fathers and father substitutes in the lives of children whose mothers have co~e into conflict with the law; * The special problems confronting children living with guardians who cannot adequately fulfi 11 thei r needs; * The necessity for and value of continued contact between mothers and children while mothers are incarcerated; * Service gaps. Locating a child of an incarcerated mother may take weeks or even months of Project staff effort. For reasons stated in this report, (in\u00ad cluding service gaps in the City) detection of the whereabouts of a child becomes circuitous and frustrating. As a result of intensive work by the Children of Offenders Project staff on one case of locating a child whose mother said he had been un\u00ad identified since her arrest two years previously, a new police procedure has been inaugurated. It is now mandated that, as part of the routine in arrest, the officer is required to ascertain if the arrested person is caring for any children and to inquire into the case, as is routinely done for persons injured and \"aided\" in accidents or illnesses. Additional gaps in services are pointed up later in this report. 291 -----~ ----~--------- WOMEN'S PRISON ASSOCIATION SERVICES RENDERED IN THIS CASE 1.

CHILD NEGLECT AND ABUSE When we \"', rv;ew parents of children ;n our study, we ask for a description of parent's own childhood. In very few cases has that period of their life been described as a happy, healthy childhood. One mother described the beatings that she and her mother received from her father. A very large percentage report that someone other than their natural mother cared for them as children. Mothers described unstable living situations in which there was constant moving about and a lack of warm, loving relationships. As a result, many mothers, when they later have children of their O\\~n, often find it difficult or lack the skill of mothering that would enable them to relate positively toward their children. Therefore, the cycle of neglect and abuse continues. Since the Children of Offenders Project began, a total of 3 referrals have been made to the Central Registray of the Bureau of Child Welfare regarding 9 children who were known by us to be either neglected or abused. 292 CASE HISTORIES INVOLVING NEGLECT AND ABUSE 1. Ms. N., mother, B/D 2/24/44 Children: Robert B/D 6/19/65 Dana R., BID 8/12/67 Because of Ms. N's involvement with the law and her subsequent incar\u00ad cerati on, her four chi 1 dt'en were 1 eft in the care of thei r maternal grandmother. The ch il dren experi enced many problems both at home and in school. Psychiatr'ic help was obtained for the children, but due to mother's drug use, scheduled clinic appointments were not kept. The situation deteriorated to the point that the children were forbidden to go to school. They were left unattended and without supervision in a dirty apartment with only mattresses for beds. The youngest child, Dana, four years old, was severely burned by her brother Gregory, six years old. The case was referred to the Bureau of Child Welfare's Central Registry. All four children were placed together in a foster home by the Bureau of Child Welfare. 293 SERVICE GAPS In our attempts to find children whose addresses are unknown or to he'jp them obtain needed services, we have found that the fallowing ser\u00ad vice gaps have made the task more difficult: 1. There is no central registry of all children who attend New York City schools. The appropriate department in the New York City Board of Education will suggest schools to contact if Ive have same knowledge of the child's location. These schools must be contacted individually and our credentials must be established in each case. If a principal adheres to a stl'i ct i nterpretati on of hi s regul ations, Vie cannot obtain any information because we are not a public agency, In addition, if we are reasonably sure that he attends school, we cannot obtain any information from the New York City Department of Education. 2. There is a central registry of all recipients of public assistance, but this information is not available to our agency. By contacting the Police Department, we have been able to obtain information through the Special Investigation Service, but our request for permission to make our own direct contact has been denied because Section 136 of the Social Services Law is quite specific in this matter. 3. The Central Registry of patients of health care agencies lists only inactive cases, twa or three years old only. If we are trying to obtain information on more recent care, we must contact individual health centers. In cases where we do not have an address, this is very difficult. 4. I~hile the Bureau of Child Welfare and Faster Care agencies provide a manual for faster parents explaining their rights and l'esponsibilities, there is no such manual available for natural parents. When a child goes into care, a social worker explains the procedure and regulations to the parents. This is usually a time of emotional stress for parents and we have found that they do not always understand. completely what is required of them or pennitted to them. Since the irregular contact with the social worker and the child may affect the eventual dispos\u00ad ition of the case, it would be helpful if these regulations were printed in some form which the parents could retian. 294 STATISCAL DATA The following statistical tables illustrate the size of the COOP (Children of Offenders [\"oject) progi'am, the demographic make-up of the COOP clients and suggest the range of problems faced by both parents and children.

We have begun to see the develop\u00ad ment of a pattern of not only 9apS in services, but an alienation from service agencies by those who need it most. This situation merits further study as to cause, effect and solution. The Children of Offenders Project will study these problems closely as well as continue to provide active intervention and advocacy services to its unique population. At th~ end of the third year of operation, we will publish our findings and recommendations on how to minimize difficulties facing female offenders and their children as well as how to maximize use of available services.

The Manpower Administration of the U.S. Department of Labor has concluded that the bonding default rate for ex-offenders is approximately the same as that for non-offenders. State employment services are now able to provide a bond for ex-offenders under a program instituted by the Labor Department. Can an employer expect loyalty from an ex-offender? The comments of U. S. Senator Charles Percy (R-ILL.) echo the opinions of probation and parole officers nationally. In a recent talk to NAB members attending a national conference, Percy said: \"Ex-offenders know that their employers are taking a chance with them. They are grateful for that risk-taking . they want to demonstrate that they can do it, and, many times, theirwork quality excels that of their fellow employees . , they have really been an inspiration to others who have known of their experience.\" (National Alliance of Businessmen) 300 Corrections -Problem Identification Checklist U.

The staff of CURE consists of two people, Pauline and Charles Sullivan, who had been devoted in the late 60's and early 70's to stopping the Viet Nam war. In fact, this issue caused their interest in the problems of jails and prisons. They visited many incarcerated anti-war activists and even experi- enced the terrible conditions of jail when they were arrested and briefly placed in custody for anti-war activities. Until the fall of 1971 the Sullivans have been traveling throughout the country working with anti-war programs. After arriving back in Texas, a friend suggested that a transportation service to the state prison system was needed. In the next few months, they researched and organized a low cost bus service for the families of prisoners. They found that most units of the Texas Department of Corrections were located north of Houston in rural, isolated areas, well over ~OO miles from San Antonio. Because bus and taxi connections were awkward, expensive, and time consuming, visits by the families of poor prisoners were few. The first bus trip to the prison units was scheduled for the Christmas season, and a phone number was placed in the prison newspaper for inmates from San Antonio area to notify their families to call for information. Volun\u00ad teers were recruited to sell tir.kets and drive the buses. Also, churches and individuals were solicited for financial contributions. In this way they were able to keep the price of the trip to $3.00 for adults and $1.50 for children. The response from the families of prisoners was so great, that on the first bus trip, there were enough people for five buses. The following month had an even larger turnout and the decision was made to stabilize the service with one bus on a weekly basis to different units. A trip to Gatesville, the largest juvenile facility in the state was also scheduled on a periodic basis. The Sullivans soon realized the need for a permanent service to families of prisoners. They acquired their own building -rent free through the urban renewal program. More than selling bus tickets, the Sullivans expanded their services to information about bail, jail and lawyer abuses, and other 302 segments of the criminal justice process. They were concerned also with the prevention of crime and included information on emergency relief, food and shelter. Because of the emphasis on sharing information, they called the; r storefront program, \"The Referral\". As one can imagine, \"The Referral\" was not without its crises and characters, all of which taught the Sullivans more and more about the system with which they were dealing. Perhaps the most unforgettable experience was with Jimmy Martinez. \"The Referral\"was hoped to become a \"drop in center\" for ex-convicts. This assumption was somewhat naiVe because the years required for an organization to build credibility with the alienated sub-culture of the world of the prisoner had not yet been accrued. However, one afternoon Jimmy walked into \"The Referral\" saying he had been released from Leavenworth and needed a place to stay. Bending the rules, the Sullivans allowed him to sleep at\"The Referral \"and help in its operation. For the next week, everyone was impressed with Jimmy as he answered the phone. sold bus tickets, and even did some work with the jail chaplain. At the same time, howev~r, we began to notice a few pieces of fUrniture in \"The Referral\" missing. Also, Jimmy always seemed to need about $15.00 to purchase a ladder for a paint job or acquire chauffeur's license to help drive the bus or other odd projects. By the end of the week. he was gone and only then was it discovered that Jimmy was a drug addict and \"one of the best can men\" in the game. The Sullivans lamented the waste of Jimmy's many talents and were determi ned to speak out even more for Y'ehabi 1 ita ti ve programs. Jimmy's effect did not end with his exodus and for thp. next few weeks people came by \"The Referral\" and asked when the bus was g()i\\~g to the Houston Astro's baseball game. It seems that Jimmy had sold tickets for an unscheduled trip. Al though the way to the Sull ivan's approach toward community invol vement in criminal ,justice reform was service, their goals had always been two-fold. They had in mind a structural change in criminal justice brought about by organized citizen concern. Their first effort at organizing was a quixotic write-in campaign for sheriff. Charles' Sullivan was the candidate and his platform was reform of the local jail. Although he only received 1200 write-in votes they were able to politicize many vf the families of prisoners. 303 Theil' next effort at systemic change has endUl'ed to this point. In December, 1972, the Texas Legislature prepared to convene for its biennial 140 day session, and the Sullivans started a lobby for criminal justice reform. CURE (Cit'izens \\Jl'1ited for Rehabilitation of Errants) became the name of their organization. The same buses that were making the trips to Huntsville were used to bring families to lobby at the Capitol 'in Austin, Texas. Beginners luck was with them that first session, and CURE was suc\u00ad cessful in passing a ~i1l to abolish the \"building tender\" system, wherein prisoners were given power by the prison administration over other pl'isoners. This was a significant move in an agriculturally based system such as the Texas Department of Corrections. Their political activities tended to deteriorate their relations with the ~tate prison system. They began speaking out on other abuses in the system and as a prison official stated, \"We 1 i ked them only when they ran the bus servi ce.\" Since CURE was initiated as a state-wide lobby, the decision was made to move the headquarters to the state capital, Austin, Texas in the summer of 1~74. Families who had been very involved in the bus service were able to resume responsibility for its continued operation. Through developing transportation services in most of the major cities in Texas, the Sullivans have built up a network of state-wide contacts. A quarterly newsletter CURE was able to keep their friends and supporters posted on legislative issues and key votes of their legislators. From the state-wide l1st, CURE called for delegates to a constitutional convention in May, 1975 in order to formally organize. The follo~Jing September, CURE's first annual people's convention was held with over 300 members participating. Since January 2, 1972, it 'is estimated that CURE has been responsi\u00ad ble for 20,000 visits to the Texas Department of Corrections and federal prisons. Most of the sponsoring organizations of these transportation services through-out the state are today connected with CURE in some way. As for correspondence, it is estimated that CURE has mailed out over 75,000 pieces of mail in the last five years. This includes 50,000 news\u00ad letters and 10,000 personal replies to prisoners. Although many of these 304 1 etters and newsl etters ended up in \"fil e 13\" whi ch is the warden's trash can, CURE still mailed them. Besides visits and letters, CURE has been responsible for about 50,000 phone calls. In other forms of communi\u00ad eation, there have been three state conventions, tens of state and local meetings. , It is estimated that these \"get-togethers\" involved about 2,500 people. In all these estimates of 20,000 visits, 75,000 pieces of corres\u00ad pondence, 50,000 phone calls and 2,500 people involvement through meet\u00ad ings, we are not counting different persons in many instances. For example, some of the same people would ride the bus many times. In education on cr'iJ11inal justice reform in Texas, it is estimated that CURE has appeared in the media 2,000 times and has been responsible for over a hundred articles. These number',; are estimated in direc.t communication, but it is almost impossible to estimate the indirect benefits of these services. For example, how many deaths in prison and jail have been stopped through this communication? What about paroles being made through CURE? Most important, we cannot measure how much support we have all received in the struggle for criminal justice reform, how much consolation given to prison\u00ad ers, or how many fr'iendships have been made through this communication. CURE has been responsible in part for a joint legislative study on prison reform, the appointme~t of the first Black and woman to the Board of Pardons and Parole, creation of commission on jail standards, develop\u00ad ment of a statewide probation system, and an \"almost, but not quite\" mora\u00ad torium on prison constl\"uction in the state. Although CURE can show very few concrete results in Texas Department of Corrections (TOC), there have been some triumphs. HB 1056 sponsored by Rep. Joe L. Hernandez, San Antonio, was signed into law back in June, 1973, was supposed to abolish the building tender system. This law states ttiat no inmate can have disciplinary, supervisory or administrative power over another inmate. The enforcement of HB 1056 may yet happen through a fed\u00ad eral court order since physical security is one of the five issues in the major lawsuit, Ruiz v Estelle, beginning next year in Judge William Wayne Justice's Court in Tyler. 305 Besides HB 1056 in 1973, CURE in 1975 lobbied successfully for an in\u00ad crease to $200 in release money and HB 989 which put pressure on TOC to integrate the prison. This year in 1977, HB 144 was the most important bin affecting TDC. riB 144 creates a nine member Work-Furlough Commission based in Huntsville. This Commission in the next few years should expand the work release program from the present 50 prisoners to hundreds and possibly thousands. As the primary staff, the Sullivans' work during the session consi sted of testi fying before committees, calling chapters on weekends to pressure the legislators to vote in line with CURE's positions, and trying to stay \"on topll of bills as they progressed through the legis\u00ad lative process. Between legislative sessions CURE monitors and researches the various criminal justice agencies. Besides legislation affecting the state prison, CURE over the years has pressured TOC to change its visiting rules. When the bus services first started, visiting was only on Sunday for two hour slots. In those days also, prison units had totally different visiting rules. Although a few units still var~ in the treatment of visitors, there have been changes in the visiting-rules. TOC now has visiting from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. on Saturday and Sunday. The Sullivans also try to visit and to report to each of the eight chapters. CURE headquarters provide a sarvice to prisoners' families by being available to help on individual cases of parole by working with the central office of the parole board located in Austin. Since the beginning CURE has tried to walk the tightrope of credi\u00ad bility both with the political establishment and with the world of the prisoners. Their greatest assets, perhaps, in this most controversial issue have been that 43 legislators out of 181 (over 20%) are listed as sponsoring public officials. On the other hand, the number of ex-offenders and families of prisoners in CURE's leadership has been the main reason for grass roots credibility. Not only does CURE have local chapters, but also it has pressured for inmate chapters in both state and federal prisons in Texas. Although they have been unsuccessful in establishing these chapters, CURE's belief is that the rehabilitative effect on the prisoner 306 of \"seeing political system work\" as well as valuable input to politicians on ways to stop crime have been major arguments to prison authorities. The prison's objections seem to be that an individual pl'isoner can write legislators now and an association of prisoners is not needed. Also, there is a fear that \"mil itant\"lilembers will take over the chapter once it is established. Besides chapters, CURE hopes to organize three special groups: (1) an ex-convict group that would seek federal funds for a number of activities; (2) a young attorneys and writ writers group that would be funded fur lawsuits; and (3) the families of prisoners on death row. In prison reform, CURE hopes to achievtl the follO\\~ing: (1) a wage for prisoners (Texas is one of only three states that does not pay a wage); (2) removal of the most unqualified or ineffective officials in TDC; (3) mechanizing field work and doing away with stoop labor; (4) having some type of contact visiting; (5) a woman to be named to the Board of Correction and a woman as warden at the Goree Unit; (6) pressuring to place minorities in decision making positions. In concluding this brief sketch, a mention should be made as to a seeming drawback which has been the chief, over-all reason for CURE's sUccess. The subject is money and the lack of money of all things has been a tremendous asset rather than a liability. CURE as a lobby cannot receive grants, and finances for the organization have always been gener\u00ad ated by the membership. Even prisoners (over 400 at this time) as mem\u00ad bers are asked for a yearly $2.00 contribution. In 1976 CURE's budget was about $10,000, with a third of that counted in donated services which included photography, printing. legal fees and car repair. One of the biggest reasons for this out pouring of generosity in contributions and volunteerism is that CURE's paid staff receives a subsistence wage of only $5.00 per week with CURE covering all othey' living experises. The effect of this grass root funding and support is that CURE has almost total freedom to. speak out on any criminal justice issue with as much intensity as possible. 307 THE CONSTITUTION OF CITIZENS UNITED FOR REHABILITATION OF ERRANTS PREAMBLE We citizens in order to achieve a reduction of crime in our society through the Rehabilitation of Errants do hereby Unite behind this Con\u00ad stitution and the goals of this organization. ARTICLE I Goals Cr'ime can most effectively be diminished by providing errants with information on existing rehabilitative programs, by promoting the creation' of additional rehabilitative programs, by developing correctional alterna\u00ad tives, by illustrating to errants that members of our society and govern\u00ad ment are concerned with their problems and by convincing errants that change can be more effectively accomplished through the exercise of their constitutional rights of free speech, freedom to associate, freedom to petition the government for a redress of grievances and I)ther orderly activity rather than through crime and violence. To these ends Citizens United for the Rehabilitation of Errants establishes the following goals: 1. To provide channels into the political process for errants, former errants, the families of errants, and all citi~ens concerned with rehabilitative programs to reintegrate errants into a peaceful role in our society. 2. To provide errants whether incarcerated, or on parole or probation and theil' families and friends with their first amendment rights to associ ate and peti ti on thei r government for a redress of gri evances peacefully and through established democratic procedures. 3. To provide channels for errants Whether incarcerated, or on parole or probation and their families and friends from persons involved with rehabilitative progrdTOs and the executive, legislative and judicial branches of our government. 4. To provide channels from persons in prison to the public and the government as to the conditions of life in prison so that the public and.the government can make informed decisions on future correctional policies. 5. To establish chapters wihin the communities across the state to implement the goals of CURE. 6. To establish chapters within the prison system so that in the operation of the activities of these chapters, i\u00b7nmates can be exposed to the satisfaction of accomplishment and the resolution of their differences through debate and peaceful democratic processes. 308 ARTICLE II State Chapter Sec. 1.

That's why Project Bridge. another effort of AFL-CIO Labor's Community Service Agency. is now seeking new foster homes from among its union members for children who cannot live with their own families. Working with the Children's Services Division of Oregon and the Metropolitan Youth Commission of Portland and Multnomah County, Project Bridge is developing a willingness among union members to help hard-to\u00ad place youth. It has produced a guidance manual for the placement of children. It has recruited foster parents who are now being trained to receive the children and it has arranged for new foster homes to be certified by the state. Project Bridge is also breaking new ground because it is seeking single persons as well as married couples to serve as foster parents. Project Bridge will monitor the foster homes to maintain quality and will be supportive of the foster parents. It will also carry out an advocacy role for children and their foster parents. 317 \"VOLUNTEER HOMES FOR STATUS OFFENDERS: AN ALTERNATIVE TO DETENTION\" Jane C. Latina, Volunteer Service Center Coordinator Jeffrey L. Schembera, Chief Bureau of Community Services Florida Division of Youth Services October, 1975 3Cj3?4 EstimatE's by the National Council on Crime and Delinquency, indicate that 100,000 youngsters under 18 will be held in correctional institutions by juvenile courts in 1975. Of these children, 23 percent of the boys and 70 percent of the girls will not be guilty of any crime for which an adult would be arrested or prosecuted.l Detained against their will, having committed no crime, and seldom dangerous to themselves or others, thousands of these young people flood our juvenile detention centers annually. The cost of feeding, clothing, housing and supervising these children in se\u00ad curity facil ities is tremendous (sometimes $30.00 a day or more). The cost in terms of the potential negative impact on adolescents is beyond calcula\u00ad tion. Who are these young people and why are they incarcerated? They are status offenders; runaways, truants, and incorrigibles who for one reason or another must be temporarily removed from their homes by juvenile author\u00ad ities. They fill our jails and detention centers because juvenile judges and other officials believe there is no other place to house them on a temporary basis. Across the country, youth officials bemoan the practice of detaining status offenders in security facilities, yet the lack of alternative re\u00ad sources leaves them no option. To many, the situation seems hopeless and inevitable. Faced with a similar challenge, Florida's Division of Youth Services has refused to knuckle under to the \"inevitability\" of locking up status offenders and have been developing alternatives. Florida's search for detention alternatives began early ;n 1974. At that time, detention con- 318 ditions in the sunshine State were about as bleak as anYdhere else. Dan\u00ad gerous overcrowding, inadequate staffing, lack of therapeutic programming and i ndi sCi'imi nate mixi ng of statu,s offenders wi th del i nquents was common throughout the State.2 In a one day detention survey conducted in 1974, it was found that 22.8 percent of all children detained in security facil\u00ad ities were status' offenders. Concerned with the results of this survey, Florida Youth Services officials began a determined search for alternative ways of housing the hundt\"eds of status offenders who had to be temporarily removed from their own homes but did not really require security facilities. There were few options. The economic recession meant that new state tax dollars for any alternative detention programs were unlikely. Finally, in March of 1975 Youth Services officials settled on the one option available to them throughout the state ... Volunteer Homes. This innovative approach re\u00ad jected the traditional stand that volunteers do not replace paid services. A national consultant on volunteerism doubted he volunteer bed program would work effectively but administration made the decision to \"go\". The decision to go with the volunteer concept \\~as -not pulled out of the air. It was based on a higlily successful pilot project that had been operating in the Tampa area for over a year. THE TAMPA EXPERIENCE The Tampa Volunteer Detention Project was born in January of 1974 out of an attempt by State Youth Services officials to relieve overcrowding at the Hillsborough County Detention Center, one of the State's largest fa\u00ad ciliites. To avoid a potential crisis, State administrators resolved to place. on an emergency basis, thirty (30) of the least dangerous detained youngsters with families in and around the Tampa area.3 Essentially, the structure of the Tampa volunteer program evolved over several months through trial and error. The concept was to place in the ;to1 unteer homes status offencle,\"s whose ci rcumstances requi red a temporary stay and who were not considered serious security risks. Since this was as an emergency measure, there was little opportunity to systematically plan the volunteer program. Only the barest of procedures were in place 319 when the first group of 30 volunteer families were recruited from the Tampa community, screened, trained and certified to receive children. Surprisingly, there were few major problems and most of the children housed in the volunteer homes adjusted exceedingly well. Division officials were so pleased with the initial results of the project, thb~t\\t was con\u00ad tinued as a regular component of the Tampa detention progl'am. Thus, a project initially begun as an emergency measure to relieve dangei'!)us over\u00ad crowding in one of the State's detention centers, was maintained on a re\u00ad gular basis. THE BIG PUSH This ~JaS far from the end of the story. Throughout 1974 and into early 1975, all of the State's twenty-two secure detention centers began to ex\u00ad perience overcrowding with status offenders accounting for a large share of detained children. Analysis of statistical records revealed that 44.5 percent of all detent'j on admi ss ions had been status offenders. In March of 1975, the decision was made to expand the Tampa pilot pro\u00ad ject to a statewide program. As a first step, Division of Youth Services staff who had worked with the Tampa program were asked to prepare guide\u00ad lines which would direct the statewide operation. The most important ideas learned from the Tampa experience were as follows: 1. Establish the number of beds needed for such a program and then triple that number so there are always enough beds avail\u00ad able without using any too often. 2. Plan on forty percent turnover rate per year of volunteers participating in the program. 3. Recruit families honestly. Explain the positive and nega\u00ad tive aspects of the program. 4. Establish a definite plan for supervision of the families so they have the security of knowing that someone is always available if problems arise. 320 5. Screen and orient children carefully who are going into the program so they know what the program is about. 6. Make specific arrangements for liability insurance to cover the volunteers. 7. Establish a plan to provide emergency medical attention for children in the program. 8. Set up a clothes closet consisting of donated clothes to meet the needs of the children. 9. Prepare and give each child a personal kit including tooth brush, toothpaste, comb, deodorant, and soap so that the volunteer family does not have to purchase these items for each child placed. These items can be acquired as donation~ from local merchants. After planning was completed, the wheels were set in motion to initiate the statewide volunteer home program. An April 21 deadline was set to have enough beds available to begin placement of children in cOlTYJlunity homes. Staff projected that the state\u00ad wide average daily number of children in the category of status offenders would be 282. Applying the three to one formula to insure that enough beds would be available, 852 volunteers beds were needed. An objective was set to have 282 beds available initially. The first objective of 282 beds by April 21 was met; the second objective of 852 was met on July 31, which was a month later than planned. The success or failure of the program was dp.pendent on the recruitment of volunteer families. Families recruited had to be involved with kids most of society had turned their backs on -children that families, schools, and churches could not reach. What chance was there of finding ~eople to take these children into their homes? Throughout the state groups of staff met to brainstorm re\u00ad cruiting ideas. Information was printed about the program which was help\u00ad ful and lent credibility to the program. Ministers of all denominations ~/ere contacted. Each one was asked to identify five families in their 321 congregation that might partic'ipate in the program. M~.ny of the ministers accompanied recruiters and introduced them to prospective volunteer fam\u00ad ilies. This method of recruiting gained a number' of volunteers and pro\u00ad vided experience in recc'uiting famil i es and sell ing the program. Other volunteer bed recruitment techniques developed were: contacting current volunteers with the agency, acquiring lists of volunteers from other organizations (Red Cross, Voluntary Action Centers, etc.), contacting community leaders, homeowners associations, and firemen. There was support by the media. Radlo spots were done by new~caster Frank Blair and Comedian Jackie Gleason. Spot. announte,nents were on television and human intf!rest stories appeared in local newspapers and neighborhood shopping guides. Personal contact was most effective in recruitment. Parents of pro\u00ad bationers, past and present, were excellent resources, as were friends of staff. Quickly, newly recruited volunteers began referring families that. were interested in the program. Speeches to clubs or small groups were not particularly effective, but contacting influential persons in clubs for specific names worked well. Being able to use that key person's name in the initial phase contact, often generated interest and paved the way for a personal visit. A primary goal of the recruiters was to sit down in the prospective volunteer's home to explain and discuss the program. At this point, honest salesman:.hip and community pride sold the program. A program of this type can be destroyed if one family is abusive, physically or sexually, to a child. Therefore, much ti\".,e and effo)'t \\~ent into screening the ilomes to assure fitness for housing ,;hildren. Initial screening was done~y a home visit. The recruiter, through observation and conversation, Jearned about family interaction, emotional and finan\u00ad cial stability, general attitudes and values, reasons for volunteering, family members in the home, physical setting, adaquacy of space, health standards, and sanitation. The home visit gave the volunteer family an opportunity to discuss any questions they had and resolve any reservations about becoming involved. While in the home, the recruiter discussed the type of child the family wanted to take (age, sex, race, and any addition\u00ad al preferences), the times the home would be available to be called 322 (days, night, weekends, anytime), how often they wanted to take a child, whether or not they could provide transportation, and whether or not they felt comfortable in handling some specific types of children, i.e. the child ~Iho smokes, is a bedwetter, requires a special diet or regular medication, or is mildly retarded. The recruiter also made sure that each family had homeowner's insurance, automobile insurance, and valid driver's licenses. In addition to this on-site screening, a police records check was made on each adult in the home and references wa\\'e contacted. A decision was then made by the recruiter to accept or rejG:ct the family. If the family was accepted the recruiter scheduled an individual or group orien\u00ad tiation session. The orientation included information about the Division of Youth Services, details of how the program actually operated, what the respon\u00ad sibil Hies of the volunteer famil ies and the Division were, how to handle emergencies, and discussion of any other pertinent information. Families had an opportunity to raise questions and discuss anything that might not ~ have been covered. These sessions gave the recruiter and families an opportunity tl' become better acquainted and to finalize their decision. Recruitl,:-'lt, screening, and orientati on were in-depth processes, re\u00ad quiring approximately eight hours per family. This expenditure of time \\~as a valuable asset because the families were carefully selected and well\u00ad oriented to the program and to the children. Supervision of the homes and length of the child's stay had been trou\u00ad blesome aspects of the pilot project in Tampa. In order to avoid these problems, responsibility for supervision of volunteer homes was aSSigned to line Youth Services staff. Staff who had initial contact with a child havin'g committed a status offense and needing temporary lodging were resonsible for the following: 1. Placing the child in one of the beds available, taking into consideration preferences of the volunteer home with regard to sex, age, and race. 2. Scheduling the detention hearing within 48 hours just as if the child were in secure detention. 323 3. Providing for contacts with the volunteer home at least once ~ ~ in order to monitor the situation while a child was in the home. 4. Immediately beginning work towards returning the child home or moving the child to a pennanent placement within t~1l days. In order to insure proper super'/i :;.~uft of the vol unteer horne by Youth Services staff and supervision of ti,e child by volunteer parents the following terms \\~ere agreed upon in a contract signed by staff and, voJ\u00ad unteer houseparents: 1. The maximum 1 ength of stay for the chil d named is to be days. The Division, through its agent, will be responsible for moving as quickly as possible to find a more permanent placement for the youth or return him to his home as appropriate. 2. The DiVision of Yout;l Services' personnel agree to provi,de at least one contact with the non-secure detention home parents per day. 3. That transportation to the home will be provided if necessary by the Division through its agent. 4. That emergency medical care will be provided and paid for upon approval by the Division if necessary. 5. That the Division, through its agent, and/or the non-secure detention home parent named herein, \\~ill provide written noti\u00ad fication of intent to terminate at least one week prior to dis\u00ad continUing participation in the program. IT WORKS Based on the Pilot Project in Tampa, the probability of success in the volunteer home program was high. However, staff was still concerned about runaways being placed in a situation where they could run at any time .. the number of people who would take these children into their homes, and thefts by the status offenders. These and other fears were alleviated by the results of a study of the volunteer program over a four and a half 324 month period. Analysis of the data revealed a 13 percent turnover of volunteer homes (Table 1), which was expected based on the predicted 40 percent turnover rate per year or 3.33 percent per month; however, an interesting side bene\u00ad fit was that a number of the homes terminating were lost to paid programs within the agency. In addition, other families withdrew from the program to accept custody, through the court, of children placed in their home. Even though they are no longer volunteer homes, they continue to be involved. TABLE I Availability of Volunteer Homes* STUDY I March 15 -July 31, 1975 Total Beds Available Between March 15 -July 21 -------------------- 852 Beds Available July 31 --------------------------------------------- 738 Terlninations Between March 15 -July 31 ---------------------------- 113 Turnover Rate ------------------------------------------------------ 13% * One volunteer home may provide several beds at a time. Florida officials were surprised by the extent that volunteer homes were utilized (Table 2) and the savings incurred. If, for instance, the homes which provided food, shelter, and supervision for 1,181 children oVer a period of four and one half months had been paid a minimum of eight dollars per day, it would have cost the State $60,048.00 to operate the program. When compared to the potential cost of holding these chil\u00ad dren in secure detention at $30.00 a day, the cost benefit in addition to the positive impact on children was significant. TABLE 2 Utilization of Volunteer Homes STUDY 1 March 15 -July 31, 1975 325 I Number of Children Placed in Volunteer Homes --------------------- 1,181 Number of Days Utilized ------------------------------------------ 7,506 Average Length of Stay (Days per child) -------------------------- 6.4 Few families had any serious behavior problems develop even though they were prepared for this possibility. Acceptance by the families made the children responsive and eager to please. There were a few incidents where the child caused damage to the home of the volunteer family. However, the major financial loss by families was phone bills caused by children making long distance calls. In most instances, arrangements were made for the child to repay the family. Several thefts occurred, but as the data indicates, most of these items were returned. The 5.6 percent runaway rate (Table 3) is impossible to compare since there are no other known comparable programs. However, since many of the children placed in volunteer beds are chronic runaways (one girls had run away 15 times before coming into the volunteer program), indications seem to be that 5.6 percent is a very low runaway rate. TABLE 3 Inappropriate Behavior by Children Placed in Volunteer Homes STUDY I March 15 -July 31,1975 Number of Children Who Ran Away From Volunteer Homes --------------- 67 Runaway Rate ------------------------------------------------------- 5.6% Number of Children Who Stole Property From Volunteer Homes ----------------------------- .. -------------------- 18 Theft Rate --------------------------------------------------------- 1.5% Cost of Thefts During Period Studies -------------------------- $5,981.87 Amount Returned ----------------------------------------------- $4,050.85 Partially based on the results of this program, the Florida Legislature recently passed legislation which removed the category of status offenders from delinquency status. Housing status offenders in detention centers \\~as made illegal on July 1, 1975 th'us affirming the administrative decision 326 which was effected over two months earlier. For years professionals in juvenile justice systems have w\\'ung ,their hands over what to do with status offenders. Now, a viable alternative to housing status offenders in jails and detention centers is available -the volunteer home. This program has proven successful in the State of Flor\u00ad ida, both for the children involved and the taxpayers. Volunteer families provide the food, shelter, and supervision so the child can remain in the community rather than end up in secure detention. Families who volunteer for this program are a cross-section of the community. The one common denominator is a concern for today's teenagers an,_ a willingness to become involved in improving their situation. SUMf4ARY Analysis of detention patterns revealed that approximately 44.5 percent of the children being admitted to detention in Florida were status offenders not requiring secure detention but needing temporary shelter and supervi\u00ad sion. Continuing to house them in secure detention facilities was dam\u00ad aging to the child and costly to the taxpayer. Alternative placements needed to be developed for the status offender. The solution to the problem was to develop a volunteer program that would provide temporary (up to two weeks) placement for these children. Initial staff and community resistance had to be overcome through an honest and open educational process. As the program has proven its worth, its use has increased and the need for additional homes grO\\~s. Some of the homes have been lost to paid programs and others have been given cus\u00ad tody of the children by the Juvenile Court. Thus it is necessary to con\u00ad stantly recrui t nevi homes. Since tile program began, status offenders have been phased out of secure detention entirely and it has been proven that these youngsters do not need to be locked up. Children in volunteer homes have received good care 'and supervision and have not presented any major problems within the community. The runaway rate for 1,181 children placed in this program during a four and one half month survey period was 5.6 percent. 327 Since the program is strictly volunteer, families receive no money. They have all extended themselves far beyond their original commitment to the agency and the children have responded to the warmth and acceptance, usually leaving the home with better self-images and a desire to improve their behavior. Children are able to avoid the stigma and exposure to r.ardened delinquents that result from placement in secure detention. Instead of learning criminality, they learn thE\"r'e are adults who care enough to help them. This one lesson may be the most important long-term effect that placement in a volunteer home has on a child. 328 ANALYSIS OF YOUTH SERVICES VOLUNTEER CRISIS BED PROGRAM BY DISTRICT Time Frame - 1 year (March 1, 1975 to March 1,1976) Average # Crisis Chil d Care Days District Beds Availble In Beds Used 68.4 3,073 II 101.4 IX 49.2 X 6.1 167 XI 5.7 15 were derived by computing the cost of Home Detention Child care of $8.00 per day. 329 COMPARISON OF VOLUNTEER AND PAID BEDS TABLE I Availability* Study I Total Beds Ava.lable During Period Studied Beds Available at End of Period Studied Terminations During Period Studied Turnover Rate Number of Children Placed Number of Days Utilized TABLE II Utilization of Beds* Study I Average Length of Stay (Days per child) TABLE III Volunteer Beds 851 738 113 13% Volunteer Beds 1 ,181 7,506 6.4 Inappropriate Behavior by Children Placed in Beds* Study I Number of Children Who Ran Away Runaway Rate Number of Children Who Stole Property Theft Rate Cost of Thefts During Period Studied Amount Returned 330 Volunteer Beds 67 5.6% 18 1.5% $5,981.87 $4,050.85 Paid Beds 175 162 13 8% Paid Beds 1,585 16,565 10.4 Paid Beds 84 5.3% 12 .7% TABLE IV Cost Effectiveness ** Cost per day Vo'lunteer *** Beds $4.75 Paid**** Beds $13.42 * Volunteer bed data was collected from March 15 -July 31,1975.

Consequently, there was little reluctance on the part of Division Administrators to try them as shelter parents. 332 THE FOSTER HOME: A TEMPORARY PLACE OF REFUGE The Problem: Each year, over 400,000 boys and girls are detained by the court, pending disposition of their cases. These are youngsters who have been accused of delinquent acts, many of a minor nature. Not only delinquent, but dependent and neglected children are in\u00ad carcerated in some jails, detention homes, or juvenile halls. Even if each detention home were ideally constructed and could provide children with diagnostic, educational and recreation services, holding them with \"sophisticated\" delinquents is one of the worst things that could happen to them. Unfortunately, many detention homes are far from ideal and are often overcrowded, Over 100,000 youngsters of all ages are held in jails or police lock-ups. Although every effort is made to isolate children from adult inmates, this is not always possible. Beatings, homosexual attacks, and other assaults are not uncommon in many jails due to the lack of super\u00ad vision and enforced idleness. The Task: For many delinquent youngsters, neither the jail nor the detention home is appropriate. They need a refuge from unfortunate home experiences. They need temporary substitute parents with understanding, patience and ski 11 . Subsidized foster homes, on a sh?rt-term basis, are urgently needed for children who must be removed: from their homes temporarily but who do not require secure custody. These may be \"difficult\" youngsters nobody wants. But foster homes can prevent those with problems from falling into a pattern of delinquent behavior. The right foster home can effect a turning point in a young life. Whom to Contact: Consult your juvenile or family court judge, or chief probation officer to see what kinds of homes are needed for children. 333 THE VOLUNTEER PROBATION COUNSELOR PROGRAM LINCOLN, NEBRASKA Richard Ku with the assistance of Ri chard i~oore and Kei th Gri ffiths The use of volunteers to support the efforts of salaried correctional personnel has become an increasingly common practice, enthusiastically endorsed by probati on agl~ncy admi ni strators. In recent years, ri sing probation caseloads and costs, combined with a growing awareness of the necessity for citizen participation in correctional activities, have stimulated a renewed dependence on the employment of community volunteers in probation. Volunteers in court settings have become more prevalent in the past 15 years. Several woy'thll'hile projects have been undertaken during this time and exhibit a variety of approaches dealing with different types of offenders. The use of volunteers has been well documented and several \"manuals\" exist for initiating, implementing, and operating programs of this type. This document attempts to supplement the literature on volunteer work in probation by abstracting the essential elements and philosophy of the Lincoln program--a program which has demonstrated measurable success in working with high-risk probationers. Here, the routine use of professional psychological services in the assessment of probationer needs, the selection of volunteers, and the matching of volunteers to probationers are seen as unique program features. The Lincoln Approach The Volunteer Probation Counselor Program is an integral part of general probation programming of the Lincoln-Lancaster Municipal Court. In general, probation is intended as a structured and intensive learning experience for the probationer, designed to inhibit or \"unlearn\" maladap\u00ad tive behavior patterns which have developed as a result of the proba\u00ad tioner's past history of rewards and punishment. Direct intervention is provided through probation programming, which includes supervision by probation staff, court-conducted educational classes, and one-to-one counseling relationships. 334 Fu1lowing a guilty finding for a misdemeanor, sentencing may be de\u00ad ferred by the judge, pending the outcome of a pre-sentence investigation. The purpose of the pre-sentence, investigation is to determine the offen\u00ad der's suitability for probation, to identify the offender's needs and pl'oblems, and to specify a risk-level, which reflects the offender's l'ikelihood of committing additional crimes. Only those offenders desig\u00ad nated \"high-risk\" are considered fOI' assignment to a volunteer counselor, since the assignment of \"low-risk\" individuals would result in the in\u00ad efficient use of volunteers. The probationary period is one year for high-risk offenders. Counseling by probation staff, and participation in court-conducted educational classez, account for most of the activity duri ng the fi rst two months. It is at thi s poi nt that assi gnments are made to volunteer counselors for the remainder of the probationary period. The underlying philosophy of the Lincoln Volunteer Probation Counselor Program is that certain misdemeanant offenders can derive benefit from one-to-one counseling relationships with carefully selected and trained citi zen vol unteers. Many youthful mi sdeme.:.nant offenders (ages 16 -25) commit additional criminal offenses because they are poorly prepared for a responsible and productive adult life. By exhibiting a genuine interest in the youth's needs and problems, a volunteer counselor can redirect a youth's energies toward a more acceptable path 1;0 maturity. Probationers remain under the supervision of the Probation Office of the Municipal Court after having been placed on probation. However, for those assigned to one-to-one relationships with volunteers, primary con\u00ad tact is in a community-based environment. The thrust of the program 'is to util i ze the humanitarian concerns of ordi nary ci ti zens to the benefit of young people who have diverged from the norm in attaining adulthood. Counseling assignments are based on some common-sense notions. First is the observation that offenders are not all alike. The reasons for their being delinquent, their interpersonal needs, and the kinds of help they requi re to make a more adequate community adjustment diffeY\" from one offender to another. Second is the well-documented assumption that very few volunteers will relate well to all types of offende,\". 335 41 Volunteers possess different capabilities for helping offenders. Some they can help and others they cannot. The basic idea is to match certain kinds of delinquents with certain kinds of volunteers so that the needs of the probationer are met by the capabilities and interests of the volunteer. Both must be comfortable in the matched arrangement. Four categories of probationer needs have been used in Lincoln to guide assignment of probationers to volunteer counselors. Approximately 65 percent need a 8uitabZe aduZt modeZ; 20 pe~eent need primary oounseZing; ZO percent need a friend/oompanion; and 5 percent need considerabZe direct supervision. The Lincoln program consists of four key components. Probation staff conduct comprehensive pre-sentence investigations on each offender from which a determination may be made as to suitability for probation and eventual assignment to a volunteer counselor. Staff are also responsible for the supervision of volunteers and are available to assist volunteers during times of crises in counseling relationships. In addition to these program-related duties, probation staff carry regular probation caseloads, and each staff member is responsible for an educational program: driver education, alcohol/drug abuse, and the volunteer counselor program. The input of a professionaZ psychoZogist is critical to the philo\u00ad sophy of the Lincoln program. This individual is responsible for the psychological assessments of probationers and volunteer applicants, the matching or probationers and volunteers, and the training of volunteers in counseling skills. Although these basic services could be obtained under contract with a consultant, there are several advantages of having a full-time position. Individual counsel ing and therapy, group and family counseling, and in-service training for probation staff can supplement regular probation programming and volunteer counseling. Moreover, great familiarity and un'1erstanding of the unique demands of working with\u00b7 offender populations which would be gained by a full-time psycholo\u00ad gist (possibly even carrying a small caseloadl would enhance a program's overall effectiveness. 336 The third key component of the Lincoln program is the voZu;~eer aoor\u00ad dinator. In Lincoln, the volunt\u20acer r.oordinator is a probation staff member who also carries a caseload. However, a full-time position is recommended during the early stages of a program. The duties of the vol unteer coordi nator are multi -faceted and hi ghly compl ex. Exampl es of these duties are given below: Recruiting volunteer applicants; Reviewing volunte~r applications and conducting interviews Participating in matching decisions; Managing logistical problems in assigning volunteers to probationers; Reviewing monthly progress reports from volunteers; Establishing and maintaining channels of communication between volunteers and probation staff. The voZunteers themselves constitute the fourth key program component. They pE:t,form a variety of diffet'ent functions within the Lincoln program. Volunteer specialists contribute to educational classes, help with employ\u00ad ment and educational development, assist in public relations, and pre\u00ad pare a monthly newsletter which is distributed to other volunteers and . staff. Some in-office clerical duties are also handled by volunteers. Volunteers have filled the role of featured speakers in educational classes oj' as group leaders in small group counsel ing. Most vol unteers are utilized in one-to-one counseling relationships. Two approaches are used to supervise volunteers. In the first, the volunteer coordinator assumes total responsibility for all activities of the volunteers, and probation staff relate directly to the volunteer coordinators in dealing with any problems which may occur with the volun\u00ad teer~. In the second apr.-I'oach, volunteers are assigned to work with individual st~ff members. Thus each probation staff member supervises a group of vol unteers, with support from the vol unteer coordi nator. As a general rule, a maximum of 20 volunteer counselors is supervised by one staff member. 337 The Volunteer-Probationer Relationship Interaction between the volunteer and the probationer is an essential condit'loi'l for a change pro\"ess. A major assumption of the Lincoln Program is that the volunteer and the probationer must meet together on a regular basis before a relationship can be established and a potential for change exists. That is, a genuine impact is made by the volunteer which results in a general improvement to the probationer's life, as well as avoidance of further contact with the criminal justice system. The average volunteer-probationer relationship lasts about 10 months. During that period, regular meetings are held about three times a month (not counting special meetings caused by emergency or pel'sonal crisis). Meetings tend to be on a weekly basis during the initial stages of the relationship and ',1ere less frequent a$ the probationary year progressed. The volunteer-probationer relationship was found to be remarkably different from traditional counseling relationships. Volunteers do not spend all their time sitting around and talking with their probationers. Rather, they take an active interest in building a relationship based upon sharing of pleasurable experiences and serious problem-solving. Employment and educational problems were the most frequently reported concerns of probationers. In about one of every five relationships, volunteers actually arranged employment for probationers. Also, volun\u00ad teers assisted with financial problems by obtaining aid through outside agencies in about 20 percent of the cases. About one-half of the volun\u00ad teers dealt with at least one significant educational pl'oblem. For example, volunteers arranged for special classes and tutoring, assisted in planning for future education, and intervened in behalf of the pro\u00ad bationer with school officials, In addition, volunteers engaged in a variety of recreational activi\u00ad ties with probationers. Significant amounts of time were spent in spec\u00ad tator sports and other leisure activities. Nine important characteristics of the way in which volunteers relate to probationers have been gleaned from the Lincoln experience: 338 Meets regularly with probationer; Liked as a person by probationer; Contacts community agencies on behalf of probationer; Participates in planned activities with probationer; Sensitive to expressed needs of probationer; Available during emergencies; Accurate perception of personality and attitudes of proba ti oner; Submits regu1 ar monthly progress reports; Cooperates with probation staff. The task of identifying a single type of individual or single set of personality characteristics associated with success as a volunteer pro\u00ad bation counselor is not likely to meet with much success. Because the youthful offenders differ considerably, it seems only reasonable to ex\u00ad pect different types of volunteer probation counselors to be needed. Each of the four different types of relationships between offenders and volunteers has somewhat different role demands, and different types of people are required. Screening procedures in the Municipal Court's Volunteer Probation Counselor Program are very stringent. If serious questions arise about the ability of the volunteer applicant, he or she is likely to be re- moved frqm the program. Consequently, it can be said that volunteer pro\u00ad bation counselors represent a relatively select group of individuals. Most volunteer applicants complete a personality inventory before assign\u00ad ment to a probationer. An overall profile, constructed from mean scores on each of several scales, all of which were somewhat above average, in\u00ad dicated that the volunteers could be described as enterprising, fluent and persuasive, self-confident, dependable, tolerant and accepting of others, flexible in thought, and willing to accept new and different ideas. A 1972 study of the Program' s E'~fecti veness produced hi ghly favorabl e results of comparisons between high-risk probationers who were assigned to volunteers and probationers who proceeded through regular probation programming. Statistically significant differences were found between 339 the two groups in the number of new offenses committed during the pro\u00ad bationary year, as well as in the seriousness of those offenses. Even more striking differences occur if the year prior to probation is com\u00ad pared to the probationary year for the two groups. Reductions were found in all offense categories for volunteer program participants, with an overall percentage reduction of 62 percent. In contrast, the group in regular probation had an ove~all reduction in offenses of 11 percent, which included increases in theft-related, anti-social, and minor traffic offenses. In general, volunteer counseling relationships are \"successful\" in about 3 of 4 cases. Statistical Profile of Probationers The average probationer caseload is about 200, half of whom are in the high-risk category. Trle average age of the probationer population is about 19 years, and about 90 percent are male (although there is an increasing trend in the number of female offenders). Data from the 1972 study suggest that offenses committed by high risk probationers break down approximately as follows: Theft-related 10% Anti-social Alcohol/Drug 22% Major traffic 35% Minor traffic 17% Psychological testing indicates that the personality characteristics of the high-risk population are remarkably similar to inmate populations in California and delinquency-prone youth in other jurisdictions. Statistical Profile of Volunteers During the past eight years, 336 citizens from the Uncoln community have served as volunteer counselors for 472 high-risk offenders. Approximately 80 volunteers are currently associated with the program. Volunteers have ranged in age from 18 to 69 years, with the average be\u00ad ing about 17 years. About 60 percent were men, and about 60 percent of the volunteers were married. Thirty\u00b7\u00b7nine percent had previous counsel\u00ad ing ex.perience, formal training, or work experience with other community 340 I I service agencies, sometimes in a volunt.eer role. Twenty-one percent expressed an interest in a counseling career. The average educational level was a little over 14 years. Over 90 percent of the volunteers expressed a religious affiliation. Volunteer probation counselors come from all walks of lif,~ and socio\u00ad economic levels in the community. Blue conal\" workers, professors, house\u00ad wives, plumbers, attorneys, college students, and retirees have served as volunteer counselors. About 70 percent of the volunteers who are assigned to counsel a probationer agree to be I\"eassigned. Because of the care taken in recruiting and screening applicants, the number of volunteers who must be dismissed is minimal. The major loss in volun\u00ad teers is caused by persons moving from the community. PROGRAM PROCEDURES Assessment The assessment of a probationer's needs begins with the presentence investigation. It is a critical element of the volunteer probation counselor program. With respect to the program, the presentence in\u00ad vestigation serves two major purposes: to determine the offender's suitability for a probationary relationship with a volunteer; and to identify, at a high level of detail, the offender's needs and problems, for later \"matching\" with a volunteer. The major components of the presentence investigations are as follows: Interviews with the offender, family members, and persons in the community who are acqu,ainted with the offender. A Defendant Information Form is used to gather a consider\u00ad able amoun!; of data pertaining to the individual's personal history, employment and educational experience, finances, social involvement, and personality. 341 Psychological and intelligence tests. A sentence completion test and the California Psychological Inventory are used to supplement the evaluation of the defendant by the Court Psychologist. These tests pertain to personality traits, intelligence capacity, use of alcohol or drugs, and societal adjustment and attitudes. In addition, the Shipley Institute of Living Scale (Vocabulary and Abstraction Tests) is administered to refine the assessment of intelligence capacity. Examination of prior criminal record, including juvenile arrests. A presentence investigation report is then prepared for the judge's approval. This \"report summarizes the findings of the presentence inves\u00ad tigation and ~rovides recommendations as to the terms of probation. High-risk offenders are identified on the basis of several of the following characteristics: Significant mental or emotional problems; Anti-social attitudes; Relatively unstable family or living environment; Situational pressure or stress; Relatively limited personal assets; Numerous prior criminal offenses. Probation terms for high-risk offenders include one-year probation; written essays on topics related to the offense; court-conducted educa\u00ad tional classes/regular meetings with volunteer probation counselor; and monthly reports about educational and employment activities. Other special terms of probation incluQed are based on the needs of individual offenders. On the basis of the presentence investigation, interviews with the offender, and the interpretation of the psychological tests, the high\u00ad risk offenders who are considered amenable to assignment to a volunteer 342 are further classified according to their needs: Suitable Adult Model The probationer lacks a suitable adult model with whom he can identify. The youth needs assistance in planning for the future and clarifying his role in the community. By far the greatest number of pro\u00ad bationers fall into this category--about 65 percent. Friend-Companion Some probationers are unable to relate well to older volunteers. Often the youthful offender is rebelling against the family an'd/or community. A crucial need is for a dependable friend who he or she can trust. Approximately 10 percent of the probationers fail into this category. Supervision A small proportion (about 5%) of probationers are persons with very limited personal assets. A basic goal is to maintain their functioning in the com\u00ad munity outside of an institution. They need assistance with very basic skills in living, such as managing finances, obtaining and keeping employment, and finding suitable recreational outlets. Primary Counseling The probationer has personal and/or emotional problems which can be aided by talking about them. He is verbal with some insight into himself and the causes of his problems. Furthermore, the youth experiences r'elief through talking and may be able to make some changes in himself by talking through the problems. Roughly 20 per\u00ad cent of probationers have this need. Orientation, Assignment and Counseling The emphasis on responsibility-taking begins with the Order of Pro\u00ad bation, which is a written contract signed by both the judge and the offender. The judge advises the defendant of the specific, individual\u00ad ized probation program, and the offender makes the voluntary choice of accepting the terms of probation, or rejecting probation and receiving punishment. If the offender accepts the terms of probation, both the 343 e ., I judge and he sign the Order of Probation. This approach places the burden OT decision-making on the offender. The opportunity to make decisions has much appeal to an offender whose rebellious and nonconforming behavior is motivated by a striving for independence as well as the self-satisfaction of being in a position to exercise some control over what happens to him. It is noted that less mature offenders tend to perceive probation as an easy alternative to punishment, rarely bothering to pay much attention to the specific terms of probation. Staff counse'!or and probationer begin meeting within a week after the probation hearing. Three to five weekly meetings are usually necessary to clarify terms of probation, communicate expectations, and deal with any existing crisis situations. A written essay is assigned and discussed with the probationer. The probationer is enrolled ;1 one of the educational classes as soon as possible, The staff counselor gains additional impressions about the kind of volunteer probation counselor who should be assigned to the probationer. The staff counselor provides a model for mature problem-solving and makes it tlear that the probationer will have to abide by the probation program, HOlever, if the probationer does not succeed, the opportunity tv sit down at:l talk about the situation and suggest possible solutions and alternativ.;s is avialable. Most high-risk offenders are confident of success, usually because they do not see any problems with their behavior, and agree readily to abide by the probation terms. The indivi\u00ad dual is given the chance to prove that successful probation can be achieved, rather than being threatened by an authority figure, By accepting and respecting the offender, an important foundation is made for dealing with future problems. The counseling relationship is the most significant element of the program because more immediate attention to individual needs is possible, and the amount of direct contact with the individual offender is greater. The. change process through counseling is predicated upon two assumptions: (a) that continuing contact facilitates the development of trust and greater acceptance of useful advice from the counselol'; and (b) that the 344 most significant change will occur during periods of crisis where moti\u00ad vation to change is maximized. The crisis intervention model of behavior change assumes that moti\u00ad vation for char.ge in behavior is present only intermittently and for a short period of time, usually four to six weeks. When external or interne1l pressures produce emotional discomfort, a probationer is motivated to reduce the emotional stress. The volunteer counselors are trnined in crisis intervention techniques in order to recognize the feeling of the probationer and deal with them; to identify precipitating factors and be\u00ad havior used to cope with these feelings; to seek alternative ways to react to or solve problems; to persuade the probationer to initiate new and more effective means of coping; and to reinforce newly-learned and more acceptable behavior. It has been observed that the time taken for arrest, conviction, and probation may be a significant inducement for the change process, particularly if the case is processed rapidly (in less than four to six weeks). In order to take advantage of the motivation for change induced by this crisis situation, the individual should be assigned to probation programming as soon as possible. If a delay occurs, the individual is likely to be exposed to the same family and peer pressures which have contributed to the maladaptive behavior, making change more difficult to achieve. Two basic learning tasks are impressed upon probationers during counseling. One deals with assuming responsibility for one's self and behavior, a necessary condition for a satisfactory participation in society. Many offenders avoid responsibility-taking by blaming bad luck, fate, authority, or other persons for the personal problems. Some youthful offenders shirk responsibility in order to behave im\u00ad maturely and engage in pleasure-seeking behavior. Many times the offender will engage in risk-taking or adventurous behavior with little regard for the consequences, including possible harm to other people. The offender must learn to accept responsibility for his acts, especially the effect on other persons. If the individual does not accept responsi\u00ad bility, he cannot control his own behavior and cannot be expected to 345 initiate meaningful change in himself. Before the individual can derive self-satisfaction for meaningful change in his behavior, he must feel responsible for what he has done. Responsibllity-taking is a necessary condition for setting goals, taking the initiative, following through, and accepting consequences for behavior, both rewards and punishments. A realistic understanding of one's self and life situation is an\u00ad other essential condition for successful participation in the community. Low self-esteem, often caused by poor child~rearing practices or con\u00ad tinued failure in experiences with societal expectations (at school or on the job) pY'event the individual from looking at himself realistically and objectively. The person remains severely handicapped because he can\u00ad not accurately perceive his own abilities and cannot assess his impact upon other persons in interpersonal relationships. Some youthful offen\u00ad ders exaggerate their own self worth and often engage in grandiose schemes which show little common sense, poor judgement, or no planning ahead. Other offenders develop an attitude of resignation, based upon both fear of failure and fear of success. The insecure offender feels threatened by goal-setting since he has typically failed in the past. He has either experienced punishment for failure, or has not been re\u00ad warded for success. Self-doubt, expectation of rejection from others, and fear of pun\u00ad ishment are typical attitudes which produce feelings of distrust and resentment toward otller people and society. The individual may resort to manipulation and exploitation of others as a way to protect himself from perceived threatening surroundings. A basic lack of trust in others is prominent. If the individual can develop a sense of trust in others, a valuable mode for modifying faulty perceptions and expec\u00ad tations will be pt'esent. Some degree of real istic self-worth must exist before the individual can risk experimenting with alternative and more effective behavior. When a person is able to perceive himself (es\u00ad pecially his feelings, needs, and expectations) more realistically, he is able to perceive where he stands with respect to society. Only then can he begin to learn how to satisfy himself in socially approved ways . 346 VOLUNTEER SELECTION AND SUPERVISION One of the key features of the Lincoln V01unteer Probation CQunselor Program is the care taken in selecting volunteers. The selection process begins at the ~Qcruiting stage and continues through the screening proce\u00ad dures, followeQ by evaluation of volunteer performance to determine whether reassignment is desirable. There is a great temptation for programs to use the \"shotgun\" approach in sol iciti ng vol unteer workers, probably a result of the feeling that any kind of assistance is better than none. The Lincoln approach contradicts this theory, and the out\u00ad comes of the Lincoln program attest to the benefits which stem from careful selection of volunteer participants. Recruitment Some communities have a history of \"volunteer spirit\" to fill many different kinds of needs. In these communities, finding enough bodi\\:s for a volunteer probation counselor program should not be difficult, and the emphasis should be on selective recruiting. Volunteer \"bureaus\" are likely to be found in areas having a high degree of volunteer spirit. Such bureaus serve as \"brokers\" in provid\u00ad ing volunteers for hospitals, the mentally retarded, the physically handicapped, and otherwi se underpri vil eged persons. These bureaus generally screen all of their applicants as to general qualifications and are therefore an excellent source. Contacts with volunteer bureaus can be made directly. Churches and reiigious organizations are a second source of volun\u00ad teers. Here, the initial contact can be made with ministers, rabbis, and other congregation leaders to determine whether there is sufficient interest and time. The program can be described at church meetings and the name of a program person to contact can be made available at this time. With the cautionary note to avoid selecting individuals who are solely motivated by their religious affiliations, religious organizations can generally provide an excellent source of volunteers. 347 A third source of volunteers is graduate students in communities in which universities are located nearby. Graduate students in social and educational psychology and other types of social work can gain useful experience working with probationers in a volunteer relationship, and this can bring counseling skills to the program which would not be present in \"lay\" counselors. Talking to graduate classes, posting notices on bulletin boards, and obtaining the interest and support of the graduate faculty are three means of tapping this source of volunteers. In some cases, course ~redit can be offered to certain graduate stud~nts for program pa rtic i pa ti on. Althoug~ age and maturity are constraints, the use of Undergraduate students in a volunteer probation counselor program is a possibility. However, with some exceptions, the Lincoln program reports that under\u00ad graduate students lack the ability to maintain a sufficiently high level of motivation and interest to be successful volunteer counselors. This is not surprising in view of the fact that, in contrast to graduate students, undergraduates generally do not focus on one area of study and are involved in many different types of extra-curricular actiVities. Community service groups offer yet another source of volunteers. Leaders of such groups are often community leaders, and their support for the program can provide a large network of communication to dis\u00ad seminate information about the program. If it can be arranged, program personnel should try to be present at meetings of thew Ol'ganizations to describe the program in some detail in an informal t.llk. This format enables interested parties to respond immediately, perhaps even receiving an application form. Questions about the program can also be answered at such meetings. Retired perso~s also make excellent volunteers, particularly where the assets of patience and \"wisdom of age\" are desired. Working with youthful offenders enables older volunteers to keep up with the problems of youth and to feel th\u20ac\"t they can still contribute to the well-being of the community. Some jurisdictions may have organization\" and associa\u00ad tions of retired persons which can be tapped for volunteers. Where these 348 do not exist, the best approach to attract these individu~ls to the program is through word-of-mouth. Pt'ofessional organizations, reprHsenting occupations sV;h as teachers, accountants, businessmen, and social workers can be approached to recruit volunteers. These persons may be particularly suited for \"volunteer specialist\" roles such as job and educational development, where a full counseling relationship is not required. Additionally, their time may be sought to per'form clerical and other office tasks which would not in\u00ad vol ve a major commi tment to counsel i ng, Bl ue-coll make excell ent vol unteers. Servi ce station personnel, construction workers, and bus drivers are examples 0\" possible sources which may be tapped directly, or with the assistance of labor unions. Many volunteer candidates are likely to be referred by program staff and court personnel. In particular, judges are excellent re\u00ad cruiters, and they lend much respect to a program, especially during its formative stages. As a supplement to each of the sources discussed, individual word\u00ad of-mouth is an indispensable means of recruiting volunteers. Com\u00ad munication about a program betw~en friends and acquaintances will vir\u00ad tually assure a continual source of volunteer applicants. Screening and Selection of Volunteers A successful volunteer program requires an adequate supply of volunteer workers. In general, it may be said that it is not difficult in most communities to attract a pool of applicants. In this section the aim will be to describe the procedures for screening, selecting and assessing the qualifications of volunteers, as a basis for matching volunteers with probationers. ~~'reeni no I One of the key e1ements in a successful volunteer program is the care taken in screening volunteer applicants. An intensive, multiple screening process is recommended. In Lincoln, screening consists of four stages: the application form, an interview with the Volunteer Coordinator, psychological testing, and performance during training. 349 ~ , One might ask if volunteers will be discou' 1~J\"\\d by 1ntensive screen\u00ad i ng. The ,!.i nco 1 n experi ence i ndi ca tes that most rna ture volunteers react favorably to car'eful and ri gorous sel ect ion procedures. Mature persons appreciate an organized and efficient program that is willing to spend extra t.ime and take great care ;n the selection process. The greater the amount of effort required of the individual in order to get into the program, the more likely he or she is to remain committed to th,e program. There is honor and prestige associated with being selected to serve as a volunteer probation counselor. Rigorous screening procedures are very useful in screening out less reliable individuals. The Application Form The application form seeks information of the following types: Age, occupation, biographical information; Community affiliations and social organizations; Prior experience working with young people; Prior experience in a counseling role or as a volunteer with another agency; Three personal references; Future plans, especially with regard to how long the applicant plans to remain in the community; Family situation, marital status; Attitude toward probation, the law, and deviant behavior; , Reason or motivation for volunteering; Sensitivity to personality characteristics and needs of this age group; Commitment to serving for a period of one year working for at least one hour a week on behalf of offenders assigned by the COlll\"t, The Interview The next step is an interview with the Volunteer Coordinator. The applicant sends in the completed application form ~nd asks for an interview. The staff person reviews the .::.pplication and pre\u00ad pares for the interview by noting any topics which need clarification. At this face-to-face meeting the Volunteer Coordinator has the oppor- 3liO tunity to form an impression about the personality characteristics of the volunteer. The Coordinator assesses such qualities as the following: Wa;-mth, openness, and, acceptance vs. coo') ness, aloof\u00ad ness, and closed-mindedness, Self-confidence, maturity vs. uncertainty, insecurity, The individua;'s ability w handle anxiety, and shoul d seek ans~:ers to questions such as: Does the individual appear to be overly talkative a(.J hyperactive or very passive and shy? Is the applicant overly contrite, pl(~asing, and obedient? What does the person do if the Volunteer Coordinator disagrees with the applicant? Does the person become hostile, critical, threatened? Is the individual flexible in thought, alert mentally, spontaneous, and able to think on his feet? Does he appear to have good practical judgement? What kinds of attitudes and opinions does he express toward punishmr \"t? How does the \\'''I'son react to deviant or unacceptable behavior? Will the applicant be able to continue to communicate acceptance and feel comfortable working with the youthful offender even when the offender does not cooperate and often rejects advice? By the end of the interview, the staff person has a reasonably good idea about whether ,,:~ exclude the person 'Immediately from the program or to pass him to the next stage. If it seems unl i kely the person will be a suita~le volunteer probation counselor, the Volunteer Co\u00ad ordinator will discuss other possible roles within the program. Persons who are accepted nt this stage as applicants for ~he pro\u00ad gram are advi'sed when the next training series for volunteer probation counselors \\~ill be held. They are given a fict'ional, case history in tne form of a presentence investigation and a series of study quest'ions. The individuals are asked to look over the information and formulate 351 '\", answers to questions in prepara~ion for the training series. Psychological Evaluation A paper and pencil personality inventory which requires between 45 and 60 minutes to complete is routinely administered to volunteer appli\u00ad cants. This is the same test administered to defendants in the pre\u00ad sentence investigation. Brief inspection of the resulting test profile by a qualified psychologist will detect gross distortions of person- ality and provide other relr'vant information about personality functioning. The psychological test requires a little staff time and provides valuable information not only for the selection process but also for the process of matching volunteer with probationer. The role of psychological testing in the selection procedure should not be underestimated. It is a much needed supplement to the interviewing process as a means of making sound decisions about personality characteris\u00ad tics and the poss i bil i ti es for bei ng successful i r, a counsel i ng role. Because the volunteer program must select and ','ecruit a variety of dif\u00ad ferent kinds of persons with many different ~.inds of backgrounds, it is almost inevitable that some problems and limitations will result if only staff interviewing is used for selection. A much sounder approach is to utilize multiple sources of information in order to provide a better overall perspective and more objective information on personality characteristics associated with responsib'il ity-taking, self control, tolerance, flexibility, self-acceptance, and social poise. Performance During Training The fourth and last stage in the s~reening process is t~d applicant's performance .::uring training. After the individual has successfully passed through the interview and psychological testing phase, his or her per\u00ad formance in the training series is carefully assessed. The general demeanor of the person in group situations is noted by professional staff. Modes of interacting with other volunteers and staff persons are also observed. Staff are better able to get a feeling for the way the real person comes across through their contacts with the person in the training series. Some areas of interest include whether the individual exercises a leadership role in small groups. Does the person tolerate 352 disagreements from others? Will the person become defensive if a suggestion of his is rejected? Or, will the person appear to be hurt? Will the person continue to push a point of view even to the extent that other people are becoming noticeably offended? Does the behavior indicate that his thinking is on the rigid and not vey,y flexible side? Will the individual accept new and different ideas? Does the individual seem to grasp essential features of the instructional material? . How well does the persun respond to the demands in the role playing situation? Selection \u00b7The screening process provides the necessary information to make sound judgements on the selection of probation counselors. In summary, those selected are capable people who meet certain minimal standards. They are dependable, responsible, conscientious, and honest. They main\u00ad tain a productive and stable role in the community. They possess good common sense and practical judgement. As individuals, they are secure in their own identity. They are likeable, able to get along with pl'oba-tit tion staff, and possess a minimal level of interpersonal skills. Follow- ing are some of the most common reasons for excluding individuals from the role of volunteer: Dishonesty in completing application form; Prior criminal offense record, unless the individual is r~habilitated through the probation program; Presence of mental and/or emotional problems; Poor personal stability, including: marginal members of the community who suddenly develop an intere~t in counseling others even though their own long-term adjustment to the community has been poor; persons experiencing a temp~rary personal crisis or significant change ;n life situation, such as going through a divorce; Inabi'iity to make a commitment for one full year, with the exception of some college students who may be able to work during the academic school year; 353 Joine\\'s: individuals who beiong to many different com\u00ad munity organizations but rarely bother to contribute much to any given one; Inappropriate motivation which stems from: personal whim, a desire to reduce boredom, a willingness to be recruited as a personal favor to a friend rather than to any commitment to the program, an axe to grind, or a desire to pUnish w\\\"ong\" doers; Persons associated with the criminal justice system, including police officers, attorneys, etc. are rarely able to function very successfully as counselors. The offender typically per\u00ad ceives these individuals as authority figures and has an extremely difficult time forming a relationship ba.sed on trust. However, these in~ividuals may give great assistance with educational classes or in other roles. Also, prominent mem\u00ad bers of the community are often asked to become volunteer probation counselors. They will often accept the invitation and be genuinely motivated to do a good job as a counselor. Unfortunately, these individuals may be involved with many different kinds of activities so that they simply do not have enough time to be effective as volunteer counselors. Although they probably make a conscientious effort, conflicts in schedul\u00ad ing results in missed appointments or inability to deal with personal crisis when needed. Assessment of Volunteer Qualifications As a result of the four-stage screening process a significant amount of data are obtained about the volunteer which are essential in making a suitable match with an offender. Certain obvious demographic data concerning age, occupational status, ethnic status and interests are available. Interests, hobbies and recreational likes and dislikes are known, Personal characteristics such as patience, dedication, and resourcefulness can be assessed, as can interpersonal sensitivity, 354 I' , counseling skill and professional training in counseling. Finai v, a great deal is known about personality features and capabilities for relating to diFferent types of probationers. Supervision Joint meetings between the Volunteer Coordinator and probation staff are necessary in order to clarify realistic expectations for the relationships. After the volunteer counselor has been assigned, the staff member generally does not interfere or meet with the offender. If emergencies or crises occur, the staff member should talk first with the volunteer and try to have the volunteer deal with the situation. If this is not possible, then the staff person will intervene. Three progress meetings between staff and vol unteers are sch'edu'J ed during the probationary year. These meetings occur after four weeks\" about six months, and about one month or less before the end of the probationary period. The staff member receives monthly progress reports and occasionally talks with the volunteer probation counselor. ~lost. of the intensive contact occurs early in the probationary period, until the relationship has been stabilized. Part of the role of the Volunteer Coordinator is to determine whether the volunteers are getting constructive supervision by the staff. If probl ems ari se with the staff p~rsons, the Vol unteer Coordi nator meets with the individual involved to help clarify and resolve any problems,. The sensitivity and interpersonal skills of the Volunteer Coordinator' are called into play to deal with the situational problems tactfully. Matching meetings are held, in which all staff members participclte. All staff members' contributions and suggestions are elicited and are given careful consideration in matching volunteers to probationers. This reinforces and rewards the staff for participating in the program\u00ad ming and provides further opportunity for the resolution of conflicts and problems with particular volunteers. ,Two basic approaches to staff caseload assignment exist. In one, all probation staff have some paper caseloads, most of whom work directly with volunteers. Using this approach, the staff member who is responsible for 355 that case works with the volunteer probation counselor assigned to that case as necessary. This involvement of all the probation staff with volunteers leaves the Volunteer\" Coordinator free to shift between work\u00ad ing with groups of volunteer counselors, attending to other programmatic activities, and dealing with any conflicts or problems between staff and volunteer counselors. The other alternative is for the Volunteer Coordinator to have primary responsibility for working directly with all volunteers and probationers, leaving less time for involvement with other probation activities. The choice depends primarily on whether staff persons are able to work effectively with volunteers in a supervisory capacity. If not, then the Volunteer Coordinator should probably assume the supervisory role over all volunteers. If volunteer counselors, work with i ndi vi dua 1 staff , several factors should be considered. Neophyte staff members are likely to be uncertain of their role and somewhat insecure. It is well worth the time and eff'Jrt to make certain that veteran volunteer counselors are assigned to work with the new staff person. The experienced and capable volun\u00ad teer probation counselo~ is very willing to assist new staff and help orient the individual to the role. As a result, the staff person will 1 earn to appredate the vol unteer and to understand the vol unteer' s strengths. If all staff c1re \"experienced, it is desirable to have a certain balance with respect to the persons assigned to each staff member. Thus, experienced counselors should probably be d\"ivided equally among staff. Some staff resent having to spend much extra time with newly trained volunteer counselors and begin to resent other' staff who have a caseload made up of volunteers who will require very little attention. The best comb~nation finds each staff member assigned a few excellent counselors, several veteran or experienced counselors, some borderline 'counselors, and a few newly trained volunteers. 356 Several guidelines have been developed by the Lincoln program re\u00ad garding staff who may find ,.ifficulty wor'king with volunteers. If the characteristics described below can be identified by staff before a program is implemented, measures can be: taken to minimize problems once the program ~egins. \u00b7 Some staff may see punishment as a way of dealing with deviant be\u00ad havior. Persons who perceive their ro\"e as authoritarian fit into this group. Often the individual is very talented and has many years of ex\u00ad perience working with offender populations, but the kinds of experiences they have had ~ay lead them to expect the worst from most offenders. Furthermore, the staff person comes by his perceptions and biases honestly, i.e., they've seen so many criminals that they have a certain point of view which cannot be overcome. This individual feels that strict terms of proba~ion and punishment through revocation are most likely to be effective in meaningful change. This philosophy is cor\u00ad tradictory to that of a successful volunteer pro~ation counselor program. \u00b7 Unless a staff person has some rudimentary knowledge of basic con\u00ad cepts in counseling, the needed sensitivity towards the volunteer or supervision for the counseling relationship is not likely to be present. \u00b7 The staff person needs to be open minded and able to see some value in different approaches to handling probationers. The rigid person often refuses to accept new ideas and valuable contributions from the volun\u00ad teer who brings a different perspective to the working situation. \u00b7 The staff person who is insecure in his or her own personal identity or whose role is poorly defined, is likely to have a very difficult time determining where the staff role ends and that of the volunteer begins. Consequently, there is a struggle between them in deciding who should perform which functions. The insecure staff person is simply preoccupied with so many duties as to be unable to devote needed time to work effec\u00ad tively with volunteers. \u00b7 Unless the staff person has some sensitivity to the kinds of per\u00ad sonal needs end behavior patterns of y(Junger p:~I'SQnS, juJgment of pro\u00ad gress in volunteer counseling relationships will be difficult. 357 The Volunteer Coordinator needs to be familiar with the perception by other staff members of the volunteer counselors and the modes of re\u00ad lating to the volunteers used by different staff people, since the way the staff person perceives the volunteer is a major factor influencing the vOlunteer's performance. Insecure staff members often perceive the volunteer as a threat: if the lay vOlunteer can do as well or better than the staff member, the staff member may see himself or herself as expendable. Another temptation of the staff is to perceive the volu~\u00ad teers as a 1 uxury, not to be taken sel' i ously. Thi s attitude must be overcome for the program to be successful. It is most desirable to have staff perceive volunteers as assets, friends, colleagues, and accord them equal status and respect for the uniqueness of their role and contribution to the program. Evauation of Volunteer Performance One of the important components of managing a volunteer probation counselor program is the evaluation of each volunteer's performance. For new volunteers, this is done to determine whether the assignment to a probationer was suitable and to identify serious problems which may re\u00ad quire termination of the r~lationship or dismissal of the volunteer. Experienced volunteers should be evaluated to ensure their continued motivation and to determine whether they have become too lax or casual in their relationships. Evaluation of volunteer performance in the aggregate can enable program management to refine its screening, selection, and training procedures. Although the screening, selection, training, and match1ing procedures recommended in this manual will minimize the chance that misdirected or misinformed volunteers will be selected for the program and assigned to a relationship with a probationer, this may nevertheless occur occa\u00ad sionally; otherwise evaluation of volunteer performance would be un\u00ad necessary, and only a minor supervisory effort would be needed. It should be emphasized, however, that every effort shoulq be made to maintain a match, as long as the needs of the probationer are being met. Each 35tl relationship can expect difficult periods and crises, and in one sense, the absence of these may suggest that the relationship is not progressing, and change is not occurring. Thus care must be taken not to terminate a relationship on the basis of temporary setbacks. Several checkpoints exist to evaluate volunteers' performance. One very important criterion is the regular submission of monthly progress reports on the probationer, particularly for the newer volun\u00ad teers. Thi scan i ndi ca te a hi gh 1 eve 1 of interest and consci enti ousness on the part of the volunteer, both factors being important to the rela\u00ad tionship. The occasional failure of an experienced volunteer to submit a monthly written report is no particulay' cause for alarm, however. Another important element in the evaluation of volunteers' perfor\u00ad mance is the manner in which problem and crisis situations at'e handled. The inexperienced volunteer should generally seek the assistance of a staff member in handling serious problems, such as rearrest, reports of further cY'iminal activity, or severe domestic or family problems. The experienced volunteer <s better equipped to handle these kinds of situations alone, although the real criterion for judging any volunteer's performance is based on the volunteer's recognition of situations which require professional intervention. A third evaluative criterion is the extent to which a volunteer interacts with other volunteers in sharing ideas and problems. The periodic volunteer seminars are designed for this purpose and should be attended by both experienced and novice volunteers. Interaction and cooperation with probation staff is also important to the performance of volunteers. For example, advice on the availability and use of other community resources on benalf of the probationer should be sought in most cases; probation staff represent an excellent source of information about other agencies which may fulfill certain probationer needs. In addition to the possibility of an incorrect assessment of a volunteer's suitability to the program, events may occur in the volunteer's private life which may adversely affect the relationship with a probationer. Domestic problems, the loss of a job, or job 359 pressures may cause the valunteel' to give a lower priority to Hle pre> bationer relationship, resulting in missed meetings a;;d anxiety in those meetings which do take place. Conversely, the probationer's suitability to the program may have been incorrectly assessed. An incorrigible youth will not respond to any relationship. However, the program philosophy and procedures are designed under the assumption that youth who can benefit from a relation\u00ad ship with a volunteer counselor will be identified. Thus, although cases may occur in which failure in the relationship result despite the best efforts of the volunteer, these are likely to be rare. If an unfavorable evaluation of a volunteer's performance occurs, three basic options exist: The volunteer is terminated from the pt'ogram; The volunteer remains in the pool, but is reassigned to non-counseling duties; The volunteer remains in the pool and is reassigned at some later date. The first option is exercised in severe situations which occur with re\u00b7l a ti ve infrequency. The second opti on is a 1 mas t tantamount to the first, but it provides a gentler way of removing ~omeone from the pro\u00ad gram. In some instances, the volunteer may graciously accept a less prestigious assignment such as a non-counseling job. The third option-\u00ad reassignment at a later date--would generally be exercised if there were a temporary interruption in the volunteel\"s ability to serve as a counse\u00ad lor, but the basic desirable qualities remain. Dismissal in this case would result in the loss of a potentially valuable asset to the program. It is important to point out that the needs of the probationer are paramount in ~ny decision regarding reassignment or dismissal of a volun\u00ad teer. If the probationer is highly motivated and desirous of a relation\u00ad ship, every effort should be made to improve the relationship prior to taking action. If another volunteer is available and can be suitably matched with the probationer, this may be the best course of action. 360 Whether another volunteer is assigned of course depends on the length of time remaining on the probationary period. Discussions with the Volun\u00ad teer Coordinator or staff are undertaken bj the probationer to resol ve this issue. 361 Bibliography Barker, Gordon H. and Matson, Ronald H.

Regrettably, there are not enough probation officers available to provide effective service. Caseloads average well over 100 per officer\u00ad far in excess of recommended standards. Many courts have no probation services. Social work schools are incapable of producing enough trained probation workers to fill the gap. Citizens can help by assisting the probation department of the family or juvenile court. A case in point: in all of Holland, there are only 400 probation officers. But for each professional, there are ~ 20 volunteers-citizens who recognize the need for helping youth in trouble. The Task: Many delinquent boys and girls have not had stable family lives. They have not come into contact with adults who were able to give them supervision, affection, guidance, and morale boosting support. Such youngsters need the supportive aid of a friendly, interested adult to whom they can talk without fear. Men and women, who are mature and understanding, can aid over\u00ad worked officers able to give only scant attention to these young people. Many family and juvenile courts would welcome volunteer help from civic-minded organizations, Undoubtedly, a large percentage of your organization'~ members are parents who have had the experience of bring\u00ad ing up their own youngsters. They can serve by devoting a number of hours each month to seeing\u00ad and helping~ a young boy or ~irl. 363 _#<_ -''';:'''--... r Use the Rod and Spoil The \u00b7Child. That's the reverse of thla old saying, \"Spa re the rod and spoi 1 the chil d.\" But according to research by Dr. Kalph S. Welsh of Bridgeport, Conn., it is also the truer statement. He examined the upbringing of young criminals brought into a Connecti\u00ad cut juvenile court. They came not from permissive homes, but rather from homes in which severe parental punishment \\lias practiced. There even was d marked correlation between the nature of the youngster's crimes and the nature of puni shment meted out to them by theii' parents in their formative years. The most aggressive crimes were committed by juveniles whose parents had beaten them '.~ith belts and boards and other objects for the slig,ltest wrong doing. The youngsters who com\u00ad mitted less aggressive crimes, such as running away or misbehaving in school, had been punished by their parents, but in less brutalizing ways. Why does the ol'd idea of beating a child into good behavior fail to work? When you punish a child physically or even verbally, you enrage him. He doesn't concentrate on changing his behavior, but rather on hating you -and himself. He wants to get even, but he is small and defenseless so the only way he has of getting revenge is by being bad. Parents who teach hatred and brutality through their methods of punish\u00ad ment are rearing children who will apply these lessons to others in the future. (Chicago Tribune) 364 VOLUNTEERS . ADULT AND YOUTH BRING A FRESH DIMENSION *Mary Lilly Sage Volunteer Coordinator Training School for Boys, Skillman Division of Correction and Parole It is odd the manner in which fate plays an important role in our lives! Why do we say this? No one could have foreseen on that day on December 22, 1968, when the first delivery of Christmas presenta was made to the School for the few boys then in residence, that almost three years later, the volunteer program would have enrolled the services of 1050 - clocking 19,496 hours -in one year alone -July 1, 1970, through June 30, 1971. On the other hand, we could not fail, as Dr. Alfred B. Vuoco10, Superintendent, has from the beginning stated the philosophy that \"Re\u00ad habilitative activities are quite meaningless unless they are consciously geared toward the post-iTistitutiona~ future that awaits the child. This demands not only preparing the boy for the path ahead, but also some changing of the path itself insofar as is practicable. The staff is expected to constructively identify and merge family and societal strengths for the boy to better obtain sOlCial viability. It also means that the in\u00b7' stitution must be oriented outward and consider itself part of the broader community. It is expected that the Training School will be an open insti\u00ad tution providing citizens with an opportunity for service and itself serving the surrounding community. We 100k to numerous programs with extensive in\u00ad teraction between the School and society ... and the heavy involvement of *Skillman is fortunate indeed to have the services of Mrs. Sage whose back\u00ad ground in education and the social services, as well as her concern for people, make her a unique Volunteer. A former school teacher, she has also done extensive volunteer work for the Red Cross, and later served as Executive Director and Directol' of Red Cross Youth in Princeton, until her retirement from that position in 1969. As this report indicates, she has certainly not retired from public service. We underscore the statement of Dr. Alfred Vuocolo, Training School Superin\u00ad tendent, that \"A very special note of recognition is due to Mrs. Geoffrey Sage for all of her efforts on behalf of the Training School through her completely voluntary service as Coordinator of Volunteers.\" 365 L _______ ________ volunteers. Fundamental to this approach is the clear demonstration to the boy that his fellow citizens are not hostile toward him and, by the example of help and understanding, symbolize the forces of society which are interested not in avenging delinquent acts but in preventing them.\" EVen more fundamental is his concept that the problem child is \"the product and responsibility of the community and society at large\" and, considering this as our basic objective, we set about to organize a volun\u00ad teer program that would provide meaningful participation in all the service areas of the School by volunteers of all ages, with varied economic, cul\u00ad tural and social status, and with different skills, abilities and training. Here was the opportunity to make maximum use of our human potential and resources. Gr. Vuocolo and his Staff had established the need for a vol\u00ad unteer program, so necessary st'eps were to be found to structure a sound program and effectively utilize the services of the persons -\"people who CARE\" -so they can see the Schilol as a place to make an important contri\u00ad bution to mankind through volunteering. Mr. Gary J. Hilton, Sr., Assistant Superintendent, organized a volunteer Council in January, 1969 (the S,chool opened December 9, 1968), made up of people who had shown an interest in the School. From January, 1969, we met mont.hly, discussing the \"usia of voluntee'is,\" and in September, 1969, the Office of Volunteers was established or rather officially became iden\u00ad tified as a part of the whole Sichool program, under the guidance of a Vol\u00ad untee,\" Coordinator. \\~e were on our way, bringing a freshness and a variety of approaches and experiences tlJ correctional work which may be more diffi\u00ad cult for those within the system to generate. We haven't read the textbook and we are not encumbered byex[perience! However, we studied carefully the organizational structure, the p!hilosophy of the School, the areas in which we could meet the need, and reco9nized the importance of having all programs and services of volunteers approved by the respective Heads of Departments. Volunteer services vary from re'!atively simple ones to ones that require professional training. But wh'ichever -individual or group participation - every volunteer receives orientation covering the history of the School, the 366 child served by the School, a tour of the School, a review of its philo\u00ad sophy, and speciflc training for the area in which he or she will be per\u00ad forming service. We have \"Staff-Volunteers\" working side by side with \"Civilian-V~lunteers.\" The Volunteer Coordinator is responsible to the Ass'fS-Earii: Superintendent, and co-chairs with him the Staff-Volunteer Committee which meets once a month. The Volunteer Coordinator also serves as Supervisor of all Volunteers. EVERY volunteer program is cleared and approved by the resp.ective Head of each Depo.t'tment. We have received tre\u00ad mendous support from EVERY Staff member, and to this we can attribute the success of the Volunteer program. The State of New Jersey is \"Our Community,\" and we have endeavored to interest folks far away as well as near at home. The N.J. State Feder\u00ad ation of Women's Clubs has adopted as a State project support of the Vol\u00ad unteer Program at the School. The N.J. State Federation of Garden Clubs, the Princeton Soroptimist Club, the Princeton Woman's Club, the Hopewell Valley Woman's College Club, the Montgomery Woman's Club, and the Ameri\u00ad can Businessmen's Association have adopted us as their annual project. Financial. support of the volunteer office is presently maintained by spe\u00ad cial contributions -to name a few: 92 patrons for Achievement Award Day (the volunteer office underwrote the monetary and the gift awards); Princeton University Chapel presented a Sunday morning collection; David R. Sarnoff Laboratories, a Holiday Card Fund to underwrite a radio system on campus; a benefit by the American Association of University Women; a gift from the Church Council of Women of Pennington; a gift from the Rider College Faculty Wives; a gift from the Women's Auxiliary, Lions Club of Princeton; a gift from the Mercer County Educational Secretaries Associa\u00ad tion, the Monmouth Legal Secretaries Association, plus countless numbers of individual contributions. Particular mention is made of the \"behind the scenes\" programs which require financial support, such as, a Birthday Cake for every boy; schools from allover the State who fill the 200 Christmas stockings, provide the candy for the \"200\" Easter baskets ... the eight-foot and four-foot artificial Christmas trees for each cottage, the Chapel, the Dining Area, the Music Room, the Professional Service 367 Department, and the Library, and a 27-inch tree for every classroom, plus 67 pairs of skates, books for the cottages, games for use in recreation ... baseball equipment .. and special treats of box lunches to take on a trip, knitted afghans for the beds in-one cottage, knitted beanies to cover the ears, draw strings bags for carry-alls, jigsaw puzzles, the playground equipment by the New Jersey State Federation of Women's Clubs and the sound-proofing and wall-to-wall carpeting of the Music Room by the Prince\u00ad ton Soroptimist Club. We feel certain we have forgotten other projects! Meeting the needs, which means giving supportive help to the profes\u00ad sional staff for the child who finds himself rejected, unwanted, not loved or cared for, has been a real challenge. Service is operating in the areas listed below. PROFESSIONAL SERVICES: Family visiting -requested by the Social Worker. A boy becomes the friend of a family, who take him off-campus for a day, or overnight. The Social Worker gives a permission slip, indicating the time he is picked-up and rEturned. All regulations of the School are abided by. The families vary from those with seven children to those with no children, and those unmarried. A boy continues with his family until he is paroled, or some other event may. terminate the relationship. The Family decides the frequency of the visits, as some boys may also be visit\u00ad ing their own home. EDUCATION DEPARTMENT: Tutoring on an individual basis. Certified teachers do remedial reading and remedial arithmetic. Instructional as\u00ad sistants work with the Classroom Teacher. Yout.h serve during the su~er. Specially qualified volunteers serve in the Art and the Music Departments. We have two volunteers who visit twice a week to teach piano, and one vol\u00ad unteer who works specifically in ceramics. Also, special trips are arranged such as visits to research laboratories, fire departments, first aid squads, dairies, police departments, etc. 368 COTTAGE LIFE: A cottage is adopted by a group. Assignments to the cottages are approved by the Supervisor of Cottage Li,'o.1, based on the con\u00ad stellation of the group. Visits vary -monthly, semi-monthly, to weekly - or for those groups some distance away, perhaps four times a year. Con\u00ad stellation of groups vary -all college male, college male and female, teenage male and female, all adult, young adults, male and female. The cottage group listing show: youth Fellowship, Red Cross Youth, Girl Scouts, Boy Scouts, 4-H Club, Rainbow Girls, DeMolay Boys, Adult Church Groups, College Groups, High School Groups, Private School Groups, Women's Club Groups, and Catholic youth Adult Groups. Activities include baseball, basketball, games, arts and crafts, making cookies, making ice cream, kite making, etc. SPECIAL PROJECTS: Volunteers work with a group of boys chosen by the School in Arts and Crafts Projects, including Halloween decorations, Thanks\u00ad giving and Christmas projects to take home, and an Easter Egg Tree for the School. For the Communi~y, last year we decorated and made the decorations for an eight-foot artificial tree for the Princeton Public Library, and this year we are doing a four-foot tree for the Governor's Mansion at Morven. Through the Music Department, with the help of volunteers, we sang Christmas Carols in a Nursing Home and decorated the Pediatrics Ward of a local Hos\u00ad pital. A volunteer working with a group of boys, made the banners for the Chapel, and a special program was arranged by our School Chaplains for pre\u00ad sentation of the banners, in which the boys participated. CLUBS: The Botany Club had eight members and has completed the plant\u00ad ing around the front of the Adminsitration Building and the Gymnasium. This volunteer was a horticulturist with the New Jersey Turnpike. The Cooking Club has five members meeting weekly either at the School or the leader's private home. She has taken them to the 4-H Fair in Somerville. The Negro Airmen's International Club has 13 members. The Airmen had their first meeting with the boys on July 21, 1971, and will meet twice a month. All members of this club are qualified airmen, and some of them are taking their private plane from Newark or other airports, flying to the Princeton air- 369 port in order to get to the School for the meeting time of 7:30 p.m. A Vacation Bible School, was organized by our Reverend John Painter. There are 12 boys meeting every Tuesday and Thursday evening at the School. They hope to continue through the fall and winter months. The Leader is a vol\u00ad unteer from the Kingston Presbyterian Church, Kingston, New Jersey. Not under the Office of Volunteers, but organized by the Assistant Superinten\u00ad dent, and having volunteer leadership is the new group of Boy Scouts. RECREATION: The Supervisor of Recreation and the Volunteer Coordin\u00ad ator meet on a weekly basis to coordinate the volunteer visits with the School's recreational program. This alleViates overlapping, and we have the support of professional staff when a group visits the gymnasium or the swim\u00ad ming pool area. The volunteers have also supported the recreational depart\u00ad ment through monetary contributions. We are in the throes, presently, of planning an African Dance team to present a program for the School. VOLUNTEER COORDINATOR: We understand our position at the School. The task of the coordinator is a complex one, in that she must deal with a mul\u00ad titude of levels of organization. The job should begin with leadership ... we must try at all times to extract the best qualities of the volunteers and to elevate them to their maximum capabilities. We must do the job of train\u00ad ing ... and we must do the job of supervising the volunteers ... we must even be alert to good public relations ... we must earn the trust of the Staff and theVolunteer \". and we must, above all, \"learn to work with people\"! We do not have \"Written job titles or job descriptions\" as such ... but, we all get along together! As evidence of this on May 6, 1970, Or. Vuocolo wrote \"Within (its) brief history, a tradition of citizen involvement has already become in\u00ad grained and volunteer service is an essential element in the School's pro\u00ad gram. The response fromthe community has been overNhelming and on a scale that is unprecedented -at least for a correctional facility. It has been very heartwarming to witness the expenditure of time, energy and resources that have been made by so many organizations, including youth groups, on 370 behalf of the children who have ueen committed to our care. We prefer to think of our volunteers not as guests -but as co-workers in an organic partnership with the Training School staff to achieve the goals of restor\u00ad ing the boy to the community better equipped for constructive citizenship. No institution staff -no matter how numerous, proficient or talented - can perform this task alone. Whatis particularly noteworthy is that the volunteer assistancE has been offered so massively, creatively and freely and is of the self-giving type. Almost all are involved in ~upplying a personal contact for the boys and this ismostvital if the youngster needs to learn -quite literally -to be a person. The presence of volunteers also has an inestimable impact on staff morale and effectiveness. All of us employed here thank them for their genuine interest, their zeal and their many courtesies and labors while joining directly in the task of salvaging our mutual client, the delinquent boy.\" The Training Schooi for Boys, Skillman is New Jersey's newest resi den\u00ad tial facility for delinquent youth. Funds for its establishment were in\u00ad cluded in the 1964 Bond Issue for institutional construction. The School is located adjacent to the New Jersey Negro-Psychiatric Institute and accepts preteen boys who have been adjudicated delinquent by the County Juvenile Courts and committed to the Training School for Boys, Jamesburg. Its campus is located on some seventy-five acres and includes a Central Services Building, Chapel, a heating plant and twelve cottage living units. The design provides an environment for 190 boys that approx\u00ad imates community living in many respects. Education is the main activity of the boys and the aca:lemi c program opel'ates on a fully day, year-round basis for all residents. Delinquents are environmentally and/or psychologically disturbed with considerable overlap between the two typologies. With the preadolescent, removal from the home to a correctional institution by the court most often means that even a higher order of disturbance is present, usually evidenced by severe social, emotional and educational disadvantage. Prior to the opening of the Training School this age group was received at the Training School for Boys, Jalilesburg, becauseof its previous obligation to so wide an age range. The School's basic objective is to return the child to society with a greater potential for constructive adaptation in the community. Primary program goals are oriented toward evaluation, to discover and meet the needs 371 of the boys; remedial activity, to increase skills, eliminate deficien\u00ad cies, and create positive attitudes toward others, and social planning, aimed at placem;~nt of ear.h boy in i.Jn appropriate positive environment upon release. Methods fur fulfilling these goals involve clinical studies; positive managl:l1'ent of boys in a relatively controlled environment; special education; grOJp and individual therapy; providing opportunities for healthy relationships with adults; cO!1struct-;ve engagement of family a.ld community resources and continuous measurement and assessment of institutional pro\u00ad grams. A secondary purpose of the school is to provide a resource for uni versity-based tr.,~ i ni ng programs in various profess ions. 372 SUGGESTIONS FOR VOLUNTEERS THE TRAINING SCHOOL FOR BOYS, SKILLMAN, NEW JERSEY COTTAGE LiFE: Adult, college and youth participate in the cottage life program. During the fiscal year ... July 1, 1975 and June 30, 1974 ... 1092 visits were made '\" every cottage receiving visits. The visits occur on a monthly, twice a month, and a weekly schedule. Every group adheres to the schedule . (the ~;rst Wednesday, the second Tuesday, weekly every Wednesday) UNLESS for some reason they cancel ... OR ... The School is on \"break\". Normally, when the youngsters are leaving on a ten-day break, we do not schedule the volunteer group to come the evening before ... because the boys are preparing for leave. ALSO, the evening for the return of the boys, normally does not include the volunteer visit. AS YOU KNOW ... the time of return is 8:30 p.m., and certain procedures cancel the group visit. To maintain a weekly schedule requires MUCH, I~UCH PLANNING! Also, while refreshments are NOT the most important, the boys do enjoy the \"social aspects\" of this part of the program ... and look forward to this \"happy hour\". Dr. Alfred B. Vuoco10, Superintendent ... has fromfue inception of the School, December, 1968 .,. stated its philosophy: \"Rehabilitative activites are quite meaningless unless they are consciously geared toward the post-insti\u00ad tutional future that awaits the child. This demands not only preparing the boy for the path ahead, but also some changing of the path itself insofar as is practicable ... The staff is expected to constructively identify and merge family and societal strengths for the boy to better obtain social via\u00ad bility. (This is a part of the volunteer philosoph). It also means that the institution must be oriented outward and consider itself part of the broader community. It is expected that The Training School will be an open institution providing citizens wit~ an opportunity for service and itself serving the surrounding community.\" (here, is the volunteer again.) To continue, Dr. Vuocolo stated: \"We look to numerous programs with exten\u00ad sive interaction between The School and society .. and THE HEAVY INVOLVE\u00ad MENT OF VOLUNTEER,\" The \"1092\" visits show the interest of the volunteer groups .. and we MUST plan a constructive evening for the boys.

Upon second thought we will offer some suggestions for Chri stmas .. . Every cottage has an eight-foot artificial Christmas tree and a four-foot Christmas tree. One is generally placed in the recreational -dining area and the other on a table along the division in the dormitory area. Decora\u00ad tions for the tree are fun to make wHh the boys: 1. Anchovy cans '\" come in a long length (filets) and an oval style . , decorate the outs1de (scrubbed well, of course) with velvet ribbon (red, gold or gree) to match the width of the can. Arrange so it will hang. On the inside place your pictures, making a wall picture. Pictures can be cut from Christmas cards '\" or ~he small plastic figures (Santa Claus, angels, snowman, etc.) are lovely arranged. 2. The new whipped cream chepse aluminum pans are lovely made into a pic\u00ad ture. Follow the same procedure as for' the above, and make them to hang on the tree. 3. The clear \"pill bottles\" '\" make beautiful ornaments to hang ... place a small figure ... Santa, snowmen, angel, deer, etc., on the inside. 4. Tin can lids '\" (careful here with the cutting) but your Officer will advise WHO can use the heavy shears for \"tin-cutting\" ... Any cut design along the edge ... with a Christmas picture placed in the Center, makes an attractive hanging. 378 5. The styrofoam ball, decorated makes a very sophisticated hanging A 4\", 6\" ... or even the 2\" are a good size. Sequins, jewels, braid, aTl lend themselves to creativity. There are the plain white styro\u00ad foam, and the colorful satin balls. (If every boy makes one ball you have a generous addition for their tree.) 6. Save the tops from spray cans ... shampoo bottles .. , perfume bottles '\" and decorate. A wool ball can be made to add under the top .. , make into a Santa face or a snowman face ... and hang. With a heated ice-pick ... you c~n easily make a hole in the top, place your gold cord ... through, make a knot, and it is ready to hang. 7. The \"TWENTY CIRCLE\" ball is lovely. Beginning with a six-inch circle, (This makes a large ball for a mobile) ... the five-inch, the four\u00ad inch, down to the two-inch is the best for the tree. You have twenty circles, cut even, folded in such a way as to fit perfectly into the shape of a ball. Use Christmas cards, and use Sobo or Elmer's for gluing. 8. The nylon Santa is charming. Old nylons stretched over a coat hanger and the face and other features made from construction paper and glued. 9. The Christmas card book ... save old Christmas cards and arrange FIVE exactly the same size, fitted into each other to make a BOOK. In the foldpd edge make two holes (use an awl for punching the holes) .,. with a wool needle, thread with yarn, and sew IN AND OUT of the holes until the book is I,ell held together. THEN ... on the empty pages glue another Christmas card to cover. In addition to the five cards sewn together .,. you will need 15 extra cards for pasting to make the complete book. (The boys love these to take home for presents to little sister~ and brothers, grandmother, or Mother. 10. EYE GLASS LENS ... Ask your oculist for eye glass lenses .. They are more than willing to give them to you. Clean the lens well. Judge the picture that you wish to use by the size of the lens. CUT the picture a little larger than te lens, as it will be trimmed later. PLACE the SOBO or the Elmer's on the INSIDE of the lens ... PLACE THE PICTURE ... face .side toward the inside of the lens ... FIR~lLY press the picture to the lens, working with your fingers until EVERY BIT OF THE GLUE disappears. THIS WILL DRY ABSOLUTELY CLEAR. Around the edge of the lens place gold cord or a fancy braid , .. These can be arranged for hanging or you can purchase a PIN from the Princeton Hobby Shop ... glue to the back and Mother has a beautiful present. 11. MACARONI ... there are unusual designs that one can create into darling angels ... or the short hollow macaroni can be colored (vegetable color- ing) and strung to make ropes for around the tree. (The stringing is easy and directions fromfue Volunteer Office.) 379 12. Let us not forget the aluminum \"tops\" that come from the soda cans, These are most effective when joined together '\" and made into strands for hanging around the three. They can be left as is , .. or can be sprayed with gold, white or silver enamel. EXCELLENT! 13. Then there is the very light weight styrofoam ... which is used today for packing ... some is shaped like the peanut, and some like shells, and still another is round. COLORED .. with a pretty bead in between makes a gorgeous strand for around the tree. 14. The CHRISTMAS placement '\" make an attractive setting for the Christmas dinner table. Collect OLD posteY's ... have everyone the exact same size ... as you certainly would not want to set your table at home other than perfect .. Cover .. sort of collage ... with Christmas cards, cut to fit accurately. Usually in the upper left hand corner (because it is shown better) we place a MERRY CHRISn.1AS card .. as a gracious welcome ... then fill the remainder of the poster board. In between the edges ... you can place very narrow gold filigree design paper strips. These are beautiful ... and one can go a step fu~ther, and make a PICTURE .. for the wall. These would be lovely over the fireplace in the recreational area. 15. There are countless designs for THE TRAY FAVOR ... It would indeed, be an outstanding project .. to have the boys work along with you ~ all for the PLACE 1-1ATS AND THE TRAY FAVORS, fill the tray favors with ,., candy, and arrange to have the boys go along \\~ith you to PRESENT to a Nursing Home. Refreshments could be served and BOTH THE BOYS .. and YOURSELVES, HITH THE PATIENTS .. vlould have a glorious time. THIS .. A REAL COMMUNITY SERVICE. You can choose the Nursing Home .. and we will arrange for the transportation. 16. The Saturday before the boys go home for Christmas ... we have our traditional Cottage Christmas parties. HERE the groups come for lunch with the boys '\" The groups bring the lunch for the boys .,. which are usually a little elaborate ... Arrival time is about 10:00 a.m., lunch around 11:20 a.m., games presents, and departure is around 12:30 to 1:00 p.m. These are gala occasions .. PLAN to do this with your cottage. 380 STAINED GLASS COOKIES These cookies are as good as they look. 7hey are made with cookie dough for the \"leading\", and clear, brightly colored hard candy such as sour balls or inexpensive lollipops for the \"stained glass\". Use either the ginger bread recipe or the light dough recipe. CUT THE DOUGH INTO STRIPS OR ROLL IT INTO THIN ROPES. Join the strips to form the outline of your desi.gn on a sheet of waxed paper. CRUSH the colored candy into coarse lumps. This is easy to do with a cloth and a hammer. Prepare dishes of various colors of candy so your \"palette\" is spread out in front of you. Fill the open spaces in the dssign with different colors. ONLY A THIN LAYER IS NEEDED. Bake in a 350 degree oven for 3 to 5 minutes. Watch closely so that the candy has only enough time to melt until it is smooth. PROLONGED baking will cause the color to darken. Cool and strip off the waxed paper. LIGHT COOKIE DOUGH: BLEND until creamy: 1/3 cup ve\u00a7etable shortening .. 1/3 cup sugar .. , 1 egg ... 2/3 cup honey ... 1 tsp. lemon extract. SIFT together: 3 cups all-purpose flour ... 1 tsp. baking soda '\" 1 tsp. salt. ADDsifted ingredients gradually, mixing well. USE more flour if dough is sticky. Rollout to 1/4\" thin and shape as you wish. Bake on WAXED PAPER at 375 degrees for 8 to 10 minutes, watching carefully. Peel off paper when the cookies are cooked. GINGERBREAD SCULPTURE: Make gingerbread ornaments and gifts. This recipe is just right for modeling, and produces a deli\u00ad ci OUS, golden brown cook i e. BLEND until creamy: 1/3 cup vegetable shortening ~ cup of light brown sugar, packed firmly .. . 1 1/2 cup molasses. ADO and mix thoroughly .. . 2/3 cup water, SIFT together: 6 cups all-purpose flour ... 2 tsp. baking 1/4 tsp. ginger. ADD THIS MIX 1/3rd at a time, beating thoroughly. If dough is sticky, add flour. Rollout to 1/4\" thin. Shape with a knife and your hands. BAKE on waxed paper at 350 degrees for about 10 minutes. Time varies with thickness and size. 381 L_ ____________ ~---- -~-~ ---~ --------MISCELLANEOUS ... You the foregoing are only suggestions. It \\~ould be impossible to cover the vast number of possible projects that the boys enjoy doing. MOTIVATION is important ... but we have found that the groups who are prepared to START RIGHT IN when they arrive are off to a most successful start. SOME of the boys will not with to participate . do not let this deter you from getting started ... eventually they will observe the others having a good time and will join in. IF A BOY SHOULD NOT ... perhaps the Officer can make a suggestion. So many, many things could cause this hesitancy to work with the group. COOKIES ... here you must bring the electric oven ... it has been accom\u00ad plished and the boys seldom have had this opportunity at home. Making up the dough, and cutting out the cookies, is fun. ENGLISH MUFFIN PIZZAS ... Here, again you need the electric oven .. which unfortunately Yle do not have. The ingredients .. they can make their own ... place in the over ... and VOILA ... success and delicious! ICE CREAM ... Bring a home freezer and the ingredients. AND, a whirl of an evening is ahead ... churning and finally the repast. SHOW SLIDES ... If you have taken a trip, share your slides \\~ith the boys. Talk about where you have been, what you saw, a funny incident ... keep it short .. but the boys will love travelling along with you. OR, get a good movie from the Princeton Public Library (Cartoons) and bring for a showing. GIVE THEIR OWN SHOW ... Prepare a funny script with the boys about given subject ... help them to act it out .. and will they have fun. MUSIC INSTRUMENTS '\" You would need expert advise on this project .. cigar boxes or other types ... a music teacher can give suggestions ... and each boy makes his own instrument ... and YOU HAVE A BUILT-IN COTTAGE BAND. SING-A-LONGS ... BRING YOUR GUITAR '\" and have a jolly-jolly evening singing. GAMES ... I have observed one of the most successful events. BUNDLES of old clothes (clean) were brought. The boys were assembled and one at a time to a bundle ... (have about three get started) see WHO CAN-rITTIDNTHE OLD CLOTHES FIRST and GET THEM OFF FIRST. They, naturally, put them over their own clothes ... and give a simple prize. This is hilarious. ANOTHER EXCITING GAME . Bring a medium size piece of old material .. old turkish towels .. old carpeting .. fine. Have them large enough that a boy can step onto it. PLACE about five or six of these pieces around on the floor ... BEING CAREFUL TO PLACE THEM CLOSE ENOUGH TOGETHER THAT A BOY can step from one to the other .. LOUDLY tap on the floor with a broom stick ... WHERE THE MATERIAL IS PLACED .. and fromthe sound he steps onto the material ... EXCELLENT .. and hilarious .. , and give a simple prize. LET all do this. 382 I HELPING KIDS IN TROUBLE: THE LABOR YOUTH SPONSORSHIP PROGRAM FORT WORTH, TEXAS AFL-CIO/NCCD The Labor Youth Sponsorship Program is a successful juvenile aid operation that is run on a shoestring and ought to be a model for any, community with kids in trouble. Financed with a grant from the Texas Youth Council, it began in May of 1976 under the sponsorship of the Tarrant County Central Labor Council, AFL-CIO, the United Automobile Workers Community Action Program, and the National Council on Crime and Delinquency. Youngsters come to the program through juvenile court referrals or through guidance counselors in schools. Sometimes they just wander in the door of this storefront agency. Mainly they are boys and girls who are, or have been. delinquent. Many of them have problems and most of them come from families who have problems. What they have in common is the need for someone-a mature, friendly adult-to take a sincere interest in them and treat them as though tl',~y mattered. This is precisely what the members of the Tarrant County labor unions have been doing. The youths have a wide variety of unmet needs and the project tries to fulfill them with the help of the community. In just the few brief months of its existence, it has already accomplished much. It has ob\u00ad tained free medical care for 7 youths, placed 32 in jobs, found foster homes for 5, provided clothing for 48, obtained counseling for 142, and, for a lucky 5, has arranged weeklong vacations. Thanks to the program and its compassionate director, boys and girls have gotten, perhaps for the first time, the feeling of being worthwhile and wanted. It's a terrific psychological boost for a kid who too often perceived himself as a burden to family and society. It's a good way to prevent further misbehavior. It's a good way to build good citizens. 383 - -~ -~ ~~-------------------=--- l~toO,\u20ac? HOMEI~ARD OF ADJUDICATED JUVENILE OFFENDERS* Ron Y. F. Chun Herb C. Willman In 1847 the lyman School for Boys was established in Nestboro, Massa\u00ad chusetts.I Thus began, on that day, a new and enlightened era in the handling of juvenile offenders. No longer would a juvenile be incar\u00ad cerated with adult felons, nor 110ul d cruel and unusual puni shments be inflicted on the young. The Training School-An Overview In subsequent years, more and more states, following Massachusetts's leadership in the field, developed \"reform\" or \"training\" schools. Regimentation was foremost. To conform to ru'les and regulations was to be \"rehabilitated.\" Days leading into weeks, then months were spent walking in line, two abreast, with hands in trouser pockets,2 lining up for \"headcounts,,3 and sleeping in large impersonal dormi\u00ad tories. As it was so aptly phrased in the Newman report: They are fed and housed and to some extent clothed. They receive a minimum of medical and dental attention. They go to classes, where some who cannot read are taught to read. They learn a few skills-though the farm work, which is probably the best taught and most interesting, is of little use upon release. They have no privacy and virtually no personal possessions. They spend months or years in a situation cJ almost total conformity and irres\u00ad pons i bil ity, with no chance to develop independence of thought or self-reliance .. they do not learn how to handle money--to earn it or even to spend it. They are isolated from their families by a system which permits two parental visits per month. They are isolated from outside 384 friends .. they never meet or associate with girls. They go out with no resources into a world that is totally strange. It is no wonder that so many gradu\u00ad ate to become inmates of our correctional institutions.'> Or as depiGted by Shaw 40 years earlier: Haircuts were (and are) short, blue dungarees and shirt are the uniform of the day .. they have al\u00ad ready achieved fame in the world of crime, and proceed to impress that fact upon the other boys. They loiter about the place, congregate in small groups, talking about their achievements and ambitions in their common vocation, crime.5 Shaw's description of delinquent boys attempting to impress their peers with tall', about \"their achievements and ambitions in their common vocati on. crime,\" was written in 1930, and has changed 1 ittle to this day, although admittedly, there is now much more talk of \"doing dope,\" or \"clouting cars.\" From that day in 1847 to the present, literally thousands of children have \"done their time\" as described by Newman and Shaw. In spite of the fact that tralning school administrations have hired increased numbers of educators, social workers, counselors, psychologists, and psychiatrists, most have proven well-meaning but their impact equivocal. We have attempted in our training schools \"compensatory educa\u00ad ti on, 116 \"i ndi vi dua 1 therapy, ,,7 \"group counseling, ,,8 and \"group therapy,\"9 among other's. t4any of these innovations show some promise in given situations, however, most have shown little or no lasting differences between control and experimental groups examined. Change criteria have been elusive. As a result, we are still turning out of our training schools more youngsters going on to further criminal activities and future incarcer,',(.ion in adult pri sons, than youngsters who reenter the mainstream of society. 385 e With this record of repeated failure in mind, let us reexamine what we assume to be true about the training school youngster. Disproport~onately, he is a child of the slums, he is 15 or 16 years old, perhaps one of numerous children, possible from a broken home; from adults and older children in charge of him, he has had leniency, sternness, affection, perhaps indifference in erY'atic and unpre\u00ad dictable succession. He may well have dropped out of school, he may well be unemployed and have little to offer an employer. His crimes are much more frequently thefts than crimes of violence.10 He is also resentful, impatient, and insecure because of repeated failure; he is searching desperately for masculine identity, and craves excitement, adventure, recognition, and acceptance. The Outward Bound Schools In England, during World War II, there was considerable concern about the large numbers of British seamen who would literally give up their lives with little strugole when forced to abondon ship in the cold waters of the North Atlantic--while many older, more experienced sailors, although in poorer physical shape, would survive this same ordeal. As a result of this concern, Dr. Kurt Hahn was cOlTl11issioned to establish the first Outward Bound School in Aberdovey, Wales. Hahn was interested in developing more than muscle in young merchant seamen for, in addition to physical conditioning, he stressed the importance of group pride, personal contribution, and trust in yourself and others. This school, as in other Outward Bound Schools to follow, recognized the value of structuring stressful situations to unify groups toward a common goal, as well as the value of repeated and hard-won successes in establishing confidence and a more positive self-image. Hahn's efforts met with such success that some 34 Outward Bound Schools have since been established throughout the world. 386 \" .. Outward Bound and Juvenile Delinquency The Colorado Outward Bound School which opened in 1962 is located on the snow-crested western slopes of the Rocky Mountains at an altitude of 8,800 feet. The program, which involves mountain walking, backpacking, high altitude camping, solo survival, rappelling and rock climbing, accepted its first adjudicated delinquents, five in all, from the Massachusetts Department of Yout~ Services in 1964. The following year, 25 more adjudicated youngsters from Massachu\u00ad setts completed the Outward Bound Program in Colorado, and in newly opened Outward Bound Schools in Minnesota and Maine. This early success led to the funding of a study to determine wp?the'(' a program of severe physical challenge can be effective in reducing further delinquency among adolescent boys as shown by a compal'ison of recidivism rates, control vs. experimental. 11 The Homeward Bound Program In September 1960 the Massachusetts Department of Youth Services established the Stephen L. French Youth Forestry Camp, located in Nickerson State Park in East Brewster, Massachusetts. Thi$ camp was designp.d to run on a work-therapy model for adjudi\u00ad cated delinquent boys, 16 years of age or older, who would provide, during a 6 to 9 month stay, labor for the Department of Natural Re\u00ad sources in building and cleaning campsites, clearing trails, and other park projects. The 18-20 boys in the camp were housed in a converted hunting lodge located in the 1,777 acre State Park. As the years passed, and the Department's success with delinquents attending Outward Bound schools grevl, pressurp.s both from within the Forestry Camp and from the Department's administration called for a radical change from the camp's work-therapy model to an adventure training, self-discipline model. FollO\\~ing a reorganization of the Department of Youth Services and a change in the administration of the Forestry Camp, sufficient money and trained personnel 12 were available to enable the Homeward 387 Bound Program to evolve from a ~eries of pilot programs 13 to a full\u00ad time Homeward Bound School, in October 1970. Using the best elements of the Outward Bound model developed by Kurt Hahn in Aberdovey, Wales, and taking full advantage of the experiences gleaned from association with the Colorado, Minnesota and Maine Outward Bound Schools, the Massachusetts Department of Youth Services initiated a series of pilot programs which evolved into a two-phase program of 6 weeK';' duration called Home\\~ard Bound.14 Boys are selected for participation in Homeward Bound based on the day they are received from the court. On alternate days during the first 2 weeks of the program boys whose offenses in the community whether they be stubborn child, use of a motor vehicle, or murder - are \"committed or referred\" to the Homeward Bound Program on a \"space available\" basis where they are immediately welcomed by the assistant superintendent and a counselor, at the lodge where they were to live during Phase I. Prior to coming to Homeward Bound, it is ca~fully explained to each boy that the program: (1) Is very rugged; (?') has limited openings; (3) is voluntary; (4) once begun must be completed; (5) once completed allows the graduate to be paroled directly home. During the study no boys declined to participate in Homeward Bound. The assistant superintendent and the counselor explain a few basic rules to each new enrollee. There are no locks, no fences, and no secure rooms. Visiting is ~ermitted, mail is not censored, per\u00ad sonal clothing may be worn, phone calls may be made and received-\u00ad all permitted during Phase I but not in Phase II where much of the program takes place on the Appalachian Trail or at sea. Following this initial orientation, the incoming boys are intro\u00ad duced to several boys working at the camp as assistant brigade leaders. who in turn orient the boys in their fashion (probably more effectively) about the rigors of the program and those few rules enforced by the staff. 388 The physical site for the \"Homeplace\" for Phase II of Home\u00ad ward Bound is located a quarter of a mile away from the Lodge, on the shores of crystal clear Cliff Pond. It is here that each brigade lives in its own A-frame while in camp, and it is the home from which at 6:00 a.m.,staff and boys begin each day with a 2-mile run and dip\u00ad regardless of the weather or season. After the first few days of Phase I, 32 boys are assembled--divided into brigades of eight each--and begin the early or intermediate phase . of Homeward Bound. Days are devoted to community service projects, short hikes along the National Seashore, some running, minimal calisthenics, and a few choice obstacle courses.15 There are also hours spent with a counselor helping to develop a realistic plan for re,,~ase, as each boy is thoroughly involved in working up his own postrelease plan and has time to reflect a bit on who he is and how he got there. Evenings are not for play; there are classes from Homeward Bound\u00ad instructors in ecology, orienteering, survival, search and rescue, overnight expeditions, ropes and knots, and seamanship. For those who do not pay attention during class--and this is the majority--the first overnight expedition is an eye-opener. Packs are not packed properly, some gear is left behind, not enough of the right kind of food is brought along, and most end up the first overnight cold, wet, and miserable. Thereafter, however, evening classes become more lively and more questions are asked. As the 2- week period in Phase I comes to a close, most boys move ahead with a mixture of fear and apprehension toward Phase II. On the first day of Phase II, following the run and dip, all brigades assemble for an orientation concerning the nature of the particular program they \\~ill undertake. Each program varies with the time of the year, weather conditions, and the availability of specialized safety equipment. Equipment is then issued and each brigade is allowed a brief period to settle into its A-frame. 389 From 1700 hours until long after dark, the program director con\u00ad ducts what is known of as a \"quiet walk.\" This is neither quiet, nor a walk; it is instead, a cross-country trot over forest tc'ails, through swamps, across ri vers, and nearly impenetrable woodl and!;. Some 5 or 6 hours after it began in daylight, it ends in darkness, with all participants fully exhausted, thoroughly wet and mud\u00ad covered. and well aware of what it means to give more than you thought you had. Following the quiet walk, each boy is then asked to step forward to sipn a pledge, reiterating his desire to continua on and complete the Homeward Bound Program. This is a soul-searching time for each youth, as his commitment is requested at a time when he feels defeated, frustrated, and incapable of meeting Homeward Bound's standards. Seldom does a boy refuse to sign. This may be due in part to peer pressure and marks the first of many personal successes he will ex\u00ad perience in the month to follow. One day then rapidly falls upon another, as each brigade learns the intricacies of survival, circuit training, land and/or sea ex\u00ad peditions, navigation, first aid and firefighting, silviculture, logistics, ecology, search and rescue, ropes and knots, rock climbing and, rappell ing. In the beginning, there is an overnight training expedition, bringing together much of what is being learned. Later, a 3-day expedition tests the brigade even further, although it barely pre\u00ad pares them for the 10-day mobile course across the Appalachian Trail, often in four or more feet of snow. A brigade can only move as fast and accomplish as much as its slowest, most inept member. This leads to increased group interaction and an eventual sharing and rencning out to one another. The 100-foot rappell, while one of the safest of exercises, can bring fear to the hearts of many brigade members, and it is here that one's peers, to\u00ad gether with the skill of the brigade instructor 'and assistant brigade instruct&r, can made the seemingly impossib1e come true. 390 After a series of repeated successes on the high rappel 1 , in rock\u00ad climbing, on expeditions and circuit training, comes the solo--a 3-day experience of survival suddenly with no peer pressure and no peers, no instructors to push, no one. It is here that each boy must put together all he has learned. With t\\ few matches,:\\. plastic sheet, a cooking pail and water, he must fend for himself for 3 days and 3 ni ghts, far from the safet.y of any town or the comforts of home. Following solo, the remainder of the long expedition seems to be anticlimactic for each boy now knows that he has what it takes. The return to the \"homeplace\" and the final competition between brigades passes all too quickly, as does the 7-mile run for individual honors. The final evening is a blending of happy and sad. Even though th there are smil.es and congratulations when each boy receives his cer\u00ad tificate and emblem; and even though the blisters have hardened and the muscles no longer hurt, each remembers all the good times-\u00ad Sitting around the fire in the evening, the first good hot meal after expeditions, and the newly won pri.Je of knowing he did some\u00ad thi ng no one coul d do for him. Attempting to capsulize or summarize Homeward Bound is not an easy task. It is certainly a program of severe physical challenge, extreme excitement and perceived danger, followed by periods of rela\u00ad tive calm, where participants can absorb and reflect on their accom\u00ad pl ishments. As shown by Kelly and Baer,16 it is of little value to attempt to point out to an adjudicated delinquent that he is far more capable than he feels himself to be. What is necessary however, is to devise a set of circumstances whereby the delinquent boy can clearly demonstrate this competence to himself. Only then will opportunities for concrete, impressive accomplishment promote personal growth. The need to pace oneself, and the requirements of persistence ;n the morning run and dip, the circuit training, and the 90-to-100 mile overland expeditions 'challenge the delinquent's impulsivity and 391 endurance. The necessity of safety rules and climbing regulations in rap\u00ad pelling, sea expeditions, and search and rescue operations, causes him to question his previous concept that laws and regulations are to be ignored or treated lightly. The placing of larger measures of responsibility on him as he holds the safety line of a peer who is rappelling, or assumes 1eadership of his brigade in stressful situations, forces him to r~evaluate his worth in relationship to his peers. His dependence on his brigade leader and peers for success, safety and well-being cause him not only to reexamine his attitude towards authority, but al so to understand and accep t the strength and weaknesses of hi~self and others. Lastly, the sobering experience of the solo, causes him to think deeply and long about his accomplishments, and consider what brought him to Homeward Bound, and where and how he is going from here. Research Results The Homeward Bound Program as a model, utilizing the lure of ad\u00ad venture and challenge as in Outward Bound, gives strong evidence that a positive rather than a negative orientation can create better correctional results with concomitant public safety. On a 7-to 14-month follow-up our study demonstrated that 20.8 percent of the Ho~ward Bound Group recidivated as opposed to 42.7 percent of the control group. This finding remarkably supports the earlier study of Kelly and Baer whose research showed that 20 per\u00ad cent of the experimental group and 42 percent of the comparison group reci di vate. 17 Selection of boys for Homeward Bound versus Lyman School for Boys was based solely on a \"space available basis\" with 32 boys going directly from the court to Homeward Bound during the first 2 weeks of each 6-week cycle and all other commitments going to Lyman School during the last 4 weeks. 392 -~- -~ -~ - ------While chi square tests of the backgound characteristics of the Home\u00ad ward Bound participants (178 boys) and the Lyman School participants (75 boys) showed no significant differences between either group, several interesting factors were observed: (1) Homeward Bound participants are able to stay out of trouble longer than participants in regular institutional programs. Only 38 percent of those who recidivated following the Homeward Bound program did so vlithin the first 6 months as compared to 72 percent of the institutional or control group. (2) There was an increased chance of success in Homeward Bound as the chronological age of the participants increased. (3) The marital status of the parents affected success or failure in the Homeward Bound Program. Participants whose parents were \"separated\" showed poorer results (22.6 percent failure) than in any other marital status category. (4) There was a significant difference in \"Last school grade attended\" and success-failure in the Homeward Bound Program. The higher the school grade attained, the better the chance for success. (5) Strong tendency noted that per,,;ms who committed \"assault against persons\" and \"larceny\" are more apt to experience success in the Homeward Bound Program. Contrariwi se, persons in \"s];L:t'born child\" category have a marked tendency toward failure within the pro\u00ad gram. Conclusion and Future Implications In their report on the Outward Bound Study, mentioned earlier in this article, Kelly and Baer state: Persistence is a virtue, and giving-up is hard to tolerate. Students feel that what they have to do at Out\u00ad ward Bound is what shouZd be done. It becomes very difficult for a boy to \"walk away\" from a challenge. Students are often kept in the challenging situation for a period of time to encourage their meeting it. There are few \"accept\u00ad able\" reasons for not doing parts of the program, or for 393 leaving the course. Serious physical injury like a broken leg, is one such acceptable reason. Injuries which allow for \"malingering,\" like sprains, are rarely acceptable. Psychological problems, like fear of the mountains, are not easily understood, sometimes ridiculed. Challenges, particularly when they are felt as dangerous, when one's life is \"at stake\" take on an irrestible quality. The excitement of the challenge, the sense of adventure, is contagious. Exciting events intensively involve the students in Outward Bound. More dangerous tasks generate more excitement. As on the climb up the rock face, much of the excitement stems from a conflict about whether one should make a certain move or should not. Many students feel they have come to Outward Bound specifically to meet challenges. Challenges are often seen as the highlights of the Outward Bound experience. The opportunity to really test one's limits is very important. Challenges, particularly those felt as dangerous are often approached as opportunities for defining oneself. For many students, the question \"Who am I?\" is very pressing. As suggested by many writers, adolescents' sense of identity is in formation. For many, the challenges of Outward Bound provide an opportunity to gain some clarity about \"who they are.~' They look upon Outward Bound as an \"initiation rite,\" a not particularly pleasant but \"real\" way of finding out who they are, what their limits are. Many students approach Outward Bound as if it were the initiation rite which will effect their transition from boyhood to manhood. The development of competence and confidence in meeting the Outward Bound tasks becomes important. Competence (mastery) generates a sense of personal worth and a feeling of accomplishment. Students develop pride in their competence, an almost professional feeling about their sailing, climbing or canoeing abilities. There is also a strong desire to be able to deal with danger confidently. It becomes important to be able to face one's fear about a dangerous situation, and still com\u00ad plete the task. Students are not comfortable with the feeling that 394 \":--------------------------------------------------------------\\ \\ \"I'd never do that again, it was too scarey.\" There is a strong desire among students to be seen as \"men not \"boys\". They do not want to be considered soft or cowardly. Hard work becomes intrinsically rewarding and a source of pride \\~hen one wants to avoid appearing soft. After a hard day of hiking or paddling, students feel a meaningful sense of accomplishment. Many of the tales told by students deal with the weight of the pack they carried, or ~he number of hours they rowed. Students who take short cuts, or have a lazy attitude, rarely occupy positions of influence or respect. Outward Bound is \"hard work,\" not \"fun.\" Rarely does a student enjoy Oublard Bound. Rather, it is something he should go through. To be considered \"chicken\" and not to be able to disprove this claim is a supreme insult at Outward Bound. Peer, staff, and family expectations exert great pressure toward conforming to the Outward Bound culture. As on the climb up the rock face, when everyone is doing it, the individual student finds it hard not to join in. This is particularly so when he realized that the camaraderie which develops is based on a sharing of common ex\u00ad periences. Anyone who did not climb the rock face that day was \"left out\" in a very important sense. The watch patrol or brigade as a unit also exerts strong pressure on completing tasks and the course. Intergroup competition is based on individuals' performances on tasks, particularly on their completing tasks. Staff members are persons who have completed tasks similar to or more demanding than the Outward Bound program. Their almost un\u00ad que~tioned expectation is that :~eir students will also complete the Outward Bound course. In fact, part of their reputation as instruc\u00ad tors depends on how all their group completes a task or finishes the course. Parents add a final pressure toward completing the course. It seems that there is an increase in the number of boys who are \"sent to Outward Bound in order to become a man.\" There is also the more usual expectation that when one goes to a school, one finishes the course and gets his diploma, or in this case, cer'tificate. 18 395 People-changing organizations vary in mode, direction and extent of change. Too often the change is symbolic-the affixing of a new title or label on an old program. Happily we do not consider the Homeward Bound program to be a symbolic change in dealing with offenders, but rather a substantively new program. The thrust is to accept the offender, emphasize his worthfulness, build up his self-esteem and con\u00ad fi derlce and through personal achievement grant him an identity that hope\u00ad fully \\~i11 not be prone to extinction or rapid diminution once he leaves the program. Through activity-with-purpose, the debilitating effects of a correctional institution are held minimal. We agree with Kelly and Baer that many features of the Outward Bound or HOIneward, Bound Program coul d, though with much diffi cul ty, be incorporated into a regular training school structure and that this could supplement, if not provide an alternative to, institutionalization. We feel, however, that for those states who undertake such a program, they will be faced rather quickly with the decision of closing one or more large and generally ineffective training schools. For it is ob\u00ad vious that Nassachusetts, which has already closed three large training schools for boys, was aided immeasurably by sending 300 14 -17 year\u00ad old adjudicated delinquents through a 6-week program (Homeward Bound) rather than through a traditional 6 -to 9-month training school experi\u00ad ence. *Homeward Bound: An II.

In 1965, the arrest rate for the 15-17 year age group was higher than any other. In that same year, says the President's Crime Commission, \"a majority of all arrests for major crimes agtlinst property were of people under 21 -as were a substantial minority of arrests fol\" majol\" crimes against the person.\" It is clearly evident that we must begin a concerted effort to reduce delinquent behavior by education and by example. The home and family are the primary forces for bringing up youngsters to respect and obey the law. But the school can, and should, play an important role too The Task: Each junior and seniol\" high school should pl\"ovide as part-of its l\"egular cuy-riculum a detailed discussion of youth and the law. Many such programs exist -for example, the YOU AND THE LAW pro\u00ad gram conceived and written by NCCD, and produced and distributed in a number of cities by Kiwanis International. YOU AND THE LAW helps the young person distinguish between a prank and a violation of the 1aw. With the help of the teacher, who works from a prepared discussion guide, children discuss law breaking and evaluate the consequences. There is an urgent need to have YOU AND THE LAW, or a similar program, instituted in every school. Visits by a member of the police department can be coordinated with the discus~ions. Arranging student trips to courts is also desirable. In some cases, citizen volunteers can help teachers bring the students to court. They can also arrange for the judge to take a few minutes to explain hO~1 his court operates. This kind of experience increases the youngsters' knowledge of and respect for the law. 398 Slide Set on Child Abuse -Concerns of Children, a division of the Odyssey Institute founded by physician-attorney Judianne Densen-Gerber, has prepared a set of 24 color slides which graphically portray the problem of the abused child. The set is accomp~nied by a narrative whi'ch sketches the causes, demographics, and responses relevant to the crime of child abuse. The price of the set is $50.00,part of which goes to fund the COC's campaign for the creation of a cabinet level post or spec1al action office to focus on the concerns of children.
