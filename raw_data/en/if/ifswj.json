A colon cleanse is the act of flushing out your large intestine. The practice of natural [colon cleansing](https://www.webmd.com/balance/natural-colon-cleansing-is-it-necessary), or colonic irrigation, dates back to ancient Greece. It became popular in the U.S. in the early 1900s. But theories behind it lost support, and it fell out of favor. Recently, though, [colon cleansing](https://www.webmd.com/balance/guide/natural-colon-cleansing-is-it-necessary) -- using teas, enzymes, or colon irrigation -- has become more popular. Is colon cleansing good for you? Scientific research on colon cleansing is extremely limited. There's no good evidence for most of the claims that its practitioners make. And the side effects can range from mild to serious. Ways to Cleanse Your Colon There are two main colon-cleansing methods. You can buy products or you can see a doctor to have a colon irrigation. Colon cleansing with powdered or liquid supplements. You take some [supplements](https://www.webmd.com/vitamins-and-supplements/supplements-assessment/default.htm) used for colon cleansing by mouth. Others you take through the rectum. Either way, the idea is to help the colon to expel its contents. You can find these products on the internet or in health food stores, supermarkets, or pharmacies. They include: Colon cleansing with colon irrigation (high colonics). The first modern colonic machine was invented about 100 years ago. Today, colonic hygienists or colon hydrotherapists perform colon irrigations. Colon irrigations work somewhat like an enema but they involve much more water. While you lie on a table, a low-pressure pump or a gravity-based reservoir flushes several gallons of water through a small tube inserted into your rectum. After the water is in the colon, the therapist may [massage](https://www.webmd.com/balance/guide/massage-therapy-styles-and-health-benefits) your [abdomen](https://www.webmd.com/digestive-disorders/picture-of-the-abdomen). Then you release the water like a regular [bowel movement](https://www.webmd.com/women/features/digestive-problems); the process flushes out the fluids and waste. The therapist may repeat the process, and a session may last up to an hour. The practitioner may use a variety of water pressures and temperatures and may or may not combine water with enzymes, herbs, coffee, or [probiotics](https://www.webmd.com/diet/features/answers-to-your-questions-about-probiotics). [Probiotics](https://www.webmd.com/digestive-disorders/probiotics-15/slideshow-probiotics) are [supplements](https://www.webmd.com/men/video/lamm-supplements-diet) containing beneficial bacteria. What's the Theory Behind Natural Colon Cleansing? One of the main theories behind colon cleansing is an ancient belief called the theory of autointoxication. This is the belief that undigested meat and other foods cause mucus buildup in the colon. This buildup produces toxins, the theory goes, which enter the blood's circulation, poisoning the body. Some people claim these toxins cause a wide range of symptoms, such as: On the surface, the idea of toxins being reabsorbed by the body makes some sense. But the theory of autointoxication has been disproven. Purported Benefits of Colon Cleansing The health claims made by producers of colon cleansing products and colon irrigation practitioners are broad and wide-reaching. Their main goal is to clear the colon of large quantities of stagnant, supposedly toxic waste encrusted on colon walls. Doing so, they say, will help your body work better. These supposed benefits include: Improving mental outlook Improving the immune system Reducing the risk of [colon cancer](https://www.webmd.com/colorectal-cancer/default.htm) Quality scientific research is lacking when it comes to backing up these claims. Is Natural Colon Cleansing Needed? Are [bowel movements](https://www.webmd.com/digestive-disorders/rm-quiz-poop) enough to clear the colon? We do know that the body alone can do the following: Natural bacteria in the colon can detoxify food waste. The [liver](https://www.webmd.com/digestive-disorders/picture-of-the-liver)also neutralizes toxins. Mucus membranes in the colon may keep unwanted substances from reentering the [blood](https://www.webmd.com/heart/anatomy-picture-of-blood)and tissues. The lining of the intestines regenerates itself faster than any other tissue in the body, preventing a buildup of harmful material. The normal number of bowel movements varies from person to person. Increasing the number of bowel movements doesn't improve [weight loss](https://www.webmd.com/diet/default.htm). That's because the body absorbs most calories before they reach the large intestine. Risks of Colon Cleansing \"Natural\" doesn't necessarily mean safe. The government doesn't regulate natural colon cleansing products, so their potency, safety, and purity can't be guaranteed. And, each state has its own rules about whether or not practitioners must be professionally licensed. It's always a good idea to talk with your doctor before starting a new practice such as colon cleansing. There are some potential risks and side effects, including: Dehydration [Dizziness](https://www.webmd.com/first-aid/understanding-dizziness-basics), a sign of [dehydration](https://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/dehydration-adults) Mineral imbalance Electrolyte imbalance Bacterial imbalance and infection Potential interference with [medication](https://www.webmd.com/drugs/index-drugs.aspx)absorption on day of procedure Bowel perforation Infection Depletion of helpful normal bowel flora unless replaced (i.e. [probiotics](https://www.webmd.com/digestive-disorders/probiotics-15/video-intro-to-probiotics)) Kidney failure Be aware, if the therapist adds a substance to the water during colon irrigation, you run the risk of an [allergic reaction](https://www.webmd.com/allergies/tc/allergic-reaction-topic-overview).

Increasing both soluble and insoluble fiber can help with a wide range of gastrointestinal problems, including [constipation](https://www.webmd.com/digestive-disorders/digestive-diseases-constipation), diverticular disease, and [colorectal cancer](https://www.webmd.com/colorectal-cancer/ss/slideshow-colorectal-cancer-overview).
