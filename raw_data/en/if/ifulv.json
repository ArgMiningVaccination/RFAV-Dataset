Providers (outside of NYC) enrolled in the NYSDOH COVID-19 Vaccination Program place COVID-19 Vaccine orders in NYSIIS, via the Manage Orders module . The NYSDOH COVID-19 Vaccination Program will allow providers to request enough vaccine to support three weeks of on-hand inventory (or the minimum ordering quantity). Providers will be able to create an order any day of the week, as needed, based upon administration needs and current inventory. FIRST STEPS To create an order and administer COVID -19 vaccine, NYS providers must first enroll with the Vaccine Program using the COVID -19 Vaccine Program Provider Enrollment application located on the Health Commerce System (HCS) from the link below: https://commerce.health.state.ny.us/hpn/ctrldocs/covidvacc/#/vaccinationProvider Orders for COVID - 19 vaccine are performed in NYSIIS. Users must have valid HCS and NYSIIS accounts and have taken NYSIIS Administrative User training prior to accessing this functionality.Appendix A - NYS COVID-19 Vaccine Order Review Process..................................................................... .10 Appendix B - Currently Available COVID-19 Vaccines.................................................................................14 Appendix C - CDC COVID-19 Vaccine Ancillary Supply Kit Guidance ............................................................1 6P a g e | 2 Ordering COVID-19 Vaccine in NYSIIS Version 1.4 - 6/28/2022ACCESSIN G NYSIIS Access NYSIIS via NYSDOH Health Commerce System (HCS) Enter the Web Address: https://commerce.health.state.ny.us A.Log in to the HCS Portal with your unique ID and password.

From the top navigational bar, click on My Content then select All Applications. Click on the letter \"N\" and scroll down to locate NYSIIS - Production . Click on the green plus sign (+) to the far right. The application will automatically appear on the left side bar under My Applications. From the HCS Homepage, click on NYSIIS - Productio n in your My Applications panel. CREATE A COVID-19 VACCINE ORDER On the left side menu panel under the Inventory heading, click on Manage Orders . On the Manage Orders screen, click Create Order. P a g e | 3 Ordering COVID-19 Vaccine in NYSIIS Version 1.4 - 6/28/2022The top of the Create Order screen displays your organization's PIN, contact person, organization name, name of the user who is placing the order, organization phone and fax, the delivery address and days/hours, and any special delivery instructions. The Order Notes section can be used to enter any details about the use of the vaccine or extenuating circumstances. It is important to enter a note if your inventory or administration history does not reflect the need for the requested number of doses. For example, if you have COVID-19 vaccine in inventory but are planning to redistribute it or if you are planning to expand administration (i.e. collaborating with a specific community -based organization or school) , indicate these plans in the Order Notes. The bottom of the Create Order screen is where you will record the quantity of vaccine you would like to order. It also displays what is available to order in the Orderable Vaccines section based on the campaign (s) the Vaccine Program has enrolled you in. If you are enrolled in Vaccines for Children or Vaccines for Adults, you will see those products in addition to COVID-19 vaccines available for ordering. The list of orderable vaccines is displayed alphabetically by trad e name. IMPORTANT: COVID-19 vaccine orders must be placed separately from routine vaccine and influenza orders. Orderable vaccines will be separated by Intention (Pediatric vs Adult). Intention may relate to the age indication or the ancillary kit supplied with the vaccine. It is important to pay attention to the NYSIIS package description for age indication of different products. A complete list of currently available COVID-19 vaccines and descriptions of each can be found in Appendix B. Additional information on ancillary supplies can be found in Appendix C. A summary of each COVID-19 vaccine product, including storage and handling and vaccine administration, can be found in the CDC COVID-19 Vaccine Quick Reference Guide for Healthcare Professionals . associated with the Trade name/NDC code for this vaccineP a g e | 4 Ordering COVID-19 Vaccine in NYSIIS Version 1.4 - 6/28/2022Columns in the Orderable Vaccines table include: Trade Name - Name of vaccine manufacturer Packaging - Description of the vaccine product packaging, including total number of doses per package and n umber of vials . Age indications have been listed to aid providers in ordering correct packages. NDC Number - National Drug Code assigned by the FDA Doses Admin (EOQ) - Number of doses administered of that product/NDC in the last 90 days Doses on Hand - Total number of doses from all lot numbers currently in active NYSIIS Inventory for that product/NDC Doses Ordered - Area where you enter the number of doses you are requesting. The number of doses per package is listed in the Packaging description. Order Quantity and Estimated Delivery Timeline Vaccine orders should be placed to support approximately three weeks of inventory or the minimum order quantity . This will ensure doses are used timely to minimize wastage of vaccine not used before expiration or beyond use date. Please consider the following for determining your order quantity and whether you can use the minimum ordering quantity : Each COVID-19 product has distinct storage and handling requirements. The length of time vaccine can be stored in the storage units you have on site must be considered in determining how much vaccine to order and to reduce wastage. Providers should take every opportunity to vaccinate every eligible person , even if it means not using the entire vial. There may be unused doses in a vial. This is considered \"responsible wastage\" and is acceptable and can be reported by following Wastage Reporting Guidance. Order according to the number of vials you will use, not the number of patients you will see. COVID-19 vaccines need to be used within 6 hours after dilution (Pfizer adult/adolescent formulation for ages 12+ PURPLE cap and Janssen/J&J vaccine) or 12 hours after dilution ( Pfizer ages 12+ GRAY cap, Pfizer ages 5-11 orange cap, Pfizer ages 6m-4y maroon cap, and all formulations of Moderna vaccine). Consider number of days you will administer if your volume is low.Example of Orderable Vaccines. The screen will change based upon product availability. See Appendix B for current ly available COVID-19 vaccines . P a g e | 5 Ordering COVID-19 Vaccine in NYSIIS Version 1.4 - 6/28/2022You must enter the request in DOSES , not packages. Orders must be in multiples of the doses per package. NYSIIS will round up to the nearest order quantity if you do not enter your order in the minimum ordering quantity (i.e. if you enter 10 for Janssen, your order quantity will change to 100 upon saving). Orders placed in NYSIIS will typically be delivered within three to five business days. Orders are not delivered on Saturdays, Sundays, or holidays. Ancillary supplies may arrive the day prior to or the same day as vaccine. Before saving or submitting your order, review your inventory on hand and ensure it is accurate. You must check the inventory verification box prior to saving or submitting. If modifications are needed, please access your NYSIIS Inventory module to correct inventory. If you do not check the inventory verification, a warning will appear. Once you have entered a Doses Ordered quantity and verified your inventory you can either click the \"Save\" button or the \"Save and Submit \" button. Save - will save the order in Saved status and allows you to come back to it later and make edits. Saving the order does not submit it to the Vaccine Program. Save & Submit - will save the order in Pending status. Sav e & Submit will submit the order to the Vaccine Program. T he order can still be edited by your organization while it is in Pending status. However, once the Vaccine Program open s the order for review, the status will change to In Progress and you will no longer be able to make edits to the order.Vaccine Program staff will review your reporting and inventory, as well as order notes, to determine if the number of doses requested is reasonable. See Appendix A: NYS COVID-19 Vaccine Order Review Process for information on the data reviewed and solutions to correct reporting or inventory issues prior to submitting an order.P a g e | \u0019 Ordering COVID-19 Vaccine in NYSIIS Version 1.4 - 6/28/2022Modifying an O rder Orders can be edited if they are in Saved or Pending status . From the Manage Orders screen, click on the status hyperlink of the order you would like to edit. NYSIIS will display the Modify Order screen.

Make sure you received what was ordered and approved and no vaccine has been damaged in transit. If there are any issues with the shipment, including temperature monitoring alarms, you must notify the Vaccine Program the day the order is received by emailing COVID19Vaccine@health.ny.gov. After placing the vaccine into your storage unit, you will log into NYSIIS and accept these vaccine lots into your NYSIIS inventory . It is important to do this before using any vaccine from the delivery so that doses administered properly deduct from inventory. Shipment Information will open in another browser tab. Enter the Shipment Tracking Number into the carrier's tracking search online to determine estimated delivery date/time. ACCEPTING VACCINE ORDER INTO INVENTORY Click on Manag e Transfers on the left side menu panel: This will take you to the Manag e Transfer screen. If you have transfers that need to be accepted, they will display as hyperlinks under the Transfer ID column. A Transfer ID may have a single or multiple vaccin e products ready to be accepted. P a g e | 9 Ordering COVID-19 Vaccine in NYSIIS Version 1.4 - 6/28/2022Click on one of the Transfer IDs that needs to be accepted. You will navigate to the Receive Transfer screen. Here you will see detailed information about the order includi ng: quantity shipped, trade name, lot number, expiration date, and NDC description. Inspect the physical inventory received and make sure it matches all of the information in NYSIIS. Next, click the Accept Transfer button in the upper right-hand corner. Once the item or items are accepted, NYSIIS will populate your inventory with the lot information automatically. Note: only orders placed in NYSIIS and received via a shipment from the manufacturer or distributor (McKesson) will appear in the Manage Transfers screen. If you receive vaccine via a redistribution from another enrolled provider, you need to manually adjust your inventory via the instructions found here .P a g e | 10 Ordering COVID-19 Vaccine in NYSIIS Version 1.4 - 6/28/2022APPENDIX A - NYS COVID-19 VACCINE ORDER REVIEW PROCESS All vaccine orders placed in the New York State Immunization Information System (NYSIIS) are reviewed by NYS Vaccine Program staff to reduce over-ordering and the risk of vaccine being wasted due to expiration. To expedite the ordering process, providers should ensure: Vaccine doses administered are accurately recorded in NYSIIS; and Vaccine inventory is up to date. How Orders are Evaluated NYS Vaccine Program staff evaluate COVID-19 vaccine orders by comparing doses administered reports over a period of time (via the VFC report), inventory on hand, and doses requested. Therefore, it is critical that all providers keep inventory and doses administered up to date in the system. NYS Vaccine Program staff also review provider notes on orders and will take any extenuating circumstances under consideration when determining an appropriate order . (Note: The \"VFC Report\" applies to all vaccine doses administered from NYSIIS inventory, not just those related to the Vaccines for Children program. When generating the VFC report, choose Trade Name radio button under report type and you will see each COVID-19 vaccine your location has administered as a row.) Reasons Orders might be Denied or Reduced and Solutions Vaccine doses administered are not reflected in NYSIIS. The COVID-19 Vaccination Program Provider Agreement requires reporting of doses administered to NYSIIS within 24 hours of vaccine administration. Timely reporting of doses administered is also a condition of receiving federally-funded COVID-19 vaccine. Solution: Always run the NYSIIS VFC Report before placing an order, to ensure that vaccine doses administered are being recorded appropriately in NYSIIS (see instructions that follow ). Some providers who exchange data find that data may not transfer properly after an electronic medical record upgrade or change. Report data exchange, EMR and decrementing issues to nysiis@health.ny.gov . Historical usage does not support number of doses requested. Vaccine Program staff will compare your COVID vaccine administration over the past three weeks as a reference. For example, if your past three weeks of vaccine administration was 500 doses, and your current on-hand inventory is 200 doses, an order of up to 300 doses would be considered reasonable. Solution: Add a note to the order to justify the requested doses. For example, if you are planning a vaccination event to increase capacity compared to prior weeks or need to redistribute doses to another provider, add this information to the Order Notes area. Doses administered and inventory reported in NYSIIS indicate that the provider currently has sufficient vaccine in stock. Solution(s): Ensure doses administered are reported within 24 hours of administration in NYSIIS, per the Provider Agreement and as a condition of receiving federally-funded COVID-19 vaccine. Always run the NYSIIS VFC Report before placing an order, to ensure vaccine doses administered are being recorded appropriately in NYSIIS. Ensure all orders have been accepted into NYSIIS Inventory. This must be done PRIOR to administer vaccine from the order for inventory to decrement properly. (See: Accepting Vaccine Shipments into NYSIIS Inventory ).P a g e | 11Ordering COVID-19 Vaccine in NYSIIS Version 1.4 - 6/28/2022If using data exchange to report, check the Inventory Not Deducted module in NYSIIS. If there are any records in Inventory Not Deducted, update non-deducted inventory prior to submitting the order following the Inventory Not Deducted Cheat Sheet instructions. Perform a physical inventory count and ensure it matches the Doses on Hand in NYSIIS. If the NYSIIS inventory is higher than actual inventory and you have checked your doses administered and Inventory Not Deducted, ensure: Doses redistributed to another provider have been subtracted from inventory (See: Updating Inventory in NYSIIS for Redistributions ). If all above solutions have been examines and inventory is still not correct, you may need to manually correct inventory (See: Modifying NYSIIS Inventory ). Check your order status every few days. Vaccine orders that say, \"in progress,\" may have a note from VFC staff that requires providers to give additional information. Check the notes section of vaccine orders to determine why an order was denied or reduced. If your order was denied or reduced due to inventory or reporting issues you may place another order once the issue is resolved. Inventory contains duplicate lot numbers, invalid NDCs and/or negative or partial doses. Solution(s): Always 'Accept transfers' in NYSIIS for all orders received directly from the manufacturer or McKesson (don't manually add direct orders). Use caution when manually adding inventory received from a redistribution. Ensure the lot number is not already in active or inactive inventory before manually adding so that a duplicate lot is not entered. Data exchange will not properly decrement inventory when duplicate lots exist. Always report whole doses unless there was an administration error. Order contains both COVID-19 vaccine and regular (VFC and/or VFA) vaccine. COVID-19 vaccine orders must be placed as a separate order from monthly VFC/VFA orders. Solution: Place regular vaccine orders and COVID-19 vaccine orders separately. The Vaccine Program has not received the signed NYS COVID MOU. Solution: Ensure your organization submits the MOU and Addendum for each vaccination location. Email the COVID-19 Vaccine team at COVID19Vaccine@health.ny.gov for inquiries. Email the COVID-19 Vaccine team at COVID19Vaccine@health.ny.gov if you have any questions or concerns regarding a COVID-19 vaccine order, inventory, or MOU.

As a result, we have exhausted the adult kits and we will ship the pediatric ancillary kit for all Pfizer 450 vaccine orders until the inventory is depleted . As a reminder, the difference between the Pfizer 450 adult and pediatric ancillary kits is the adult kits include ~20% 1 .5\" needles used to vaccinate certain adults, based on weight . Pediatric kits include 100% 1\" needles .

The emergency use of this product is only authorized for the duration of the declaration that circumstances exist justifying the authorization of emergency use of the medical product under Section 564(b)(1) of the FD&C Act unless the declaration is terminated or authorization revoked sooner . Please see Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) Fact Sheet for Healthcare Providers Administering Vaccine (Vaccination Providers) including Full EUA Prescribing Information available at www .cvdvaccine-us .com . After dilution, vials of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine contain 6 doses of 0 .3 mL of vaccine . Low dead-volume syringes and/or needles can be used to extract 6 doses from a single vial . Use of low dead-volume (LDV) syringes and/or needles may maximize the potential number of vaccine doses and minimize vaccine wastage1 Low dead-volume (also called low dead-space) is the amount of fluid remaining within the syringe and needle after an injection is completed2 Characteristics of LDV syringes and needles High dead-volume needle and syringe Withdrawal of 6 doses is unlikely with standard detachable needles with standard syringe Reduced dead-volume modified syringe LDV SYRINGES have plungers molded to the luer cone, allowing fluid to be cleared from the syringe tip during injection Low dead-volume detachable needle LDV NEEDLES have an extension of the needle that fits through the opening of some standard syringes, allowing for a reduction in dead space Low dead-volume fixed \"all-in-one\" needle and syringe FIXED-NEEDLE SYRINGES have low dead volumes and will, in most cases, achieve 6 doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine Compatible LDV syringe and/or needle pairings may successfully withdraw 6 doses of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine, but not all combinations have been assessed or have a low dead volume that is small enough to allow extraction of a sixth dose . The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is partnering with McKesson to provide ancillary kits containing needles and syringes for use with all COVID-19 vaccines . Please reach out to your state, local, or tribal health department and/or the CDC for more information . Pfizer makes no guarantee of the type or quality of the needles and syringes within the ancillary kits or the capability to withdraw 6 doses .
