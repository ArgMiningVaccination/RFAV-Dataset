This work is an important part of the CEASE therapy and is aimed at homeopaths. In it, Dr. Tinus Smits shares his vision that homeopathy can address the universal human experiences of coming into incarnation from the world of spirit. read more... 3 weeks before his death, Dr. Tinus Smits released his ground breaking work about his CEASE Autism method. Order the book at Amazon. Dr. Smits discovered in his practice with over 300 cases the foundation of CEASE therapy and came to his hypothisis of what causes autism. In his experience autism is an accumulation of different causes and about 70% is due to vaccines, 25% to toxic medication and other toxic substances, 5% to some diseases. With isotherapy (see below), a form of homeopathy using the causative substances themselves in homeopathic preparation, the toxic imprints can be erased. The treatment of autistic children and even adults has matured through 300 cases taken by Dr. Tinus Smits and is called CEASE Therapy. Step by step all asumed causative factors (vaccines, regular medication, environmental toxic exposures, effects of illness, etc.) are cleared with the homeopathically prepared, that is diluted and potentized substances that were administered prior to the onset of autism. Currently we use the 30C, 200C, 1M and 10M potencies to clear out the energetic field of the patient from the imprint of toxic substances or diseases. CEASE therapists are trained during a 3 to 5 day course, given by certified CEASE therapy instructors, to guarantee the high quality of treatment and to ensure the correct application of this method. The homeopathic practitioners are only certified as CEASE therapists after having successfully passed the final exam. They will stay in contact with all other CEASE therapists around the world by an interactive forum and will receive supervision. So far the main obstacle to cure seems to be the lack of information about the causes of this disease. When important events in the life story of these children and their parents are overlooked or unknown, an essential key to the healing can be missed. Using the causative substances as a homeopathic remedy, their profound toxic effects can be witnessed as the children begin to react to the remedies. The reactions on the isopathic remedies are so characteristic, that there can be no doubt about the existence of a link between the toxins as the cause and the development of Autism as its effects although this is not considered as scientific proof. In this way Dr. Smits discovered, step by step, why autism and other behavioral problems, with their specific developmental problems, have so dramatically increased over the last ten to twenty years. It also became clear that autistic children do not suffer from one single cause but from an accumulation of different causes. During pregnancy and the first two years of life the brain is extremely vulnerable and should be protected as much as possible. Medication during and after pregnancy, especially vaccinations can be very toxic to the young child's brain. Even illness, medication and vaccination in the energetic field of the father and mother before pregnancy can be transmitted to the child by energetic transfer. In the book \"Autism, beyond despair\" you will find several examples of this. During Dr. Smits' research for complete healing, he was gradually more and more amazed how certain substances, even those not labeled as toxic, can be a causative factor for autism or other developmental disorders. For example; he saw a dramatic improvement in an autistic girl by the clearing of a nose spray, xylometazolin, which the mother had used regularly during her pregnancy. Prescription and over the counter medication, exposure to chemical substances, that are foreign to the human body and fundamentally toxic, has become more and more the cause of illness. This is not only true for vaccines, but also for many of the treatments prescribed by our modern doctors. Along with the isopathic treatment we also add orthomolecular medicine to properly nourish the brain of these children and to restore proper bowel function. Many supplements are in use for the treatment of autism and have their value, but we use just a few: Vitamin C, Magnesium, Zinc and fish oil. During treatment these supplements serve as a support for the healing process, while the healing process itself comes from the isopathic treatment. These supplements make the whole healing process smoother and help to avoid severe reactions during the clearing. read on... As a third tool we also use classical homeopathy and Inspiring Homeopathy, which are discussed extensively in the Autism, Beyond Despair book. They both play an important role in the complete healing of autistic children. However, without the resolution of the specific causes which are responsible for the development of autism, classical homeopathy by itself cannot bring complete healing most of the time. Nevertheless this way of healing can give very encouraging results and can give the final touch to complete healing. copyright "}
