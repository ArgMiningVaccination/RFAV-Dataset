Van de Wetering, DVM, FAVD ABSTRACT The 2019 AAHA Dental Care Guidelines for Dogs and Cats outline a comprehensive approach to support companion animal practices in improving the oral health and often, the quality of lif e of their canine and feline patients. The guidelines are an update of the2013 AAHA Dental Care Guidelines for Dogs and Cats . A photographically illustrated, 12-step protocol describes the essential steps in an oral health assessment, dental cleaning, and periodont al therapy. Recommendations are given for general anesthesia, pain management, facilit ies, and equipment necessary for safe and effective delivery of care. To promote the wellbeing of dogs and cats through decreasing the adverse effects and pain of periodontal disease, these guidelines emphasize the critical role of clienteducation and effective, preventive oral healthcare.

They were subjected to a formal peer-review process. These guidelines were prepared by a Task Force of experts convened by the American Animal Hospital Association. This document is intended as aguideline only, not an AAHA standard of care. These guidelines and recom-mendations should not be construed as dictating an exclusive protocol, course of treatment, or procedure. Variations in practice may be warranted based on the needs of the individual patient, resources, and limitationsunique to each individual practice setting. Evidence-based support for spe-cic recommendations has been cited whenever possible and appropriate. Other recommendations are based on practical clinical experience and aconsensus of expert opinion. Further research is needed to document someof these recommendations. Because each case is different, veterinarians mustbase their decisions on the best available scienti c evidence in conjunction with their own knowledge and experience. Note: When selecting products, veterinarians have a choice among those formulated for humans and those developed and approved by veterinary use. Manufacturers of veterinary-speci c products spend resources to have their products reviewed and approved by the FDA for canine or feline use.These products are speci cally designed and formulated for dogs and cats and have bene ts for their use; they are not human generic products. AAHA suggests that veterinary professionals make every effort to use veterinaryFDA-approved products and base their inventory-purchasing decisions onwhat product is most bene cial to the patient. yC.

Compromised dental health can affect a pet 'so v e r - all health, longevity, quality of life, and interaction with its ownerwithout exhibiting obvious clinical signs of disease. The purpose ofthis document is to provide guidance to veterinary professionals that will enable them to recognize dental pathology and deliver appropriate preventive and therapeutic care to their patients, as well as to provideessential dental education to their clients. In consideration of our patients 'welfare, veterinary profes- sionals must understand that dental patients often experience con- siderable fear, anxiety, stress, pain, and suffering. In order to achieve optimal clinical success and client satisfaction, it is essential that the veterinary team address these concerns with every client, beginningwith the rst interaction when scheduling an appointment. The guidelines are based on evidence-based information whenever possible, although we recognize that relevant data and well- designed veterinary dental studies have not always been conducted for all the topics covered in these guidelines. As a result, expert opinion and the extensive clinical experience of the Task Forcemembers have been used in writing the guidelines. The collective goalof the Task Force was to apply the highest level of evidence-based information available when preparing the guidelines. The guidelines are intended primarily for general practitioners and veterinary team members without advanced dental training. The Task Force encourages all veterinary professionals to continuouslyimprove their veterinary dentistry knowledge, skills, and treatmentcapabilities and to recognize cases needing referral. It is well known that many pet owners use the internet as a default resource for pet healthcare information and home treatment. 1However, because of the specialized nature of dental procedures, including diagnosis andtreatment, professional veterinary care is necessary for maintaining pet oral health. Therefore, veterinary dentistry represents an op- portunity for a primary care practice to demonstrate a high level ofservice and professional expertise to its clients and to positivelyimpact patient comfort and wellbeing. The guidelines are intended to be a rst-line resource in helping practitioners achieve that essential goal. Readers should consider the guidelines to be an extension and update of the 2013 AAHA Dental Care Guidelines for Dogs and Cats (hereafter referred to as the 2013 AAHA Dental Care Guidelines), which continue to be a relevantsource of medically appropriate information on veterinary den- tistry. 2Although the 2013 AAHA Dental Care Guidelines are anexcellent, basic resource for clinicians, the 2019 guidelines published here provide important new information. This includes (1) an ex-panded and updated discussion of commonly performed veterinarydental procedures, supported by photos that illustrate oral pathol-ogy and therapeutic techniques; (2) criteria for periodontal diseasestaging; (3) the importance for addressing pain and stress in dentalpatients; and (4) client communication tips for explaining the im-portance and rationale behind speci c dental and oral procedures. Client education is a particularly important and often underap-preciated aspect of veterinary dentistry. Without the pet owner 's understanding and acceptance of the veterinarian 's oral health rec- ommendations, the decision to pursue dental cleaning, oral evalu-ation, and treatment will seem optional. Applying the AAHA DentalCare Guidelines with an emphasis on client communication willenhance your practice by providing your clients with services thataddress a critical component of canine and feline healthcare. Dental Terminology Although dental terminology is constantly being de ned, current denitions applicable to veterinary dentistry are shown in Table 1 . Readers will nd it helpful to review these de nitions before reading the remainder of the guidelines. Veterinary dentistry is a discipline within the scope of veterinary practice that involves the professional consultation, evaluation, di-agnosis, prevention, and treatment (nonsurgical, surgical, or relatedprocedures) of conditions, diseases, and disorders of the oral cavityand maxillofacial area and their adjacent and associated structures.Veterinary dental diagnoses are made and treatments performed by alicensed veterinarian, within the scope of his or her education,training, and experience, in accordance with the ethics of the pro-fession and applicable law. The term \"dental \"has lost favor as an all-purpose descriptive term because it does not adequately de ne a particular procedure to be performed. For example, speci c diagnostic and treatment ter- minology should be used to describe procedures such as a completeoral health assessment, orthodontics, periodontal surgery, and ad-vanced oral surgery. Using speci c diagnostic and treatment ter- minology will help staff and clientele understand the importanceand speci cs of a scheduled procedure. Additional information on veterinary dental nomenclature can be found on the American Veterinary Dental College (AVDC) website(avdc.org/Nomenclature/Nomen-Intro.html). Anatomy and Pathology A comprehensive knowledge of oral and dental anatomy andphysiology is imperative for recognizing and treating disease in theoral cavity and teeth. Veterinarians must understand the location, 2 JAAHA | 55:2 Mar/Apr 2019purpose, and function of the structures of the head and oral cavity shown in Figure 1 .3-5Dogs and cats have two generations of teeth (diphyodont), with the roots being longer than crowns. Most of thepermanent tooth is composed of dentin, with the central portion ofthe tooth being the pulp chamber containing blood vessels, nerves,lymphatics, connective tissue, and odontoblasts (Figure 1). 6The tooth supporting structures, or \"periodontium, \"consist of the gingiva, periodontal ligament, cementum, and alveolar bone. Theperiodontal ligament attaches the tooth in the alveolus by beingafxed between the cementum and the alveolar bone (Figure 1). 3,7 There are many pathologic processes that affect the oral cav- ity of dogs and cats (congenital, infectious, traumatic, neoplastic,autoimmune, and others). The most common and signi cant diseaseis the in flammation of the tissues of the periodontium, or periodontal disease. The clinical terms used to describe the active process ofperiodontal disease include gingivitis and periodontitis. Gingivitis,the earliest stage of periodontal disease, is described as in flammation conned to the gingiva and commonly induced by bacterial plaque. Gingivitis is reversible and preventable. 8,9Plaque-induced gingivitis can be reversed by removal of the bacteria above as well as below thegingival margin and prevented with consistent plaque-removinghome oral hygiene efforts. 10Calculus, or bacterial plaque that has become calci ed by salivary minerals, is mostly an irritant and is relatively nonpathogenic.8,9 The bacterial population at the tooth surface is initially com- posed of gram-positive, aerobic bacteria. The bacterial bio lmTABLE 1 Denitions That Pertain to Dental Care Guidelines Terminology De nition Dental chart A written and graphical representation of the mouth, with adequate space to indicate pathology and procedures (see the \"2013 AAHA Dental Care Guidelines\" for included items). Dental prophylaxis A procedure performed on a healthy mouth that includes oral hygiene care, a complete oral examination, and techniques to prevent disease and to remove plaque and calculus above and beneath the gum line under anesthesia before periodontitis has developed.Note : The words \"prophy,\" \"prophylaxis,\" and \"dental\" are often misused in veterinary medicine. More descriptive terms to use for the dental procedures that are commonly performed in companion animal dentistry to prevent periodontitis are COPAT, COHAT, and an oral ATP visit. Dentistry The evaluation, diagnosis, prevention, and/or treatment of abnormalities in the oral cavity, maxillofacial area, and/or associated structures. Nonsurgical, surgical, or related procedures may be included. Endodontics The treatment and therapy of conditions affecting the pulp.Exodontia (extraction) A surgical procedure performed to remove a tooth.Gingivitis Inflammation of the gingiva with or without loss of the supporting structure(s) shown with X-rays.Home oral hygiene Measures taken by pet owners that are intended to control or prevent plaque and calculus accumulation. Oral surgery The practical manipulation and incising of epithelium of hard and soft tissue for the purpose of improving or restoring oral health and comfort. Orthodontics The evaluation and treatment of malpositioned teeth for the purposes of improving occlusion and patient comfort and enhancing the quality of life. Periodontal disease A disease process beginning with gingivitis and progressing to periodontitis when left untreated.Periodontitis A destructive process involving the loss of supportive structures of the teeth, including the periodontium (i.e., gingiva, periodon tal ligament, cementum, and/or alveolar bone). Periodontal surgery Invasive treatment necessary to re-establish or rehabilitate periodontal attachment structures. This is indicated for patie nts with pockets .5 mm, stage 2 and 3 furcation exposure, or inaccessible root structures. Periodontal therapy Treatment of tooth-supporting structures in the presence of existing periodontal disease; includes dental cleaning as dened below and one or more of the following procedures: gingival curettage for nonsurgical removal of plaque, planing periodontal application of antimicrobials. Periodontium The supporting structures of teeth, including (1) periodontal ligament, (2) gingiva, (3) cementum, and (4) alveolar and supporting bone. Pocket A pathologic space between supporting structures and the tooth, extending apically from the normal attachment location of the gingival epithelial attachment. Professional dental cleaning Scaling (supragingival and subgingival plaque and calculus removal) of teeth with power or hand instrumentation, too th polishing, and oral examination performed by a trained veterinary healthcare provider under general anesthesia. Some denitions were derived from previously published descriptions 2 COHAT, comprehensive oral health, assessment, and treatment; COPAT, comprehensive oral prevention, assessment, and treatment; oral ATP, oral ass essment, treatment, and prevention.Dental Guidelines JAAHA.ORG 3eventually invades the sulcus between the gingiva and the tooth, creating an environment selecting for a more destructive anaerobic,gram-negative population. 11The bacterial byproducts directly cause tissue injury resulting in host in flammation, which directly contrib- utes to loss of attachment between the tooth and periodontal struc-tures. If left untreated, the chronic in flammatory host response can progress to periodontitis. 9Periodontitis is an in flammation resulting in irreversible loss of the supporting tissues of the teeth, progressingfrom periodontal ligament attachment loss to the loss of alveolar bone,resulting in clinically detectable a ttachment loss. Although this process can be stabilized, it is not easily reversible and can ultimately lead totooth loss. Other factors in fluencing the progression and ultimate se- verity of periodontal disease may include breed predisposition, mal-occlusion, chewing habits, systemic health, and local irritants. 12 Fractured teeth have been reported in up to 49.6% of com- panion animals.13In the case of a complicated fracture (pulp exposure), the pulp chamber becomes contaminated by oral bacteriaand proceeds to infection and necrosis, resulting in periapicalinfection. 14Tooth resorption is also common, affecting 27 -72% ofdomestic cats and fewer dogs, and is caused by odontoclastic de- struction of teeth. Although the etiology of these progressive lesionsremains unproven, gingival in flammation and exposure of the pulp chamber can be the result. 15These are some of the most common pathologies encountered in veterinary general practice and are as-sociated with various painful stages during the course of progres-sion. Practitioners can supplement their education and experienceby consulting the growing body of literature and online resources onthe oral pathology of dogs and cats. Dental Disease Prevention Strategies It is important to communicate with pet owners the importance ofdental disease prevention strategies, beginning at the rst visit and then throughout the patient 's life stages. It is particularly important to emphasize individualized prevention strategies that should bemaintained on an ongoing basis. Some companion animal practicesuse progress visits to evaluate oral health and home oral hygieneefforts by pet owners. A helpful aspect of client education is forveterinarians and staff to explain to clients the following three waysFIGURE 1 Anatomy of a tooth. \u00aa2019 Veterinary Information Net- work (VIN), illustration by TamaraRees. 4 JAAHA | 55:2 Mar/Apr 2019preventive oral health products work: (1) mechanical (abrasion), (2) nonmechanical (chemical), and (3) a combination of mechanicaland chemical modes of action. Some experts prefer oral healthproducts that have dual action because all the teeth can bene t from the combination of mechanistic activities. In most patients, periodontal disease is a preventable condition. Fractured teeth can often be prevented by appropriate selection ofdental chews and toys and behavior modi cation for separation anxiety and cage-biting. Preventing Periodontal Disease Prevention of periodontal disease begins at the rst visit, either for a puppy or kitten, as well as for a new adult patient. Recommendationsfor young patients include the following: \u00b7A complete oral examination of the deciduous dentition will assess any missing, unerupted, or slow-to-erupt teeth. The oc-clusion should also be evaluated at this time, as well as deter-mination of abnormal jaw length and teeth that are contactingother teeth or soft tissue. In such cases, early extraction may be needed. \u00b7As permanent teeth start to erupt, it is critical to address any retained or persistent deciduous teeth. Immediate extraction ofpersistent deciduous teeth can help prevent displacement of theerupting permanent teeth that can result in a malocclusion, orthat can exacerbate periodontal disease due to crowding.Retained deciduous teeth without a replacement permanenttooth can remain stable, although extraction may be necessaryin cases of unstable dentition. Young pets with missing perma-nent teeth should have intraoral dental radiographs taken toconrm that the teeth are truly not present, as unerupted teeth can be problematic. \u00b7Home oral hygiene training can be started for clients owningpets having erupted, permanent dentition. Juvenile patientsactively exfoliating deciduous teeth may experience discomfortassociated with home dental care efforts, and negative experi-ences should be avoided. \u00b7The owner of any puppy or kitten who will be smaller than 20 - 25 lbs at maturity should be informed that the level of dentalcare and prevention for their pet is likely to be more involvedthan that of a larger dog. Brachycephalic breeds also tend to havemore dental issues due to the rotation and crowding of teeth. \u00b7A true dental prophylaxis (complete dental cleaning, polishing,and intraoral dental radiographs in the absence of obviouslesions) is recommended by 1 yr of age for cats and small- tomedium-breed dogs, and by 2 yr of age for larger-breed dogs.During the procedure, any hidden conditions such as unerup-ted or malformed (dysplastic) teeth can be identi ed andtreated. Ideally, periodontal therapy should then be provided at an interval to optimally manage periodontal disease in thispreventable stage. If periodontal disease with attachment loss is already present in the patient, a complete dental assessment, intraoral radiographs,cleaning, polishing, and any necessary treatment will help address anycurrent disease and optimally prevent further disease progression.Appropriate and effective home oral hygiene (see the \"Client Communication and Education \"section and resources at aaha.org/ dentistry) can help maintain oral health in between dental therapyprocedures. In most patients, effective periodontal prevention canhelp keep the oral cavity in a relatively pain-free and healthy state,favorably impacting the systemic health and welfare of the patient. Clarication of the Impact of Periodontal Health on Systemic Health The long-held dogma that speci c oral bacteria are directly re- sponsible for infection in distant organs is oversimpli ed and dif cult to prove.16,17There is an association shown between periodontal disease and systemic health parameters, and in human medicine, thepresence of chronic in flammation associated with periodontitis has been recognized to likely negatively impact overall systemic health. 18-25The systemic spread of in flammatory mediators and cytokines and bacterial endotoxins from periodontal pathogens canimpact the vascular system throughout the body and even causehistological changes in distant organs. 26-28Management or resolu- tion of the in flammation associated with periodontitis is likely to have greater clinical impact that just considering antibacterial ef-forts. 25,29,30Although evidence demonstrating the direct correlation between systemic disease and oral and dental infections may bedifcult to prove, the positive impact on patient quality of life is often clinically demonstrated and widely experienced. Patient Assessment, Evaluation, and Documentation History and Physical Examination A thorough history of patient health should always include an evaluation and update on systemic maladies as well as an evaluationand review of oral hygiene efforts performed by the pet owner.Proactive management of oral health includes documenting anyefforts by the client to provide home dental care. These include toothbrushing; type of diet fed; access to \"chews, \"treats, and toys; in- formation on chewing habits; and updating any current or previousprofessional or home dental care. A thorough physical examinationshould be performed to evaluate all body systems regardless ofspecies, breed, age, health status, and temperament. Patients pre-senting for complaints separate from the oral cavity should beDental Guidelines JAAHA.ORG 5evaluated for the primary complaint. Appropriate diagnostic tests and treatments should then be recommended. Patients with un-derlying health conditions should be appropriately assessed so thatgeneral anesthesia associated with dental or other procedures can besafely performed. Conscious Oral Evaluation The conscious oral evaluation is an important rst step to antici- pating procedural extent and preparing and educating clients re-garding anticipated ndings while under general anesthesia. In many instances, the examiner will underestimate the presence of diseaseduring conscious evaluation, only to have the full extent of oralpathology revealed by periodontal probing and intraoral radiography. Examination of the conscious patient can be facilitated by use of individualized pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic protocolsdesigned to reduce anxiety, stress, and pain. For anxious, consciouspatients, there should be no hesitation to recommend use of anxi-olytics to facilitate an awake oral examination. For established pa-tients, anxiety can be effectively relieved by administering trazodone in dogs and gabapentin in cats, ideally the evening before and at least 2 hr before presentation if deemed safe and appropriate. For newpatients who are dif cult to assess, rapid-acting olytics such as butorphanol, acepromazine, are recommended. The use of anxiolytics and sedativesshould not replace the need for procedure-associated analgesicstrategies but will support the analgesic ef cacy of analgesic medi- cations. Additional, nonpharmacologic techniques of compassionaterestraint that can help facilitate conscious patient evaluation includelow-stress handling, use of pheromones, reduction of excess noise,and the use of highly palatable treats as a distraction. These tech-niques reduce con flict escalation and ensure the safety of the patient, the client, and veterinary staff. Familiarization with techniques de-scribed in the American Association of Feline Practitioners 'Feline- Friendly Handling Guidelines is recommended. 31 All physical exam ndings should be recorded in the medical record ( Table 2 ). Aside from general physical exam ndings, visual attention should be paid to the head and oral cavity, and the visualevaluation should be performed with appropriate palpation. Speci c signs associated with oral disease include pain on palpation; hali-tosis; drooling; viscous and gingiva and bone; and abnormal or painfultemporomandibular joint range of motion. Occlusion should beevaluated to ensure the patient has a functional, comfortable bite. 32 The head should be evaluated and palpated including inspec-tion and retropulsion of the globes, lymph lips, teeth,mucous membranes, gingiva, vestibule, dorsal and ventral aspects of the tonsils, salivary glands and ducts, and assessment of thecaudal oral cavity and gag re flex if it can be safely elicited. Any and all abnormalities (including abnormal swellings or masses) shouldbe recorded in the medical record. Careful attention to a conscious oral evaluation provides the practitioner with an opportunity to demonstrate oral pathology and educate the client about potential treatment options. Full appreci- ation for the spectrum of treatment options will likely not be knownuntil additional information can be gathered from the radiographicinterpretation and additional anesthetized oral examination ndings such as pulp exposure, furcation exposure, tooth mobility, orperiodontal pocketing. Pre-emptive discussion of oral ndings with the client provides additional time for the client to consider whattreatment options may be offered once anesthetized oral examndings are collected. Periodontal probing for pockets or furcation exposure or dental probing to evaluate for pulp exposure or toothresorption should never be performed on an awake patient. Inad-vertent or deliberate contact with sensitive or painful areas such as theexposed pulp risks hurting the pet and exposing the owner or staff tobeing bit. Additionally, the pet may become averse to objects beingintroduced into its mouth. This tends to undermine the patient 'st r u s t in human handlers and is counterproductive to coaching the client totry various home oral hygiene tools or preventive care techniques. Unconscious Oral Evaluation Only after the patient has been anesthetized can a complete andthorough oral evaluation be successfully performed. 33TheTABLE 2 Items to Include in the Dental Chart or Medical Record SignalmentPhysical examination, medical, and dental history ndingsOral examination ndingsAnesthesia and surgery monitoring log and surgical ndingsAny dental, oral, or other disease(s) currently presentAbnormal probing depths (recorded for each affected tooth) Dental chart with specic abnormalities noted, such as discoloration; worn areas; masses Radiographic ndings/interpretationCurrent and future treatment plan, addressing all abnormalities found.

After collecting this objective information, an individualized treatment plan can bediscussed with the pet owner. A customized treatment plan shouldconsider not only the extent of diagnosed pathology but also thepractitioner 's comfort level in performing such treatments, the cli- ent's willingness to comply with recommended anesthetized recheck oral exams or retreatments, and the client 's willingness and ability to provide supplemental home dental care. It is imperative that the practitioner recognizes that an anes- thetized oral examination with intraoral radiography is necessary forcomplete assessment of oral health. One study found that 28% ofgrossly normal teeth in dogs actually had clinically importantndings radiographically, and a similar study in cats reported 42% of grossly normal teeth demonstrated clinically important radiographicndings. 34,35Without intraoral radiography, the full extent of disease can easily be underestimated, leading to inappropriate treatment recommendations and failure to detect painful disease conditions.Additionally, because of the risk of overlooking retained tooth rootsor causing iatrogenic jaw fracture, the American Veterinary MedicalAssociation 's Professional Liability Insurance Trust considers it dif - cult to defend recommending dental procedures without appropriateclient counseling and without offering intraoral dental radiography. 36 If full-mouth intraoral dental radiographs cannot be taken, it is theresponsibility of the healthcare team to advise the client that a com-plete, comprehensive examination cannot be performed. In order to maximize patient bene ts, full-mouth intraoral dental radiographs are necessary to avoid missing inapparent pathology and toestablish the patient 's baseline. At a minimum, pre- and postextractionintraoral dental radiographs are essential. Although the interpretation of full-mouth radiographs may risk overtreatment of coincidentalndings, it has been well documented that more clinically relevant pathology can only be identi ed radiographically. 34,35 As practitioners obtain the equipment necessary to take intraoral radiographs, it is essential to develop the knowledge andskills necessary to take and interpret diagnostic images. Opportu-nities to receive continuing education in these areas can be soughtfrom veterinary dental specialists (Diplomate AVDC) and VeterinaryTechnician Specialists in Dentistry (VTS Dentistry) at nationalveterinary conventions, the Annual Veterinary Dental Forum, inbooks and online courses, and at private continuing education events.The Guidelines Task Force strongly recommends full-mouthintraoral dental radiographs in all dental patients. Considering When to Refer Recommending and providing optimal dental treatment recom-mendations for your patients sometimes includes recognizing whenthey should be referred to a specialist. This should be done when the capabilities of the provider, expectations of the client, or anesthetic management concerns exceed the comfort level of the primary careveterinarian. Referral to a veterinary dental specialist or practitionerwith advanced dental training, expertise, or equipment is advisable ifthedental procedure requires skills and expertise beyond the level of capabilities of the primary care veterinarian . Veterinary dental spe- cialists often have experience managing high-risk dental patients.Referral may be preferable if the client expresses the desire for a higher level of care that may exceed the capabilities of the primary care vet-erinarian . Even though the primary care veterinarian may possess the procedural dentistry skills necessary to treat oral pathology, re- ferral to a practice with a veterinary anesthesiologist may be bene cial to address anesthetic risk factors comorbidities . Additionally, such FIGURE 2 A\"four-handed \"den- tistry procedure with the practitionerdictating oral exam ndings to a dental assistant. Photo courtesy of JanBellows.Dental Guidelines JAAHA.ORG 7referral practices may include access to other individuals with ex- pertise in managing patients with underlying comorbidities thatjeopardize the safety of the anesthetic event, especially involvingpatients with cardiac disease, chronic renal disease, diabetes, orhyperadrenocorticism. Dental Procedures General Considerations Nonsurgical dental procedures must be performed by a licensed veterinarian,a credentialed technician, or a trained ve terinary assistant under veterinarian supervision in accordance with applicab le state or provincial practice acts. Oral surgery, including surgical extractions, must be performed only bytrained, licensed veterinarians. State-by-state regulations concerningwhat licensed technicians can perform are summarized at avma.org/Advocacy/StateAndLocal/Pages/sr-dental-procedures.aspx. Anesthesia allows the practitioner and assistants to carry out dental procedures in a safe and effective manner, minimizing the risk ofinjury. Anesthesia recommendations and techniques are discussed inthe \"Anesthesia, Sedation, and Analgesia Considerations \"section. All dental procedures need to use a consistent method to record pathological ndings, recommended treatments, treatment performed,and treatment declined, as well as future planned treatment and pre- vention recommendations in the medical record. Practitioners should be aware that transient bacteremia from the oral cavity is commonplace and increased during oral procedures,and therefore, risk for seeding other remote surgical locations ispossible. Combining dental and other surgical procedures should beperformed with caution. The risk of multiple anesthetic eventsshould be weighed against the risk of complicated healing in thepresence of signi cant periodontal disease. 37 Positioning and safety of the patient is important. The head and neck should be stabilized when forces are being applied in the mouth.The use of spring-loaded mouth gags must be avoided as it maycompromise blood flow, which may cause myalgia, neuralgia, blindness, or trauma to the temporomandibular joint. If a mouthprop is necessary, do not fully open the mouth or overextend thetemporomandibular joint. 38 Whenever possible, practitioners and assistants should dem- onstrate healthy ergonomic practices to avoid chronic injury. Ac-tivities and procedures that cause excessive reaching, bending, andtwisting should be limited. For example, instruments and equipmentshould be arranged where they can be easily grasped. Supplies should FIGURE 3 AAHA canine dental record (aaha.org/dental_resources). FIGURE 4 AAHA feline dental record (aah a.org/dental_resources). 8 JAAHA | 55:2 Mar/Apr 2019be placed as close as possible to the working area and at working height to decrease stretching and bending. Suf cient space should be allowed to enable turning the whole body, using a swivel stool. Essential Steps Before, During, and After the Dental Cleaning and Periodontal Therapy The essential steps for a professional dental cleaning and periodontal therapy are as follows: 1.Perform an oral evaluation on the conscious patient before administering anesthesia. A visual assessment can suggest whether periodontal disease exists and its extent. 2.Radiograph the entire mouth of the anesthetized patient using intraoral lm or intraoral digital radiographic systems. 3.Scale curette ultrasonic scaler followed by a curette inserted subgingi-vally to remove additional plaque and calculus ( Figure 5 ).D o not use a rotary scaler, which excessively roughens the tooth enamel. 39,40Elimination of calculus is essential because it acts as a retention matrix for plaque and toxins harmful to the tooth 's support. Curettes are designed to assist in the removal of sub-gingival plaque and calculus for root planing and curettage(soft tissue removal in diseased periodontal pockets). Curetteshave a smooth, rounded heel and toe opposite the cuttingsurface. The rounded back makes curettes less traumatic to softtissues compared with sickle scalers.Every professional teeth cleaning should include hand scalingof the accessible root surfaces ( Figures 6, 7 ). Aggressive curet- tage and scaling causing cementum removal is covering the roots contains cell-activating proteinsthat encourage reattachment. Dentin does not contain theseproteins. Subgingival ultrasonic treatment causes cavitationand disruption of the subgingival ecosystem and bio lm. The design and safety of thin, long, ultrasonic periodontal tips de-crease the need to aggressively root-plane teeth affected byperiodontal disease. 4.Crown polishing is recommended after cleaning and scaling, to assist in the reduction of microabrasions on the enamel. Polish the teeth using a low-speed hand piece prophy angle andpolishing cup running at no more than 3000 rpm. Polishwith prophy paste or ne-grit pumice because medium or course grit can contribute to enamel loss, microabrasions,and predisposition for plaque accumulation. The use of dis-posable prophy angles and individually packaged prophypaste is strongly recommended to avoid cross contamination. 5.Perform oral evaluation using a periodontal probe after dental scaling and full-mouth radiographs have been obtained. Eachtooth should be probed in at least six places parallel to the roots. The probing depth should not be greater than 2 -3m m in a midsized dog and 1 mm in a midsized cat. Oral exam-ination abnormal ndings should be charted. 41 6.Perform subgingival irrigation to remove debris and polishing paste and to inspect the crown and subgingival areas. Use the air or water syringe to inspect the visible subgingival areas for remaining calculus requiring removal ( Figure 8 ). 7.After sharing examination ndings, a therapy plan, related fees, and informed consent with the pet owner, perform indicated periodontal therapy or extractions. Periodontal disease staging and appropriate treatment are as follows: \u00b7Stage 1 (periodontal disease staging [PD]1, gingivitis): Den- tal scaling, polishing, irrigation, home dental care. \u00b7Stage 2 (PD2, early periodontal disease with ,25% attach- ment loss): PD1 care plus locally applied antimicrobials and/or subgingival scaling if pocketing exists. \u00b7Stage 3 (PD3, established periodontal disease with 25 -50% attachment loss): Periodontal treatment including periodontal surgery will only be successful if the client is committed to consistently administering home dental care.

Periodontal therapy: closed- or open-root planing 6 locally applied antimicrobials or a dvanced periodontal treatment such as guided tissue regeneration. \u00b7Stage 4 (PD4, advanced periodontal disease with .50% at- tachment loss): Extraction or periodontal surgery including osseous resective or additive procedures followed by con-sistently performed home dental care; prognosis is consid- ered guarded. Extraction site packing, which includes bone autografts, allografts, or synthetic products, may be appropriate in select extraction sites where the remaining supporting bone is at risk for fracture during the period of extraction site healing, for example, in a dog 's mandibular rst molar or canine. These products are used to facilitate bone healing when concern over bone integrity or strength exists. The use of extraction site packing is contra- indicated in the presence of osteomyelitis or infection. 42-44 Periodontal surgery is performed to remove deep debris, eliminate pockets, and to extract teeth. When pocketing orgingival recession exceeds 50% of the root support, extrac-tion is indicated and should be performed by trained veter-inarians or referred for treatment by a veterinary dentalspecialist when the practitione r does not have the expertise, equipment, or facilities to perform treatment. It is recom-mended that extraction sites .1 mm should be sutured withDental Guidelines JAAHA.ORG 9absorbable suture (4-0 or smaller) to keep blood clots in and food and debris out. 8.Administer either systemic or local perioperative antibiotics where indicated. The use of antibiotics in veterinary den- tistry must be assessed on a case-by-case basis. Therapeuticantimicrobials should be used appropriately in the surgicalsetting. Most dental procedures are considered to be clean-contaminated procedures, meaning that after extractions, systemic antibiotics are usually not indicated. 45-47 Preoperative antibiotics given several days before surgery may be administered in cases of PD4 for the purpose ofmaking tissues more amenable to surgical handling. Intra-operative antibiotics may be indicated in patients with sys-temic risk factors, such as subaortic stenosis, systemic FIGURE 5 Sequence for a dental cleaning and periodontal therapyprocedure.

Appropriate clinical judgment for each indi- vidualized patient is necessary. Postoperative antibiotics areindicated when radiographic evidence of presumed osteomy-elitis is present. Clindamycin (5.5 mg/kg per os q 12 hr) and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (13.75 mg/kg per os q 12 hr) are both approved for use in cases of dental infections andshould be prescribed for a full 7 -14 day course. The use of locally applied antimicrobials (LAA), also calledperioceutics, may be indicated where a .5 mm cleaned pocket exists in PD2 or PD3 cases ( Figure 9 ). The purposeof use is to improve periodontal health and encourage reat- tachment to a normal level. 48PD4 cases require periodontal debridement and compo-nent. substances such as barrier sealants. It is impor- tant for practitioners to understand the appropriate indicationsfor the use of sealants. The term \"sealant \"in human dentistry is a substance applied to teeth to prevent tooth decay. In veteri-nary medicine, barrier sealants are applied to decrease the ac-cumulation of plaque ( Figure 10 ). Although the use of barrier sealants has been shown to decrease accumulation of plaquesubgingivally, it does not totally prevent accumulation of sub-gingival plaque, the occurrence of periodontal disease, the needfor home oral hygiene, or professional dental therapy. 49-51 The use of resin-bonded sealants is designed to treat damaged tooth structure (e.g., fractured o r abraded teeth without pulp ex- posure) by sealing exposed dentin tubules, thus decreasing sensi-tivity and risk for bacterial migration leading to pulpitis. Acomplete examination and intraoral radiographs are necessary be-fore using any bonded sealant to identify nonvital teeth and otherpathology. Application of these products requires appropriate training and radiographic follow-up in 6 mo to recon rm tooth vitality. Inappropriate use may result in increased dental pain, risk FIGURE 8 Compressed air used to visualize the root surface and subgingival calculus. Photo courtesy of Jan Bellows.

Medically important and indicated procedures should not be absolutely discouraged based on chronologic age or most underlyingcomorbidities. The most recent AAHA/AAFP Pain ManagementGuidelines provide the entire veterinary care team an opportunity torevisit the pathophysiology of pain and intervention strategies andassociated pharmacology/pharmacokinetics of treatment. General anesthesia with endotracheal intubation, appropriate monitoring, and physiologic support is necessary for dental proce-dures, including dental cleaning and scaling as well as more advanceddental care. Expert opinion and published data strongly support theuse of general anesthesia for dentistry. So-called \"anesthesia-free \" dentistry has not been shown to be safer or comparable to the ca-pacity to supra- and subgingivally clean teeth in an anesthetizedpatient and is therefore unacceptable. 2,61 Any dog or cat presenting for anesthesia should be considered on an individual basis. Anesthesia for o lder dental patients and those with comorbidities requires special atte ntion. Each patient will have speci c physiologic alterations or diseases unique to that individual. Thus, the anesthetic protocol needed for one patient typically will be quite differentfrom that needed for another. The use of local anesthetics as dental blocksdramatically decreases the depth of gen eral anesthesia needed, and thereby helps support blood pressure, decreases ventilatory depression, providesanalgesia, and generally increases safety. Additionally, anxiolytic adminis-tration prior to veterinary visits has become routine to decrease stress insome patients. The synergistic effect between anxiolytics and other drugs necessitates consideration for decrease d amount of premedication, induction agents, and maintenance anesthetics necessary to achieve the desired effecta n ds h o u l db ec o n s i d e r e dw h e nf o r m u l a t i n ga na n e s t h e t i cp l a n . As with any patient, a thorough and complete history and preanesthetic examination should be completed. Any previous anes-thetic experience with the patient should be noted, and close attentionshould be paid to any anesthetic complications or abnormal responses.A minimum database including laboratory evaluation and imaging willbe individually developed. Additional diagnostics will be indicated forsome dental patients based on clinical signs, practical availability, andclient consultation. Any abnormal preanesthetic ndings should be thoroughly evaluated and delaying the anesthesia and surgery shouldbe considered if necessary to address any potential problem areasidenti ed. Veterinarians must be in tune with their clients, their pa- tient 's psychosocial issues, and the existing human -animal bond. Often, stressed and compromised animals do not thrive at the vet-erinary practice, away from their families and homes. Considerations should be made to make the dental stay brief and less stressful. Outpatient techniques with prompt return of thepatient to familiar settings and routines are highly desirable for all FIGURE 9 Injection of perioceutic into a 5 mm cleaned, bleeding periodontal pocket. Photo courtesy of Jan Bellows. 12 JAAHA | 55:2 Mar/Apr 2019dental patients. A gentle approach, both in pharmacology and in the application of clinical techniques, is especially important and willbenet all patients. Support of the human -animal bond is an im- portant goal, and dedicated emphasis on the reduction of fear, stress,and pain is always warranted and primarily addressed throughmanagement and behavioral modi cation. Anesthetic management represents a powerful combination of additional modalities. General Anesthesia For outpatient dental anesthesia, it is useful to select perioperativemedications that (1) typically provide for a rapid and completerecovery (propofol or alfaxalone), (2) can be carefully reversed(diazepam, midazolam, opioids, and dexmedetomidine), (3) can betotally eliminated ventilation (iso flurane, sevo flurane, or des flurane), or (4) do not have substantial intrinsic toxicity or signicant adverse effects should drug effects persist (diazepam, midazolam, or butorphanol). In situations in which delayed or in-adequate recovery is recognized, physiologic support including judi-cious fluid therapy, support of body temperature, ventilatory support, and extended postanesthetic care should be provided. It is worthnoting that there is a strong consensus among veterinary anesthesi-ologists to reverse dexmedetomidine only when medically necessary,which allows the bene cial residual sedation to continue after the completion of procedures in order to facilitate and ease recovery. Ifnecessary, consider using a low dose of atipamezole in cats. 62 Adequate fluid replacement should be given to help prevent a renal crisis and to help maintain a proper perioperative hemody-namic state. The rate of IV fluid administration will depend on the particular patient 's needs, but will generally be in the range of 3 - 5 mL/kg/hr. 63 Careful planning and additional attention to drug and dosage selection is important to safely manage high-risk patients. Someinjectable general anesthetic agents need to be used with care in higher-risk patients (including geriatric animals) because of thetypically altered hemodynamics, pharmacokinetics, and pharmaco-dynamics; decreased plasma protein binding; and decreased hepatic metabolism and renal excretion in compromised animals.Brachycephalic breeds and their associated airway conformationswarrant particularly close attention during the induction and re-covery periods to avoid hypoxia and prevent dyspnea. Inhalant general anesthetics are the anesthetics of choice in many small animal patients, especially for procedures lasting longerthan 10 -15 min. The inhalants iso flurane and sevo flurane offer the advantage for outpatient anesthesia of rapid adjustment of inhaledand alveolar anesthetic dose and effect. However, inhalational in-duction of anesthesia (by either mask or chamber) is contra-indicated in almost all clinical situations. 64 Dose-dependent vasodilatation and hypotension preclude the use of higher doses of inhalant anesthetics in many higher-risk patients.Dose-sparing anesthesia achieved using lower doses of synergisticallyacting injectable systemic agents (e.g., a fentanyl infusion) with localanesthetic techniques allows for the maintenance of partial IV anes-thesia (PIV A) with comparatively low doses of inhalants. In otherwords, \"less is more. \"In more extreme cases, injectable agents (total IV anesthesia [TIV A]) are best used in conjunction with intubationand oxygen supplementation but without inhalant anesthesia. Thisapproach can often support markedly improved hemodynamics. Patients should be preoxygenated for 2 -5 min before anesthetic induction to help prevent hypoxia from developing during induction.Every anesthetized patient should be intubated to protect andmaintain a patent airway. The safety that often has been associatedwith inhalants, as opposed to injectable anesthetics, is partly due tothe customary, if not obligatory, provision of supplemental oxygen asthe carrier gas for the volatile anesthetics. Endotracheal intubation FIGURE 10 Application of antiplaque sealant. ( A) Barrier sealant gel professionally applied to a cat 's gingival sulcus; home plaque prevention gel is then reapplied weekly by the pet owner. ( B) Application of hydrophilic gingival dental sealant professionally applied to a dog 's gingival sulcus; reapplication is recommended every 6 mo. Photo courtesy of Jan Bellows.Dental Guidelines JAAHA.ORG 13and administration of supplementary oxygen can easily be incorpo- rated into injectable general anesthetic techniques and substantiallyadds to patient safety. If anesthesia is deep enough to allow forplacement of an endotracheal tube, then the patient is no longer ableto protect its airway from either obstruction or aspiration of regur-gitated or foreign material. Adherence to proper techniques protectsour personnel and practices from waste anesthetic gases. 64 Sedation In select cases in which teeth cleaning, polishing, and extractions arenot anticipated, heavy sedation may be appropriate and suf cient to collect limited baseline information. Examples include a targetedintraoral radiograph recheck and a more involved preliminary ex-amination of the oral cavity. When making the decision to use se-dation versus general anesthesia, there are three considerations: (1)protecting the patient, (2) protecting personnel, and (3) protectingequipment. The loss of intrinsic airway protection requires us to placean endotracheal tube and serves as an operational distinction betweensedation and anesthesia. The use of reversible agents, such as alpha- agonists, or boluses of induction agents, such as propofol combined with a quiet and dim environment and care to avoid stimulation, mayprovide suf cient chemical restraint to meet these ends. Sedation-only procedures generate limitations including risking aspiration of fluids and aerosolized bacteria into the airways and substandard ability to monitor ventilatory capacity without a properendotracheal tube in place. Because of the brief duration of actionand efforts to minimize depth of sedation, challenges arise sur-rounding the ability to appropriately monitor patient hemodynamicsbecause time and patient handling (additional stimuli) are necessaryto properly af x monitoring equipment. This results in dif culties monitoring the adequacy of sedation even with well-trained anddedicated staff. Because of the absence of reaching a surgical plane ofanesthesia, sedation risks self-in flicted injury from the patient 's re- flexes when attempting to probe subgingivally during an oral exam and unnecessary risk for damage to equipment if bitten. Personnelhealth must also be considered during sedated procedures becausean absence of a proper endotracheal tube while delivering inhalantgas risks human exposure to waste gas, ultrasonic scaling with in-appropriate irrigation results in increased bacterial aerosolization,and abrupt patient response to stimuli risks bite injury. Local Analgesia Anyone performing oral surgical or periodontal procedures shouldbe familiar with dental nerve block techniques, including a thoroughknowledge of oral anatomy and analgesic agents and their applica-tion. Administration of local anesthetics will decrease the amount ofrequired inhalant anesthetic, will decrease the required amount ofother analgesics, and will ease the transition to administering postoperative oral pain medications at home. Speci c techniques for local anesthetic dental nerve blocks (indications, doses, and speci c techniques) are described in detail by Niemiec et al., Beckman, andGracis, and others. 61,65 -68Three approaches for the maxillary nerve block are well described and offer choices based on anatomy andpersonal preference. 66The maxillary tuberosity approach, using or extraoral (via the buccal pouch) access, allows for avery short needle insertion just posterior to the caudal molar andmaxillary tuberosity. Both the subzygomatic approach and thetechnique of advancing the needle through the infraorbital canalprovide access to the maxillary nerve as alternatives. Care is taken toavoid damage to the maxillary or infraorbital neurovascular or may blocked using the infraorbital nerve block technique alone,but anesthesia should be reliable from the third or fourth premolarand the more rostral structures including the canine teeth. 67 The mandibular or inferior alveolar block can be performed at the angle of the mandible. The more successful intraoral approach technique is recommended.68More rostral block at the mental fo- ramen is less effective.60Rarely, the lingual branch will be anesthetized with a mandibular nerve block, and a very few patients may bite theirtongue during recovery. Recovery of the patient in sternal recum-bency with the tongue between the jaws may decrease this risk. Regardless of the local anesthetic technique or site, always as- pirate to avoid intravascular injection of local anesthetic. Other usesof local anesthetics may contribute to the basic nerve block tech-niques and include \"splash blocks, intrapulpal injection. 66 Nonanesthetic Dentistry Nonanesthetic dentistry (NAD), also referred to as anesthesia-free dentistry, is a procedure in which the teeth are scaled andpolished without the bene t of general anesthesia. NAD is considered not appropriate because of patient stress, injury, riskof aspiration, and lack of diagnostic capabilities. Because thisprocedure is intended to only clean the visible surface of theteeth, it provides the pet owner with a false sense of bene tt o their pet 'so r a lh e a l t h . 69,70 Veterinary dentistry relies on detailed examination by a veter- inarian with thorough knowledge of oral anatomy, physiology, andpathology to make an accurate diagnosis. The examination includesradiographs, requiring the animal to be motionless, as well as the useof costly equipment in the oral cavity. Periodontal probing (noxiousstimulus) is also required to allow appropriate diagnosis andtreatment recommendations. 14 JAAHA | 55:2 Mar/Apr 2019Removal of plaque and calculus is the most common treatment recommended and performed for the treatment of periodontaldisease. It requires that subgingival surfaces be cleaned. This processis uncomfortable, and at times painful, for the patient. Removal ofsupragingival calculus alone is purely cosmetic and ineffective to treatdisease. The processes described above are not possible in a consciousdog or cat. Without general anesthesia, an accurate diagnosis cannotbe made, patient pain cannot be addressed, the patient 's airway cannot be protected from aspiration, and disease cannot be ap-propriately treated. When NAD is performed, the owner may be under the false impression that the pet was not stressed by restraint, that pain wasmanaged, and that oral disease was accurately diagnosed and treated.Patients who undergo NAD may go for long periods with untreateddisease, leading to more costs to health status (disease progressionand pain) and increased costs to the client. Peer-reviewed dataaddressing the safety and ef cacy of this controversial procedure are very limited. 71-73 The risks of anesthesia in healthy or minimally compromised patients are very low when performed by appropriately trained in- dividuals. A veterinarian concerned about the risk of anesthetizing apatient may seek the assistance of a diplomate of the AmericanVeterinary Dental College or a diplomate of the American College ofVeterinary Anesthesia and Analgesia. 74See aaha.org/dentistry for additional resources for discussing the risks of NAD. Addressing Pain For both veterinary professionals and pet owners, the ability torecognize dental pain is limited because dogs and cats often maskovert signs of oral discomfort. Untreated dental pain may be indi-rectly demonstrated by halitosis, teeth chattering, weight loss, changein eating habits, lethargy, and change in behavior with reluctance toengage in the human -animal bond. A short course of oral pain medication may provide objective improvement to the patient 's quality of life, thus bolstering support for the dental procedure. It is imperative to recognize the importance of pre-emptive, intraprocedural, and postprocedural dental pain management. Theuse of pre-emptive multimodal analgesia with synergistic comple-mentary classes of analgesics is obligatory and effective in managingdental procedural pain. Pre-emptive versus postprocedural nonsteroidal anti- inflammatory agents may be most effective but would not be se- lected for patients with hypovolemia, dehydration, chronic renaldisease, azotemia, and other risk factors. Opioids are often used alone or in combination with tran- quilizers in the dental patients as preanesthetic medications. Use ofanxiolytics and sedatives does not replace primary ef antagonists, and partial agonists have great value. The Role of Technicians and Assistants Credentialed veterinary technicians and veterinary assistants have aprominent role in canine and feline dental care. Highly ef cient veterinary dental practices fully use and empower them in both theexam room and the dental suite. The Guidelines Task Force stronglyencourages veterinary practices to support the training and educationof their veterinary technicians and assistants to assume a larger andappropriate role in dental practice. In the exam room, they shouldobtain a patient medical and dental history. They should be able toexplain to the client the dental procedures indicated, answer ques-tions, translate veterinary diagnoses into lay terms, and reassure theclient by demonstrating expertise in dentistry. In the dental suite, a credentialed veterinary technician should perform both a conscious and anesthetized initial oral exam and dictatecharting to a veterinary assistant, t ake diagnostic radiographs, perform cleaning procedures, and place regional blocks if indicated. Because extractions are considered oral surgery, they should not be performed by veterinary technicians. Veterinarians need to provide the appropriate levelof oversight and supervision as required by their state practice acts (www.avma.org/Advocacy/StateAndLocal/Pages/sr-dental-procedures.aspx). Veterinary technicians and assistants are the veterinary team 'sp a - tient advocates and client educators. They should spend time with thepet owner before and at the time of discharge, explaining the proceduresand treatments performed, home o ral hygiene, and medications. In addition, they should interview the client to determine the best homedental care options for the pet and advise, demonstrate, and instruct theowners on how to provide quality home oral hygiene for their pet. Practices should encourage continuing education and training of veterinary team members. Enabling team members to increase thelevel of their training and education brings satisfaction and con-tributes to the retention of skilled personnel. Delineation of dutiesbased upon the training and education of the staff also bene ts the practice by fully using the team and ensuring patient safety. Manyskills in dentistry should be only performed by credentialed veter-inary technicians with the knowledge base to understand how toperform a skill and understand why a procedure is performed and therisks associated with each task. The highest level of training and certi cation is the Veterinary Technician Specialist in Dentistry, designated as VTS (Dentistry).This certi cation is issued by the Academy of Veterinary Dental Technicians and awarded to credentialed veterinary technicians whocomplete a rigorous 2 yr process of education. VTS (Dentistry)training includes both didactic and experiential learning culminatingin examination. Although most credentialed veterinaryDental Guidelines JAAHA.ORG 15technicians may not have the interest to pursue VTS (Dentistry) training, companion animal practices should support and encouragebasic and advanced continuing education in dentistry for all teammembers. Trained veterinary assistants are valued members of thepractice team and should act as assistants to the credentialed vet-erinary technician. Care should be given to assure that veterinaryassistants are only performing tasks appropriate to their skill level andtheir state 's practice act. Facility, Equipment, and Operator Safety Requirements Facility Requirements Excellent dental care for canine and feline patients requires an efcient, organized, and safe work environment. As a result of environmental contamination that occurs during many dentalprocedures, a dedicated space in a low-traf c area separate from the sterile surgical suite is necessary. Other requirements includea p p r o p r i a t ev e n t i l a t i o n ,a na n e s t h e t i cs c a v e n g i n gs y s t e m ,a n dadequate surgical lighting and magni cation. This allows ade- quate visualization for oral treatments and surgery. The proce- dure table must be impervious and sanitizable and allow fordrainage because dental procedures typically produce a largeamount of water. Materials, Instruments, and Equipment An assortment of correct dental surgical instruments is essential foradequate dental care. A \"one size ts all \"approach to dental surgical equipment is inadequate. Several different sizes of dental luxators,elevators, periosteal elevators, scalers, curettes, and mechanical scalerinserts make for a more comprehensive oral surgery suite. Dentalinstruments must be in proper working order and properly stored,with defective instruments repaired or discarded and replaced. Otherdental materials, consumable dental equipment, and products mustnot be expired. As with any surgical instruments, all dental instru-ments must be cleaned and autoclaved between each use and storedin a sterile manner until the next use. Instruments may be autoclavedaccording to procedure, such as examination materials, suture packs,oral surgery instruments, exodontia instruments, periodontal surgeryinstruments, and materials. Additionally, materials used for guidedtissue regeneration must be sterile and perioceutics used according tomanufacturer recommendations. It goes without saying that properknowledge of instrument use and storage is essential. Single-use itemsmust be discarded after each patient use. If barrier sealants and dentinsealants are used, each must be selected and applied appropriately.References from the 2013 AAHA Dental Care Guidelines providerecommendations and information on ordering equipment. 8,75 -78A basic assortment of recommended materials and instruments forveterinary dentistry is listed in Table 3 . See aaha.org/dentistry for additional resources on instruments. Operator Protection Pathogens and debris such as calculus, tooth fragments, plaque, waterspray, and prophy paste are aerosolized during dental procedures. It isprudent to irrigate the oral cavity with a 0.12% chlorhexidine so-lution before dental scaling, tooth sectioning, and drilling to decreasebacterial aerosolization. 79The safety of the operator is ensured during dental procedures by using radiographic, oral, respiratory,skin, eye, and ear protective devices as noted in the 2013 AAHA Dental Care Guidelines. 2Ergonomic considerations for personnel performing dental procedures include proper seating, fatiguemats for standing, and proper positioning of both the patient andmaterials to minimize immediate and chronic operator injuries.Instruction on proper instrument handling techniques should beprovided. 2Radiographic safety precautions should be adhered to at all times while radiographs are obtained. Radiation protection shouldinclude the use of a lead shield or apron, thyroid shield, and a ra-diation dosimeter. Sources of radiation in the dental suite includedirect exposure to the primary beam, scatter radiation, and leakagefrom the tube head. The operator and other staff should not be in thepath of the primary beam. Scatter radiation can be minimized bystanding at least 6 ft from the source, maintaining a 90 -1358angle from the path of the primary beam, and avoiding touching the tubehead or housing during exposures. Tests for leakage radiation shouldbe conducted on a regularly scheduled basis by a licensed profes-sional. 8See aaha.org/dentistry for more resources on radiation safety. Client Communication and Education Terminology and Messaging The most important step in achieving compliance with oral healthrecommendations is getting the client to understand the value andbelieve in the importance of regular dental care. This awarenessgenerally results when client realizes that oral pathology is a source ofchronic pain, infection, and poor quality of life for the pet. 20,80The majority of dental care takes place in the primary care setting. Afundamental aspect of delivering high-quality veterinary dental careis for the practice team to use consistent dental care terminologyand messaging with the client. When this is consistently done usingtools such as a written treatment plan, client compliance with youroral health recommendations will generally follow. Dental terminology should re flect the importance and breadth of the dental and oral disease preventio n, diagnostics, and therapies. For example, the consensus viewpoint of the Guidelines Task Force is thatusing the simpli ed term \"prophy \"is incorrect and misleading because our dental patients often have calculus and gingivitis before 16 JAAHA | 55:2 Mar/Apr prophy nor the term \"dental \"adequately convey the breadth or complexity of oral health services offered in primary care or referral practices. The broader ter-minology \"oral health \"better conveys the full scope of this aspect of pet healthcare. Even the correct use of medical terminology withoutproperly educating the client as to its meaning is insuf cient. The practice team should avoid acronyms, overly simpli ed terminology, and medical jargon when discussing oral healthcare with clients. Per- haps more than most other aspects of veterinary care, proper use oforal health terminology is directly li nked to client understanding, ac- ceptance, and compliance with your recommendations. Explaining the Role of Anesthesia The client should be told that their pet needs a comprehensive, anesthetized oral exam and dental radiographs in order to perform a preventive cleaning or dental-periodontal therapy. It is also vital thatthe client understands the distinction between awake and anes- thetized dental procedures. When the veterinarian explains that an awake patient must be anesthetized for a proper exam and therapy, clients understand the central role of anesthesia in oral healthcare. This often leads to a discussion of the client 's concerns about an- esthesia, a common reason given by pet owners who decline oralcare. Clients and, sadly, practitioners are often susceptible to un-supported myths about unreasonable risks of general anesthesia. It is helpful to manage client expectations on the need for general anesthesia early in a patient 's life or at the outset of an oral health visit. Sample dialog might consist of \"Y our pet will need an anesthetized oral exam, dental radiographs, and cleaning between 1and 2 yr of age, even if no abnormalities are seen on the awakeexam. 34,35After that, a periodic anesthetized oral exam, treatment, cleaning, and prevention should be given throughout her lifetime. Wewill develop a prevention plan that will work for you and your pet. \" Discussing Regular Oral Healthcare Oral health should be discussed at the rst appointment and every visit thereafter. A 6 mo awake oral health exam is appropriate. Thepatient should be evaluated for permanent dentition, retained orpersistent deciduous teeth, unerupted teeth, and crowding. A regularawake exam can identify oral health problems that can be effectivelytreated at an early stage with minimal discomfort to the pet. Forexample, extraction of persistent deciduous teeth when the per-manent tooth begins to erupt can avoid more extensive interventionlater on. 82 Although most clients will not have experience with diabetes, heart disease, or a ruptured cruciate ligament, they are all familiarwith their personal oral health. It is helpful to use the client 's existing personal hygiene habits for themselves and their children as a bridgeto dental care recommendations for a pet. Client education topics and recommendations will differ based on the pet 's age and breed and the client 's prior misconceptions about pet oral healthcare. 83By discussing dental care at each appointment, the client becomes fa-miliar with the concept of oral health. Using \"road-mapping \" techniques and providing the client with written instructions andrecommendations will facilitate in-depth pet oral health discussionsat later healthcare visits. See aaha.org/dentistry for additional clienteducation resources. Nonanesthetic Scaling of Teeth Clients should be informed that groomers and others should never beallowed to scale a pet 's teeth. Scaling of teeth must always be accom- panied by polishing and must only be done by trained veterinary per-sonnel operating in a clinical setti ng with an anesthetized animal. Explain that NAD scaling is a cosm etic procedure, does not improve oral or systemic health, and can cause pain, fear, bleeding, and infection. Recommending Home Oral Hygiene and Products Advise clients regularly of the potential damage done by inap- propriate chew toys and the bene ts of regular home dental care. In offering this guidance, speci c recommendations are more likely to be followed. For example, explain that \"Your dog will bene t from feeding this food and using this toothpaste and toothbrush at leastonce a day, \"or\"The prescription diet is working well to control tartar (calculus) and plaque on the back teeth, but I would like youto add these dental wipes for the incisor and canine teeth. \"Clients must be told speci cally that brushing only removes plaque, not calculus. Brushing needs to be done daily to be of bene t. Brushing teeth with already in flamed gingiva will cause pain and animal aversion. Even daily brushing does not preclude the need foranesthetized exams, radiographs, and therapy, the same as in hu-man dental care. Discussing the Anesthetized Oral Exam It is critical to have a written protocol to avoid misunderstandingregarding an anesthetized oral exam. It is not until the mouth andoral radiographs have been evaluated under anesthesia that a fulltreatment plan and the costs of a dental procedure can be accuratelydetermined. As soon as the anesthetized oral exam and full-mouthintraoral radiographs have been reviewed, the ndings and treatment plan can be discussed with the client. The consent form must clearlystate that if the owner cannot be contacted, any ndings requiring additional treatment that are not already speci cally on the consent will not be performed, and a separate appointment and procedurewill be scheduled. Advise the owner beforehand that if more extensivedisease is found, staging procedures may be recommended. ClientsDental Guidelines JAAHA.ORG 17may feel guilty for not knowing that their pet was in pain or had an oral infection. It is important to let them know that these problemsoften develop gradually and can be avoided in the future withproactive oral healthcare. In some cases, even if an individual tooth or teeth can be saved, this may not be the best choice for an owner who is not committed tofollow-up care or who has limited resources. When presenting optionsfor treatment, make sure the client clearly understands all treatmentoptions available, including risks, bene ts, and costs, and provide the information needed to make an informed decision.

Explaining the Role of Nutrition in Dental Health The phrase \"food be thy medicine \"can apply to preventive dental healthcare. Commercial diets speci cally designed to retard the accumulation of plaque and calculus are especially helpful if theowner is unable or unwilling to brush a pet 's teeth. These preventive diets work by mechanical (abrasion) and/or nonmechanical(chemical) mechanisms. The \"kibble \"can be larger in size or have a unique texture that mechanically cleans the surface of the tooth orcoats it in an \"anticalculus \"agent. 84 Although many products make this claim, only those that have been accepted by the VOHC have met preset standards of doing so.The VOHC helps veterinarians and owners choose effective productsto help decrease the accumulation of plaque and/or calculus. AAHAsupports the scienti c methodology employed by the VOHC. The VOHC website (vohc.org) can be a useful resource for guiding cli-ents and the veterinary care team to help understand product labelclaims. When appropriate, many clinicians encourage pet owners to select complete and balanced \"dental \"diets as the lifelong source of nutrition for the pet. As with any recommendation, practitionersshould evaluate compliance and ef cacy for the individual patient during subsequent examinations.TABLE 3 Materials Needed for the Practice of Veterinary Dentistry* Necessary materials Antiseptic rinseProphy paste in individual single use tubs (ne grit) Prophy angle and cups Hemostatic agentsNeedles and to prevent hypothermia: conductive blanket, forced-air warming blanket, circulating water blanket, towels, blankets, IV fluid warmer, d ental water reservoir warmer Gauze spongesAntimicrobial agents for local applicationResorbable suture material sized appropriately for smaller)Bone augmentation/guided tissue regeneration materialLocal anesthetic drugs and delivery system Necessary equipment A dental machine with tubing and attachments for low and high-speed handpieces, mechanical scaler, suction and pressurized air/water delivery syst em Dental radiograph generator (wall, ceiling mount or floor model)SuctionHigh- and low-speed hand pieces (two of each)Pressurized air water delivery systemAutoclave or gas sterilization system Various sizes of high-speed and low-speed burs (round/cross cut taper/nishing burs) Power scaler tips for gross and subgingival scaling (ultrasonic, subsonic, piezoelectric)Head or eye loupes for magnication * Disposable items are for single use only. 18 JAAHA | 55:2 Mar/Apr 2019Offering supplemental treats to pets can be an important part of the human -animal bond. However, choosing treats that support oral health is also helpful. There is a broad array of treats that have beenaccepted by the VOHC to decrease plaque and calculus accumulation.The Guidelines Task Force believes that there is not a strong rationalefor offering hard treats (antlers, synthetic, or natural bones) thatcould damage the structural integrity of the tooth, ultimately leadingto unnecessary pain and infection for the pet. See aaha.org/dentistryfor additional resources on appropriate treat selection. Discussion at the Discharge Appointment Written and verbal client communication is fundamental to themaintenance of pet oral health. This dialog should address allprocedures and potential complications, immediate postoperativehome oral care (e.g., no brushing until surgically manipulated gingivahas healed), medications and their side effects, and any diet changesthat might be necessary (e.g., soft or premoistened food in theimmediate postoperative period). If clients are not properly advisedof normal postanesthesia behavior and postoperative side effects affecting a pet, they may be reluctant to allow another procedure. Sharing the patient 's dental chart, photographs, and radiographs with the client at the discharge appointment is helpful in illustrating theextent of the pre-existing pathology and effects of treatment. Clientsbetter appreciate inapparent oral pathology once they see the visualevidence of its effects and the bene ts or therapeutic intervention. See aaha.org/dentistry for additional client education resources. Establish an appointment for a follow-up or recheck exami- nation in 10 -14 days, even if the procedure performed is limited to a prophylactic cleaning. Rechecks will help determine ownercompliance and the need for continued care. At the dischargeappointment, clients are generally more focused on postanesthesiacare than on continued oral hygiene. The recheck is an opportu-nity to af rm the positive steps that the owner has already taken in caring for the pet 's oral health and to establish an ongoing treat- ment plan. Summary Not only is oral health a fundamental aspect of overall pet health andwellbeing, but veterinary dentistry is now considered a standardcomponent of companion animal medicine. Any full-service, primarycare companion animal practice should have the capability to performbasic canine and feline dental examinations and procedures, includingthose performed under general anesthesia. This capability assumes thatthe veterinarian and other clinical staff have the expertise and essentialresources necessary to perform veterinary dentistry. These includefacilities, materials, and equipment, including barrier protection,specic for veterinary dentistry. It is important that the practice teamroutinely apply the nomenclature and terminology speci cally asso- ciated with veterinary dentistry. This is done not only to ensureprecision in performing dental procedures but also to educate clientsabout the unique aspects of oral healthcare. Lifetime oral health assumes that individualized periodontal disease prevention and treatment plans will be implemented.Avoiding and managing the in flammation, pain, and potential for systemic infection associated with periodontal disease are strongcontributors to the pet 's quality of life and longevity. Evaluation and documentation of dentition and oral pathology involves oral evaluation of both the conscious and anesthetizedpatient. Initial evaluation of the conscious patient can be facilitatedby pharmacologic protocols to reduce the patient 's stress and anxiety. A comprehensive oral health assessmen t involving radiography requires general anesthesia. It is important to recognize that many grosslynormal teeth in dogs and cats have clinically important pathology orabnormalities that can be detected only by intraoral radiography per- formed under general anesthesia . Because dental procedures can be painful, intra- and postoperative pain management, often using mul- timodal protocols, is an essential component of veterinary dentistry. The guidelines describe a step-by-step process for the procedures that are typically performed for canine and feline dental patients. Theseinclude oral examination, radiography , tooth scaling, periodontal disease staging, plaque and calculus removal and mitigation, general anesthesia,and instructing pet owners on home oral hygiene. Although some ofthese procedures are often performed in a referral setting, they are allwithin the capabilities of properly trained and equipped primary carepractices. Additional resources can be found at aaha.org/dentistry. Oral healthcare is a necessary aspect of lifetime pet wellness. However, because veterinary dentistry involves general anesthesia, many clients arehesitant to consider dental procedures for their pet. For this reason, clienteducation plays a pivotal role in success fully integrating veterinary dentistry into your practice 's service offerings and incorporating dental care into a lifetime healthcare plan for canine and feline patients.
