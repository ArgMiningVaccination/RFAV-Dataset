Ancestral lineage healing is a spiritually-grounded, ritual process that empowers you to connect, repair and nurture relationships with your own wise and loving ancestors. Many of us are lost, disconnected and hungry for a sense of belonging after generations of displacement, oppression, colonialism and the rippling, ongoing consequences of cultural wounding. We carry these burdens within our families and our bodies - but we carry the blessings, as well. The lineage repair process opens a pathway to your roots to fuel the transformation of inherited burdens and the full embodiment of your gifts. This approach is an effective, securely held form of ritual work (unlike conventional therapy) which assists you to directly access the supportive guidance of your own ancestors of blood. The process is experiential and combines ritual, guided trance, dreamwork and offering practices. There are no prerequisites, however, prior experience with inner work and relation with spirit guides are both helpful. I am accepting new clients for one-on-one phone and Zoom sessions and can support small ongoing study groups by arrangement. I have trained extensively in this modality as developed by [Dr. Daniel Foor](https://ancestralmedicine.org/) of Ancestral Medicine and am an experienced, certified practitioner of this work.

Community Ancestor Circles Facilitated Community Ritual via Zoom 3rd Thursday of each month 7:00pm-9:00pm Pacific Registration is open now! RSVP is required to receive link [Pay what you can/by donation](https://paypal.me/rootwisdom) Monthly Ancestor Circles aim to provide ongoing support for folks continuing the ancestral lineage healing process through facilitated community ritual. During these rituals we work directly and safely with elevated ancestral guides to assist and support the troubled dead who may be having a significant influence in our lives. Each 2-hour circle includes direct visioning/journeywork, forgiveness practices, song, movement, prayer, heart-centered group dialogue, altar-making and other inclusive types of ritual. Please note, there are prerequisites for joining and space is limited to 15 participants. For more information, visit our [Meetup Group](https://www.meetup.com/Ancestral-Healing-Community-Bay-Area) or [contact me directly](mailto:kirra@rootwisdom.com). WHO ARE THE ANCESTORS? The ancestors are the mighty dead, the bright ones who came before us, whose spirits are intact, vibrant and fully woven into the long currents of energy that reach back, through blood and bone, to our common origin. You are linked to your ancestors, consciously or not, and these ties can have significant impact your life and your family members, for better or worse. The ancestors are your very own elders. As the living face of your people, you can choose to build a mutually supportive, positive relationship with your own ancestral guides. For most of our history, humans have maintained vibrant relationships with our ancestors. It is possible to restore this vitality, tap into the wellspring of ancestral support and consciously embody the strengths and blessings of your unique, diverse bloodlines. WHAT ARE some BENEFITS OF ANCESTRAL HEALING? Imagine walking through life with your ancestors by your side, owning your strength, following your true path and feeling resourced, resilient and whole. This is what ancestral healing has done for me. This transformative work can help untangle deep-seeded negative family patterns and empower you to shine your light into the world. You can rely on the wisdom of your elevated ancestors for grounding in your waking life and call upon their guidance while navigating non-ordinary states of consciousness and integrating major life changes. With access to this source of profound wellness, you may resolve long-standing family struggles or become inspired to engage in social and environmental healing on a new level. Plant medicine practitioners, community leaders, dreamers and healers will learn new skills to deepen and support their work. IS THIS WORK RIGHT FOR you? Do you feel ready to dive into this work? If you have questions, please schedule a complimentary [20min consultation](/schedule) with me. There are no prerequisites, however, prior experience with inner work and relating with spirit guides/allies are both helpful. WORK WITH ME I am an ecologist as well as a ritualist and specialize in integrating earth reverence and direct connection with wild nature in my practice. I work with people of all genders and backgrounds and my own ancestors hail from the British and Irish Isles, the Ligurian Apennine Mountains of Italy, Sicily and the Caucusus Mountains and Armenian Highlands in the [SWANA](https://rootwisdom.com/swana-ancestral-hub) region. I have a special affinity for folx who seek to bridge the gap between scientific and intuitive ways of knowing (such as dreamwork and relating with plant teachers/plantcestors). I speak English and Spanish and can support clients in either language. Learn more about my background [here](/kirra). I am trained in the model of ancestor work developed by Dr. Daniel Foor and have [received his backing](https://ancestralmedicine.org/practitioner-directory/) to practice. This approach to ancestral work emphasizes the need for repairing our ancestral legacies, prioritizes ritual safety and is inclusive of all genders and diverse ancestries, whether known or unknown. I am committed to keeping this work accessible and I offer reduced rates, as needed, to people of African and/or recent Indigenous ancestry, LGBTQIA++, veterans and low income folx. Please [contact me directly](mailto:kirra@rootwisdom.com) to discuss reduced cost options. MELANIE S. -ATLANTA, GA Kirra is bold and open and unafraid, which creates space for people to be brave about the work they are doing. CARMEN W. -DECATUR, GA I would most definitely recommend this intensive work to anyone and everyone I know. I find it to be one of the main answers to healing ourselves, our communities and the world as a whole because it addresses the root of most of our problems.
