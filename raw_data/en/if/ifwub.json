First-year students are required to attend Orientation Part Two. wayne.edu/orientation/twoAUGUST 28-29, 2017 Watch your WSU email for further details this summer! ACADEMICS Don't procrastinate. Prioritize and put your most important work first. Time management is extremely important in college \u2014 you have to plan your day by the hour to make sure that you are using your time wisely.\" See page 58 for more advice from current students and alumniKRYSTAL ROBINSON Marketing Detroit Class of 2017 WARRIOR WISDOMWORDS of\"ACADEMICS | 5 Academica: An internet gateway that provides single sign-on and secure access to WSU computer systems (such as WSU email and calendars, Blackboard and OneCard) as well as university, library and computing resources, and financial aid. Academic advisor: Professional staff or faculty members who help students determine their requirements for graduation, select appropriate courses and connect to campus resources. Academic plan: A semester-by-semester, four-year plan of the courses a student needs to successfully complete their degree. Because some classes must be taken in a particular order, this outline keeps students on track and takes the un-certainty out of registration. Meet with an academic advisor to create an academic plan in Degree Works that is specific to your program, and see the Forms section in the back of this guide for an example. Blackboard: This online resource connects you to your professors and classmates. You'll find your syllabus, textbook requirements and homework assignments here. Log on to blackboard.wayne.edu with your AccessID and password, then scroll to the bottom of the page to take a free, self-paced online tutorial. See page 14 for more information. Bulletin: Intended to provide academic information and course descriptions, it specifies the requirements that must be met and the courses that must be taken to complete each degree: bulletins.wayne.edu. Corequisite (coreq): A course that is paired with another course and must be taken the same semester (such as a lec- ture/lab combination). Declaring or changing your major: Students in the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences can use the \"Declare/Change Major\" link in Academica under Student Resources. Follow the prompts, use the pull-down menu to select your major and click Done when finished. For students interested in declaring or changing their major in Education; Business; Engineering; or Fine, Performing and Communication Arts, please see an advisor in the department in which your de- sired major is located. General education requirements: Classes in addition to ma- jor professional courses that are needed to ensure fundamen-tal skills and a well-rounded education. Some majors require choosing from a preselected list to fulfill these requirements. Learning Community: A team of students \u2014 led by an up- perclassman peer mentor and faculty member \u2014 who work together toward course or program goals, supporting each other in study groups and other activities outside the class- room. There is no additional charge beyond standard tuition. See page 16 and lc.wayne.edu for details. Prerequisite (prereq): A course or qualifying exam that is required before enrolling in a desired class. Who is my advisor? Students can make an appointment through Advising Works by visiting advisingworks.wayne.edu. College of Liberal Arts and Sciences: Students who enter the university with a declared CLAS major will meet with an academic advisor for their specific major. You can find your advisor online at clas.wayne.edu/advisor. Pre-Medicine and Health Science Center: Provides prerequisite advising, academic support and professional development strategies for students interested in pre-med, pre-dental, pre-nursing, and pre-pharmacy and health sciences professional programs. Visit wayne.edu/advising/pre-health to schedule an appointment with an academic advisor at 1600 David Adamany Undergraduate Library. See facebook.com/WSUPreHealth or call 313-577-2680 for more information. CLAS Exploratory Tracks: Undergraduate students who are not ready to choose a major upon admission may select an Exploratory Track that best fits their interests. Academic advisors work with these students in a purposeful and programmatic way to help them explore the majors that WSU has to offer while making progress in general education and college requirements (limited to 30 credit hours, upon which time a major must be declared). You will meet with your academic advisor at 1600 David Adamany Undergraduate Library. See advising.wayne.edu or call 313-577-2680 for more information. Each department in the College of Fine, Performing and Communication Arts has its own academic advisors. Students should go to cfpca.wayne.edu to find the right academic advisor for their major. Students pursuing a degree in the College of Engineering should contact the advisor for their specific program. Visit engineering.wayne.edu and click on Current Students for a list of academic advisors and faculty members. College of Education academic advisors have open advising appointments every Tuesday (excluding holidays) from 9 a.m.-4 p.m. in Education Building Room 489, or you can call Student Services (313-577-1601) to make an appointment. Visit coe.wayne.edu. Students majoring in accounting, finance, global supply chain management, information systems management, management or marketing receive advising from the Mike Ilitch School of Business. Walk-in advising is held every Tuesday (excluding holidays) from 9 a.m.-6 p.m. in Prentis Building Room 200.

Know what we mean Common academic advising terms6 | Green & Gold GuideMarks An I (Incomplete) is given to an undergraduate student when they have not completed all of the coursework as planned for the term and when there is, in the judgment of the instructor, a reasonable probability that the student will complete the course successfully without again attend-ing regular class sessions. The student should be passing at the time the grade of I is given. A written contract specifying the work to be com- pleted should be signed by the student and instructor. Responsibility for completing all coursework rests with the student. The I will be changed to a letter grade when the student completes the coursework as arranged with the instructor or, if the instructor has left the university, with the chairperson of the department or other instruc- tional unit. Work must be completed within one calendar year. There are no extensions. An I will not be awarded if, in the instructor's judgment, it is necessary for the student to attend subsequent sessions of the class. If regular attendance is necessary to complete coursework, the student must register for the class for the semester in which attendance is planned. The student will be assessed tuition and applicable fees for the second registration. If the student decides to register for the course subsequent to the assignment of an I, then the mark of I for the original election will be changed to a WP (Withdrawal/Passing) and the student will be responsible for tuition and applicable fees for the second registra-tion. Students are responsible for notifying the department offering the course that they have reregistered for the course so that the I is not changed to an F (Failure). Any unchanged I will, within one calendar year from the time it was received, be changed to an F. WF (Official W ithdrawal Failing) is given when the student withdraws from the course in accordance with the university policy and the student had earned a failing grade as of the date the withdrawal is approved. WN (W ithdrawal Non-Attendance) is given to students who did not attend any classes and/or had no graded work by the withdrawal date. WP (Official Withdrawal Passing) is given when the student drops the course in accordance with the university policy and the student had earned a passing grade as of the date the withdrawal is approved. Y (Deferred) is given when the student is up to date with the w ork of a course planned to continue beyond the semester (i.e., essay, thesis, dissertation and certain courses taken in sequence). Z (Audit) is given when the student has formally registered fo r the course for audit. The student's academic dean or designee must provide written audit authorization to the student at the time of registration.

P, N, S, U, M, ANC, BNC, CNC, PNC, NNC, SNC and MNC grades are not reflected in the grade point average. Undergraduate courses completed with a P may count toward a degree. S, M or U performance in non-degree courses and certain designated courses such as fieldwork, practicums and internships do not affect grade point averages.ACADEMICS | 7Academic misconduct Academic misconduct is any activity that tends to compromise the academic integrity of the institution or undermine the education process. Examples of academic misconduct include: Plagiarism: To take and use another's words or ideas as your own without appropriate referencing or citation. Cheating: Intentionally using or attempting to use or intentionally providing unauthorized materials, information or assistance in any academic exercise. This includes copying from another student's test paper, allowing another student to copy from your test, using unauthorized material during an exam and submitting a term paper for a current class that has been submitted in a past class without appropriate permission. Fabrication: Intentional or unauthorized falsification or invention of any information or citation, such as knowingly attributing citations to the wrong source or listing a fake reference in the paper or bibliography. Other: Selling, buying or stealing all or part of a test or term paper, unauthorized use of resources, enlisting in the assistance of a substitute when taking exams, destroying another's work, threatening or exploiting students or instructors, or any other violation of course rules as contained in the course syllabus or other written information. Sanctions if a student is found responsible for academic misconduct: Disciplinary reprimand: A formal notification to the student that their conduct has been unacceptable and a warning that another offense may result in a more serious sanction. Disciplinary probation: A disciplinary status that does not interfere with the student's rights to enroll and attend classes but that includes specified requirements or restrictions. Suspension: A denial of privilege to continue as a student anywhere in the university and denial of all student rights and privileges for a specified period of time. Expulsion: A permanent denial of the privilege of continuing or enrolling as a student anywhere within the university and permanent denial of all student rights and privileges. Transcript disciplinary record: An entry onto the student's transcript permanently or for a specified period of time, indicating the violation and sanction imposed. Other sanctions: Other sanctions may be imposed instead of or in addition to those specified above. Grade point average The grade point average is the numerical index of your scholastic average. Points are assigned to each letter grade for each hour of credit. For example, a grade of A in a class carrying three credits would be assigned 12 honor points (3x4) and a grade of a C in a class carrying 4 credits would be assigned eight honor points (4x2). To compute your grade point average, multiply the honor points assigned to each grade by the number of credits for each course; then add the results and divide by the total number of credits. In the example below, the grade point average would be 20 (honor points) divided by 7 (credits attempted) = 2.85, nominally a B- average. Course Grade Honor Credits T otal points HIS 1040 A 4 x 3 = 12 BIO 1010 C 2 x 4 = 8 (8 + 12 = 20) \u00f7 (3 + 4 = 7) GPA = 2.85 You also can use the GPA calculator at reg.wayne.edu/students/gpa.php. Student Code of Conduct The primary purpose of the Student Code of Conduct is to promote campus civility and academic integrity and to provide the framework for the imposition of disci - pline in the university setting. The code gives general notice of prohibited conduct and of the sanctions to be imposed if such conduct occurs. The code specifies the rights of the student and the rights of other parties to the procedure. The code is designed to ensure that students who are alleged to have engaged in unacceptable behavior receive fair and impartial consideration. It is important that each of us become familiar with the Student Code of Conduct and share the responsibility for main - taining a reputable university committed to academic excellence. For more information and to read the Student Code of Conduct, visit the Dean of Students Office website at doso.wayne.edu. Welcome, Warrior!

See page 34 for details. 11Selecting classes for registration It is important to meet with your academic advisor to carefully go over your options before the priority registration period each semester. Among the things to consider when choosing your courses: How early you need to leave home. If you are commuting, figure out how long it will take to drive to campus, find a parking spot and walk to your classroom. Keep in mind that depending on where you are coming from and at what time, you could be facing rush hour traffic. And don't forget that bad weather can slow you down. Are you an early bird or night owl? Think about when you learn best and look for classes that meet around those times. Give yourself room to breathe. Be sure to leave time to get from one class to the next as well as time to have lunch or review your notes. If every day is hectic, you could burn out quickly. Do you meet the requirements? Check to make sure you don't need a prerequisite before taking the class \u2014 you may not be able to register for it, or you may get to class and find yourself already behind on the first day. Have a backup plan. When deciding which classes to take, have a few backups mapped out in case something fills before you can claim your seat. Consider other time commitments. Think about family and work obligations to avoid conflicts that would mean missed classes or coursework. How many credits should you take? Generally, most students take 12-16 credits. The minimum to be a full-time student is 12, but we recommend 15 to keep pace with your degree program. When deciding what's right for you, keep in mind that for every one hour in class, you should plan to spend at least two hours outside of class doing homework and studying. 12 credits = 12 hours in class + 24 hours studying 36 hours/week as a full-time student 16 credits = 16 hours in class + 32 hours studying 48 hours/week as a full-time student Remember, you need a minimum of 120 credits to graduate, but there are only 168 hours in each week \u2014 and some of those should be spent sleeping! ACADEMICS | 11 Class Schedule: Use classschedule.wayne.edu for registration and to research classes, compose wish lists and get help. Closed class: During registration, when a class is available, it will have an open status. When a class is full or otherwise not available for registration, it will have a closed status. To inquire about entering a closed class, contact the department offering that class. CRN (Course Reference Number): A unique number assigned to each class at the university. You will use this when registering for your classes. Degree Works: A self-service tool within Academica that allows you to evaluate your progress toward completion of your degree program. Working with your academic advisor, you can build an academic plan to guide you toward graduation. Visit wayne.edu/degreeworks. Dropping: Students must drop classes in Academica. For classes that run the full length of the term, drops in the first and second week will receive full tuition cancellation. Courses dropped in the third and fourth week will not receive tuition cancellation, but will not appear on the academic record. For courses running less than a full term, consult the Class Schedule for drop dates. There may be financial aid and academic consequences at this point. Visit reg.wayne.edu. SMART Check: In order to prevent students from making quick decisions that could negatively affect their financial aid and graduation plans, Wayne State requires that anyone wishing to withdraw must first complete a SMART Check, which helps students review why they might want to drop, and outlines the financial and academic consequences \u2014 as well as alternatives such as tutoring. This mandatory pre-withdrawal process may be completed online or on a walk-in basis in the Welcome Center. Supplemental Instruction (SI): A free series of group study lessons led by undergraduates who have successfully completed that course. Find details at success.wayne.edu. Wish list: A feature in Class Schedule that allows you to find classes and save their names for quick reference during registration, like a shopping cart. You must complete your registration by logging into Academica after you create your wish list. Withdrawing: For courses running the full term, beginning with the fifth week of class, students are no longer allowed to drop but must withdraw from class. Select the \"Withdraw from a Class\" option in the Academica Student Resources menu. There may be financial aid and academic consequences at this point. For details, visit reg.wayne.edu.Know what we mean Common registration terms12 | Green & Gold GuideIf you are still deciding on your major or program, focus on your general education and elective courses.

But just how you use this help - ful online resource varies depending on the course and the instructor. Blackboard allows you to keep up to date with coursework, stay on top of your grades, collaborate with other classmates and much more. If you register for an online class, it will be conducted almost entirely through Blackboard. Regardless of the type of class, you're able to submit assignments, participate in discussion board forums on various course-related top-ics, and download required lectures and readings \u2014 all depending on how your instructor chooses to use the site. You can even create and manage your own blog. Familiarize yourself with this tool by logging on to blackboard.wayne.edu and choosing one of two training options:1. Enroll in the free, self-paced online course, Blackboard Basics for Students. 2. Refer to the Blackboard Guide for Students with quick questions about specific sections and tools. General ed classes: Do the write thing While Wayne State students develop a great depth of knowl - edge in their chosen fields of study, the general education program ensures they are exposed to a broad range of topics providing a variety of ideas and approaches. It is through general education classes that students improve their skills and are introduced to methods of inquiry, modes of thought, bodies of knowledge, and representative ideas drawn from many academic disciplines. What's more, general education helps students connect what they learn in the classroom to real-world experiences. Why should you take writing courses early in your college career? Learning to write at the college level is an essential part of succeeding at WSU. Research shows that students who pass freshman composition are far more likely to continue into their sophomore year. Related research shows that students who do continue from freshman to sophomore year are very likely to complete their college education and graduate. General education writing courses are important because they prepare you to succeed in later courses. You'll write in many of your courses and writing varies across professions and communities. Writing in biology is quite different from writing in psychology, and both are different from writing in philosophy, business or law. To prepare students for writing competency in different courses, careers and situations, WSU has three general education writing requirements: Basic Composition (BC), Intermediate Composition (IC) and Writing Intensive (WI) in the majors. Most students fulfill these requirements by tak - ing a sequence of three or four of the following courses: Basic Writing - ENG 1010 , a developmental course that prepares students to succeed in freshman writing and other courses Introductory College Writing - ENG 1020 , WSU's freshman composition course Intermediate Writing - ENG 3010 , which prepares students to take required WI courses in their major Major-specific WI course These courses work in sequence, each building on the last. ENG 1010 explains fundamental reading and writing concepts in depth and examines how these concepts are used in other writers' work. ENG 1020 guides students in using the concepts in their own writing for audiences in and outside the university. In ENG 3010, students learn how the concepts operate in writing within specific disciplines and professions to prepare them for WI courses and beyond. You can make important progress toward succeeding at WSU by taking and passing ENG 1010 or 1020 during your freshman year and ENG 3010 in your sophomore or junior year. Talk to your academic advisor with questions about your specific plan. ACADEMICS | 15 16 | Green & Gold GuideAchieve success through Learning Communities By participating in Wayne State Learning Communities (LC), students, faculty and peer mentors learn together, leading to the discovery of themselves and the world around them. Students take advantage of a small college learning environment with the resources of a major research university. The community provides academic support and social activities related to a specific course or major. Wayne State's LCs are linked to specific courses that range from business to the arts to education to the sciences. With nearly 10,000 students already participating in an LC, you have a tremendous network of support to guide you through your academic career. Students and faculty members engage in group discussions and experiences centered on course material or subject matter. In your LC, you'll: Share new experiences with people who have similar interest s Engage with faculty and student mentors Explore your academic and career interests Enhance your learning skills Within each LC, small groups of students with similar interests work closely together to study, problem-solve and socialize. Our research shows that, on average, first-year students who engage in Wayne State LCs achieve a 10 percent increase in their grades over those who choose not to participate. Visit lc.wayne.edu to review the full list of more than 40 communities. Then contact the LC coordinator for the community that interests you. That person will have the specific information to get you started. Call us at 313-577-2254 or write to learningcommunities@wayne.edu with questions. Sample LCs Mike Ilitch School of Business Warriors Business Living LC First-year business students have a unique opportunity to live on the same floor as other business peers. Current business students are peer mentors and serve as resident advisors on the floor. Students will attend study groups, networking events, academic and professional workshops, and engage in BA 2020 - the introductory business course.

ACADEMICS | 17Study Abroad and Global Programs Students who want to take their studies on the road and earn credit at the same time can do so through a variety of programs facilitated by the Study Abroad and Global Programs office. International study opportunities can fulfill language and foreign culture requirements, and students older than 18 can participate in most programs at any point in college, including during freshman year. Programs run from two weeks to a semester, and some last an entire academic year. Sharpen your language skills while staying in a 13th century monastery in Italy or at the Lebanese American University in Beirut, or follow the Magical Mystery Tour through London and Liverpool during spring break. Some programs focus on majors such as engineering or business, and various faculty members lead programs related to their academic discipline so students have the benefit of traveling with an expert as well as classmates. Costs vary by program. Some types of federal student aid such as Pell Grants and Stafford loans, as well as private grants and scholarships can be used to cover Study Abroad costs, as long as the program is for credit. By planning ahead, students will find that Study Abroad can be a realistic option during their academic career. In an increasingly global economy, Study Abroad experience makes a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 stand out to potential employers. International coursework is great preparation for graduate school, so grab your passport and get ready!

A good academic plan includes calculating how much financial aid may be available to you. Federal aid and many WSU scholarships and grants have an- nual and lifetime limits. Federal Pell Grant limits: If you are receiving the Federal Pell Grant, keep in mind that it is limited to 12 semesters of awards for full-time enrollment. Federal loan limits: If you decide to borrow student loans to help pay for your degree, remember that loans have annual and lifetime limits. Once you reach these limits, you will no longer be able to borrow. There also is a maximum period to receive Federal Direct Subsidized Loans. In general, you may not receive subsidized loans for more than 150 percent of the published length of your program. If you lose eligibility for subsidized loans, the federal interest subsidy on the loans end and you become responsible for paying the interest. Detailed information is available on the Federal Student Aid website: studentloans.gov/myDirectLoan/directSubsidizedLoanTimeLimitation. action. If you want to take advantage of the reduced summer tuition rate and want to use loan funds to pay these costs, don't borrow your maximum loans in the fall and winter.

Make the interest payments on your student loans while enrolled. Otherwise, the interest will be added to your principal balance at repayment and you will be paying interest on top of interest. Avoid costly credit cards. NOTE TO PARENTS For some students, college can be more expensive than it needs to be. Helping your student with money-management skills will be useful throughout life.

The FAFSA information is used by the U.S. Department of Education to determine financial need for federal financial aid. You must complete the FAFSA every year (available beginning October 1) using the WSU school code 002329. For details and to apply, visit fafsa.gov. Financial responsibility: An agreement electronically signed by all students prior to registering for classes each semester. Student accepts full responsibility for paying tuition and fees, and any costs associated with collecting them. Grants: Generally awarded based on financial need and require no repayment. Refund: Your financial aid will be credited to your tuition account to pay for your tuition, fees and any residential housing charges. When these charges are paid, any remain- ing aid will be refunded to you by direct deposit into an existing checking or savings account or by paper check mailed to your address on file with WSU. The amount refunded is for you to use for your books, housing, food, transportation and other miscellaneous costs directly re-lated to your WSU education. Satisfactory Academic Progress: To remain eligible for financial aid, you are required to maintain Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP) each semester. At the end of each semester, the financial aid office will check your academic progress according to three standards: GPA - As an undergraduate, you must maintain a minimum 2.0 GPA. Pace (completion percentage) - You must complete at least 67 percent of your registered courses with passing grades. Time frame - You must not exceed your program credit hours by more than 150 percent. If you do not meet any one of the three SAP components, you will be placed in \"warning\" status for one semester, during which you must regain Satisfactory Academic Prog- ress. If you do not achieve academic progress at the end of the warning semester, you will be denied financial aid in the subsequent semester.Scholarships: Gift aid that is awarded on multiple factors, including academic achievement, special talent, ability or financial need. No repayment is required. For a complete list, visit wayne.edu/scholarships. For scholarship oppor - tunities external to the university, subscribe to the Scholar - ships stream in Academica. Student service fee: Assessed to all students, it's used primarily to maintain, upgrade and replace student comput- ing and technology resources on campus. A small portion is also used to fund student activities on campus, and to enhance programs directed toward improving on-campus activities, including athletics. Subsidized loans: Federal direct subsidized loans are for undergraduate students with financial need. The amount you can borrow depends on your financial need (see FAFSA definition), grade level and dependency status. You are not charged interest while you're in school at least half-time and during grace periods and deferment periods. Title IV authorization: Some fees and/or charges that can be assessed on your student account are not automatically paid with federal financial aid (Title IV aid). These fees and charges include a matriculation fee, book vouchers and late registration fees. Students can authorize payment of these fees in the current semester or up to $200 of a prior year balance by signing a Title IV authorization form. If a Title IV authorization is not on file, you will be respon- sible for paying these fees out of pocket. You can submit the form at wayne.edu/financial-aid/receiving/titleiv . Unsubsidized loans: Financial need is not a criterion for a Federal Direct Unsubsidized Loan. However, a borrower must receive the maximum amount for which he/she is eligible in a Federal Direct Subsidized Loan before receiv- ing an unsubsidized loan. Because financial need, demon-strated via the FAFSA, is a criterion for the subsidized loan, the FAFSA also is necessary to borrow a Federal Direct Unsubsidized Loan. Verification: The process by which the accuracy of the in- formation provided on the FAFSA is confirmed. You may be asked to provide documentation such as a tax transcript. Verification status and document requirements can be viewed in Academica. Work-study: A form of need-based federal financial aid. Work-study provides students with part-time employment opportunities in a variety of on- and off-campus jobs.Know what we mean Common financial aid termsFINANCES | 27Crossing the finish line Having a good graduation plan includes calculating how much financial aid may be available to you. Federal Pell Grant If you are receiving the Federal Pell Grant, keep in mind that it is limited to 12 semesters of awards for full-time enrollment. Loan borrowing If you decide to borrow federal student loans to help pay for your bachelor's degree, subsidized loans also are limited to 12 semesters of full-time enrollment. Satisfactory Academic Progress The Satisfactory Academic Progress standards include a minimum GPA, pace (completion percentage) and 150 percent time frame. The time constraint limits the number of courses you can take in your degree program and still receive financial aid. Dropping courses will affect your pace and may affect your GPA. WSU merit scholarships WSU merit scholarships will be awarded for four consecutive years to new freshmen and two consecutive years to new transfer students. Merit awards include the President's, Warrior, Gold, Green and Detroit Leadership. Academic plan A good academic plan can help you stay on track. Work with your academic advisor to develop your plan and stop in at the Academic Success Center for some valuable tips. If your degree requires 120 credits, you will need to enroll in 15 credits each semester to graduate in four years. Money plan Avoid over-borrowing by creating and following a personal spending plan (budget). See resources at cashcourse.org. How your enrollment affects your aid You must enroll full-time to be eligible for the maximum award amounts. If your enrollment is less-than-full-time, the amount of aid disbursed may depending on your EFC Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant100% 0 0 0 WSU Promise or Access Grant100% 0 0 0 You must enroll at least half-time to receive most types of financial aid, including federal loans. If you drop all courses, you may be required to repay a portion of your financial aid.28 | Green & Gold GuideConsequences of withdrawing from all classes Withdrawing from all classes during a semester may affect your ability to meet the Satisfactory Academic Progress standards. You also may be required to repay a portion of your financial aid. WSU is required to calculate a return of Title IV funds and refund amount if you receive aid and withdraw or do not attend classes during a semester. WSU will determine the amount of aid (if any) you are entitled to keep. Funds may be returned to the university, state, federal programs or your lender. You must repay your loans even if you do not complete your program. If you do not make loan payments, you will be ineligible for future aid. Consequences of attending less-than-half-time If you attend less-than-half-time, you will not be eligible for federal loan funds. The grace period of your subsidized loans will begin. You will be responsible for loan payment at the end of any grace period. Contact your loan servicer to make payment arrangements or request a loan deferment or forbearance.Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP) Your SAP status is reviewed each semester. You will lose financial aid eligibility if you do not maintain SAP standards. If you lose your financial aid eligibility, you may appeal if you have a reasonable plan to meet the standards within a set time frame. See wayne.edu/ financial-aid for SAP appeal process details. You are strongly encouraged and advised to see an academic advisor each semester to ensure you are selecting appropriate courses and progressing through your program of study. Satisfactory Academic Progress standards Academic progress is measured at the end of each semester against the following standards: Cumulative minimum grade point average (GPA) : 2.0 for undergraduate programs. Completion percentage (pace): At least 67 percent of all credit hours attempted must have successfully passing grades. The pace of progress is calculated by dividing cumulative hours you have successfully completed by the cumulative hours you have attempted. Maximum time frame: Undergraduate and graduate students must complete a degree or certificate program in no more than 150 percent of the average published length of the program in credit hours. The SAP policy is online at wayne.edu/financial-aid/receiving/sap. Review your SAP status in Academica Click on My Satisfactory Academic Progress.

Repeat coursework policy If you repeat a course, credit hours for each registration will be added to your attempted credit hours total. However, only the most recent grade received in the course will be included in the calculation of your cumulative GPA. Federal financial aid will pay for only one repeat of a previously passed course. See wayne.edu/financial-aid for more information about repeated courses and their effect on your financial aid eligibility. Undergraduate enrollment status Full-time 12+ credits Three-quarter time 9-11 credits Half-time 6-8 credits Less-than-half-time 1-5 credits The census date policy The classes in which you are enrolled on the census date will determine the amount of grant funding you will receive. If you increase your enrollment level after the census date, your grants will not be increased. If you decrease your enrollment level after the census date, your grants will not be reduced. However, if you drop all courses, federal financial aid regulations require WSU to reduce your federal aid based on the percentage of the semes- ter that you have completed. The percentage is determined by dividing the number of weeks you were enrolled by the number of weeks in the semester. Awards that may be reduced or canceled: Federal Pell Grant Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant (FSEOG) WSU Promise Grant WSU Access A ward Enrollment requirements for Federal Direct Loans You must be registered at least half-time at the time WSU disburses your Federal Direct Loan funds. When reviewing your enrollment for loan purposes, federal financial aid regulations require WSU to review real-time enrollment. More information is available at wayne.edu/financial-aid/ receiving/retain. The consequences of withdrawing from classes may include cancellation of your financial aid and loss of future financial aid eligibility. Before you withdraw from courses, you will be required to acknowledge the academic and financial consequences by participating in the SMART Check process. Learn more at go.wayne.edu/smart. The census date policy only applies to students who attend class. Your aid may be reduced or canceled if your participation in class is not verified by your instructor. Reporting additional financial aid resources You are required to notify WSU of any additional financial resources you receive that are not listed in your award notification.

These resources may result in adjustments and/or reduction of the financial aid originally offered. Verification of your FAFSA Verification is a process to confirm the accuracy of the information you provided on the FAFSA. The U.S. Department of Education may select your FAFSA for verification of additional items at any time. Verification selection can be random or due to incomplete, estimated or inconsistent data reported on your FAFSA. If your application was selected for verification, WSU will ask you to provide additional information to document the accuracy of your FAFSA information, which may include a copy of your tax transcript. View your requirements in Academica. All requirements must be completed before any financial aid can be applied to your student tuition account. Your financial aid awards will not be available for payment until verification is completed.

To qualify, you must enroll full time for the fall and winter semesters, completing at least 24 credits with a minimum GPA of 2.5. For details, visit wayne.edu/tuition. FINANCES | 29 30 | Green & Gold GuideThe bottom line To determine your eligibility for aid, the financial aid office uses estimates of your costs of attending school. Since the costs are estimates, they may not reflect your actual expenses. Your actual costs will vary depending on your housing and the number of classes you take. We recommend you take at least 15 credits each semester. There are lifetime limits to the federal aid you can receive and most scholarships are limited to four years. You are not required to accept a student loan. If you choose to borrow, calculate how much you will need to cover your costs and borrow no more than that amount. Expenses you will need to consider in addition to tuition and fees include books and supplies, miscellaneous expenses, and transportation if you commute from home. Below are examples of estimated costs and rewards based on 2016-17 rates. If your financial aid is not enough to pay your student account bill, you are responsible for paying the remaining balance. Living on campus example Direct costs Fall bill W inter bill T otal charges Tuition and fees estimate for 15 credits $6,384 $6,134 $12,518 Housing and meal Total charges $11,059 $10,809 $21,868 \u2014 and scholarships WSU $1,250 $1,250 $2,500 Federal and scholarships $6,384 $6,134 $12,518 Needed to cover tuition and fees 0 0 0 Federal Student Loans (with loan fees deducted) Federal Direct Subsidized Loan Offer $1,731 $1,731 $3,462 Federal Direct Unsubsidized Loan Offer Total student loan funds $2,720 $2,720 to cover dorm, meal plan $1,955 $1,955 $3,910 Other options Federal Parent PLUS Loan $2,000 $2,000 $4,000 The Federal Pell Grant and Wayne Access grant are awarded based on the estimated family contribution (EFC) determined by your FAFSA information. The Wayne Access grant is available to eligible students with need who file the FAFSA early. The WSU Green Scholarship is a merit award offered to students based on admission credentials. The Federal Parent PLUS Loan is not included on your award letter. Parents of dependent undergraduates may apply for a Federal PLUS loan to assist with educational expenses. Unlike other federal loans, the Federal PLUS loan requires credit approval. Parents may apply online at studentloans.gov. Other options to assist with costs include a payment plan, military and national service benefits, and non-federal private education loans.Your costs will vary \u0007 The\u0007financial\u0007aid\u0007cost\u0007of\u0007 attendance \u0007figure\u0007is\u0007only\u0007an\u0007 estimate of expenses you will have in an academic year.

Check out the resources at cashcourse.org.FINANCES | 31Payment of aid and refunds Financial aid for an academic year is applied in two payments: half for the fall semester and the other half for the winter semester. Aid is paid to your student account no sooner than the week pri or to the official start of the semester. If you have excess aid, you will receive a refund to use for your ot her educational expenses. Financial aid refunds are released within 14 days of payment. Refu nds are generated weekly. Late financial aid applicants will receive funds after an award is offered and accepted, provided other award conditions are completed, such as entrance loan counseling and signing a loan Master Promissory Note. You have the right to cancel all or a portion of your student loans and may notify the financial aid office in writing within 14 days of payment. Include your full name, student number and signature. Your aid may be reduced or canceled if your course participation is not confirmed by your instructor. How you will receive your refund Review your options at wayne.edu/bursar/refunds. If you do not indicate a preference, a check will be mailed. Review your account on Academica to check for refunds. Other options to cover costs We encourage you to pursue all sources of assistance. Any external aid you receive will reduce the amount of loans you borrow and thereby reduce your loan indebtedness. For information about outside scholarships, visit wayne.edu/scholarships/external. Special circumstances We recognize that students may have extenuating circumstances that the FAFSA does not consider. If a significant change occurs in your financial situation (e.g., reduction in income, loss of employment, divorce/separation, death of a parent/spouse), you may submit a Special Circumstance Appeal and request a review of your financial aid eligibility. Please see a financial aid officer to discuss your circumstances and obtain an appeal form.

STUDENT SERVICES | 41Preventing and reporting sexual assault Wayne State is committed to maintaining a safe environment that supports the education and career advancement of its students. Every WSU student is strongly encouraged to participate in educa- tion focused on familiarizing themselves with ways to reduce the risk of being a victim of sexual harassment, sexual assault, domestic and relationship violence, or stalking. Key facts Most sexual assaults on college campus occur among people who know each other. Alcohol is the No. 1 date rape drug. About 75 percent of the men and at least 55 percent of the women involved in date rapes had been drinking or using drugs right before the attack. Alcohol and drugs cloud a person's thinking and alter their abil- ity to make sound decisions and assess risk. The fact that alcohol consumption may increase a person's likelihood of experiencing sexual assault does not make them responsible for the perpetrator's behavior. Consent cannot be given by a person who is unable to make a reasoned judgment because of intoxication, incapacity, uncon- sciousness or mental deficiency, or if the consent is the product of threat or coercion. Each one of us is responsible for making sure we have consent in every sexual situation. If you're not sure, ask! Where to report If you witness, become aware of, or are the victim of a sexual assault by another member of the university community, you should immediately call the WSUPD at 313-577-2222. They will offer immediate help and work to preserve any evidence and apprehend the offender, if desired. WSUPD will take police reports and conduct investigations of any assaultive crimes involving any student, staff or faculty member. You are not required to press charges when you report an incident, but documentation is important in case you change your mind about pressing charges later. For all other sexual misconduct by another member of the university community, seek assistance through the Dean of Students Office at 313-577-1010 or the Office of Equal Op - portunity at 313-577-2280. DOSO can implement interim measures \u2014 such as a no-contact order, an interim suspension of the accused or a change in classes \u2014 that may be needed to protect the victim and the rest of the campus community. The university will promptly and fairly investigate all reported incidents of sexual harassment and assault, and take adminis - trative action where appropriate, even if no criminal charges are brought. Help and support It is important that a survivor receive help and support in dealing with trauma that may result from experiencing domestic or inti - mate partner violence, sexual assault, stalking, sex discrimination, or harassment. Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS) is available to offer support and referrals, with free services for Wayne State students. Good safety choices Always trust your instincts. If you feel uncomfortable in a situation, don't try to be polite and stay. Remove yourself im- mediately, and call the WSUPD at 313-577-2222. If you're off campus, call 911. If you plan on drinking alcoholic beverages, don't do so from open containers (such as punch bowls), which can easily be spiked with other drugs. Order your own beverage and keep an eye on it at all times. When going out to social events, go with friends you trust. If you head out alone, notify others about where you'll be. Don't leave a social event alone or with someone you just met or don't really know. Visit doso.wayne.edu for additional information about aware-ness, prevention and support resources. RAD training The Wayne State University Police Department offers low- cost, nationally certified Rape Aggression Defense (RAD) training throughout the year. Students, staff and faculty learn techniques for awareness, prevention, risk reduction and avoidance before advanc - ing to realistic self-defense training. Emphasis is placed on the proper way to deliver effective kicks, blocks and strikes, as well as practical, tactical ground-fighting skills to facilitate escape. Watch your inbox for messages from WSUPD with details about upcoming training sessions. 42 | Green & Gold Guide CAPS: A safe place for support If you find yourself having trouble adjusting to college, Counseling and Psychological Services is a safe place to start for support.

You manage your own time Most of your classes are set for you. You arrange your own course plan with an academic advisor. Note: Your weekly schedule may look lighter than in high school but you'll be expected to spend twice as much out- of-class time on studying and homework. Teachers impart knowledge and facts, often drawing connections and leading you through the thinking process.Professors expect you to contemplate, make sense of and draw connections between seemingly unrelated topics. Teachers often remind you of assignments and deadlines. Professors expect you to read, save and consult the course syllabus to stay on top of expectations. Reading assignments are often discussed and re-taught in class.You are assigned substantial amounts of reading and writing that may not be directly addressed in class. Testing is frequent and covers small amounts of material. Testing happens less frequently and may be cumulative. You are responsible for test preparation, not your professor.

You do not need to identify as a sur- vivor or know a victim of violence to experience its emotional and physical effects. It is possible to be traumatized vicariously. You may feel fear, anger, resentment, hopeless- ness, helplessness, confusion, alienation, or even guilt or shame. We encourage you to reach out to people you trust for support, know your limits, and set boundaries in conversations and around social media so that you can take care of yourself.

Patrick Roache Theatre Detroit Class of 2018 60 | Green & Gold GuideParking on campus You'll probably hear a lot about parking at Wayne State. In fact, parking is likely to be at a premium at any university situated in the middle of a bustling city. However, parking at WSU can be very easy. Even when the closest structures and lots are full, there is plenty of perimeter parking with free shuttle service available. The best way to approach parking, and the method that will give you the most peace of mind, is to purchase a semester- long assigned parking pass ($287 for most structures, or $369 for premium parking*). This allows unlimited entry and access to a designated structure or lot, which you'll choose based on availability and where you spend most of your time on campus. Students who live on campus with vehicles must be in the semester parking program. Each new parking pass customer will pay a one-time fee ($25*) for an RFID tag, which hangs from your rearview mir-ror to allow for quick, hands-free entry and exit. The hang- tag is linked to your OneCard and all current (and future) parking assignments, so hold on to it throughout your WSU career, even if you take a semester off from assigned parking. General parking is another option, allowing you to pay as you go, with access to any of the general student parking areas. Deposit funds to your OneCard for easy in-and-out access and to take advantage of the discounted student OneCard parking rate of $3.75* ($4.75* for premium park - ing areas). The general public may park in designated WSU lots and structures at the daily public rate, typically around $7.50-$10*, using a credit/debit card for entrance and exit and cash at limited locations. Visit parking.wayne.edu or use the Wayne State mobile app to see up-to-the-minute availability of open spots. See ad on page 56. To purchase a pass or get more information, visit parking. wayne.edu and click the Student Parking tab or go to the OneCard/Parking Service Center in room 257 of the Wel- come Center. *Based on 2016-17 academic year rates; subject to change.Campus shuttles Wayne State offers a complimentary shuttle service that al- lows you to get from one part of campus to another simply by showing your OneCard. The mini-buses are marked and run in approximately 15-minute intervals Monday-Friday from 7 a.m.-7 p.m. on main campus, and in approximately 30-minute intervals Monday-Friday from 7 a.m.-9 p.m. on the medical cam-pus.

A weekend shuttle service is offered, with buses running from main campus to downtown Detroit on Friday and Saturday nights from 9 p.m.-2:30 a.m., excluding holiday weekends and spring/summer semester.

In 1881, the Detroit Normal Training School was established, which is now the College of Education. The now-iconic Old Main Hall was built in 1896 as Central High School, which began adding college classes in 1913. Those classes evolved into the Detroit Junior College (offering a two-year general education program) in 1917, which became the College of the City of Detroit (with four-year degree programs) in 1923, and now is the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences. In 1924, the College of Pharmacy was organized, and six years later the first regular graduate courses were offered in liberal arts and education. Frank Cody became the first president in 1933, with the existing colleges united into a university organization, eventually named Wayne University, taken from Wayne County in honor of General Anthony Wayne. Wayne University continued to grow, adding the School of Social Work, the Law School, and the School of Business Administration, now the Mike Ilitch School of Business. In 1956, it was renamed Wayne State University. In 1963, Wayne State was designated one of Michigan's three constitutionally established universities. Vision Wayne State University will be a pre-eminent, public, urban research university known for academic and research excellence, success across a diverse student body, and meaningful engagement in its urban community.Mission Wayne State's mission is to create and advance knowledge, prepare a diverse student body to thrive, and positively impact local and global communities.
