How can you detox mercury with homeopathy and improve your health naturally Cristina Villacorta", "sitename": "Cristina Villacorta", "date": "2022-07-05", "cleaned_text": "In my practice, I see children vaccinated and children who are not vaccinated, and there are a few interesting- or, say, striking observations- that are obvious at first sight. Of course, this is not a problem that all children experience, but obviously, I only see children in my practice that are experiencing problems. Healthy children do not tend to come and see me! Firstly, both groups of children get ill with acute affections, but the vaccinated children tend to see me for recurrent or chronic problems such as recurrent chest infections, eczema, chronic otitis media, recurrent tonsillitis, hives, allergies, recurrent fevers etc. However, a lot of parents that come with their children do not necessarily realise the problems had started after a set of vaccines ( although some do), and they only come because conventional medicine has not been effective in helping to get rid of the symptoms and therefore hope that homeopathy can help. Secondly, the incidence of allergies is much higher among vaccinated children. I am not saying that non-vaccinated children do not suffer from allergies!! But the severity of the allergies and the number of triggers is higher in the vaccinated group. Typical allergies that tend to occur together in those children are peanuts, nuts, eggs and sensitivity to chemicals that are either ingested, such as preservatives or applied on the skin, such as in soaps or creams. Treatment for both children is the same, but unvaccinated or partially vaccinated children tend to react very well to remedies, and their health improves fairly quickly. Fully vaccinated children with this kind of recurrent problem take much longer to regain their health and need to go through a set of remedies to clear the problems. HOW MY PRACTICE HAS EVOLVED ACCORDING TO MY FINDINGS At the beginning of my practice, I used to simply take the case relying on the information the parents provided, but in time, it was obvious to me that many of the parents were missing crucial information. They simply could not make the connection between cause and effect regarding vaccines. Some parents would say that their child had a strong reaction to one particular set of the vaccine programme, but still, they could not make the link to the current complaints. While others simply could not think about any possible connection since it may have been a couple of months since their child got quite ill, so logically, they did not even think about it. THE HOMEOPATHIC TREATMENT FOR DETOXING I do not use any fixed particular protocol or detox programme, I rather work with a different set of methods that fit the child without overwhelming the system but in a very gentle way. This may include remedies for incomplete expressed disease states, the use of nosodes, both miasmatic and vaccine nosodes, constitutional remedies, therapeutics to alleviate symptoms as I work on deeper layers and the Banerji Protocols. I approach any of these cases as I would do with any other case presented in my practice, but these children tend to have longer paths to regain health and need several remedies over a period of time to complete the process. [In here you will find my favourite remedies to gently detox your liver.](https://cristinavillacorta.com/blog/helping-the-digestive-system-liver-support) CASES FROM MY CLINIC Baby with recurrent bronchiolitis and slow development. The baby had this recurrent complaint since the last set of vaccines. He had been in and out of the hospital several times with this complaint but could not clear it completely. Remedies: Ant-tart 30, a few doses of this remedy for several days cleared his chest, and the baby became more alert and responsive. Baby with severe eczema: Baby was getting worse progressively with every set of vaccines until, at 4 months, it extended to all of her body. Eczema is itchy and weepy, parents had used cortisone cream, but every time it goes away, it comes back worse than before; therefore, they started to look for another solution. Remedies: Morgan Pure30, after a few doses of the remedy, the eczema is nearly gone, with only a few remaining patches. Over the course of a year, more remedies were needed to complete the process, and the remaining eczema at this point was a small patch on her body that it was occasionally itchy. The whole case took two years, but the child is now free from eczema and has remained like this until the present day. THE USE OF BOWEL NOSODES AND LIVER SUPPORT IN MY PRACTICE WITH THESE CHILDREN For some of these children that I see, their gut microbiota or intestinal flora is badly affected and some of these children will present with digestive symptoms such as constipation, unformed stools and passing more than average wind and colic. This may accompany allergies or intolerances or come on its own. It is not surprising that many children with eczema have allergies as an associated symptom of gut microbiota, which profoundly influences many aspects of our physiology, including nutrient metabolism, resistance to infection, immune system and neurological development. The composition and density of gut bacteria can influence inflammatory processes in our gut, drive autoimmunity, and prevent allergic responses. This is why bowel nosodes have become indispensable with children in my practice, especially children who come to see me with eczema, allergies or behavioural problems. In most cases, tackling the bowel alone will clear 50% of the skin and make the rest of the case more manageable. Most of those children, at some point, will benefit from liver support remedies and Chelidonium 6x and Lycopodium 30c are one of my favourites. They seem to do wonders to tone up this special organ that helps clear our body's toxicity. BANERJI PROTOCOL TIP The Banerjies use for ADHD: Aethusa200 every 3rd day Stramonium 6c two doses daily Clue: Banerjies cause Aethusa 200 for dairy intolerance as well, and lots of these children suffer from dairy allergies. The Banerjies are onto something good here! Stramonium is a remedy that has an affinity to the brain and spinal nerves and, in this particular potency is an excellent toning remedy. It is disheartening to find so many children whose problems started after receiving vaccines, but of course, this is not all children. However, there are enough for me to question vaccines as a trigger to new children who see me for recurring chronic health complaints. The road to recovery for this patient can be long or short; that very much depends on a lot of factors such as the length that the child has been ill, if he has been vaccinated again and how full the case feels at first appointment. After taking the whole case and how the patient reacts to the first prescriptions indicates their vitality. In some cases, a child may need to come to see me only a few times, and in others, the road to healing is a little bit bumpier and lengthy, but there is always an improvement in the symptoms as the case moves along. A SIMPLE STRATEGY FOR PREVENTION OR DETOXING This is a very simple strategy for helping minimize any symptoms that could arise after vaccinations. This may not help in all cases, especially if reactions were severe previously, but it is a good first port of call for self-prescribing. The day before the vaccination, the child the potentised vaccine in 200c and also repeat after vaccination on the same day. For instance, if your child received the DTP vaccine, then give DTP potentised remedy. If there are acute symptoms immediately, give the remedy in a 30c or 200c dissolved in 1/3 of a glass of water. Take a teaspoon as a dose every 3 hours. If your child has received several vaccines at once, use Poli Vax from a good homeopathic remedy. "}
