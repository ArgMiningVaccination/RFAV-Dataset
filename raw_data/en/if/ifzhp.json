Certain Cigna Companies and/or lines of business only provide utilization review services to clients and do not make coverage determinations. References to standard benefit plan language and coverage determinations do not apply to those clients. Coverage Policies are in tended to provide guidance in interpreting certain standard benefit plans administered by Cigna Companies. Please note, the terms of a customer's particular benefit plan document [Group Service Agreement, Evidence of Coverage, Certificate of Coverage, Summ ary Plan Description (SPD) or similar plan document] may differ significantly from the standard benefit plans upon which these Coverage Policies are based. For example, a customer's benefit plan document may contain a specific exclusion related to a topic addressed in a Coverage Policy. In the event of a conflict, a customer's benefit plan document always supersedes the information in the Coverage Policies. In the absence of a controlling federal or state coverage mandate, benefits are ultimately determined by the terms of the applicable benefit plan document. Coverage determinations in each specific instance require consideration of 1) the terms of the applicable benefit plan document in effect on the date of service; 2) any applicable laws/regulations; 3) any relevant collateral source materials including Coverage Policies and; 4) the specific facts of the particular situation. Each coverage request should be reviewed on its own merits. Medical directors are expected to exercise clinical judgment and have d iscretion in making individual coverage determinations. Coverage Policies relate exclusively to the administration of health benefit plans. Coverage Policies are not recommendations for treatment and should never be used as treatment guidelines. In certain markets, delegated vendor guidelines may be used to support medical necessity and other coverage determinations.

General Background Effective 11/15/2023 Page 6 of 57 Medical Coverage Policy: 0533 Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), also called hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) or stem cell transplant, is a type of treatment for cancer (and a few other conditions as well). Bone marrow produces all of the different cells that make up the blood, such as red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. All of the cells of the immune system are also made in the bone marrow. All of these cells develop from a type of precursor cell found in the bone marrow, called a \"hematopoietic stem cell.\" Hematopoietic stem cells are found in the peripheral blood and the bone marrow; therefore stem cells can be collected or harvested from either location. Some of the most effective treatments for cancer, such as chemotherapy and radiation, are toxic to the bone marrow. In general, the higher the dose, the more toxic the effects on the bone marrow. After the t reatment, a healthy supply of stem cells is reintroduced, or transplanted. The transplanted cells then reestablish the blood cell production process in the bone marrow. HSCT is a method of replacing immature blood -forming cells in the bone marrow that have been destroyed by drugs, radiation, or disease. It may be autologous (i.e., using a person's own stem cells) or allogeneic (i.e., using stem cells donated by someone else). Autologous transplant \u2014 In autologous transplantation, an individual's own hematopoietic stem cells are removed before the high dose chemotherapy or radiation is given, and they are then frozen for storage and later use. After chemotherapy or radiation is complete, the harvested cells are thawed and returned to the individual, like a transfusion. Allogeneic transplant \u2014 In allogeneic transplantation, the hematopoietic stem cells come from a donor, ideally a brother or sister with a similar genetic makeup. If an individual does not have a suitably matched sibling, an unrelated person wit h a similar genetic makeup may be used. Under some circumstances, a parent or child who is only half - matched can also be used; this is termed a haploidentical transplant. In other circumstances, umbilical cord blood may be used in an umbilical cord blood t ransplant. Myeloablative transplant \u2014 A myeloablative transplantation uses very high doses of chemotherapy or radiation prior to transplantation with autologous or allogeneic hematopoietic stem cells. Non-myeloablative transplant \u2014 A non -myeloablative tran splantation, sometimes referred to as reduced intensity transplant, allows an individual to have less intensive chemotherapy before transplantation with allogeneic hematopoietic stem cells. The idea is to minimize up front toxicity by using lower doses of intensive therapy, while retaining the immune graft versus tumor effect. This approach may be recommended for a variety of reasons including age, type of disease, other medical issues, or prior therapies. Racial disparities The American Society for Transp lantation and Cellular Therapy (ASTCT) and the National Marrow Donor Program (NMDP) have formed the ACCESS Initiative to address and reduce barriers to hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) and cellular therapy (CT) in an effort to ensure equal access a nd outcomes for all patients in need. In addition to cellular therapy physicians, the initiative includes program administrators, health policy and health equity experts, health service researchers, participants from commercial payer organizations, and federal stakeholders. The ACCESS Initiative incorporates a comprehensive approach to reduce HCT/CT -related access barriers and resultant inferior outcomes. The inaugural ASTCT -NMDP ACCESS Workshop was held in Washington, DC on July 28 and 29, 2022, wherein committee members met to discuss and to define goals for 3 focus areas: awareness, poverty, and racial and ethnic inequity. The goals include: Increasing awareness among community physicians of disease indications for HCT/CT and providing education for patients and caregivers on HCT/HCT availability, clinical trials, and support services available for them. Effective 11/15/2023 Page 7 of 57 Medical Coverage Policy: 0533 Identifying HCT/CT recipients at high risk of adverse outcomes due to socioeconomic adversity and developing patient -, center -, and policy -related initiatives to improve these patients' access and survival. Improving equity in access and outcomes for all HCT/CT recipients, regardless of race or ethnicity, by working with HCT/CT centers to address the gap in knowledge of these patient populations and provide accurate data on t he sociodemographic characteristics of patients in their regions. Ultimately, publications and policy changes based upon committee efforts would be laudable (Auletta, et al., 2022 ; National Marrow Donor Program ). Landry (2021) conducted a systematic revie w of the literature which included 17 publications that evaluated racial disparities and access to SCT (11 retrospective cohort studies, one literature review, 3 cross -sectional studies, and 2 focus group samplings). In 2014, the Affordable Care Act (ACA) became fully implemented. This expansion of coverage for uninsured or underinsured has led to approximately 40% of SCT procedures performed in the United States now reimbursed by governmental payers. Eight of the included studies evaluating access to SCT were performed after 2014. Three of these studies specifically evaluated utilization and found that ethnic minorities with multiple myeloma, ALL, AML, and AL amyloidosis are still underutilizing SCT, with significant differences in referral and time to r eferral for Blacks. Eight retrospective reviews found substantial variation in access to SCT by ethnic minorities (Black, Hispanic, or Asian) when compared to their Caucasian counterparts. Thirteen publications found racial disparities in either overall su rvival, progression free survival, treatment related mortality, relapse, or combinations of these outcomes. The author stated that \"While variation in overall mortality between ethnic minorities and white patients has traditionally been attributed to decr eased utilization of stem cell transplant, our review revealed that discouragement of potential donors, differences in treatment failure and/or transplant rejection, and overall stigmatization and mistrust of the medical profession likely play significant roles in continued, worse outcomes seen in minority patients.\" Majhail et al. (2012) reviewed published literature and noted disparities by race exist in three areas related to HCT: donor availability, access to HCT and outcomes of HCT. About 70% of patients who need allogeneic HCT do not have a matched sibling and must rely on unrelated donors or umbilical cord blood (UCB). African -Americans/Blacks have a lower likelihood of finding an unrelated donor. The probability of finding a match within the Nation al Marrow Donor Program's (NMDP) Be The Match Registry is estimated to be 0.93 for Whites, 0.82 for Hispanics, 0.77 for Asian Americans and 0.58 for Blacks. Whites constitute nearly 74% donors in the registry, whereas the representation of Hispanics (10%), Blacks (7%) and Asians (7%) is less frequent. Contraindications Many factors affect the outcome of a tissue transplantation; the selection process is designed to obtain the best result for each individual. The presence of any significant comorbid conditi ons which would significantly compromise clinical care and chances of survival is a contraindication to transplant. Relative contraindications for HSCT include (but are not limited to): poor cardiac function (ejection fraction less than 35%) poor liver function (bilirubin greater than 2.0 mg/dL and transaminases greater than two times normal), unless related to disease poor renal function (creatinine clearance less than 50 mL/min) (not applicable for most auto transplants) Effective 11/15/2023 Page 8 of 57 Medical Coverage Policy: 0533 poor pulmonary function (diffusion capacity less than 50% of predicted) human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) if not controlled or active hepatitis B, hepatitis C or human T-cell lymphotrophic virus type 1(HTLV -1) Karnof sky rating less than 60% and/or Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status greater than two Blood Cancers Most blood cancers start in the bone marrow where blood is produced. Stem cells in bone marrow mature and develop into three types of blood cells: red blood cells, white blood cells, or platelets. In most blood cancers, the normal blood cell development process is interrupted by uncontrolled growth of an abnormal type of blood cell. There are three main types of blood cancers: Leukemia , a type of cancer found in blood and bone marrow, is caused by the rapid production of abnormal white blood cells. The high number of abnormal white blood cells are not able to fight infection, and they impair the ability of the bone marrow to produce red blood cells and platelets. Leukemia can be either acute or chronic. Chronic leukemia progresses more slowly than acute leukemia, which requires immediate treatment. Leukemia is also classified as lymphoblastic/lymphocytic or myeloid/myelogenous. Lymp hocytic/Lymphoblastic leukemia refers to abnormal cell growth in the marrow cells that become lymphocytes, a type of white blood cell that plays a role in the immune system. In myeloid leukemia, abnormal cell growth occurs in the marrow cells that mature into red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. L ymphoma is a type of blood cancer that affects the lymphatic system, which removes excess fluids from the body and produces immune cells. Lymphocytes are a type of white blood cell that fight infection. Abnormal lymphocytes become lymphoma cells, which multiply and collect in lymph nodes and other tissues. Over time, these cancerous cells impair the immune system. Lymphomas are divided into two categories: Non-Hodgkin lymphoma: Non -Hodgkin's lymphom as are the most common. There are about 61 known types of non -Hodgkin lymphoma. About 85 percent of non - Hodgkin's lymphomas diagnosed in the U.S. are B -cell lymphomas, which means they originated from this type of cell. B -cell lymphomas grow quickly (high -grade) or slowly (low -grade). There are over a dozen types of B -cell non -Hodgkin lymphomas. The rest are T cell lymphomas, named after a different cancerous white blood cell, or lymphocyte. Hodgkin lymphoma: The Hodgkin's lymphomas are the rarest types of the disease and are characterized by Reed -Sternberg cells. There are six different subtypes of Hodgkin's lymphoma. Myeloma (multiple myeloma) is a cancer of the plasma cells. Because myeloma frequently occurs at many sites in the bone marrow, it is often referred to as 'multiple myeloma' (MM). Plasma cells are white blood cells that produce disease - and infection -fighting antibodies. The plasma cells make an abnormal protein (antibody) known by several different names, including monoclonal immunoglobulin, monoclonal protein (M -protein), M - spike, or paraprotein. There are other plasma cell disorders that also have abnormal plasma cells but do not meet the criteria to be called active multiple myeloma. These other plasma cell disorders include but are not l imited to: Effective 11/15/2023 Page 9 of 57 Medical Coverage Policy: 0533 Smoldering multiple myeloma (SMM) Light chain amyloidosis. POEMS syndrome Myelodysplastic Syndromes (MDS) are conditions that can occur when the blood -forming cells in the bone marrow become abnormal (dysplastic). There are several different types of MDS, based on how many types of blood cells are affected and other factors. Myelofibrosis is considered a myeloproliferative neoplasm. Three other disorders are commonly classified as MPNs: chronic myeloid leukemia, essential thrombocythemia and primary myelofibrosis (PMF) or idiopathic myelofibrosis, it is characterized by replacement of the bone marrow by fibrous scar tissue, which reduces the ability of the marrow to produce red blood cells. POEMS (Pol yneuropathy, organomegaly, endocrinopathy, M - protein, skin changes) syndrome is a rare plasma cell disorder characterized by demyelinating peripheral neuropathy and clonal plasma cell proliferation. It can be mistaken for chronic inflammatory demyelinatin g polyneuropathy. The clinical manifestations of POEMS syndrome can be debilitating; therefore, early diagnosis is essential (Khouri, et al., 2021). Systemic mastocytosis (SM) is no longer considered a subgroup of myeloproliferative neoplasms, but is considered a distinct disease category. It results from a clonal, neoplastic proliferation of morphologically and immunophenotypically abnormal mast cells (MC) that accumulate in one or more organ systems. The clinical presentation of mastocytosis is heterogeneous, ranging from skin-limited disease (cutaneous mastocytosis, CM), particularly in pediatric cases where the majority have disease -onset within the first 2 years of life and commonly experience spontaneous regression of skin lesions at puberty, to a mor e aggressive variant with extra -cutaneous involvement (systemic mastocytosis, SM) that may be associated with multiorgan dysfunction/failure and shortened survival, that is generally seen in adult patients (Pardanani, et al., 2023).

Overview of Treatment Phases in ALL Management Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation Effective 11/15/2023 Page 11 of 57 Medical Coverage Policy: 0533 Cancer As part of postremission consolidative therapy, the decision to proceed with allogeneic/autologous HCT or prolonged maintenance are mutually exclusive approaches in ALL therapy. Each case will need to be individualized based on disease setting and features. Allogeneic HCT is more likely to be a primary part of post -consolidative therapy in AY A and adult patients with evidence of high -risk features (including Ph -positivity, Ph-like disease, or persistent MRD). Notably, while younger patients may experience lower transplant -related mortality, older age is by itself not a contraindication. For this reason, HLA typing and bone marrow transplant referral should be considered for all newly diagnosed and relapsed transplant -na\u00efve patients to facilitate timely donor identification, and ultimately allogeneic transplant if warranted. (MS -13) NCCN Recomm endations for Ph -Positive ALL AYA and Adult Patients with Ph -Positive ALL The panel recommends that Ph -positive ALL AYA and adult patients less than 65 years of age and no substantial comorbidities be treated in a clinical trial, when possible. Many variables determine eligibility for allogeneic HCT including donor availability, depth of remission, comorbidities, and social support. The optimal time for a patient to receive allogeneic HCT is unclear; however, proceeding to allogenic HCT with MRD is no t optimal and additional therapy is recommended to eliminate MRD before transplant. In cases of persistent or rising MRD, consolidation therapy options may include blinatumomab (B -ALL) with or without TKI, or continuation of multiagent chemotherapy or cort icosteroid combined with a TKI. In younger AYA patients (aged 21 years), emerging data suggest that allogeneic HCT may not confer an advantage over chemotherapy combined with TKIs. Allogeneic HCT may be useful in appropriate candidates with MRD negativity, while considering post -HCT TKI following consolidation therapy. (MS -25, 26) Patients with Relapsed/Refractory Ph -Positive B -ALL For all patients with R/R Ph -positive B -ALL, participation in a clinical trial is preferred. If transplant -na\u00efve p atients experience a second CR prior to transplant, consolidative allogeneic HCT should be strongly considered. For patients with disease that relapses after an initial allogeneic HCT, other options may include a second allogeneic HCT and/or DLI. However, the role of allogeneic HCT following treatment with tisagenlecleucel or brexucabtagene autoleucel is unclear. (MS -26, 27) NCCN Recommendations for Ph- Negative ALL AYA Patients with Ph -Negative ALL Effective 11/15/2023 Page 12 of 57 Medical Coverage Policy: 0533 Cancer The panel recommends that AYA patients with Ph -negative A LL (regardless of risk group) be treated in a clinical trial, where possible. (MS-43) For patients experiencing a CR following initial induction therapy, monitoring for MRD should be initiated (see NCCN Recommendations for MRD Assessment). If the resulting MRD status is negative, continuation of the multiagent chemotherapy protocol for consolidation and maintenance would be appropriate. Consolidation with allogeneic HCT may also be considered, especially if the patient has high -risk features. If the MRD sta tus is positive, blinatumomab (for B -ALL) is recommended or allogeneic HCT may be considered. Although long -term remission after blinatumomab treatment is possible, allogeneic HCT should be considered as consolidative therapy. If the MRD status is unknown, allogeneic HCT is recommended, especially if the patient has high -risk features, although MRD retesting should be considered at first available opportunity. A continuation of multiagent chemotherapy may also be considered, and MRD assessments should be pe rformed at the earliest subsequent opportunity. In all cases, the optimal timing of HCT is unclear. Adult Patients with Ph -Negative ALL For adult patients with Ph -negative ALL, the panel recommends treatment in a clinical trial, where possible. For relatively fit patients (aged <65 years without substantial comorbidities), the recommended treatment approach is similar to that for AYA patients. For patients experiencing a CR after initial induction therapy, monitoring for MRD should be initiated (see NCC N Recommendations for MRD Assessment). If the resulting MRD status is negative, continuation of the multiagent chemotherapy protocol for consolidation and maintenance is recommended. Consolidation with allogeneic HCT may also be considered, especially if t he patient has high -risk features. The effect of WBC counts on prognosis in adult patients with ALL is less firmly established than in pediatric populations. If the MRD status is positive, blinatumomab (for B -ALL) is recommended or allogeneic HCT may be considered. After blinatumomab treatment, consolidative therapy with allogeneic HCT should be considered. If the MRD status is unknown, allogeneic HCT is recommended, especially if the patient has high -risk features. A continuation of multiagent chemotherapy may also be considered. In all cases, the optimal timing of HCT is unclear. (MS -44) Patients with Relapsed/Refractory Ph -Negative B -ALL For patients with R/R Ph -negative B -ALL, the approach to second- line treatment may depend on the duration of the initial response. If transplant -na\u00efve patients experience a second CR prior to transplant, consolidative allogeneic HCT should be strongly considered. For patients with disease that relapses after an initial allogeneic HCT, other options may include a second al logeneic HCT and/or DLI. However, the role of Effective 11/15/2023 Page 13 of 57 Medical Coverage Policy: 0533 Cancer allogeneic HCT following treatment with tisagenlecleucel or brexucabtagene autoleucel is unclear.

Graft -versus -host disease (GVHD), chronic immunosuppression, and gonadal dysfunction in males and females related to high -dose conditioning chemotherapy and RT are the major post -transplant complications associated with HSCT. Chronic GVHD has been identified as the leading cause of non -relapse mortality in HSCT survivors. AYA patients are at a higher risk of developing chronic GVHD than younger children. HSCT survivors are also at increased risk for late complications, which include recurrent infections, secondar y cancers, cardiac dysfunction, growth failure, weight loss, neurocognitive delay, and other end -organ dysfunction. Allogeneic HSCT survivors irradiated at 30 years or younger are at higher risk of developing secondary solid cancers.

NCCN GUIDELINES Acute Myeloid Leukemia (V.3.2023 \u2014 April 5, 2023) NCCN Recommendations The NCCN AML Panel strongly enc ourages enrollment in a clinical trial for treatment induction of younger patients (aged <60 years) with AML. (MS-34) HLA testing should be performed promptly in those who may be candidates for either fully ablative or reduced -intensity conditioning (RIC) allogeneic HCT from a matched sibling or an alternative donor, which constitutes the best option for long -term disease control. (MS -35) CBF Cytogenetic Translocations and MRD Negative There are insufficient data to evaluate the use of allogeneic HCT in first remission for patients with AML who are MRD negative and have favorable -risk cytogenetics outside of a clinical trial. (MS -40) Intermediate -Risk Cytogenetics and/or Molecular Abnormalities Including MRD Positive The panel members agree that transpla nt-based options (either matched sibling or alternate donor allogeneic HCT) or 3 to 4 cycles of HiDAC affords a lower risk of relapse and a somewhat higher DFS when given as consolidation for patients with intermediate -risk cytogenetics. The role of autologous HCT in the intermediate -risk group outside of clinical trials is diminishing due to improvements in allogeneic transplants, which are expanding the pool of potential donors outside the family setting. While autologous HCT is still incorporated i nto the clinical trial design in Europe, the consensus of the NCCN AML Panel was that Effective 11/15/2023 Page 18 of 57 Medical Coverage Policy: 0533 Cancer autologous HCT should not be a recommended consolidation therapy outside the setting of a clinical trial. (MS -40) Treatment -Related Disease Other than CBF and/or Unfavorable Cytogenetics and/or Molecular Abnormalities The panel strongly recommends clinical trials as standard therapy for patients with poor prognostic features, which include FLT3 -ITD abnormalities in the setting of otherwise NK -AML, high WBC (>50,000/mcL) a t diagnosis, or adverse cytogenetics/molecular markers as well as secondary and therapy -related AML. If remission is observed, consolidation therapy is recommended, and strong consideration should be given to allogeneic HCT with matched sibling or alternat ive donor (including umbilical cord blood products) as part of consolidation strategy. (MS-41) NCCN Recommendations Similar to recommendations for adults younger than 60 years, the NCCN AML Panel encourages enrollment in a clinical trial for treatment induction of patients aged 60 years with AML. (MS -49) NCCN Recommendations Previous Intensive Therapy For patients who had previously received intensive therapy, a marrow to document remission status upon hematologic recovery should be performed after 4 to 6 weeks. If a CR is observed, a clinical trial is recommended. Other postremission or maintenance therapy recommendations include but are not limited to allogeneic HCT. (MS -52) For patients who experience induction failure, a clinical trial, low - intensity therapy (azacitidine, decitabine), allogeneic HCT (preferably in the context of a clinical trial), therapies for R/R disease (see Management of Relapsed/Refractory AML), or best supportive care are recommended treatment options. (MS- 53) Previous Lower -Intensity Therapy For patients who previously received lower -intensity therapy, a marrow to document remission status upon hematologic recovery should be performed, with the timing dependent on the therapy used. If a response is observed, allogeneic HCT may be considered for select patients. (MS - 53) NCCN Recommendations The NCCN AML Panel recommends enrollment in a clinical trial for the management of Relapsed/Refractory AML as a strongly preferred option. Other options include targeted therapy or chemotherapy followed by allogeneic HCT.

Those with low tumor burden can proceed to receive HCT immediatel y. Those who are not eligible for HCT due to high tumor burden may receive systemic therapy first, and their eligibility for transplant may be assessed after initiating systemic therapy based on improvements in functional status and/or organ response. The NCCN panel members recommend that treatment of SLCA should be in the context of a clinical trial when possible, because data are insufficient to identify optimal treatment of the underlying plasma cell disorder.

Ongoing advances in alternative donor sources (such as unrelated donors and cord blood), more accurate HLA testing for a stringent selection of unrelated matched donors, and the use of reduced -intensity conditioning regimens have improved outcomes following allogeneic HCT. Allogeneic HCT is an appropriate treatment option for the very rare patients presenting with BP -CML at diagnosis, patients with disease that is resistant to TKIs, patients with progression to AP -CML or BP -CML while on TKI therapy, and patients with CML that is resistant and/or intolerant to all TKIs. The potential use of allogeneic HCT must be tied to faithful monitoring of disease, since the major potential pitfall in delaying transplantation is \"missing\" the chronic phase interval.

Although further cytoreduction and HDT/ASCR (with RT if not previously given) are often appropriate, occasional clini cal circumstances may warrant the use of RT or systemic therapy with or without RT. Conventional -dose second- line systemic therapy may precede HDT/ASCR. RT should be strongly considered for selected sites of relapse that have not been previously irradiated . In radiation -na\u00efve patients, TLI may be an appropriate component of HDT/ASCR. Second -line systemic therapy followed by response assessment with FDG-PET is recommended for all patients. Patients with a Deauville score of 1 to 3 should proceed to HDT/ASCR with or without RT (category 1). Observation with or without RT can be considered, if HDT/ASCR is contraindicated. Maintenance therapy with BV can be considered for patients with high risk of relapse as defined by the AETHERA trial (defined as those having primary refractory disease, duration of first CR <1 year, or relapse with extranodal or advanced -stage disease). An alternative regimen with or without RT or RT alone is recommended for patients with a Deauville score of 4 or 5 after second -line systemic therapy. Autologous or allogenic HCT following additional therapy may be considered in these patients. Another approach for patients with a Deauville score of 4 is to proceed with HDT/ASCR with or without RT, followed by maintenance therapy with BV for pat ients with a high risk of relapse. The panel has included allogeneic HCT with a category 3 recommendation for select patients with relapsed or refractory disease. Autologous or allogeneic HCT is an option with FDG -PET- positive refractory HL (D eauville 5) that is responsive to RT alone or to subsequent systemic therapy, with or without RT.

(MS -12) NCCN Recommendations for Relapsed or Refractory CHL Histologic confirmation with biopsy is recommended before initiating treatment for relapsed or refractory disease given the risk for transformation and high false -positive rate of FDG -PET/CT. If the biopsy is negative, the panel recommends either observation with short -interval follow -up or additional workup if there is a high index of suspicion. If the biopsy is positive, the panel recommends enrollmen t in a clinical trial if available, and referral to or consulting with a center of expertise, as several options exist for the treatment of R/R disease and there is a lack of data to support one regimen over another. Typically, patients are treated with re-induction therapies, and after an FDG-PET/CT or FDG -PET/MRI assessment, if metabolic CR is observed (Deauville score 3), treatment can be followed up with HDT/ASCR with or without ISRT and with or without maintenance therapy. In general, RT is perf ormed as consolidation after transplant. If a metabolic CR is not achieved, RT may be used before transplant.

The NCCN Panel recommends that all patients eligible for HCT should be referred for evaluati on by HCT center and hematopoietic stem cells (for at least two transplants, in younger patients) should be harvested. High -dose therapy with hematopoietic stem cell support is a critical component in the treatment plan of eligible patients newly diagnosed with MM. The types of HCT may be single autologous HCT, a tandem HCT (a planned second course of high -dose therapy and HCT within 6 months of the first course), or an allogeneic HCT. Effective 11/15/2023 Page 25 of 57 Medical Coverage Policy: 0533 Cancer The NCCN Guidelines for Multiple Myeloma indicate that all types of HCT are appropriate in different clinical settings. In general, all candidates for high-dose chemotherapy must have sufficient hepatic, renal, pulmonary, and cardiac function. However, renal dysfunction is not an absolute contraindication to transplant. (MS -20, 21) Autologous Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation Autologous HCT results in high response rates and remains the standard of care after primary therapy for eligible patients. According to the NCCN Guidelines, for transplant -eligible patients autologous HCT is the preferred option after primary induction therapy while a delayed HCT after early stem cell collection and storage is appropriate as well. (category 1) A repeat HCT can be considered for treatment of progressive/refractory disease after primary treatment in patients with prolonged response to initial HCT. (MS -21) Tandem Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation Tandem HCT refers to a planned second course of high -dose therapy and HCT within 6 months of the f irst course. The NCCN Multiple Myeloma Panel recommends collecting enough hematopoietic stem cells for at least one HCT in all eligible patients, and for 2 transplants in the younger patients if tandem transplant or salvage transplant would be considered. According to the NCCN Multiple Myeloma Panel, a tandem transplant with or without maintenance therapy can be considered for all patients who are candidates for HCT and is an option for patients who do not achieve at least a VGPR after the first autologous HCT and those with high-risk features. (MS -22, 23) A second autologous HCT can be considered at the time of disease relapse. According to the NCCN Multiple Myeloma Panel, repeat autologous HCT for relapsed disease may be considered either on or off clinical trial depending on the time interval between the preceding HCT and documented progression. (MS -23) According to the NCCN Multiple Myeloma Panel, repeat autologous HCT for relapsed disease may be considered either on or off clinical trial depending on the time interval between the preceding HCT and documented progression. (MS -24) Allogeneic Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation Allogeneic HCT includes (ie, \"mini\" transplant) transplants. Allogeneic HCT has been investigated as an alternative to autologous HCT to avoid the contamination of reinfused autologous tumor cells, but also to take advantage of the beneficial graft-versus- tumor effect associated with allogeneic transplants. However, lack of a suitable donor and increased morbidity has limited this approach, particularly for the typical older MM population. Non myeloablative transplants are designed to decrease the morbidity of the high-dose chemotherapy but preserve the beneficial graft -versus -tumor Effective 11/15/2023 Page 26 of 57 Medical Coverage Policy: 0533 Cancer effect. There fore, the principal difference between myeloablative and nonmyeloablative transplants relates to the chemotherapy regimen used.

Participation in clinical trials is recommended for all patients. CHOP or CHOP -like therapy is not adequate for the treatment of BL The management of patients with B- cell lymphomas with features intermediate between BL and DLBCL (now included in the new category, HGBL, NOS) as well as those patients with double -hit or triple -hit lymphomas (HGBL with transloca tions of MYC and BCL2 and/or BCL6) has not been well studied. Therefore, these patients are best managed in the context of clinical trials evaluating novel targeted agents. (MS -144) Patients with relapsed or refractory disease should be treated in the context of a clinical trial. Consolidation with high -dose therapy and autologous stem cell rescue (HDT/ASCR) or allogeneic HCT (if donor available) may be considered for selected patients achieving a CR or PR to second-line therapy.

(MS -53) NCCN Recommendations Given the poor prognosis associated with T -PLL, the NCCN Guidelines Panel recommends that patients be managed in a clinical trial. In patients who achieve a CR or PR following initial therapy, consolidation with allogeneic HCT should be considered. Autologous HCT may be considered, if a donor is not available and if the patient is not physically fit enough to undergo allogeneic HCT.(MS -53, 54) Adult T -Cell Leukemia/Lymphoma Available evidence mostly from retrospective studies suggest that allogeneic HCT may be associated with long term survival in some patients with ATLL, suggesting a contribution of graft-versus - leukemia/lymphoma (GVL) effect. (MS -66) NCCN Recommendations In the NCCN Guidelines, patients with ATLL are classified into four subtypes (chronic, smoldering, acute, and lymphoma) according to the Shimoyama criteria.

(MS-13) American Society of Transplantation and Cellular Therapy (ASTCT) Clinical Practice Recommendations for Transplantation and Cellular Therapies in Mantle Cell Lymphoma (Munshi, et al., 2021) The following are 2021 Final Clinical Practice Guidelines Consensus Statements for Transplantation and CAR T Cell Treatments in the First- Line Setting for MCL : 1. The panel recommends autologous HCT as consolidation therapy in eligibl e, newly diagnosed MCL patients (without TP53 mutation or biallelic deletion) in complete remission or partial remission after first -line therapies.(Grade: A*) 2. The panel does not recommend autologous transplantation as consolidation therapy in MCL patients with disease not responsive to most recent antilymphoma therapy. (Grade: B) 3. The panel does not recommend using measurable residual disease (MRD) testing to guide use of autologous transplantation consolidation after first- line therapies in MCL outside the setting of a clinical trial. (Grade: C) 4. The panel does not recommend using MIPI or MIPI -c prognostic score as a criterion determining use of autologous transplantation as consolidation therapy in eligible newly diagnosed MCL patients in first complete remission or partial remission after first -line therapies. (Grade: C) 5. The panel does not recommend allogeneic transplantation consolidation in MCL patients (without TP53 mutation or biallelic deletion), achieving a complete or partial remission after first -line therapies. (Grade: B) 6. The panel does not recommend consolidation with CAR T cell therapy in MCL patients achieving a complete or partial remission after first -line therapies outside the setting of a clinical trial. (Grade: C) Effective 11/15/2023 Page 39 of 57 Medical Coverage Policy: 0533 Cancer 7. If a TP53 mutation (or bial lelic deletion) is present, the panel recognizes that outcomes are poor for MCL patients in complete or partial remission after first -line therapies who then undergo autologous transplantation. However, no specific alternative strategy has yet been shown to improve outcomes in such patients. Therefore, the panel recommends considering autologous transplantation consolidation as well as alternative consolidation strategies (eg, CAR T cell therapy or allogeneic transplantation), ideally in the context of a clinical trial, for such patients. (Grade: C) The following are 2021 Final Clinical Practice Guidelines Consensus Statements for Transplantation and CAR T Cell Treatments for R/R MCL : 1. If a TP53 mutation (or biallelic deletion) is present, the panel does not recommend autologous transplantation in rel apsed MCL patients achieving a complete or partial remission after second or subsequent lines of therapy.(Grade: B) 2. The panel recommends both CAR T cell therapy or allogeneic transplant consolidation as acceptable options, in relapsed MCL patients with TP5 3 mutation (or biallelic deletion) in a complete or partial remission after second or subsequent lines of therapy. (Grade: C) 3. If a TP53 mutation (or biallelic deletion) is present, the panel recommends treatment with CAR T cells in relapsed MCL patients, with disease unresponsive to last antilymphoma therapy. (Grade: B) 4. In relapsed MCL patients, the panel recommends offering CAR T cell therapy before proceeding with allogeneic transplantation. (Grade: C) 5. Regarding timing of CAR T cell application in relapse d MCL patients (without TP53 mutation or biallelic deletion), the panel recommends offering CAR T cell therapy to patients relapsing after (or who are intolerant to) at least one BTK inhibitor. (Grade: B) 6. The panel does not recommend allogeneic transplantation in relapsed MCL patients with disease refractory to most recent antilymphoma treatment. (Grade:B) 7. The panel recommends allogeneic transplantation for eligible relapsed MCL patients who have achieved only a partial remission with a BTK inhibitor in sec ond or subsequent treatment line, particularly in regions without access to CAR T cell therapy or in subjects where such therapy is not feasible. (Grade: B) 8. The panel recommends allogeneic transplantation in eligible MCL patients relapsing/progressing afte r CAR T cell therapy, if they achieve a complete or partial remission or if they have stable disease with subsequent antilymphoma therapies. (Grade: C) 9. Among eligible MCL patients lacking a TP53 mutation (or biallelic deletion) not undergoing autologous tr ansplant consolidation following first -line therapies, the panel recommends considering Effective 11/15/2023 Page 40 of 57 Medical Coverage Policy: 0533 Cancer autologous transplantation consolidation therapy in patients who have achieved a complete remission after second- line chemoimmunotherapies.

(MS -18) American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy ( ASTCT 2023) Evaluation of Children with Malignancies for Blood and Marrow Transplantation: A Report from the ASTCT Committee on Practice Guidelines (Fraint, et al., 2023) states: The underlying disease indication for HCT is the main driver of HCT planning and its tempo, donor selection, and preparative evaluation checklists. Allogeneic HCT indications in pediatric malignant disease typically include high -risk acute myeloid leukemia (AML), relapsed or refractory acute lymphoid leukemia (ALL), relapsed or refractory chronic myeloid leukemia, juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia, myelodysplastic syndrome, and some high -risk lymphomas, whereas autologous HCT is indicated for lymphomas and a variety of high -risk solid tumors, with the most common procedure being tandem autologous HCT for high -risk neuroblastoma. These indications have been described in more detail by (Kanate, et al., 2020) an ASTCT Committee on Practice Guidelines Task Force . Literature Review ALL: Several randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and case studies have demonstrated improved outcomes with the use of myeloablative conditioning and allogeneic HSCT in subsets of adults with 2006). Although variables exist, several studies have demonstrated improved outcomes with the use of myeloablative allogeneic HSCT compared with autologous HSCT or chemotherapy in selected infants and children Data are not robust regarding improved overall survival rates for the use of autologous HSCT compared w ith allogeneic HSCT. However, this therapy may result in improved disease -free survival (DFS) and may be an acceptable treatment option for selected individuals who are ineligible for allogeneic HSCT (Thomas, 2004). AML: Several randomized controlled trials, meta -analyses and retrospective reviews have demonstrated relapse (RFS) -, disease -free (DFS), and overall (OS) survival benefit with the use of myeloablative allogeneic HSCT in first complete remission for individuals with poor - and intermediate risk A ML. No improvement was noted for individuals with good -risk disease (Schetelig, 2015; data are limited, non -myeloablative or reduced -intensity conditioning permits the use of allogeneic HSCT for a subset of individuals who may be unable to tolerate the toxic effects of myeloablative chemotherapy prior to allogeneic Medical Coverage Policy: 0533 Two meta -analyses evaluated the outcomes of autologous HSCT versus chemotherapy in six studies of adult patients with AML in first CR. Patients receiving autologous HSCT had better EFS in both studies; however, there was no difference in OS. The studies did not address the effect in the high -risk population (Levi, 2004; Nathan, 2004). Amyloidosis (systemic light -chain): Several prospective case series and retrospective studies have demonstrated higher complete response rates in addition to improv ed outcomes after high - dose chemotherapy and autologous HSCT, in selected subgroups Sanchorawala, 2007). CLL: There evaluating the role of allogeneic hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation (HSCT) in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL); however, the evidence demonstrated by several nonrandomized trials suggests that high -dose allogeneic HSCT may be potentially curative for a select population of patients with CLL based o n the long -term survival of some patients who have achieved a complete remission (Moreno, 2005; Oscier, 2004). Several case series and retrospective studies involving non -myeloablative conditioning and allogeneic HSCT have demonstrated improved remission rates, improved progression -free and overall survival rates at variable time intervals ; Khouri, 2007; Brown, 2006. Several prospective comparisons have investigated the safety and effectiveness of autologous published, peer -reviewed scientific literature supports the safety and effectiveness of allogeneic HSCT for the treatment of CML in selected individuals. Although it remains a research interest, improved out comes have not been demonstrated for autologous HSCT compared with conventional chemotherapy in individuals with CML and the role of autologous HSCT has not been established for this indication (Hehlman, 2008; Kebriaei, 2007) CMML/JMML: Data from randomiz ed controlled clinical trials are lacking; however, several prospective and retrospective studies have demonstrated improved overall survival (OS) with myeloablative allogeneic et a l. (2013) published a Cochrane review regarding the effectiveness of high- dose chemotherapy followed by autologous stem cell transplantation for patients with relapsed/refractory Hodgkin lymphoma. The authors included three randomized controlled open -label trials with 14 publications, assessing 398 patients. Data from this systematic review suggest a survival benefit for patients with relapsed or refractory HL after first -line therapy in those treated with HDCT followed by ASCT compared to patients treated with conventional chemotherapy. A systematic review and meta -analysis published by Rashidi et al. (2016) reported autologous HSCT outcomes of 38 studies (42 reports) involving 1850 patients. The primary endpoints were six-month, one -year, two -year and thr ee-year relapse -free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS). The pooled estimates for RFS were 77%, 50%, 37% and 31% at six months and one, two and three years, respectively. The corresponding outcomes for OS were 83%, 68%, 58% and 50%, respectively. Dat a suggests that non -durable remissions are a major shortcoming of allogeneic HSCT in Hodgkin lymphoma. Multiple Myeloma: Allogeneic HSCT may include the use of nonmyeloablative conditioning regimen (Kuruvilla, Although autologous HSCT Page 43 of 57 Medical Coverage Policy: 0533 is not curative, studies demonstrate an improvement in complete response rates and prolongation of median overall survival (OS) by approximately 12 months (Giralt, 2009; Barlogie, 2006 [a -c]). Several randomized controlle d trials have demonstrated improved response rates and overall survival (OS) rates with the use of tandem compared with single autologous transplantation (Kumar, 2009; Bruno, 2007). Myelodysplastic Syndromes: Allogeneic HSCT the potential for long -term disease -free survival (DFS), and is a component of the standard of care for individuals with good performance status and no significant comorbidity for individuals with de novo and secondary myelodysplastic syndromes (Alessandrino, 2008; Kebriaei, 200 5). Autologous HSCT may be appropriate in a carefully selected subset of individuals who achieve complete remission following induction chemotherapy and in whom suitable autologous stem -cells can be collected (Alessandrino, 2002; Kroger, 2006 de Witte, 2007). Myelofibrosis: Allo-HSCT remains an important curative option for patients with PMF. When assessing a PMF patient for transplantation, focus should be placed on: (1) pre -transplant symptom burden and quality of life, (2) age, (3) comorbidities, (4) disease -specific factors, (5) functional status, and (6) availability of related donors. Unfortunately, despite the dramatic improvements in transplantation over the years, many patients with PMF who undergo transplant evaluation are considered ineligible du e to age, comorbidities, or other factors and should be considered for clinical trial or symptom -directed therapies (Wolfe, et al., 2022). Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma: The peer -reviewed published scientific literature supports the safety and effectiveness of hig h-dose chemotherapy with autologous HSCT as a standard treatment option for selected adults with aggressive or advanced indolent, aggressive or recurrent chemosensitive disease. There is a clear survival benefit for compared with conventional chemotherapy (Song, 2007; Oyan, 2006). Although pediatric data are not robust, there is evidence in the published peer -reviewed scientific literature supporting improvement in overall survival (OS) with autologous HSCT compared with standard chemotherapy for the treatm ent of stage II, stage III or stage IV NHL (Won, 2006; Sandlund, 2002). Although data are not robust, myeloablative allogeneic HSCT is considered an acceptable treatment option for selected adults and children with NHL (Kim, 2006; Laudi, 2006; Kasamon, 2005). Non -myeloablative allogeneic HSCT may result in improved OS and is considered an acceptable treatment option for selected adults with NHL (Tomblyn , endocrinopathy, M - protein, skin changes) syndrome is a rare plasma cell disorder. Jurczyszyn et al. (2022) retrospectively reported on a multi -country registry of 108 patients with POEMS.A total of 15 hematology centers from 9 countries from the period of 1992 to 2019 were included in the analysis. Median follow up was 2.6 years. High dose chemotherapy with autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT) was incorporated into front line treatment in 25 patients (30%). Fifty -two percent ASCT patients achieved complete remission/very good partial remissions (CR/VGPR), compared to 35% in the non-ASCT group (p=.003). The authors concluded that proteasome inhibitors (PI) as single agents, the combination of a proteasome inhibitors with immunomodulatory agen ts (IMiDs), and ASCT all demonstrate high responses and should be considered standard options for a newly diagnosed POEMS patient. Systemic Mastocytosis: Systemic mastocytosis (SM) results from a clonal proliferation of abnormal mast cells (MC) in extra -cutaneous organs. Broadly, patients either have indolent/smoldering SM (ISM/SSM) or advanced SM, including aggressive SM (ASM), SM with Effective 11/15/2023 Page 44 of 57 Medical Coverage Policy: 0533 associated myeloid neoplasm (SM- AMN), and mast cell leukemia. Identification of poor -risk mutations (i.e., ASXL1, RUNX1, SRSF2, NRAS) further refines the risk stratification. Treatment goals for ISM patients are primarily directed towards anaphylaxis prevention/symptom control/osteoporosis treatment. Patients with advanced SM frequently need therapy to inhibitors (TKI) (midostaurin, avapritinib) have the treatment landscape in SM. While deep biochemical, histological and molecular responses have been documented with avapritinib treatment, its efficacy as monotherapy against a multimutated AMN disease component in SM -AMN patients remains unclear. Cladribine continues to have a role for MC debulking, whereas interferon - has a diminishing role in the TKI era. Treatment of SM- AMN primarily targets the AMN component, particularly if an aggressive disease suc h as acute leukemia is present. Allogeneic stem cell transplant has a role in such patients. Imatinib has a therapeutic role only in the rare patient with an imatinib -sensitive KIT mutation (Pardanani, et al., 2023).
