You are cordially invited to join us for our Authentic Ayurvedic Autumn cleanse! Through this interactive series of wellness workshops we aim to nourish our human experience and align with our soul. Over the course of three weeks, you will delve into the art of: nurturing your body with deep self care rituals restoring inner wellness, through Ayurvedic cleansing soup, herbal teas and harmonizing your spirit through mindfulness practices, meditation and nature At the heart of our endeavor lies the profound connection between bodily health and mental serenity. Together, we shall explore ancient self-care traditions tailored to support your modern lifestyle, guiding you toward a deep-seated sense of inner harmony and mental clarity. Who doesn't need more of that! Our wellness workshops will encompass a series of ancient self care techniques aimed at balancing the vital energies within us, drawing inspiration from the elements and chakras within. Guided by the wisdom of the seasons, particularly the enchanting autumn, we will curate a blend of customized herbs and personalized cleansing dietary recommendations that align seamlessly with your unique digestion type. Because Ayurveda recognizes our unique digestion and mental faculties, in this way it is most effective and addresses your unique symptoms. Immersing ourselves further into nature's embrace, we will engage in moments of self reflection while being embodied through intentional movement via specific detoxifying yoga sequences and postures. We will kindle our digestive fires, enhancing our immunity in time for the colder seasons and alleviate the burdens of stress that weigh upon our minds from this modern world. Because this 3D reality can get to us sometimes! Surrounded by the gentle and transitioning leaves in nature we will engage in peaceful moments of meditation, self reflection and also journal our thoughts, sip on delicious organic tea and bask in the earthly aromas that surround us. (We will meet at least once out in nature depending on the weather.) Together, we will practice becoming available to the beautiful forces of Mother Nature and the cosmos with all of our senses finding solace in ancient old breathwork and 3rd eye (Ajna Chakra) vision meditations. We will also practice grounding our Muladhara root chakras deep into the earth for a most nourishing sense of vibrational harmony and stability. Our sustenance throughout this transformative journey shall come in the form of nourishing and rejuvenating soups known as kitchari, as well asn the \"the ambrosial essence\" of organic, seasonally stewed fruits. You will learn how to prepare these easy to digest meals with me! With gratitude and mindfulness, we will also honor the bountiful harvests that nature bestows upon us, savoring each meal as a sacred ritual that prepares us for digestion\u2014because each and every meal is a sacred moment according to Ayurveda. In the company of our group, you will find not only detoxification but also a renewed sense of well being, connection and companionship. It is my honor to facilitate these beautiful workshops which I delicately prepare to create a most loving and nurturing journey of rejuvenation. As a deeply empathetic individual, I understand the art of nurturing the senses and curating a haven of compassion and serenity. During a designated week, you will have the opportunity to prepare healing kitchari soup within the comfort of your own home. While I shall provide the essential herbs and spices, you'll be responsible for assembling the kitchari and accompanying vegetables. Rest assured, these ingredients are both affordable and readily available. I can guide you through the entire process and if you need, I can also accompany you to get your supplies. Guided by the principles of Ayurveda, will practice communing and establishing a relationship with our beloved source. This ancient wisdom calls us to align with the infinite, unseen and intelligent energies of our universe\u2014an intricate tapestry to which we belong.
