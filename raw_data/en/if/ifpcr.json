Further, she engagedin meditation. An auntie had been the person who suggested most ofthese remedies to her, and she had used them for the decadefollowing her first diagnosis. She felt that using CAM gave her peaceof mind and would save her from dying. In her view, in fact, CAMsshould serve as primary cancer treatments since they are more likelyto lead to healing than medical care. Mrs. A. added, \"Take time outfor fun. One of the major medications is to be happy.\"Case B. Ms. B. was asingle 50 year-old Caucasian woman whowas ahigh school graduate. She had received surgery and radiationfor her Stage Ibreast cancer. Ms. B. took Chinese herbs as well asVitamins A, B, and C, evening primrose oil, garlic, calcium, antioxidants, and oolong tea. In addition, she practiced qi gong, participatedin areiki group, and underwent light therapy. She also took nutritionclasses at alocal medical center to improve her eating habits. Sheworked full-time in aservice industry, and one of her clients hadalerted her to these options. She said she chose CAMs \"because Ibelieve in alternatives. Idon't believe that doctors aid you in healing.Ididn't have any expectations. Iwent in with an open mind. Itcouldn't hurt and itfelt right.\" Ms. B. felt that the CAM, qi gong inparticular, \"works because it's positive and natural. We have thecapability of curing ourselves. Your mind can cure you or kill you.\"Case C. Ms. C. was asingle woman in her forties of Chinese-Korean ancestry who was diagnosed with Stage 2B breast cancer.She was acollege graduate who worked full-time in aprofessionalposition. She had received surgery, chemotherapy, and radiationtherapy for her disease and was currently taking Tamoxifen. Withrespect to CAMs, Ms. C. took sunrider (Chinese-oriented herbs),antioxidants, therapeutic tea, vitamins, garlic, Echinacea, aloe, andflorabalane, as well as shiatsu massage. She believed that the herbsplayed arole in purging the body of toxins and also helped her to getthrough the chemotherapy: \"I know it's done something, since beingon the products helped me to respond to the drugs.\" She also noticedthat the shiatsu helped her to regain motion in her shoulder aftersurgery. She saw CAM as complementing medical care: \"It workshand in hand. They're two different things. The medical treatmentblocks disease. (CAMs) are as effective as medical treatment inbuilding up the body.\" DiscussionThis study provides the first report of CAM use in Hawai 'icancerpatients. Study 1 is based on responses from a registry-basedpopulation and includes aheterogeneous group of patients who wereassessed at the same time after diagnosis. Study 2provides in-depthinformation on aspecific population sub-group: women with breastcancer. Several caveats to data interpretation should be mentioned,however. Given the differential response rates, the results may bemore valid for Caucasians, Hawaiians, women, breast cancer patients, and younger individuals. In addition, the survey and interviews relied on self-reports. Even though the interviewers were notpart of the medical care team and had been trained to elicit candidresponses to personal questions, itis possible that some patients maynot have wanted to discuss full CAM use with the interviewer. The patients reported using a tremendous variety of CAM approaches, and many used more than one approach simultaneously.For the most part, the kinds of therapies cited were consistent withthe OAM classification. However, several significant differencesare seen. The OAM listing includes \"bioelectromagnetic applications,\" which includes blue light treatment and artificial lighting,electroacupuncture, electromagnetic fields, electrostimulation andneuromagnetic stimulation devices, and magnetoresonance spectroscopy. Only one patient in the interview study mentioned havingtried one of these approaches. Perhaps they are not as popular inHawai'i as elsewhere. On the other hand, the CAM listing includes\"prayer therapy\" within the general \"mind/body control\" category.In this sample, the use of prayer was so prevalent that we listed itasaseparate category.With respect to prayer, and in fact to all the therapies mentioned,sometimes patient responses indicated behaviors that did not greatlydiffer from everyday practices, while others represented aspecialcancer-related activity. For example, many patients reported sayingprayers, or having prayers said by their church, to help themselvesget well, while one patient said that the priest conducted ahealingmass \"to try to remove my sickness,\" and another had gone to aChristian prayer healer. Dietary changes included changes as simpleas eating healthier foods and as complex as daily preparation andingestion of aspecial soup using six fresh vegetables recommendedby an alternative medicine institute. Many herbal medicines werementioned, the most common being essiac tea and shark cartilage.While manual therapies were relatively uncommon, anumber ofpatients reported experiences with \"healing touch\" in the hospital.One patient related how astaff member in the same day surgery unitincluded healing touch in preparations for her lumpectomy. \"She'laid over hands' and told me to 'see the light' and let it heal me.Wheeling me to surgery, (she) sang Happy Trails.\" The patient saidshe laughed, went along with it, and also felt more at peace.Thirty-six percent of patients in this study reported using somekind of CAM. As mentioned earlier, previous estimates of howmany cancer patients use CAM have varied considerably. Thesereports differ for anumber of reasons: the year when the data werecollected (since CAM's popularity has increased over the pastdecade), patient population (site of disease and type of institution),the length of time since cancer diagnosis, methodological differences in how patient response was elicited (e.g., an open-endedquestion, such as that in the current study, compared to achecklist),and the varying definitions of CAM that were employed. Thefindings of this study are quite consistent with the average percentage \u2014 30% \u2014 reported in the world's literature. However, additional research is needed to replicate and refine this estimate.These results of the survey indicated that CAM users tend to beyounger, women, Catholic, and better educated. These correlations,with the exception of the link to Catholicism, are consistent with allother studies of CAM in cancer patients and other populations.3Educational level has been investigated in virtually all studies ofCAM use and consistently emerges as the strongest predictor. Whilethis may seem surprising initially, it likely reflects greater knowledge and access to resources among people with higher education.Education may also confer increased self-confidence in knowinghow to seek out additional support beyond what is provided in thehospital and doctor's office.
