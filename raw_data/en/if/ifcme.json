Cosentyx is now the first biologic indicated for ERA and the only biologic treatment approved for both ERA and PsA in pediatric patients in the US. These are the second and third approvals for Cosentyx in a pediatric population in the US, and Cosentyx now has a total of five indications across rheumatology and dermatology1. \"Prior research suggests that despite receiving treatment, some children and adolescents with PsA or ERA can continue to experience symptoms,\" said Hermine Brunner, MD, Cincinnati Children's Hospital. \"The findings from the Phase III JUNIPERA trial show that pediatric patients treated with secukinumab demonstrated marked responses throughout the treatment period. This approval is positive news for some patients who continue to struggle with painful symptoms like inflammation of the joints and swollen fingers and toes.\" ERA and juvenile PsA (JPsA), subtypes of juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), are autoimmune diseases3,4,5. ERA is characterized by joint swelling and pain where tendons and ligaments attach to bone and may present with low back pain or tenderness at the palpation of the hips6. JPsA is characterized by joint swelling and skin psoriasis and may present with nail changes, inflammation of fingers and/or toes, or psoriatic skin changes in a first-degree relative6. If left untreated, they can lead to high levels of pain and disability3,4,5. \"The FDA approvals for JPsA and ERA follow the approval of Cosentyx as a first-line systemic treatment for pediatric psoriasis earlier this year, and further reinforce the commitment of Novartis to the pediatric community,\" said Victor Bulto, Head, US Pharmaceuticals, Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation. \"Cosentyx is a proven medicine with a history of efficacy and safety across several systemic inflammatory conditions, with more than 500,000 patients treated worldwide since launch.\" The approved pediatric dosing for Cosentyx in children and adolescents is 75 mg (body weight: 15 kg to less than 50 kg) or 150 mg (50 kg or more). It is administered as a subcutaneous injection by a pre-filled syringe or Sensoready\u00ae pen every four weeks after initial loading doses1. With appropriate guidance/instruction from a healthcare professional, Cosentyx can be administered by an adult caregiver outside of a healthcare provider's office via a single-dose prefilled syringe or Sensoready\u00ae pen. The approval is based on data from the Phase III JUNIPERA study, a two-year, three-part, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized-withdrawal trial that enrolled 86 children and adolescents aged 2 to 17 years with a confirmed diagnosis of ERA or JPsA according to a modified International League of Associations for Rheumatology classification criteria7. The primary endpoint of the study was time to flare in the treatment period 2 (Week 12 to Week 104)7. In children and adolescents ages 2 to 17 years old, the study demonstrated that patients with active JPsA (n = 34; mean age: 12.2) treated with Cosentyx had a significantly longer time to flare, showing a 85% reduction in the risk of flare (P<0.001) versus placebo1,8. The study also demonstrated that patients with active ERA (n = 52; mean age: 13.7) treated with Cosentyx had a longer time to flare, showing a 53% reduction in the risk of flare versus placebo1,8. Safety in this pediatric population was consistent with the known safety profile of Cosentyx for the treatment of plaque spondyloarthritis and ankylosing spondylitis2. \"The symptoms of PsA and ERA can be debilitating for children and adolescents living with these chronic conditions, impacting their daily lives,\" said Tiffany Westrich-Robertson, CEO, International Foundation for Autoimmune & Autoinflammatory Arthritis (AiArthritis). \"It is encouraging to see an additional treatment option for these underserved patient populations.\" In July 2020, Cosentyx received EU approval as a first-line systemic treatment for pediatric psoriasis in patients aged 6 to less than 18 years and recently received approval in the US and China1,9,10. In 2021, Cosentyx was also approved in Japan to treat psoriatic arthritis and psoriasis in pediatric patients aged 6 years or older, as well as generalized pustular psoriasis11. Novartis has filed regulatory submissions for Cosentyx in ERA and JPsA in Europe with a decision anticipated in the coming months. About Cosentyx\u00ae (secukinumab) Cosentyx is the first and only fully-human biologic that directly inhibits interleukin-17A (IL-17A), an important cytokine involved in the inflammation of psoriatic arthritis, (PsA), moderate to severe plaque psoriasis, (AS) and non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis (nr-axSpA)12,13. Cosentyx is a proven medicine and has been studied clinically for more than 14 years. The medicine is backed by robust evidence, including five years of clinical data in adults supporting long-term safety and efficacy across moderate to severe PsO, PsA and AS14-20. These data strengthen the position of Cosentyx as a treatment across AS and nr-axSpA, PsA and moderate to severe PsO, supported by more than 500,000 patients treated worldwide since launch in 20151,21,22. Indications COSENTYX is a prescription medicine used to treat: - people 6 years of age and older with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis that involves large areas or many areas of the body, and who may benefit from taking injections or pills (systemic therapy) or phototherapy (treatment using ultraviolet or UV light alone or with systemic therapy) - people 2 years of age and older with active psoriatic arthritis - adults with active ankylosing spondylitis - adults with active non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis (nr-axSpA) and objective signs of inflammation - people 4 years of age and older with active enthesitis-related arthritis IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION Do not use COSENTYX if you have had a severe allergic reaction to secukinumab or any of the other ingredients in COSENTYX.
