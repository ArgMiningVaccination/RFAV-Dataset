Learning to befriend uncertainty, to feel comfortable in that gray area of not knowing, can help manage anxiety. When feeling overwhelmed by all the unknowns, it is helpful to focus on the present and to rest in the moment-to-moment experience of breathing. Befriending uncertainty means living life knowing that it is finite, while recognizing that no one knows with certainty how long we have to live. And it is this realization that makes each day precious and worth living as fully as possible.9Patient and Family Guide to Cancer Services at UCSF Information, Support, and Important UCSF Phone Numbers 10 What is Cancer? 16 Your Medical Care Team 18 Useful Tips and Information 21 Insurance, Billing, and Disability 25 Making the Most of Your Visit 27 Things to Know Before You Go 31 UCSF Cancer Programs and Services 33 Living Now, Planning for the Future 45 Care in Life's Last Chapter (End of Life Care) 49 What Are We Doing Well?

I feel I owe it to myself to make the most of this incredible gift of life.\" ~ Kelley Cancer is caused by an overgrowth of abnormal cells. These cells divide and multiply in an uncontrolled fashion and can spread to other parts of the body. When damaged cells travel to another part of the body and invade healthy tissue, it is called a metastasis. The type of cancer you have is based on where the abnormal cells originate in the body. If the cancer cells start growing in the breast, it is called breast cancer, even if those cells spread to other parts of the body, such as the bones or liver. Cells can become cancerous for many different reasons, including genetic inheritance (where the trait is passed on from one generation to the next), exposure to cancer-causing chemicals, as well as other factors, which are still being studied. 17The goal of treatment is to destroy, remove, or control the cancer cells. Some of the most common types of treatment include: Surgery, which involves removing the cancer cells Chemotherapy, which uses medications to destroy cancer cells that may be circulating in the body Radiation therapy, which uses high energy particles to wipe out cancer cells Immunotherapy, which uses the body's own immune system to find and destroy cancer cells Targeted Therapy, which involves using treatments that target specific characteristics of cancer cells to block their growth and spread. Because targeted therapy is directed just at the cancer cells (and has less effect on healthy cells), these treatments tend to have fewer side effects.- A person's plan of care may include one or more of these treatments, as well as others not listed here. As our understanding of cancer improves, new treatments are emerging that help people live longer healthier lives. When people tell me that my experience with cancer inspires them, it sometimes dumbfounds me. I think that I got through my experiences by just putting one foot in front of the other and by counting on a lot of support. ~Natalie 18Your Medical Care Team \"We tend to get caught up in statistics and averages, but no two cancers ever behave exactly the same way. Each individual has different genes and an immune system, a distinctive will to live, and an urge to fight. These cannot be measured on charts or graphs.\" ~ National Cancer Institute You and your caregivers are important members of the healthcare team. As such, it is important that you participate in your care, ask questions and make sure that you understand and can follow your treatment plan. It is also helpful for you to know the names of roles of members of your care team, so be sure to jot down this information. This will help you know who to reach out to in order to get the help you need. As part of an academic medical center and teaching hospital, UCSF combines the best in research, clinical care and education to provide advanced treatments that may not be available at other hospital. Our collaborative approach to care means that you will likely be seen by a number of different types of doctors, nurses, and other clinicians, who are often referred to as providers. If your English is not fluent and you prefer to discuss your medical issues in your spoken language, you can request to have a medical interpreter free of charge.19Doctors, also called Physicians (MD) or Medical Providers will direct your care. In addition to your main doctor, called an Attending Physician, you may receive care from: Fellows, who are licensed physicians with specialized training who are furthering their expertise in a sub-specialty Residents, who are licensed physicians completing additional specialty training Medical Students, who may accompany other providers as part of their education. There are also physicians and other clinicians at the UCSF Osher Center for Integrative Medicine who are trained in therapeutic approaches from around the world, including acupuncture, nutrition, and various stress reduction practices. The Osher Center can be reached at 415-353-7700. Nurse Practitioners (NP) and Physician Assistants (PA) have advanced medical degrees and share responsibility with your doctor for your overall treatment plan and care. They will help develop a care plan, conduct physical examinations, order medications and tests, and assist in managing your symptoms or side effects from treatment. -Your Medical Care Team Registered Nurses (RN) will tell you what to expect, respond to your phone calls, and will work with your doctors to answer many of your questions. Medical Assistant (MA) help prepare you for your appointment, assist with medical procedures, and are present in the room during sensitive medical exams. If you are having an in-person appointment, they will call you in from the waiting room, take your vital signs and record your medical history and medication list. They can also give you updates on your wait time or bring you a glass or water or blanket to make you feel more comfortable. If you are having a video visit, a Medical Assistant may call you before your visit to ask some intake questions and ensure you are set up for the video visit. 20Medical Interpreters facilitate communication between patients, their caregivers, and members of the care team. All patients whose English is limited and who would prefer to communicate in their spoken language can request to have a Medical Interpreter at no cost. Even if you are bringing a family member or friend who does speak English, it is still good to have a Medical Interpreter at your appointment who understands medical terminology. This way your friend or family member can focus on supporting you or taking notes. - - Practice Coordinators (PC) are the people who answer phones, schedule appointments, communicate with your insurance company, and assist with other administrative tasks. Social Workers (MSW or LCSW) are trained to help people manage the challenges of living with cancer. They provide emotional support and can help with health insurance and disability benefits, lodging, transportation, and community resources and programs. You can request to speak to a social worker by asking your provider's office for a referral or by calling (415) 353-4762 for general information. Ask for a Medical Interpreter! This service is Free. 21Useful Tips and Information \"Reading autobiographies of others who have dealt with cancer has been really helpful. It is comforting to know that others have gone through similar experiences, sometimes more difficult than mine.\" ~ Janet The experience of being diagnosed with cancer and having to navigate the health care system can be very overwhelming. The tips and suggestions on the next few pages will help your visits go more smoothly. Scheduling Your Appointments We offer two types of appointments: In-person appointments, where you come in to the medical center to be seen Video appointments, which are also called telehealth visits. Telehealth visits allow you to talk to your doctor and be treated from the comfort of your home. Instructions for signing up for video visits are available at videovisit.ucsf.edu . If your situation is not urgent, and you do not need to be physically examined or undergo a procedure, you may be able to choose a video visit. Please be aware that video visits are billed in the same way as in-person visits, and all the same rules about copays and deductibles apply. Avoid scheduling time-sensitive activities (such as picking up kids from school or catching an airplane) too close to the time of your scheduled appointment. 22Preparing for Your In-Person Appointment Please bring the following to your in-person appointments: Your insurance information and photo identification (usually a driver's license or ID card) A list of questions to ask your doctor Information about new symptoms or other health issues A list of medications you are taking, including herbal supplements Preparing for Your Video Visit (Telehealth Appointment) Prepare for your video visit by downloading the free Zoom Cloud Meetings App onto your smart phone, tablet, or computer, and then do a test meeting at https://zoom.us/test . Once you have scheduled your video visit, you will receive an invitation with a Zoom Meeting ID number and a link to join. Five minutes before your appointment, click on the Zoom link to join the video visit. If this does not work, open Zoom on your device or go to https:// ucsf.zoom.us , Click \"Join a Meeting\" and type in the Zoom Meeting ID number that you received. If you need help setting up your video visits, contact MyChart Customer Service at 415-514-6000. After Your In-Person or Telehealth Appointment You can review what was discussed during your appointment by reading the After Visit Summary (AVS) or reading the doctor's medical notes in Notes. Both your After Visit Summary and the medical Notes can be found in the \"Visits\" tab next to the day of your appointment. You can also request to have your AVS printed out for you at the end of your in person visit. If you have any questions or concerns about your medical care, contact your doctor, nurse or the Practice Manager in the clinic where you are seen as they will best be able to resolve the issue. Or, if you feel uncomfortable doing so, you can contact Patient Relations.23- -UCSF MyChart: Secure Online Access to Your Health Information ucsfhealth.org/mychart 415-514-6000 UCSF MyChart gives you access to your online patient medical record and is an effec tive way to communicate with members of your care team. You can access it on the web or download the MyChart app onto your phone or other electronic device. Accessing MyChart To sign up for MyChart, you will need an activation code, which you can request at your appointment, find on your after visit summary (AVS) report, or obtain by calling MyChart customer service at 415-514-6000. You can also log into the MyChart website ( ucsfmychart.org ) to obtain an activation code. If you have any trouble signing up, call MyChart customer service at 415-514-6000 or ask the person at the front desk for help. Designating a Proxy - Having a Trusted Person Access Your MyChart Account If you have trouble using MyChart or communicating in English, you can allow a trusted friend or family member to log into your MyChart account to view your health information and communicate with your doctors. This process is called \"designating a proxy\". 24To designate a proxy, you will need to: Fill out a Proxy Authorization Form, where you will provide the contact informa tion of the friend of family member you have chosen. That person will then receive an email with a link that will allow them to sign-up to your MyChart account.- You can obtain the Proxy Authorization Form by going to the MyChart website at ucsfhealth.org/mychart , calling the MyChart office at 415-514-6000, or asking the person at the front desk for a copy. UCSF MyChart allows you to: View your health information and test results Communicate with your health care team View your upcoming appointments Refill medications Schedule some appointments Review and pay bills Fill out forms and questionnaires prior to your appointment so that they can be reviewed by your provider before you are seen. (If it is difficult for you to fill out the forms in English, you can arrive early to your appointment and request to have a Medical Interpreter meet with you to help you fill out the forms for your upcoming appointment.)- 25Insurance, Billing, and Disability \"Dealing with cancer was like climbing a huge mountain. I thought that the ordeal would be over once I was done with treatment. But, I then realized that I still had to figure out how to climb down the mountain.\" ~ Michelle Before starting treatment, we recommend that you contact your insurance plan to verify your health insurance coverage and to find out if your plan covers care at UCSF. You may want to ask whether your plan has a deductible, which is a specific amount that you need to pay out of pocket before the rest of the claim is covered. There also may be certain treatments or procedures that your insurance needs to pre-approve or pre-authorize in order for the cost to be covered. Our office staff will often work with your doctor and insurance company to get the pre-authorizations you need. If you don't have insurance, or it is not clear whether you have pre-authorization for the visit, we will consider you a self-pay patient and will collect a deposit at the time of your first appointment, regardless of whether it is an in-person appointment or video visit. The deposit amount will be deducted from your total bill.26Patient Financial Services Office - Helps Patients after the Appointment Patient Financial Services can help you after your appointment, once you have received your bill. They can help you to: Understand your statement balance Arrange a payment plan, and Get financial assistance (if you qualify), where a portion of your medical bill is forgiven and written off. Those with a family income at or below 400 percent of federal poverty guidelines generally qualify for assistance. Phone: 866-433-4035 You can also communicate with the office through MyChart messaging. Website: ucsfhealth.org/billing-and-insurance Filing for Disability and Leave of Absence - edd.ca.gov/disability For more information on short-term and long-term disability options, ask to speak to a UCSF social worker. You can also complete your state disability forms online at edd.ca.gov/disability . You may also need to complete forms from your employer. To get information about the forms that your employer requires, contact your employer's Human Resources Department. Once you have filled out your portion of the form, your doctor or nurse will need to complete the medical section. If you are experiencing financial difficulties with transportation costs, lodging, or other expenses,you can also let a member of your care team know or ask to speak with a social worker.27Making the Most of Your Visit \"I was getting really anxious and depressed that I would have to put off my travel plans to see my family on the East Coast, but when I brought it up with my doctor, she tweaked my treatment schedule so that I could still enjoy my long awaited plans!\" ~ Jason Taking time to prepare for your visit will help you use your time with your doctor more effectively. Make sure to share your concerns and ask questions if you don't understand what is being said. It is your doctor's role to explain your treatment options, describe advantages and disadvantages of each option, and respond to your questions and concerns. Consider having a family member or friend be present (either remotely or in-person) It is often helpful to have the support of a trusted friend or relative, who can be there with you at your doctor's appointment to listen to what is said, ask questions, and take notes. This person can either be with you at the appointment or participate on the phone or through a video call. You can also contact the Patient Support Corps at 415-476-6004 to request the support of a student intern who can take notes and share them with you. It is not easy to remember it all!28Bring a list of questions Your doctor and care team are available to help you with any of your questions. Think about the questions you want to have answered and write them down, listing the most important ones first. This way you don't have to try to remember all of them. You can also give the doctor a copy of your questions either at the appointment or send them in beforehand. Let your doctor know about any symptoms you are experiencing and how they are impacting your life. If you would like some help preparing for your appointment (including video visits)... The Patient Support Corps Program has student interns (usually pre-medical students) who can help you: Make a list of your most important questions and concerns. - Make an audio recording of your visit with your doctor.

You can also ask a friend or relative to take notes for you or contact the Patient Support Corps to do so. Keep track of who is on your care team It is helpful to make a list of all the doctors and health care providers you are seeing, noting their specialty and why you are seeing them. This is also a good list to share with your doctor, particularly if you are seeing health care practitioners at different facilities. There are some blank sheets at the end this guidebook that you can use for this purpose. - Share important information with your care team, including: Any health problems and symptoms you are experiencing Your goals for treatment or any religious or cultural beliefs that may influence your decisions Important plans that may need to be coordinated with your treatment, such as a family vacation, a desire to finish a college degree, a wish to start a family, etc. Any issue that might make it difficult for you to follow the treatment plan, such as difficulty getting to appointments, paying for parking, taking your medications correctly, or other issues The name of the person you choose to make decisions for you in case there is a time when you are unable to make your wishes known. (This can also be documented in a form called an advance directive.) Don't be afraid to ask questions! 30 Calendar of Symptoms Date Symptom/Event/Description November 17 Started chemo: carboplatin Light nausea - level 2 Nov. 18 Spoke to nurse Jan and started Zofran for nausea - feel no nausea, some fatige,need afternoon nap.

Make sure to document this information in a place that is easy to access, such as a notebook, a smart phone, or in the blank pages at the end of this guidebook. This will make it easier to track the information and share it with your doctor and care team. Above is an example that shows an effective way to track symptoms and changes. Rest assured that the information you give us is confidential We are committed to the safety and health of our patients and make it a priority to keep your health and personal information confidential. We do not collect or share information about immigration or citizenship status.

Knowing that I am mortal, that we are all mortal, reminds me to appreciate each day and do that which makes me come alive and brings joy. ~ Kerim What is Advance Care Planning? Advance care planning involves talking to your doctors and the people who matter most in your life about the type of treatment you would like to have in the event that you are unable to state your wishes or make medical decisions about your treatment. Knowing what is important to you and the type of care you would want can help you plan now so that your wishes for care and treatment ar e honored in the future. Advance care planning is for everyone. Something unexpected can happen at any age.46- -As long as you can communicate and make medical decisions, your stated wishes will be honored - regardless of what you have said in the past or written in your Advance Directive. A convenient way to begin this discussion is to bring it up at one of your medical appointments. This way, your wishes will be documented in your medical record and your medical providers will know what is important to you and the type of care you want to receive in an emergency situation or in the event you can no longer participate in medical decision-making. You can also document your medical wishes in a form called an advance directive. What is an Advance Directive? An advance directive is a form where you write down your wishes for medical care. An advance directive allows you to: Name a trusted person to help make medical decisions for you if you are unable to do so. Let your caregivers and doctors know what kind of treatments and care you may want in different situations. Why Is It Useful to Have an Advance Directive? An advance directive can reduce stress for family and caregivers because they don't have to \"guess\" what type of care the patient wants. Patients feel more secure in knowing that their wishes for treatment and care will be respected. Advance directives can provide specific instructions that are important to the patient. Examples include: - \"I do not want my sister to make decisions on my behalf.\" - \"If my care team says that my condition is incurable and I have a short time to live, I do not want to be put on a ventilator.\" - \"Pain control is my priority. I do not want to suffer.\"47Where can I get an Advance Directive? Advance directives can be obtained: At your clinic visit or the front desk when you check-in for your appointment. Online there are many different formats available for you to choose from. The two forms that many of our patients use include the easy-to-read PREPARE form ( prepareforyourcare. org), which is described below and the advance directive developed at UCSF, which will download directly upon clicking this link ( ucsfhealth. org/pdf/advance_health_care_directive.pdf ).- - PREPARE - prepareforyourcare.org The PREPARE website offers: A step-by step program with video stories. Tips for talking with your family, friends, and medical providers about your wishes. Free advance directives in Spanish, Chinese, Russian and other languages (https:// prepareforyourcare.org/advance-directive ). How Can I Get Help? If you would like some help in thinking through your options or filling out an advance directive, contact your social worker or talk to a member of the Symptom Management Service team. You can also get this information by attending the free monthly workshop described below. Remember, you can change and update your advance directive at any time.48An advance directive reduces confusion in the case of an emergency by letting your doctors and caregivers know who should make decisions for you and what type of care you want and don't want. Monthly Advance Care Planning Workshop - What Matters Most? The MERI Center offers free monthly workshops called What Matters Most? In the workshops, you can meet with an experienced staff person in a supportive group setting to think through your preferences for future care. This workshop is offered online and in-person and is for everyone - patients and their caregivers, old and young, and healthy and sick. It is designed to help you write down your wishes in a document called an advance directive. To sign up for the \"What Matters Most Workshop\" or to find out about other program offerings, contact the MERI Center. Phone: 415-509-8645 Website: meri.ucsf.edu What Do I Do with an Advance Directive Form? Once you fill out an advance directive, you will need to have it signed by either two friends or family members or by a Notary Public. Notary services are available at many businesses, including photocopy shops, parcel shipping stores (such as UPS), libraries, etc. Once your advance directive is signed, make sure to give one copy to your doctor and copies to family members or friends involved in your care. You can also scan a copy and send it to your doctor via My Chart). 49Care in Life's Last Chapter (End of Life Care) - - \"I've found that sitting with my feelings, not running away from them, has helped me resolve my sadness and anger.\" ~ Dan POLST FORM- Physician's Order for Life Sustaining Treatment - https://capolst.org/ A POLST form is a physician's order that lets emer gency personnel who respond to an emergency call know about a patient's preferences for care. Although the emergency personnel may not have access to the advance directive, they are trained to look for a POLST form, which can be worn as a bracelet or displayed in a visible place, such as on the refrigerator. They will follow the instructions on the POLST form when providing emergency care. Patients with advanced or serious illness can get a POLST form from their physician. 50Translations of the POLST form are available at https://capolst.org/ . However, trans lated versions of this form are for reference only; an English version of the POLST form must be completed and signed so that emergency medical personnel and healthcare providers can follow the orders.- Hospice Hospice care refers to care provided by a team of providers that focuses on reducing suffering, providing comfort, and improving quality of life. Hospice care is available for individuals who are expected to live for about six months or less. However, some patients in hospice live longer, or, in some cases, recover. - You can request information about hospice from a social worker, Symptom Management Service, or any one of your providers. Hospice care is covered by Medicare and most insurance companies. - There are a few hospice facilities that specialize in providing around-the-clock comfort care. But most hospice services are provided in the home of the patient, with nurses and other care providers visiting a few times a week to help with bathing, pain management, and care to help patients feel more comfortable. The rest of the care is generally provided by family members, friends, or paid caregivers.- Hospice care provides: Drugs and treatment to provide relief from pain and symptoms Emotional and spiritual support to the patient and family Care at home or at a hospice facility Medical equipment and supplies Education to the family about how to care for the patient51What Are We Doing Well?
