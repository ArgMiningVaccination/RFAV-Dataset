The illustration of the immune responses against SARS-CoV-2 is urgently needed for understanding the pathogenesis of the disease and its vaccine development. CD8+ T cells are critical for virus clearance and induce long lasting protection in the host. Here we identified specific HLA-A2 restricted T cell epitopes in the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2. Seven epitope peptides were confirmed to bind with HLA-A2 and potentially be presented by antigen presenting cells to induce host immune responses. Tetramers containing these peptides could interact with specific CD8+ T cells from convalescent COVID-19 patients, and three dominant epitopes were defined. Furthermore, those epitopes could activate and generate epitope-specific T cells in vitro . All these epitopes exhibited high frequency of variations. The epitope variations not only significantly reduced their binding to the HLA-A2 but also decrease the proportion of specific T cell activation, which might contribute to the immune escape of SAR-CoV-2.
