It uses a wide range of methods that focus on physical, emotional, and spiritual health. It is based on the idea that the human body has an energy in it, known as qi (pronounced \"chee\"), and when this energy is out of balance or somehow blocked, it causes illness. Traditional Chinese Medicine's four key principles: 1. Your body is an integrated whole - Essentially, this means that your body is a fully connected system, and it simply won't function to its full potential if pieces are missing. If a part of your computer is damaged, the entire system suffers, and our bodies work the same way. 2. You are completely connected to nature - Traditional Chinese Medicine factors in more than just your internal system. Your geographical location, the time of year, and local factors like pollution, noise, radiation, and more are taken into account. 3. You were born with the ability to heal yourself - Whereas the modern western model of medicine is focused on introducing foreign elements into your body in order to fight disease, practitioners of Traditional Chinese Medicine know your body already has a built in method for fixing problems. This system has helped us survive as a species for many years, and so strengthening it is the best way to deal with many diseases. 4. Prevention is the best cure - Your body is always showing signs that something may be wrong, but it's common for us to simply ignore them. But practitioners of Traditional Chinese Medicine will take a close look at what is happening with your body, so you can catch any health issues which may arise in the earliest stages, where they are more manageable. One of the most popular forms of traditional Chinese medicine is acupuncture. Acupuncturists use very thin needles, placed on certain spots on the patient's body, with the idea of helping to increase the flow of energy through the body. Traditional methods of Chinese medicine, including [acupuncture](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acupuncture), herbal medicine and other modalities, are used to encourage the flow of qi once again and help achieve a state of optimal health. Though it's based on ancient Chinese philosophy, these treatments can be effective for anyone!
