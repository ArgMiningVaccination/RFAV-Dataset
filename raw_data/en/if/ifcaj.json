Research methods are evolving and we have many promising prospects on the horizon, with ground- breaking cell and gene therapies being increasingly available*. The innovative pharmaceutical industry is driven by, and drives, medical progress. It aims to turn fundamental research into innovative treatments that are widely available and accessible to patients. Already, the industry has contributed to significant improvements in patient well-being. Today's European citizens can expect to live up to 30 years longer than they did a century ago. Some major steps in biopharmaceutical research, complimented by many smaller steps, have allowed for reductions in mortality, for instance from HIV/AIDS-related causes and several cancers. High blood pressure and cardiovascular diseases can be controlled with antihypertensive and cholesterol-lowering medicines; knee or hip replacements prevent patients from immobility; and some cancers can be controlled - or even cured - with the help of new targeted treatments. European citizens can expect not only to live longer, but to live better quality lives. Yet major hurdles remain, including Alzheimer's, Multiple Sclerosis, many cancers, and rare diseases.

In 2021 it invested an estimated \u20ac 41,500 million in R&D in Europe. It directly employs some 840,000 people and generates about three times more employment indirectly - upstream and downstream - than it does directly (PwC, Economic and societal footprint of the pharmaceutical industry in Europe, June 2019). However, the sector faces real challenges. Besides the additional regulatory hurdles and escalating R&D costs, the sector has been severely hit by the impact of fiscal austerity measures introduced by governments across much of Europe since 2010. There is rapid growth in the market and research environment in emerging economies such as Brazil, China and India, leading to a gradual migration of economic and research activities from Europe to these fast-growing markets. During the period 2016-2021 the Brazilian, Chinese and Indian markets grew by 11.7%, 6.7% and 11.8% respectively compared to an average market growth of 5.8% for the top 5 European Union markets and 5.6% for the US market (source: IQVIA MIDAS, May 2022). In 2021 North America accounted for 49.1% of world pharmaceutical sales compared with 23.4% for Europe. According to IQVIA (MIDAS May 2022), 64.4% of sales of new medicines launched during the period 2016-2021 were on the US market, compared with 16.8% on the Eu- ropean market (top 5 markets). The fragmentation of the EU pharmaceutical market has resulted in a lucrative parallel trade. This benefits neither social security nor patients and deprives the industry of additional resources to fund R&D. Parallel trade was estimated to amount to \u20ac 6,070 million (value at ex-factory prices) in 2020.

A decade of strong US market dominance led to a significant shift of economic and research activity towards the US during the period 1995-2005, a trend that has been exacerbating since 2015. Additionally, Europe is now facing increasing competition from emerging economies: rapid growth in the market and research environments in countries such as China and Korea are contributing to the move of economic and research activities to non-European markets. In 2021 China nearly equalled Europe as originator of new active substances launched for the first time on the world market, with respectively 18 and 19 new substances, far behind the US leading with 35 on a total of 95. The geographical balance of the pharmaceutical market - and ultimately the R&D base - is likely to shift gradually towards fast-growing emerging economies.

Recent studies in some countries showed that the research-based pharmaceutical industry generates about three times more employment indirectly - upstream and downstream - than it does directly (PwC, Economic and societal footprint of the pharmaceutical industry in Europe, June 2019). Furthermore, a significant proportion of these are valuable skilled jobs, for instance in the fields of academia or clinical science, which can help maintain a high-level knowledge base and prevent a European \"brain drain\" .

In costly diseases such as cancer and rheumatoid arthritis, medicines account for even less than 20% of the total disease costs. Medicines can also generate additional savings, for example by substantially reducing costs in other areas of healthcare, including hospital stays and long-term care costs.
