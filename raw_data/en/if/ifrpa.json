It is considered to be autoimmune; though, the exact cause is not yet understood. Overproduction of white blood cells (leucocytes) which gather at some places forming the ring shape of rash in this disease. Causes of Granuloma Annulare: The exact cause of Granuloma Annulare is not understood. The underlying process is known to be auto-immune in nature. It is often associated with other auto-immune diseases in the patient or in immediate family members, such as diabetes, under-active thyroid, Systemic Lupus, and Cancer. Injury to the skin, some allergy (such as gluten), or tetanus vaccine may trigger this disease at times. It is more common in females as compared to males. It can occur at any age. Types of Granuloma Annulare: The following clinical variants are recognized. - Localized Granuloma Annulare: the localized variant is the most common form. It occurs most commonly on the hands, feet, wrist, and ankles of young adults. Skin-colored bumps occur generally on the joints. - Generalized Granuloma Annulare: it is predominantly found in adults. The rashes involve a large area of the body including the trunk and extremities. They are more likely to be itchy. - Deep or Subcutaneous Granuloma Annulare: it is seen most often in children. It favors scalp margins, fingertips, and shins. They form a lump below the skin that is rubbery in feel instead of a rash. - Perforating Granuloma Annulare: this form is very rare. They are usually localized on the dorsal of hands and fingers. They leave a scar on healing. Symptoms of Granuloma Annulare: The most prominent symptom includes bumpy skin rash, reddish eruptions, and circular rash with mild itching. Patients usually notice a ring of firm bumps over the back of forearms, hands, and feet. These papules start as small pimple-looking bumps, which spread over time. Occasionally multiple rings may join into one. Diagnosis of Granuloma Annulare: It is clinically diagnosed because of its characteristic appearance. You may need a skin biopsy to confirm the diagnosis. Future (Prognosis) of Granuloma Annulare: If not treated, it may turn out to be self-limiting in about two years; or may last even more.
