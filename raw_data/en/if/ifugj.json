It restores health and vitality to our body, mind and soul, through natural processes of removing toxic substances from the body. My name is Helena (41 years) and I'm Orions certified detox specialis as well as guiding people with private coachings all over the world. I started my study of naturopathy with Dr. Morse's \"International School of Healing Arts\" where I learned the foundations of true healing, creating protocols, learning about the chemistry of our cells and how eating specific foods can create an environment perfect for regeneration. I lerned how to understand the lymphatic system and why this is a vital focus in detoxification. I learned how to rid the body of what is ultimately causing most health issues. At the moment I'm studying \"Lymphatic Iridology\" with Dr. Morse's \"International School of Healing Arts\". Iridology is an alternative medicine technique that uses the colours, patterns, and various other properties of the iris to assess an individual's general health. The technique of iridology is based on the belief that each organ in the human body has a corresponding region in the iris. Thus, the premise is that organ functioning can be examined by simply inspecting the iris. Brutal menstruation pain started my personal health journey more than 10 years ago in my late twenties. Being able to stay alive during these days only by taking painkillers and being told by modern medicine that this was normal, fuelled my dedication to learn about the principles of natural healing, experimenting with diet, herb supplements and lots of detoxification therapies. In the last 2,5 years I've done more than 350 days of fasting (water-, juice- and coconut- water- fasting) and experienced different detox protocols. I've experienced clients getting many benefits out of fasting and detox and I've seen clients healing their bodies from different diagnosed diseases. My mission is to empower others on their healing journey to use natural methods such as detoxification, purification, herbal therapies, and a high-vibration diet and lifestyle to heal their bodies and reach a higher state of consciousness.

You may have heard of or tried the restorative-technique of fueling your body with fat instead of carbohydrates and sugar. To fully grasp the technique, imagine two states: the Fed and the Fasted. Your body can only ever be in one state at a time.It only enters the Fasted state 12 hours after eating. In the Fed state, insulin levels are high which sends signals to your body to store excess calories in fat cells rather than burn them. In turn, your body uses glucose from your last meal as fuel for energy.In the Fasted state, insulin levels are low, while glucagon and the growth hormone are elevated. This means your body starts burning the stored fat for energy, a healthy way to give your system the tools needed to restore itself. Intermittent fasting places your body in a state it wouldn't normally reach during a regular eating schedule.Orion's Intermittent Fasting program is based on a 16/8 schedule of fasting and eating. Although women seem to benefit from a fasting ratio of 14/10, it is entirely up to you which ratio option you choose.During your unrestricted window of food-freedom, it is necessary to nourish your body with nutrient-dense healthy meals. With an award-winning menu, this is an easy feat; you'll be spoiled for choice, and should you need any guidance, there will always be someone available to support you. Once a week you will have the option of joining a full 24-hour fasting day experience known as the, \"Eat, Stop, Eat\" -a 24-hour fast, once a week. This involves fasting from dinner one day, to dinner the next, this amounts to a 24-hour fast. Fasting is the first principle of medicine.We recommend that you drink as much water as you can during the fast, which we provide you complimentary as part of your program. Being properly hydrated is nature's first and foremost cure.Starting from \u20ac1,328 - 8 Day Cleanse and Detox Thani, Thailand4.8 Orion is a sanctuary, located in the Gulf of Thailand, Koh Phangan.

And I learned more in 200 hrs about Yoga, asanas and teaching than I could ever expect. Although a Yoga teacher always remains a student as well, I feel confident enough now to start teaching yoga without any previous teaching experience.Starting from \u20ac1,775 - 28 Day Yoga and Meditation Retreat in Kathmandu, NepalKathmandu, Nepal4.940 reviews A very nice place owned by a very friendly family. We stayed 10 days practising yoga, meditation and discussing life philosophy. During our stay, we were treated as members of the family, and everyone has been helpful and supporting in any aspects of our daily life. The yoga is truly beneficial for body and soul, and the yoga teacher is indeed a yogi with great experience and a very high skill level. The stay was worth every penny, and I am looking forward to coming back again some day.Starting from \u20ac1,308 - 8 Day Rejuvenating Yoga Break Retreat in Island Falls, USIsland Falls, Maine, United States513 reviews It felt like coming home when I spent the week teaching and sharing time with guests at Sewall House Yoga Retreat. I had known Amrita/Donna for over two decades in New York and had heard wonderful things about her yoga home, away from home! Nothing came even close to the intimate friendliness and gratitude that I experienced while working there last summer. Her staff was exceptional, the food was highly nutritious and the guests were all enlightening and wonderful. What a lovely place to come to enjoy in our stressful times. Thank You Amrita!!Starting from \u20ac2,354 - 24 Day 200 Hour Vinyasa Flow TTC in Goa, IndiaGoa, India4.6999999999999998 reviews I qualified as a yoga instructor 2 years ago with different school in Thailand and had an amazing experience. I've never had an intention to teach yoga, I just wanted to educate myself about yoga, learn the right way of doing asanas, get inspired and meet likeminded people. This year I've decided to do it again to refresh my memory, get back on track and to get new experience from different yoga school. Unfortunately I wasn't as lucky this time as the training with Nisarga and particularly with Hari the founder was not very good. I was drawn to Nisarga by its good marketing and professionally done website which promised me an extraordinary experience in my yoga journey. After just a couple of days of yoga practice and theory lessons I realised what I had signed up to . I had to withdraw myself from training as Hari's lessons and instructions were poor and unclear. He was completely inadequate. The quality of yoga and teaching were appalling. I'd like to pinpoint other faults, these include Hari's poor listening skills, lack of experience teaching yoga, disrespect, unpunctuality and his complete lack of teaching skills. There are lots of lies on website regarding his yoga background. There are also misleading information about some western female teacher and other teachers who we never met as all the training was delivered by Hari and his assistant, Ankit. I lost lots of money paying for this training, accommodation and the flight so consider that I was cheated and robbed. The man who is responsible for this is director of Nisarga Hari , who is a complete faker. Response from Nisarga: Dear Elena, We regret that you felt disappointed with our training. However, it's our understanding that we definitely do not deserve this highly critical review. Let us explain. The course was of 22-day duration and you left after completing only one and a half days. In such a short time of the introductory phase, you did not get even a glimpse of the course, and you made up your mind against us. The Yogic and universal wisdom says that if you want to learn, you need to become a student first and be ready to accept and not to expect. However, you already had certain expectations from the course, based on your prior experience with Yoga Teaching. Its good that you wanted to deepen your knowledge despite being already a qualified Yoga instructor, however, you came with an expectation, rather than acceptance. When you go with pre-defined expectations, your mind is bound to conflict with what is offered to you, because every teacher has his own style, his strong points, and weak points. Let us give you an example. As you are a massage therapist, let's assume you offer one hour massage. Now, imagine a customer comes to you and wants to gain the whole experience of massage in a quick massage of only one and a half minutes. Do you think, in such a short span of time, he will get a true insight into the quality of massage? We should understand that every process has a simple beginning, then a detailed procedure followed by a final ending. You stayed with us only for one and a half days, instead of 22 days. It takes 3-4 days to adjust to a new atmosphere, interact with the group and understand the group's energy. You did not go through that transition phase. As you already have teacher training experience, however, other students were beginners, the teacher has to satisfy students of all levels. Possibly, you should have gone for an advanced teacher training course, a 300-hour course. You also mentioned about lies on our website. We are doing authentic work and we do not need the support of fake experiences for promoting our work. Its an open world, the teachers keep on changing places, so, you might not find the same teachers who worked with us in the past. Also, we keep on shifting the teachers in our 3 different locations, India, Thailand, and Bali. However, we always ensure that our teachers are well qualified, authentic, dedicated and experienced. Also, as per our standard policy, we do not entertain refunds, however, we refunded you the amount you deserve. We have shared what we feel about your review. We certainly do not agree with it.\"Starting from \u20ac1,050 - 30 Day De-Addiction & Weight Loss Yoga Retreat in Himalaya, IndiaDharamshala, Himachal Pradesh, India4.11 reviews This was my very first yoga retreat, Location is very good in the mountains of Himachal with snow visible around, Tarun sir is very good at coaching Yoga, Overall it was the best time spent during my yoga retreat, Tarun sir & his wife were always calm & smile on face while serving food & services, they made it in a way to make me feel like I'm in my own house.
