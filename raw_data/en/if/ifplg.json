Very small stones can pass through the urinary system without causing problems. However, larger stones, when traveling from the kidney through the ureters to the bladder, can cause severe pain called colic. The pathogenetic mechanisms of kidney stone formation are complex and involve both metabolic and environmental risk factors. The pain kidney stones cause typically starts in side or back, just below your ribs, and radiates to lower abdomen and groin. Kidney stones are easy to diagnose for those with a sudden onset of pain, blood in the urine and stones that show on x-ray.
