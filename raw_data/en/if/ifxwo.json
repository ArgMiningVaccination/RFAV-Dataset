GRADUATE STUDIES COMMITTEE The Department's Graduate Studies Committee is selected and operates according to the rules of the Graduate School Handbook . A. Graduate Faculty Membership The faculty elects the Graduate Studies Committee Chair for a three -year term. Upon petition by five members of the faculty, an election for the Chair can be held. The Department Chair appoints the members of the Committee as recommended by t he Graduate Studies Committee Chair. In addition to the Chair, the Graduate Studies Committee consists of the department chair, one senior faculty member, one junior faculty member, and one other member. Committee members serve for two years and may be re appointed. B. Role and Responsibility The role and responsibility of the Department's Graduate Studies Committee are listed in the Graduate School Handbook . C. Petition/Appeal Process Petition/Appeals by students regarding the Department's graduate p rograms, policies, and rules must be made in writing to the Graduate Studies Committee. If necessary, the Committee will conduct a hearing with the student and the student's advisor. The outcome will be reported in writing to the parties involved. Should the student decide to continue the Petition/Appeal to the Executive Committee of the Graduate Council, the Graduate Studies Committee Chair will report the Committee's position to the Executive Committee. III. ADMISSION Departmental graduate admission policies and procedures follow those of the OSU Graduate School and the University. Additional specific information is listed below: A. Criteria and Credentials To enter the graduate program, students must have at least one semester of college level calculus, biology, microbiology, physics, chemistry through organic chemistry, and biochemistry, or have obtained the equivalent through training or experience. 7/13 FST GSC /MMG /CGD 8 The GRE general test, with appropriate evidence of per formance, is required of all applicants. Admission to graduate school is competitive. Average scores for our current students are 56th percentile verbal, 78th percentile quantitative, and 48th percentile written with an undergraduate GPA of 3.4. The min imum GPA for admission is 3.0 (on a 4 -point scale) in all previous undergraduate and graduate work. Applicants with lower graduate grade -point averages may be admitted conditionally, by petition to the Graduate School. Past performance in basic science courses (math, chemistry, physics), scores in the analytical and written portions of the GRE, and recommendations from previous instructors or advisors are important criteria for admission. Qualified students may be denied admission when their academic goa ls are not aligned with those of the Department or when advisors, space, or facilities to accommodate the students are unavailable. Students who wish to transfer to the Food Science and Technology Graduate Program from another academic unit must meet the admission criteria listed above. A student wishing to transfer must submit a letter from a faculty member stating which faculty member will serve as the student's advisor. Graduate -level courses completed in the other academic units are accepted toward th e Food Science and Technology degree if these courses meet the Food Science and Technology program requirements. To apply, students must fill out an online application form and have their GRE scores, TOEFL scores (if applicable) and a copy of their offici al transcripts from all university -level schools attended sent directly to the OSU Graduate Admissions Office. Students will also be required to upload three (3) letters of recommendation , a current resume/CV and a Statement of Intent. The letters of reco mmendation should be on company letterhead. The letter of intent should describe the area of research the student would like to pursue, as well as any relevant internships or research experience. B. Application Deadlines. Application deadlines for admis sion to the Department are those set by the University. All application material must be submitted by the deadline to assure a decision regarding admission for the desired term. Complete applications received by November 30 (for international applicants) or January 7 (for domestic applicants) will be considered for university fellowship nomination. 7/13 FST GSC /MMG /CGD 9 IV. ADVISOR A. Assignment of Advisor Graduate students are assigned an advisor when admitted into the program. The Graduate Studies Committee Chair will serve as temporary advisor if the student does not have an assigned advisor. When a student wishes to change his/her advisor, the consent of both the present and the prospective advisors should be obtained. The Graduate Studies Committee should be informed in writing. If consent of one or both advisors cannot be obtained, the student may petition the Committee in writing. Action of the Co mmittee will be based on consultation with the student and his/her present and prospective advisors. The Graduate Student Petition for Change of Advisor form can be found at the end of this handout. B. Role and Responsibility. The graduate advisor provid es counsel and advice to the student on: course selections, individual program development, selection of research and Individual Study topics, and execution of the student's research and educational goals. The graduate advisor also assists with all other student requests that require assistance. Early in the student's program, an additional two -member (for MS) or three -member (for PhD) Advisory Committee will be appointed upon recommendation of the advisor and student and approval of the Graduate Studies Committee. The Advisory Committee serves to: (l) approve the student's course program and changes in the program; (2 ) consult on progress in research; and (3) participate on the student's Examination Committee. All students must have their course program approved by their Advisory Committee before the end of their first term of enrollment. A copy of the approved cours e program must be provided to the Graduate Studies Committee Chair. Students who fail to meet this requirement will be denied further registration. V. COURSE REGISTRATION AND SCHEDULING The Dep artment's rules with respect to registration, scheduling, course load, and changes in schedule are the same as those stated in the Graduate School Handbook . Throughout this document, credit hours refers to graduate -level credits only (5000 and above in FST, 4000 and above in other departments). Undergraduate credits do not meet department or University requirements for graduate programs. English as a second language courses (any cour ses in EDUTL) do not count towards the department requirements . In this Department, 18 credit hours per semester is considered a full -time course load. All Graduate Fellows, GRA s and GTA s must enroll for 18 credit hours per semester (Fall and Spring) and for 8 credit hours during the S ummer term (including May and Summer sessions). 7/13 FST GSC /MMG /CGD 10 The Department shall maintain a file on each student and it must contain: all application materials; a record of the student's academic performance at The Ohio State Univers ity; copies of the approved course schedule and research proposal; copies of all official correspondence and forms from, to, or about the student from the advisor, the Graduate Studies Committee, the Department, the Graduate School, and other faculty membe rs and administrative units of the University. VI. COURSE CREDIT, MARKS, POINT -HOUR RATIO A. Course Credit Rules in the Graduate School Handbook apply. B. Marks (Grades) Rules in the Graduate School Handbook apply with the excep tion that EM credit may be earned only in undergraduate courses. EM credit will be awarded for grade B or better performance. All formal courses offered by the Department, Group Studies and Seminar are graded A -E. All Individual Studies and Research cour ses are graded S/U. Credit for work at other institutions may be transferred as outlined in the Graduate School Handbook . C. Point -Hour Ratio. Rules in Graduate School Handbook apply. A course may be repeated with the advisor's approval when mastery of the subject matter is critical to the student's performance in major area courses and research, or if t he grade in the course was the result of absence beyond the student's control. A Fresh Start option may be granted to students enrolling after a five -year absence upon petition to the Graduate Studies Committee. VII. ACADEMIC STANDING Rules in the Graduate School Handbook Academic and Professional Standards apply wit h respect to good standing, probation, dismissal, reinstatement, reasonable progress, and denial of further registration. 7/13 FST GSC /MMG /CGD 11 A. Required committee meetings. With regard to reasonable progress, a course program must be developed and approved by the Advisory C ommittee within the first term of the student's program. This course program should identify likely dates for Preliminary, General, and Final Oral Exams, as well as the expected graduation time. The student and advisor are expected to meet regularly to d etermine goals for Thesis/Dissertation research progress. A student who meets or demonstrates good faith in reaching established goals in coursework and research is considered to be making reasonable progress. B. Internships. Any i nternships must be arranged with advisor approval and be accompanied by a written agreement that lists the impact of the internship on time to graduation, course credits, stipend (if applicable) , proprietary information, and publication rights. VIII. REQUIRED SAFETY TRAINING All students, staff , and faculty are required to complete safety training their first term at OSU. The course is offered every fall during new student orientation in the Parker Food Science building, and can also be taken online at the Environmental Health and Safety web page by selecting Lab Standard Training . You are also required to complete OSU BEAP (Building Emergency Action Plans) training . Once completed you need to give the Academic Program Coordinator, and your lab safety manager, a copy of the certificates indicating you have passed. Depending on the work performed in your laboratory, you may be required to go through additional safety training . IX. REQUIRED HUMAN SUBJECTS APPROVAL If you want to conduct human research at OSU, you MUST first pass an online course and obtain approval from the Office of Responsible Research Practices . Human research includes surveys, taste tests, and other related activities. There are 3 levels of review a study involving humans can undergo: full -board, expedited, and exempted. Only a few categories of research qualify as exempted research. Fortunately, most surveys or sensory evaluation studies falls into the category of exempted research. Specifically, muc h of this work falls into category #6, which is defined as: Taste and food quality evaluation and consumer acceptance studies, a. if wholesome foods without additives are consumed; OR b. if a food is consumed that contains a food ingredient at or below the lev el and for a use found to be safe, or agricultural chemical or environmental contaminant at or below the level found to be safe, by the Food and Drug Administration or approved by the 7/13 FST GSC /MMG /CGD 12 Environmental Protection Agency or the Food Safety and Inspection Servic e of the U.S. Department of Agriculture. HOWEVER, just because your proposed research falls into the \"exempted\" category, this does not mean that you do not need to obtain approval. YOU cannot decide your proposal is exempt, you can only suggest that it s hould be. It is up to the ORRP to determine if it actually is. Their policy is summarized in the following quote, taken from their website: \"Research involving human subjects may be exempt from federal regulations requiring IRB review. The Ohio State University Human Research Protection Program (HRPP) is responsible for determining whether research involving human subjects meets the criteria for exemption in accordance with applicable regulations. Investigators may not make this determination\". IRB Policy Committee, rev May, 2012. Exempt research is generally short term in nature. It usually is performed \"as written,\" meaning the investigators do not plan to make changes in the research design, the selection of subjects, the informed consent process, or the instrumentation during the course of the study. A determination that research is exempt does not absolve the investigators from ensuring that the welfare of human subjects participating in research activities is protected, and that methods used and information provided to gain subject consent are appropriate to the activity. Investigators may not solicit subject participation or begin data collection until they have received approval from the appropriate Institutional Review Board OR writte n concurrence that research has been determined to be exempt. If you are going to conduct research on humans, you MUST take and pass a web -based course. This applies to the faculty advisor AND the graduate student performing the test. This course can be accessed from: http://orrp.osu.edu/irb/training/citi.cfm . The actual course is located at www.citiprogram.org . You have to create a username and password to enter the site and your employee number (found on your pay stub; if you do not have an employee ID# put eight zeros (00000000) for employee ID#) is required to sign up. For most people in this department who conduct taste tests and surveys, it will be sufficient to complete the basic course for social and behavioral researchers (group 2). More advanced nutrition studies may require completion of the biomedical course (group 1). A refresher course is required every 3 years. The entire course takes 2 -3 hours but is broken down into modules and you can enter and exit the site as often as you like if you do not want to complete it all at once. To apply for Exempted Approval, you will need to download the Exempt Application Form . Specific questions regarding exempt applications should be directed to Cheri Pettey (Phone: 614 - 688-0389 / E -mail: pettey.6@osu.edu Allow three weeks for processing of this applic ation. For research that is not exempt, you will need to download the \"Behavioral and Social Science Research\" form at: http://orrp.osu.edu/irb/initialreview/index.cfm . Questions regarding th is form should be directed to exemptinfo@osu.edu or Phone (614) Rules governing the Department's Master's Degree Programs are outlined in the Graduate School Handbook . The FST graduate program does not have a foreign language requirement. Specific conditions are stated below. A. Program of Study The student must have an advisor and an Advisory Committee. The Advisory Committee typically consists of 3 members of the graduate faculty, including the advisor. At least one of these committee members must be a full (not adjunct or courtesy) member of the Food Science and Techn ology department. Once the student and his/her advisor agree on a list of courses, the student will meet with his/her Advisory Committee to discuss and approve the course outline. This is also a good opportunity to discuss research plans with the committe e. This course plan must be approved by the student's Advisory Committee and submitted to the Graduate Studies Coordinator before the end of the first term of enrollment . Please, use the Course Plan form at the end of this handout. Students from non -tradit ional backgrounds can propose alternative course plans that vary from A through E below, and these are subject to approval by the Graduate Studies Committee. There are two options for the M.S. degree: M.S. Thesis and M.S. Non-thesis. Most students, and all students receiving a stipend or fellowship, pursue the M.S. Thesis degree. Other students, including part -time students, may choose to pursue an M.S. Non - thesis degree, which is a terminal degree and cannot be followed up with a Ph.D. degree. M.S. Th esis Students in the M.S. thesis program must take a minimum of 1 2 semester course credit hours in the Food Science and Technology Department, a minimum of 20 semester course credit hours at The Ohio State University, and a minimum of 30 total semester cre dits (including FST 7999 Thesis R esearch). Any credits taken under the quarter system are multiplied by 2/3 to calculate the number of credits under the semester system. Courses from FST must be 5000 level or above, and courses from other fields should b e 4000 level or above to receive graduate course credit. Students must register for the 10XX section of those courses for them to count towards graduate course credit. Sections identified with a 00XX number are undergraduate level only. In addition, a minimum of 4 credit hours should be 6000 level and above with at least 2 of those being from FST. FST 7193/ 8193 (individual studies), and 7 999/8999 (research credits) do not count toward the course credit requirement s. English as a second language courses (any courses in EDUTL) do not count toward the graduate course credit requirement. All students who plan to obtain a graduate degree from our Food Science and Technology graduate program must achieve a minimum competency in the following 5 categories. Thi s competency can be achieved by a passing grade (B or higher) in at least one course from each of the following 5 categories, or is demonstrated by equivalent knowledge acquired from other sources such as: a similar course completed elsewhere, demonstrated proficiency, or real world practical experiences. The equivalence must be indicated in the course plan by the student 's advisor and approved by the Advisory Committee . Courses listed below with no prefix are in the 7/13 FST GSC /MMG /CGD 14 Food Science and Technology department . Courses below the 4000 level do not receive graduate credit but can add competency. A. Chemistry: 5600, FST 8991 Seminar twice: once in the Autumn semester and once in the Spring s emester. Students should take the autumn seminar their first autumn, and the spring seminar their second spring. Students will be presenting their research data during the spring seminar . It is highly recommended that all student s take a statistics course. Once the student and his/her advisor have agreed upon a list of courses, the stud ent will meet with his/her Advisory committee to discuss and approve the course outline. This meeting must take place during the first term of enrollment. The course plan form (found at the end of this handout) will be approved by the Advisory committee a nd submitted to the Academic Program Coordinator. M.S. Non -thesis Students in the M.S. Non -thesis program must take a minimum of 14 semester course credit hours in the Food Science and Technology department, a minimum of 26 semester course credit hours at The Ohio State University, and a minimum of 30 total credit hours. Included in the 30 total credit hours are 4 credit hours of independent study, FST 7193 . Any credits taken under the quarter system are multiplied by 2/3 to calculate the number of credits under the semester system. Courses from FST must be 5000 level or above, and courses from other fields should be 4000 level or above to receive graduate course credit. Students must register for the 10XX section of those courses for them to cou nt towards graduate course credit. Sections identified with a 00XX number are undergraduate level only. In addition, a minimum of 4 credit hours should be 6000 level and above with at least 2 of those being from FST. English as a second language courses (any courses in EDUTL) do not count toward the course credits . FST 7193/8193 (independent studies) and 7999/ 8999 (research credits) do not count toward the course credits. M.S. Non -thesis students may not receive a graduate stipend or fellowship. All s tudents who plan to obtain a graduate degree from our Food Science and Technology graduate program must achieve a minimum competency in the following 5 categories. This competency can be achieved by a passing grade (B or higher) in at least one course from each of the following 5 categories, or is demonstrated by equivalent knowledge acquired from other sources such as: a similar course completed elsewhere, demonstrated proficiency, or real world practical experiences. The equivalence must be indicated in t he course plan by the student's advisor and approved by the Advisory Committee . Courses listed below with no prefix are in the Food Science and Technology department. Courses below the 4000 level do not receive graduate credit but can add competency. 7/13 FST GSC /MMG FST 8991 Seminar twice: once in the Autumn semester and once in the Spring semester. Students should take the autumn seminar their first autumn, and the spring seminar their second spring. Students will be presenting original research d ata (their own data when possible) during the spring s eminar . It is highly recommended that every student take a statistics course. Once the student and his/her advisor have agreed upon a list of courses, the student will meet with his/her Advisory commi ttee to discuss and approve the course outline. This meeting must take place during the first term of enrollment. The course plan form (found at the end of this handout) will be approved by the Advisory committee and submitted to the Academic Program Coor dinator. Students from non -traditional backgrounds can propose alternative course plans that vary from A through E above, subject to approval by the Graduate Studies Committee. B. Plans, Requirements, Time Limit. As indicated above, the Department offer s the M.S. Thesis and M.S. Non -thesis, for which a minimum of 30 semester credit hours are required. Normally, students pursuing M.S. Thesis can expect to take 40 -60 credit hours of research in addition to the required hours of course work. There are no t eaching or internship requirements for this Department's graduate students. However, to the extent possible, students who have GRA appointments are expected to assist with teaching for at least one semester per year. Graduate students who wish to transfe r to this Department from other institutions must complete 80% of their credits at The Ohio State University. All students must register for at least 3 credit hours during the semester of graduation. If credits are being transferred from another univers ity to count toward a graduate degree, they should be transferred at the time the student is admitted but no later than the end of the second term of enrollment in the Graduate School. The overall time limit for acquiring a M.S. Degree in Food Science and Technology is five (5) years. C. Master's Examination and Thesis. The term you expect to graduate you will need to submit an Application to Graduate to the Graduate School , signed by your advisor and the Graduate Studies Committee Chair, no later 7/13 FST GSC /MMG /CGD 16 than the third Friday of that term . Students will need to update the copy of th eir approved course plan and get their advis or's signature indicating that the course plan was completed i n order to get the GSC chair 's signature on the Application to Graduate. The Examination Committee for the M.S. degree in Food Science and Technology consists of at least three faculty members, including th e candidate's advisor. Normally the student's Advisory Committee constitutes the Examination Committee. Changes in the Examination Committee may be made upon request from the student, advisor, or members of the Graduate Studies Committee and with the app roval of the Graduate Studies Committee. The student must submit a copy of their thesis to their committee, either electronically or printed, and announce their public exit seminar a minimum of 7 days before their defense. M.S.-Thesis The M.S. thesis e xamination begins with a research presentation . The presentation should be announced at least 7 days in advance and will be open to the public. The presentation lasts a maximum of 45 minutes and includes a 20 -35 minute presentation followed by a maximum o f 10 minutes of questions. The exam continues with a closed -door examination by the student's committee , lasting 60-90 minutes . The start of the presentation to the end of the examination is two hours. The committee is required to attend the entire exam, including the presentation . The closed -door portion of the exam includes a defense of the thesis and general subject matter examination. The subject matter portion covers principles of food science and/or nutrition, which should be familiar to the candi date from course work. M.S. Non -Thesis The M.S. non -thesis examination consists of a four -hour written section and an oral examination, including a public presentation . The written portion is designed to test the student's knowledg e of food science and o ther subject matter when a substantial portion of the student's program has consisted of outside courses. The questions are submitted by faculty members to the student's advisor, who prepares and administers the examination. The student's answers are eval uated individually by the faculty members who have submitted the questions and overall by the Examination Committee. The M.S. non -thesis examination begins with a presentation . The presentation can be on the research project or a literature review, shoul d be announced at least 7 days in advance , and will be open to the public. The presentation lasts a maximum of 45 minutes and includes a 20 -35 minute presentation followed by a maximum of 10 minutes of questions. The exam continues with a closed -door exam ination by the student's committee of no less than 1 hour. The start of the presentation to the end of the examination is two hours. The committee is required to attend the entire exam, including the presentation . The closed -door portion of the exam incl udes a defense of the student's individual study project review. A typewritten synopsis of the project, with premise, objectives, procedures, and results, must be submitted to the members of the Examination Committee 7 days prior to the scheduled examinat ion date. The remainder of the oral examination is devoted to subject matter for clarification and supplementation of answers to the written questions. 7/13 FST GSC /MMG /CGD 17 Other rules of the Department with respect to the M.S. examination and the thesis, including judgment and decisions on the student's performance, are covered in the Graduate School Handbook . XI. DOCTORAL DEGREE PROGRAMS The rules outlined in the Graduate School Handbook apply specifically to the Department's Doctorate Degree programs. Selected rules and conditions are highlighted as follows: A. Program of Study The Food Science and Technology Department offers programs leading to the Doctoral Degree. Students entering the Ph.D. program are expected to hold an M.S. Degree; however, direct admission to the Ph.D., and transfer from the M.S. program without completing the M.S. , may occur with permission of the Graduate Studies Committee. The petition from the advisor must include the advisor's recommendation and proof of research experience. The current GPA of the student must be over 3. 5. The stud ent should have been enrolled in the OSU FST M.S. program for less than a year to transfer into the Ph.D. program. Students entering the Ph.D. program without an M.S. degree are expected to complete the course and total credit requirements for both an M.S . and Ph.D. in FST at OSU. The student will select a program of courses early in his/her career in consultation with his/her advisor. This course plan should use the format found at the end of this handbook and must be approved by the student's Advisory Committee and submitted to t he Academic Program Coordinator before the end of the first term of enrollment . The course plan should identify probable dates for proposal, candidacy, and final oral examinations. The advisory committee consists of 4 members of the graduate faculty. At least one of these committee members must be a full (not adjunct or courtesy) member of the Food Science and Technology department. The Department does not have language or internship requirements for graduate students. However, Ph.D. students must participate in the laboratory instruction program at least twice before graduation; see the section on teaching. Students are allowed to pursue internship opportunities with preapproval; see the section on internships. Doctoral Degree Course Requirements Students in our doctorate program must take at least 80 total semester credits at OSU, which includes 8999 (research) credits, or 50 total credits if they have transferred credit for their M.S. Students entering the Ph.D. program with an M.S. from another university can request that 30 credit hours from their M.S. program be counted toward the 80 semester hours needed for the Ph.D. This request should be made during the first term of attendance at OSU but must be made before the end of the second term. 7/13 FST GSC /MMG /CGD 18 Ph.D. students are required to take at least 20 semester course credits at OSU beyond their M.S. degree, and at least 12 of these must be in FST a t OSU. Any credits taken under the quarter system are multiplied by 2/3 to calculate the number of credits under the semester system. FST 7193/8193 (independent studies), and 7999/8999 (research credits) do not count toward course credits. English as a second language courses (any courses in EDUTL) do not count toward the course credits . Students must meet the same minimum competencies as an M.S. student. See the M.S. competency requirements for the 5 categories. In addition, Ph.D. students are requi red to achieve a passing grade (B or higher) in at least 8 credits fro m 6000 and 7000 level courses. At least 4 of these credits must be in the FST department. It should be noted that the 7000 level courses are not intended to fulfill the minimum compete ncy requirements for the M.S. degree. Seminars do not count toward the required 6000 and 7000 level course credits. Each student must take FST 8991 Seminar twice: once in the Spring Semester and once in the Autumn Semester. Students should take the autumn seminar their first autumn, and the spring seminar their second or later spring. Students will be presenting their research data during the spring seminar. Courses taken during the M.S. degree can be used to count toward the requirements for 6000 and 700 0 level courses but not toward the seminar courses. B. Required Teaching Experience All students graduating with a Ph.D. are expected to have teaching experience and be prepared for a possible teaching career. Students in our doctoral program are requ ired to have participated in the departmental teaching training program at least twice before graduation. Students in this training will work closely with a faculty instructor responsible for teaching a class and participate in teaching activities as requ ired by that particular course and instructor. Students on assistantships or other departmental funding are required to participate in the teaching training program annually, and those experiences count toward the minimum two that are required. Students not receiving any funding and graduating in 2013 are exempt from this requirement, but are strongly encouraged to participate if they plan on a teaching career. C. Proposal Defense Doctoral student must prepare a research proposal which will be defended before the student's Advisory Committee. The proposal must be received by the committee a minimum of one week before the exam. The proposal should focus on proposed future research and cann ot include completed research, except as preliminary results. We recommend using the format of the OARDC SEEDS proposals ( Graduate Research Competition OARDC SEEDS Grant Program ) as a guideline, but other formats can be acceptable as long as the focus is on future work. After the proposal is defended before the Advisory Committee, a Graduate Student Approval o f the Research Proposal Form must be signed and turned into the Academic Prog ram Coordinator; a copy of this form can be found at the end of this handbook. The proposal defense must be completed within 2 years of the start of the Ph.D. program and prior to scheduling the Candidacy Examination. 7/13 FST GSC /MMG /CGD 19 D. Candidacy Examination Students in our Ph.D. program should complete the Candidacy Examination once they have completed all of their classes. The proposal defense must be completed before the candidacy exam is scheduled. The candidacy exam cannot be attempted less than a year and a ha lf after entry into the graduate program, unless a petition to the graduate studies committee is approved. The objective of the Candidacy Examination is to test students' knowledge in the food science and technology field and their ability to integrate and apply this knowledge. Students are encouraged to form study groups to prepare for the examination. The Candidacy Examination consists of a written and oral portion. The written exam will be administered by the Examination committee, often (but not n ecessarily) the same as the Advisory committee. The student's candidacy Examination committee oversees the entire exam, and the composition of the candidacy Examination committee should not change between the written and oral portions of the exam. Every Examination Committee member will submit questions and grade them. The exam can be closed book (6 -8 hrs) or open book (up to 3 days). The student's answers to all questions will be photocopied and distributed to the Candidacy Examination Committee for e valuation. If, based on evaluating the written portion, the Examination Committee members see no possibility for a satisfactory overall performance on the Candidacy Examination the student may waive the right to take the oral portion. The Examination Committee may not, however, deny a student the opportunity to take the oral portion. If the student decides to waive the right to take the oral portion, a written statement requesting the waiver (II.6.9.7.3) must be presented to the Advisory Committee. I n such a case, the Examination Committee records an \"Unsatisfactory\" on the Candidacy Examination Report form and returns it to the Graduate School along with a copy of the student's waiver request. The oral portion of the exam will be administered by th e Examination committee and will typically last 2 hours. The oral exam will be related to the questions in the written exam but not limited to them. The student should NOT prepare any type of presentation for the exam. The oral portion of the examinatio n must be completed within one month after completion of the written portion of the examination. The candidacy exam tests for a basic understanding of food science and the ability to critically analyze complex problems related to food. Therefore, the st udent should have a thorough understanding of food chemistry, microbiology, and engineering. At minimum, the student should have successfully completed core food science courses and should be able to effectively address candidacy exam questions relevant t o these courses. The candidacy exam also tests the student's understanding of a particular specialization within the food science discipline. Familiarity with theories, research methods, and data analysis and interpretation, within the student's specializa tion, is essential for passing the candidacy exam. 7/13 FST GSC /MMG /CGD 20 If the candidacy exam is considered unsatisfactory, the Examination committee will provide feedback on ways to improve performance (for example, recommend additional work or classes). The student is allow ed to take the candidacy exam for a second time with participation of a graduate school representative on the oral examination. In accordance with Graduate School rules, the student will be given one copy of the examination and will type the answers for th e Graduate School Representative. Chemical and mathematical equations and diagrams may be handwritten. The student's advisor will ensure versions of the written exam are consistent with the original handwritten version. Graduate students must obtain the ir advisor's signature on their course plan indicating that the required classes have been taken and submit the signature to the Academic Program Coordinator. This must happen before the candidacy exam is scheduled. E. Candidacy The Department's requi rements for candidacy for the Ph.D. degree, including time limits and readmission for candidacy are listed in the Graduate School Handbook . F. Dissertation The student's advisor a nd Dissertation Advisory committee must approve the subject of the dissertation research. Other Departmental rules governing the dissertation, including committee selection, draft approval, format, and approval and submission of the final copy are outline d in the Graduate School Handbook . G. Final Oral Examination During the term you expect to graduate , you will need to submit an Application to Graduate - Doctoral to the Graduate School , signed by your advisor and the Graduate Studies Committee Chair , no later than the third Friday of that term . Students will need to update the copy of th eir approved course plan form and get their advis or's signature indicating that the course plan was completed i n order to get the GSC chair signature on the Application to Graduate. The student must submit a copy of the ir dissertation to their committee , either electronically or printed, a minimum of 3 weeks before their defense. In addition, the dissertation must be given to the committee a minimum of 1 week before the committee is asked to sign the Doctoral Draft Appr oval/ Notification of Final Oral Examination form. The final oral examination begins with a research presentation . The research presentation should be announced at least 7 days in advance and will be open to the public. The presentation lasts a maximum of 45 minutes and includes a 20 -35 minute presentation followed by a maximum of 10 minutes of questions. The exam continues with a closed -door examination by the student's committee , lasting 60-90 minutes . The start of the presentation to the end of the examination is 7/13 FST GSC /MMG /CGD 21 two hours. The committee, including the graduate school representative, is required to attend the entire exam, which includ es the presentation . The closed -door portion of the exam tests the student on originality, independe nce of thought, and ability to synthesize and interpret information. This examination is based on, but not limited to, the student's dissertation. Other rules pertaining to the Final Oral Examination, including selection of the Examination Committee, act ion by the Graduate School Representative, postponement, and the decision with respect to the student's performance and repeat of the examination, are stated in the Graduate School H andbook . XII. GRADUATE ASSOCIATES A. Graduate Associate (GA) Responsibilities Graduate Associates in the Department have both teaching and research responsibilities. The GA (GTA or GRA) assists in teaching b y helping with preparation for courses, grading, and conducting of laboratory experiments. The level of responsibility given to the GA depends on his/her level of experience. The GA assists in research by performing work as assigned by the faculty member in charge of the project. This faculty member also usually serves as the student's advisor. The commitment is 20 hours per week, 52 weeks a year, excluding federal holidays. The research performed may or may not be part of the student's thesis. In ad dition to their research and teaching responsibilities, GAs are expected to take classes toward their degree. See the section on course requirements. Performance evaluations of GAs are made by the major advisor and reported to the Department Chair. Th e evaluations are used in determining annual stipend increases. B. Eligibility Requirements A student must be registered for 18 credit hours in order to be eligible to be a GA. Students are only paid as a GA if they are registered for 18 credit hours. Normally, to be eligible for a GA appointment, a student must pursue a graduate degree in a Departmental program. Students pursuing a graduate degree in other OSU departmental programs may be considered when positions cannot be filled from within the Dep artment due to a lack of students or a specific expertise among the students. If a student's GPA falls below 3.0, any department assistantship will end immediately, including the tuition payment. 7/13 FST GSC /MMG /CGD 22 Graduate students admitted conditionally are not eligible for GA appointments until they achieve or are nearly achieving Regular status. Other rules of GA appointment eligibility are listed in the Graduate School Handbook . C. Terms of App ointment The majority of GA appointments are for three terms. Appointments for less than a year or less than 50% are not allowed except by petition to the Graduate Studies Committee and Graduate School. Offers of appointment and reappointment are made i n writing at the beginning of every autumn semester or as early as possible prior to the start of the appointment. The offer shall include a statement of the general responsibilities associated with the appointment. D. Stipends Stipends for new and renewed GAs in the Department are determined according to the University's annually established levels. Instruction and general fees and non -resident fees, when applicable, are authorized by the department or University for all GAs on at least a 50% appointment, for the duration of the appointment. E. Other Forms of Financial Support, Including Outside Jobs. All graduate students on a 0.50 FTE or higher paid appointment (GRA, GTA, or Fellowship) may not have any other employment. Exceptions are by advisor petition to the Graduate Studies Committee. Exceptions for Fellows also require Graduate School approval. International students should check with the Office of International Education to determine their eligibility. Fellowships for qualified applicants are available from the Ohio Agricultural Research & Development Center (OARDC) and the OSU Graduate School. Occasionally, the Department has a need for graduate students to perform part -time service anywhere from one week to a few months. Students who are not appointed as GAs are offered the opportunity to fill this need at an hourly pay -rate equivalent to the minimum GA stipend, however these assignments do not provide fee authorizations. F. Criteria for Reappointment or Termination of GA The Department's criteria for reappointment or termination of GAs are listed in the Graduate School Handbook . G. Grievance Procedures Grievance procedures are handled as s tated in the Graduate School Handbook . 7/13 FST GSC /MMG /CGD 23 H. Benefits Benefits for GAs in the Department are listed in the Graduate School Handbook . Specifically, with respect to Time Off, GAs who have been assigned to assist with laboratory classes are expected to report to the Instructor in charge one week before the beginning of the semester. GAs who are appointed to re search assignments are expected to work during the semester breaks. Such GAs are entitled to 10 working days of Time Off following one full year of service. Time Off cannot be accrued. XIII. DESK ASSIGNMENTS The Graduate Studies Committee assigns students to desks in the common areas of 266 Parker and 48 Howlett. The desks in 220, 230, 240, 320, 330, 340 Parker and 48, 59D, 144A Howlett will be assigned by priority to the professors proxim ate to the lab. However, if any of the desks, including half circle desks, in any given semester are not assigned to a full time graduate student pursuing a degree in the D epartment, these desks can be reassigned. The relevant professor will be notified b efore the assignment is made so that they have the option of first rearranging their other students. Once that student is assigned, they should not be asked to move until they graduate, unless the student requests another desk. XIV. OUTSTANDING TEACHING ASSISTANT AWARD Objectives: To motivate and encourage graduate students to contribute to our excellent teaching program for our students. To provide graduate students the teaching opportunity experience and the advantages of award recognition for obtaining academic faculty positions after their graduate study. Selection Criteria: Graduate students assisting with laboratory instruction should be nominated and evaluated by students for the award. There will be two categories of recognition: (1 ) the Departmental Teaching Award with an individual plaque, name on the Departmental Award Display Plaque, and cash award of $500; and (2) the Teaching Award of Merit. The Departmental Teaching Award will be given to student(s) with 80% of the students r ating them in the top 25% and 70% of the students voting \"yes\" to the candidate who deserves the award. The Teaching Award of Merit will be given to all students with 70% of the students rating them in the top 25%, and 60% of the students voting \"yes\" to the candidate who deserves the award. 7/13 FST GSC /MMG /CGD 24 Evaluation Sheet: (1) TAs at the University: Top 5%, Top 25% Top 50% Below 50% (2) Should the nominee receive award? Yes ? No A student can receive a maximum of two teaching awards during their entir e graduate study. Nominations should be submitted to the Chair, Graduate Student Teaching Award Committee.
