Honors are distinguished as follows: *** summa cum laude\u2014students in the top 2.5 percent ** magna cum laude\u2014students in the top 5 percent but not in the top 2.5 percent * cum laude\u2014students in the top 10 percent but not in the top 5 percent The asterisk (*) appears as indicated above next to th e name of each graduate who may qualify for Baccalaureate Honors. Because records for the final term are incomplete at the time the commencement program is printed and final term grades may affect relative rankings and overall GPA, indication in the program of graduation with Honors is presumptive rather than conclusive.

The presence of a piper in American academic pr ocessionals has become popular in recent ye ars. The pipers for UCF's ceremonies are David Enzfelder and Reg Lyle. The procedure followed for the awarding of degrees is based on a practice developed at the Univ ersity of Paris almost 800 years ago. In those days, the bishop of Paris, like every other bishop, was responsible for local educational curriculum and degree granting. His authority in these matters, however, soon came to be disputed by the teachers. They asserted that only they could be the proper judges of th e qualifications of the students. This threatened impa sse was resolved by a compromise under which the teachers, or masters, judged the merits of the students and then recommended them to the bishop for their degrees. Today's cer emony includes a secularized version of that procedure. A rep resentative of the Faculty Senate certifies that the stude nt candidates are qualified to receive thei r degrees. The presiden t then authorizes the awarding of the degree . Academic heraldry in the form of academic dress reaches as far back as the earliest days of the oldest universities. Formal directives concerning the correct and prope r wearing of academic regalia date back to the early 14th Century. In the United States , as a result of our English heritage, caps and gowns have been used since colonial times. As heraldic devices such as shie lds, coats of arms, and standards could identify a knight and his indi vidual heritage, academic regalia can describe the academic origin and accomp lishments of the wearer. Eas ily recognizable are holders of bachelor's, master's, an d doctoral degrees. With the same glance, the trained eye may identify the university that conferred the degree as well as the individual' s field of learning. The shape and decorations of the gown are the keys to the highest degree earned by an individual. The gown for bachelor's has long pointed sleeves and is designed to be worn closed only. The master's gown has an obl ong sleeve and is open at the wrist; the re ar part of its oblong shape is square cut, and the front part has an arc cut away. The master's gown may be worn open or closed. The doctor's gown has bell- shaped sleeves, may be worn open or closed, and may be most readily identified by its velvet facing down the front and by three velvet chevrons on each sleeve. It is the hood, however, which is the most important and distinctive feature of American academic pagean try. Chevrons enable those attending an academic function to distinguish at a glance the wearer 's academic heritage. The bachel or's hood, seldom seen in A merican academic circles, is three feet long with a two-inch edging of velvet. The master's hood is three and one-half feet long with a three-inch edging. The doctor's hood is four feet long with a five-inch edging. The color of the hood's velvet edging represen ts the field in which the wearer earned his or her degree. Although black may be used for any area, colors denoting selected fields of learning are as fo llows at UCF and American universities: all Ph.D.s are edged in dark blue, while professional doctorates, such as the Ed.D., are edged in the color of professional discipline. The hoods used by Americ an colleges and univers ities are lined with silk in the official academic colors of the institution that conferred the degree. UCF graduates, for example, w ill wear hoods with linings of black and gold. Generally, a school's academic colors a re identical to its athletic colors. The academic regalia you see before you today can be traced directly back to the beginnings of the oldest colleges and universities. In 1885, there occurred a widespread student movement in America to wear caps and gowns at commence ment ceremonies. The graduating students seemed to feel a need for significant and dignified apparel for the occasion. By 1895, widespread adoption of a uniform code by 95 percent of colleges and universities in the country gave America its own distinct academic regalia. However, at any academic gathering, there usually appear regalia which cannot be fathomed by these guidelines. Some of these ma y be from foreign universities; others are from those American institutions that have preferred to remain with the European tradition of allowing each school to determine its own costume. The result is the academic regalia you see before you today.

Pineapple Inclusive Education Services In Fall 2015, UCF further embraced its commitment to inclusion and diversity through Inclusive Education Services (IES). IES offers a non-degree, vocational preparation and college experience for students with intellectual disabilities. UCF is pleased to be one of approximately 16 similar college programs in the state of Florida and an estimated 265 college experiences nationally. IES is a unit within the Division of Student Development and Enrollment Services and operates in partnership with the College of Community Innovation and Education. Upon successful completion of a 42-unit curriculum spanning 2.5 years, students earn a Professional Services Credential through the Division of Continuing Education. The Continuing Education credential provides students with the opportunity to specialize in one of three concentrations: Hospitality, Early Childhood Education, and Social Services. These areas align with the highest job growth and fastest hiring industries in Central Florida based on recent employment ou tlook data. Individuals with intellectual disabilities have a history of low employment rates in our country, hovering around 17 to 18% employment based on national statistics. Experiences such as IES aim to improve this outcome. Each concentration within the Professional Services Credential includes academic courses, including courses that the students audit with degree-seeking UCF students, on-campus work experiences and a capstone community internship. At UCF, students also have the opportunity to live on campus and to participate in most student activities, opportunities and resources, such as attending football games, working out at the Recreation and Wellness Center, and participating in one of UCF's 700+ student clubs and organizations. UCF is pleased to celebrate the first group of students to complete the IES experience with recognition at the College of Community Innovation and Education ce remony. The list of students includes: Christina Arias Peter Becht Keyanna Brown Amanda Carbonneau Kayla Dollar Ana Gasparini Justin Isaac Patricia Moody Elyse Mundelein David Norvell Matthew Ortiz Sebastian Strawser Ashley Strube 88 89 The University Mace During the Middle Ages, the mace was an effective weapon in battle, but as newer and more powerful military arms developed, it was transformed into a symbol of authority. The earliest ceremonial maces we re borne by bodyguards of 12th Century English and French kings. By the end of the 16th Century, they were used widely by officials of English cities and to wns. Today, the ceremonial mace is found in the British Houses of Parliament and is frequently carried in ecclesiastical processions and in university convocations and comm encement ceremonies. The mace incorporates two symbols identifie d with the University of Central Florid a. The top is cast in the shape of the star found over the Pegasus in the UCF emblem. Inside the star is a reproduction of the \"Flame of Hope\" sculpture near the John C. Hitt Library. The mace is cast in bronze with three bronze UCF emblems in laid at the crest of the ro sewood staff. The center of the staff is engraved with the na mes of the presidents of UCF. The creation of UCF's mace was a collec tive effort by UCF art professor Jagd ish Chavda, sculptor David Cambia, and wood craftsman David Conway. The Presidential Medallion The gold medallion worn by the university president at fo rmal and ceremonial occasions marks the president as a distinguished scholar and administrator, the highest officer of the university, and one who strives to uphold the twin tenets established by its founders: Accent on the Individual and Accent on Excellence . The medallion is embossed with the university seal showing the mythical Pegasus ascending toward a single heavenly star and the motto, Reach for the Stars . The seal serves as a visible reminder to each member of the university community to strive to reach individual goals. The president has been entrusted to maintain and develop an atmosphere in which these creeds can be realized . The presidential position represented by the medallion epitomizes the foundations and aspirations of the univ ersity that the president has pledged to uphold. As the only university official who can formally award a degree, the presiden t recognizes the graduates for meeting the standards of excellence set by the university and for reaching the point from which new ventures begin. From the presentation of the first medallion in 1968 to char ter President Charles Millican to the one worn today, the Presidential Medallion has remained a symbol of academic leadership and the leg acy of those pioneers who launched a unique experiment in higher education. 90 Honorary Degrees Awarded December 1969 Kurt H.
