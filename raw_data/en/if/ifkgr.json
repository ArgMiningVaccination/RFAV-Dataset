Ronald Calley I got really impressed by Dr Mark, he has experienced and knowledge. After my first visit, I felt released .... as a \"miracle\" my lower back uncomfortable GONE! Erika M. I got slipped disc and sciatica at the same time and I was introduced to Dr. Mark. He is an amazing chiropractor I've ever seen. I had 3 months of gun treatments and now I'm healed and able to work out everyday without the pain. I would definitely recommend to see him if you are looking for a chiropractor. Yuki K. I started going to Dr Mark at the recommendation of a good friend for assistance with an injury. After that healed, I've continued seeing him regularly for more than 10 years because I find his chiropractic and ayurvedic care to be quite worthwhile. I always feel refreshed and recentered after a visit, not just realigned. Torrance, CA "}
