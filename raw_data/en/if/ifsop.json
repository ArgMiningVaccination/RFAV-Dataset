Actor Briefing Briefing generally conducted the morning of the exercise, prior to the victim actors taking their positions on the exercise field. The victim actor coordinator should lead this briefing and include the following information: exercise overview, safety, what to do in the event of an actual emergency, symptomology, acting instructions, and schedule. Identification badges and symptomology cards should be distributed before or during this briefing. If moulage is to be applied to actors, it should be completed before the briefing. Advanced Life Support Ambulance (ALS) An ambulance service capable of delivering advanced skills performed by an EMS practitioner, e.g. intravenous fluids and drug administration. Adjuvant A substance added to a vaccine to improve the immune response so that less vaccine is needed to provide protection. After Action Conference A post-exercise forum in which key personnel and the exercise planning team are presented with findings and recommendations from the After Action Report (AAR) and an Improvement Plan is developed. After Action Report (AAR) The final exercise document, produced by the exercise planning team and/or the evaluation team, describing what happened, noting any exemplary practices, identifying issues to be addressed, and providing recommendations for improvements. The AAR should be submitted to participant and/or federal officials. APHIS Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, a part of the U.S. Department of Agriculture that provides leadership in ensuring the health and care of animals and plants. Agency An administrative division of government. Agent Fact Sheet Specific information regarding the scenario agent used in an exercise (i.e. anthrax, small pox). Fact sheets might include properties, sympto ms, effects, lethality, transmissiblity, decontamination or prophylaxis methods, etc. All-Hazard Covering all possible hazards whether natural, accidental negligent or intentional. All-Hazards Preparedness Preparedness for domestic te rrorist attacks, major disasters and other emergencies. Advanced Life Support Ambulance (ALS) An ambulance service capable of delivering advanced Survey & Certification Emergency Preparedness Initiative - All Hazards EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS ACRONYM & GLOSSARY LIST - Revised 9/2008 Page 13GLOSSARY skills performed by an EMS practitioner, e.g. intravenous fluids and drug administration. Anthrax A noncontagious potentially fatal disease caused by breathing, eating, or skin contact with spores of the skin bacteria known as Bacillus anthracis. Antibiotic A substance produced by bacte ria or fungi that destroys or prevents the growth of other bacteria and fungi. Antibody A protein produced by the body's immune system in response to a foreign substance (antigen). Our bodies fight off an infection by producing antibodies. An antibody reacts specifically with the antigen that triggered its formation and its function is to inactivate the antigen. Antigen Any foreign substance, usually a protein that stimulates the body's immune system to produce antibodies. (The name antigen reflects its role in stimulating an immune response - antibody generating.) Antiviral Drug that is used to prevent or cure a disease caused by a virus, by interfering with the ability of the virus to multiply in number or spread from cell to cell. Assembly Area The gathering place for deployable resources prior to the start of many operations-based exercises. All response units are dispatched from this area, thus all personnel, organizations, and resources playing and responding to the primary incident site (where the triggering event takes place) should report to the assembly area. (Note: Participants playing at offsite locations (e.g., hospitals, Emergency Operati ons Centers [EOCs]) should report to the areas designated by their respective organizations or controllers.) Assembly Area Controller Responsible for the logistical organization of the assembly area, including placement locations for units and coordination of exiting patterns for dispatched units. Asymptomatic Presenting no symptoms of disease. Avian Flu A highly contagious viral disease with up to 100% mortality in domestic fowl caused by influenza A virus subtypes H5 and H7. All types of birds are susceptible to the virus but outbreaks occur most often in chickens and turkeys. The infection may be carried by migratory wild birds, which can carry the virus but show no signs of disease. Humans are only rarely affected. B Basic Life Support Ambulance (BLS) An ambulance service capable of delivering basic emergency interventions performed by EMS practitioners trained and credentialed to do so, e.g., splinting, bandaging, oxygen administration. Survey & Certification Emergency Preparedness Initiative - All Hazards EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS ACRONYM & GLOSSARY LIST - Revised 9/2008 Page 14GLOSSARY Best Practices Peer-validated techniques, procedures, and solutions solidly grounded in actual experience in operations, training, and exercises. (N ote: Exercise After Action Reports (AARs) should identify lessons and highlight exemplary practices. Many of these can be found on www.llis.gov, the Department of Homeland Security's lessons learned/best practices portal.) Biological Attack The deliberate release of germs or other biological substances that can cause sickness. Biological Incident A natural, accidental, negligent or deliberate exposure involving biological agents. Bio-Safety Level A system for classifying laboratory safety practices, in four levels, by degree of protection provided to personnel, the environment, and the community for laboratories dealing with infectious microorganisms. Laboratories dealing with microorganisms not known to consistently cause disease in healthy humans require no special practices and operate at Bio-Safety Level 1. Laboratories dealing with the most dangerous and exotic microorganisms that pose hi gh risk of life threatening disease require the most stringent practices to protect against contact or release of the microorganisms and operate at Bio-Safety Level 4. (Contrast with Laboratory Levels) Bioterrorism The use of a biological agent in a terrorist incident; the intentional use of microorganism or toxins derived from living organisms to produce death or disease in humans, animals, or plants. Building Block Approach A planned exercise cycle of increasing complexity, with each exercise designed to build upon the next, in terms of scale and experience. C Capability The means to accomplish one or more tasks under specific conditions and to specific performance standards. A capability may be delivered with any combination of properly planned, organized, equipped, trained, and exercised personnel that achieves the intended outcome. Carrier A person or animal that harbors a specific infectious agent without discernible clinical disease and serves as a potential source of infection. The carrier state may be of short or long duration (temporary or transient carrier or chronic carrier). Category-A Agents The biological terrorism agents having the greatest potential for adverse public health impact with mass casualties. The Category \"A\" diseases are: smallpox; anthrax; plague; botulism; tularemia; viral hemorrhagic Survey & Certification Emergency Preparedness Initiative - All Hazards EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS ACRONYM & GLOSSARY LIST - Revised 9/2008 Page 15GLOSSARY fevers (e.g., Ebola and Lassa viruses). Category-B Agents Could be used to contaminate food or water sources. Agents are more readily ava ilable, may not necessarily cause mass casualties, and their use may often be found more often in the setting of biological crime or extortion than terrorism Category-C Agent Emerging infectious diseases or agents with characteristics that could be exploited for deliberate dissemination. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) The U.S. government agency at the forefront of public health efforts to prevent and control infectious and chronic diseases, injuries, workplac e hazards, disabilities, and environmental health threats. CDC is one of 13 major operating components of the Department of Health and Human Services. CDC Type C Facility An isolation facility that meets the following requirements: a structure with non-shared air conditioning, heating, and ventilating systems that exhau sts 100% of air to the outside through HEPA filter or is located at least 100 yards from any other occupied building or area; adequate water, electricity, heating, cooling, and closed-window ventilation to maintain activities of daily living and tertiary medical care of residents; a communication system that allows for dependable communication within and outside of the facility (e.g. telephone or intercom system); ability to provide the following medical care within the facility: supportive care with iv fluids, antibiotics, etc. skin care: oxygen monitoring (pulse ox) and oxygen (in-line or portable); medical vital signs monitoring; cardiac and respiratory evaluations (blood chemistries, CBC); radiolog y (portable chest x-ray) staffing resources (to be determined by severity of illness) A Type C facility is appropriate for confirmed, probable, and suspected smallpox cases. CDC Type R Facility (R = residential) may be the person's own home. A Type R facility is appropriate for asymptomatic contacts (not infectious). CDC Type X Facility Meets the same isolation and general supply requirements as a Type C Facility. However, Type X Facilities need to supply only basic medical care functions such as monitoring vital signs. Chemical Agent A chemical substance that produces incapacitation, serious injury or death. Chemical Attack The deliberate release of a toxic gas, liquid, or solid that can poison people and the environment. Survey & Certification Emergency Preparedness Initiative - All Hazards EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS ACRONYM & GLOSSARY LIST - Revised 9/2008 Page 16GLOSSARY Chemical Incident An accidental or deliberate exposure involving chemical agents. Chemical Terrorism The use of a chemical agent in a terrorist incident to intentionally inflict harm upon others. Clade A group of organisms, such as a species, whose members share homologous features derived from a common ancestor. The avian virus H5N1 clade 1 includes human and bird isolates from Vietnam, Thailand, Cambodia, Laos, and Malaysia. Clade 2 viruses have been identified in bird isolates from China, Indonesia, Japan, and South Korea. Communicable Disease An illness due to a specific infectious agent or to toxic products that arises through transmission of that agent or its products from an infected person or animal to a susceptible host. (Contrast with infectious disease). Communications The system by which the message is communicated. Concept and Objectives Meeting (C&O Meeting) Initial exercise planning meeting used to identify, or agree upon an already identified, the type, scope, objectives, and purpose of the exercise. Typically attended by the sponsoring agency, lead exercise planner, and senior officials. Contagious A contagious disease is easily spread from one person to another by contact with the infectious agent that causes the disease. The agent may be in droplets of liquid particles made by coughing or sneezing, contaminated food utensils, water or food. Contextual Injects A scenario element, from the Master Scenario Events List (MSEL), introduced to a player by a controller to help build the contemporary operating environment. Injects should drive players towards the achievement of exercise objectives. If, for example, the exercise objectives include information sharing, a contextual inject could call for one actor to portray a suspect, and another to approach a law enforcement officer/participant and inform him/her of the suspicious behavior. Contingency Injects A scenario element, from the Master Scenario Events List (MSEL), used to generate specific and necessary player action when players themselves have failed to take said action. If, for example, a simulated secondary device is placed at an incident scene but not discovered, a controller would use a contingency inject by prompting an actor to approach a player/responder and report suspicious activity close to the device location. This should prompt the discovery of the device by the player/responder, and result in subsequent notification of law enforcement (i.e., the bomb squad). Survey & Certification Emergency Preparedness Initiative - All Hazards EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS ACRONYM & GLOSSARY LIST - Revised 9/2008 Page 17GLOSSARY Contingency Plan Targets a specific issue or event that arises during the course of disaster operations and presents alternative actions to respond to the situation. Continuity of Operations Plan (COOP) An effective COOP includes the activities of individual departments and agencies, and their subcompartments to ensure that their essential functions are performed. COOP activities include: Plans and procedures to ensure that essential functions are performed, Tests, training and exercises essential for ensuring a viable COOP capability. Controller and Evaluator Briefing A pre-exercise overview given to controllers and evaluators, generally co nducted the day before an operations-based exercise. Generally 1-2 hours, the briefing covers the exercise purpose, scenario, location, schedule of events, control concept, controller and evaluator res ponsibilities. Controller and Evaluator Debrief A forum, conducted by the planning team and/or the evaluation team, for functional area controllers and evaluators to review and provide feedback on the exercise. Through facilitated discussion controllers and evaluators discuss the strengths and weaknesses of the functional area they observed. During the debrief, controllers and evaluators should complete and submit their Exercise Evaluation Guides (EEGs) and feedback forms, the results of which w ill be captured for inclusion in the After Action Report (AAR). Controller and Evaluator Handbook (C/E Handbook) An exercise overview and instructional manual for controllers and evaluators. The C/E Handbook supplements the Exercise Plan (EXPLAN), an overview given to players, contains more detailed information about the scenario, and describes controllers' and evaluators' roles and responsibilities. Because the C/E Handbook contains information on the scenario and exercise administration, it should be distributed only to those individuals specifically designated as controllers or evaluators. Larger, more complex exercises may use Control Staff Instructions (COSIN) and an Evaluation Pl an (EVALPLAN) in place of, or to supplement, the C/E Handbook. Controllers Planners and managers of operations-based exercise play who set up and operate the exercise incident site, and possibly take the roles of response individuals and agencies not actually partic ipating in the exercise. Controllers give key data to players and may prompt or initiate certain player actions (as listed in the Master Survey & Certification Emergency Preparedness Initiative - All Hazards EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS ACRONYM & GLOSSARY LIST - Revised 9/2008 Page 18GLOSSARY Scenario Events List (MSEL) to ensure that objectives are met and the exercise maintains continuity. Controllers are the only participants who should provide information or direction to players. All controllers should be accountable to one senior controller. (Note: If conducti ng an exercise requires more controllers or evaluators than are available, a controller may serve as an evaluator; however, this typically is discouraged.) Counterterrorism The full range of activities directed against terrorism, including preventive, deterrent, response and crisis management efforts. Critical Infrastructure Protection Actions taken to reduce the lik elihood of attack on assets or systems and limit the impact should an attack occur reducing the vulnerability of critical infrastructure/key resources (CI/KR) in order to deter, mitigate, or neutralize terrorist attacks. Critical infrastructure protection includes the activities that identify CI/KR, assess vulnerabilities, prioritize CI/KR, and develop protective programs and measures, because these activities ultimately lead to the implementation of protective strategies to reduce vulnerability. Counterterrorism The full range of activities directed against terrorism, including preventive, deterrent, response and crisis management efforts. D Debrief A forum for planners, facilitators, controllers, and evaluators to review and provide feedback on the exercise. It should be a facilitated discussion that allows each person an opportunity to provide an overview of the functional area they observed and document both strengths and areas for improvement. The debrief should be facilitated by the Lead Exercise Planner or the Exercise Director; results should be captured for inclusion in the After Action Report (AAR). (Note: Other sessions, such as a separate debrief for hospitals (during an operations-based exercise), may be held as necessary.) U.S. Department of Interior (DOI) The government agency that protects and provides access to our Nation's natural resources. Decontamination The process of making people, objects, or areas safe by absorbing, destroying, neutra lizing, making harmless, or removing chemical, biological, or radiological material. Design and Development Stage A stage in the exercise process, proceeding Foundation and preceding Conduct. The design and development stage focuses on identifying objectives, designing the Survey & Certification Emergency Preparedness Initiative - All Hazards EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS ACRONYM & GLOSSARY LIST - Revised 9/2008 Page 19GLOSSARY scenario, creating documentati on, coordinating logistics, planning exercise conduct, and selecting an evaluation and improvement methodology. Direct Exercise Support Requested monies provided to States and local jurisdictions by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) for exercise pla nning and conduct under the Homeland Security Exercise and Evaluation Program (HSEEP). (Note: States and local jurisdictions may use direct support money to pay for contractor assistance in both exercise planning and conduct). Dirty Bomb The use of common explosives to spread radioactive materials over a targeted area. Also known as a radiation attack, a \"dirty bomb\" is not a nuclear blast, but rather an explosion with localized ra dioactive contamination. Disaster, major (Federal) \"Major disaster\" means any natural catastrophe (including any hurricane, tornado, storm, high water, wind driven water, tidal wave, tsunami, earthquake, volcanic eruption, landslide, mudslide, snowstorm, or drought) or, regardless of cause, any fire, flood, or explosion, in any part of the United States, which in the determination of the President, causes damage of sufficient severity and magnitude to warrant major disaster assistan ce under this [Stafford] Act to supplement the efforts and available resources of States, local governments, and disaster relief organizations in alleviating the damage, loss, hardship, or suffering caused thereby. (From: Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act, as amended by Public Law 106-390, October 30, 2000, Sec. 102). Discussion-Based Exercises Exercises normally used as a starting point in the building block approach to the cycle, mix, and range of exercises. Discussion-based exerci ses include seminars, workshops, tabletop exercises (TTXs), and games. These types of exercises typi cally highlight existing plans, policies, mutual aid agreements, and procedures. Thus, they are exceptional tools for familiarizing agencies and personnel with current or expected jurisdictional capabilities. Discussion-based exercises typically focus on strategic, policy-oriented issues, and operations-based exercises tend to focus more on tactical response-related issues. Facilitators and/or presenters usually lead the discussion, keeping participants on track while meeting the objectives of the exercise. Drift One process in which influenza virus undergoes mutation. The amount of change can be subtle or dramatic, but eventually as drift occurs, a new variant strain will become Survey & Certification Emergency Preparedness Initiative - All Hazards EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS ACRONYM & GLOSSARY LIST - Revised 9/2008 Page 20GLOSSARY dominant. This process allo ws influenza viruses to change and re-infect people repeatedly through their lifetime and is the reason influenza virus strains in vaccine must be updated each year. See shift. Drills Small-scale, internally con ducted, activities aimed at providing a more \"hands-on\" teaching environment to familiarize staff with actual procedures necessary for emergency operations. They may be stopped and restarted in order to clarify a point, provide instruction, allow for observations from the evaluator and evaluatee, or to permit the evaluatee a second chance to perform a procedure or activity. E Emergency (Federal) Any occasion or instance for which, in the determination of the President, Federal assistance is needed to supplement State and local efforts and capabilities to save lives and to protect property and public health and safety, or to lessen or avert the threat of a catastrophe in any part of the United States (From: Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act, as amended by Public Law 106-390, October 30, 2000, Sec. 102). Emergency Management A systematic program of acti vities that governments and their partners undertake before, during, and after a disaster to save lives, prevent injury, and to protect property and the natural environment Emergency Operations Center (EOC) The physical location at which the coordination of information and resources to support domestic incident management activities normally takes place. Emergency Operations Plan (EOP) Plan each jurisdiction has and maintains for responding to a wide variety of potential emergency incidents. Emergency Preparedness See Preparedness. EPA U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the government agency that leads the nation's environmental science, research, education and assessment efforts. Epidemic The occurrence in a community or region of cases of an illness (or outbreak) with a frequency clearly in excess of normal expectancy. Epizootic A disease occurring suddenly in animals in a community, region or country in numbers clearly in excess of normal. See epidemic and panzootic . Evaluation Process, conducted by the planning and/or evaluation team, which captures an exerci se participant's strengths and opportunities for improvement. Under the Homeland Security Exercise and Evaluation Program (HSEEP), Survey & Certification Emergency Preparedness Initiative - All Hazards EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS ACRONYM & GLOSSARY LIST - Revised 9/2008 Page 21GLOSSARY evaluations are conducted through player observation and the use of Exercise Evaluation Guides (EEGs) which outline exercise performance measures expected from participants. Evaluator Part of the exercise team selected to evaluate and comment on the actions/decisions of players during an exercise. Evaluators use Exercise Evaluation Guides (EEGs) to measure and assess performanc e, capture unresolved issues, and analyze exercise results. They also participate in post exercise meetings and critiques. Evaluators are typically chosen based on their expertise in the functional areas they will review. They have a passive role in the exercise and only note the actions/decisions of players without interfering with exercise flow. Event A simulated or real action that takes place during an exercise. Exercise An instrument to train for, assess, practice, and improve performance in prevention, protection, vulnerability reduction, response, and recovery capabilities in a risk- free environment. Exercises can be used for: testing and validating policies, plans, procedures, training, equipment, and interagency agreements; clarifying and training personnel in roles and re sponsibilities; improving interagency coordination and communications; identifying gaps in resources; improving individual performance; and identifying opportunities for improvement. (Note: Exercises are also an excellent way to demonstrate community resolve to prepare for disastrous events.) Exercise Evaluation Guides (EEGs) Structured evaluation measures of participant conduct, which identify critical tasks to be completed in an exercise. Developed under the Homeland Security Evaluation Program (HSEEP) to enable consistency across evaluations, EEGs provide evaluators with information on what they shoul d expect to see, space to record observations, and questions to address after the exercise as a first step in the analysis process. Exercise Plan (EXPLAN) An synopsis document for oper ations-based exercises, created by the planning team for use by players and observers. In addition to detailing exercise objectives and scope, the EXPLAN identifies tasks and responsibilities for successful exercise execution. It should not contain detailed scenario information, such as the hazard to be employed. Exercise Plan Workshop (EPW) Forum for State and local leadership to review and update Survey & Certification Emergency Preparedness Initiative - All Hazards EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS ACRONYM & GLOSSARY LIST - Revised 9/2008 Page 22GLOSSARY their Multi-year Exercise Plan and schedule.

Exercise Planning Team Parties responsible for designing, developing, conducting, and evaluating all aspects of an exercise (often members of major participating organizations). The planning team determines exercise design objectives, tailors the scenario to jurisdictional needs, and develops documents used in exercise evaluation, control, and simulation. Planning team members also help with developing and distributing pre-exercise materials and conducting exercise briefings and training sessions. (Note: Due to this high level of involvement, planning team members are ideal selections for controller and evaluator positions during the exercise itself.) Exercise Planning Timeline A key document, produced by the planning team, which identifies key planning meeting dates, milestones, and critical tasks. (Note: Changes in the timeline should be approved by the Lead Exercise Planner.) Exercise Play Rules Parameters exercise participants will follow, describing appropriate exercise behavior, particularly in the case of real emergencies. Exercise Project Management Tool A web-based project management tool and comprehensive tutorial for the design, development, conduct and evaluation of exerci ses. The exercise project management tool is the backbone of a larger suite of tools, called the HSEEP Toolkit, which includes document builders for Master Scenario Events Lists and After Action Reports, as well as an Improvement Plan tracking tool. Exercise Series Multiple exercises designed in sequence using the building block approach, aimed at achieving a greater capability (e.g., a seminar which leads to a tabletop, which leads to a functional (command post). Expected Action Events Activities exercise controll ers expect participants to engage in as a result of the scenario and/or scenario injects. e.g., during a full-scale exercise involving a chemical agent, the establishment of decontamination is an expected action. F Facilitated Discussion Group discussions arranged by functional area expertise, directed by a subject matter expert from said functional area. This facilitator is responsible for keeping the Survey & Certification Emergency Preparedness Initiative - All Hazards EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS ACRONYM & GLOSSARY LIST - Revised 9/2008 Page 23GLOSSARY discussion on track with exercise objectives and making sure all issues (driven by exercise objectives) are explored. Facilitator Part of the exercise management team responsible for guiding participant play. During discussion-based exercises, the facilitator is responsible for keeping participant discussions on trac k with the exercise design objectives, making sure all issues and objectives are explored as thoroughly as possible under time constraints. FAO Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations leads international efforts to defeat hunger. FAO serves both developed and developing countries and acts as a neutral forum where all nations meet as equals to negotiate agreements and debate policy. Final Planning Conference (FPC) The final forum for the exercise planning team to review process and procedures for conducting their exercise, final drafts of all exercise materials, and all logistical requirements. There should be no major changes made to either the design or the scope of the exercise or to any supporting documentation at this time. First Responder Individuals who, in the early stages of an incident, are responsible for the protection and preservation of life, property, evidence, and the environment. First responders include emergency response providers, as well as emergency management, public health, clinical care, public works, and other skilled support personnel (such as equipment operators ) that provide immediate support services during prevention, response, and recovery operations. Focus See Mission.

The Foundation stage focuses on developing a project management timeline, establishing milestones, identifying a planning team, and scheduling planning conferences. Full-Scale Exercise (FSE) A high-stress multi-agency, multi-jurisdictional activity involving actual deployment of resources in a coordinated response, as if a real incident had occurred. An FSE is typically used to: assess plans and procedures under Survey & Certification Emergency Preparedness Initiative - All Hazards EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS ACRONYM & GLOSSARY LIST - Revised 9/2008 Page 24GLOSSARY crisis conditions; and assess coordinated response under crisis conditions. Characteristics of a FSE include mobilization of units, personnel, and equipment, stressful, realistic environment, and scripted exercise scenarios. Functional Exercise (Command Post, CPX, FE) A single or multi-agency activity designed to evaluate capabilities and multiple functions using simulated response. An FE is typically used to: evaluate management of Emergency Operations Centers, command posts, and headquarters; and assess adequacy of response plans and resources. Characteristics of a functional exercise include simulated deployment of resources and personnel, rapid problem solving and highly stressful environment. G Game A game is a simulation of operations using rules, data, and procedures designed to depict an actual or assumed real-life situation. A game is typically used to: explore the processes and consequences of decision-making; conduct what-if? analysis of existing plans; and develops new plans. Characteristics of a game include: Does not involve the use of actual resources; often involves two or more teams; and increasingly include models and simulations. H Hazard A source of potential harm fr om past, current, or future exposures. Hazard/Threat Realistic scenario element(s), either posing or causing harm, intended to drive exercise play towards the fulfillment of objectives. Fo r example, if the exercise objectives include validating public health or surveillance systems, then a biological threat/hazard would be appropriate. In a highly populated, high-profile community, the threat of chemical, biological, or radiological terrorism may be considered more of a risk, whereas in predominately rural areas, industrial or agricultural assets may be more vulnerable to acts of terrorism. Hazardous Material (HazMat) Any material that is explosive, flammable, poisonous, corrosive, reactive, or radioactive, or any combinations thereof, and requires special care in handling because of the hazards it poses to public health, safety, and/or the environment; any hazardous substance under the Clean Water Act, or any element, compound, mixture, solution, or substance designated under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA); any hazardous waste under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA); any toxic pollutant listed under pretreatm ent provisions of the Clean Survey & Certification Emergency Preparedness Initiative - All Hazards EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS ACRONYM & GLOSSARY LIST - Revised 9/2008 Page 25GLOSSARY Water Act; any hazardous pollutant under Section 112 of the Clean Air Act; or any imminent hazardous chemical substance for which the administrator has taken action under the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) Section 7.

Used to review communications between the exercise site and hospitals, notification procedures, sc hedule of events, scenario, controller and evaluator responsibilities, actor issues, and any miscellaneous information. Hospital Debrief Debrief generally conducted the day after an operations-based exercise for participati ng hospital representatives to assess their experience during the incident. Discussion should be facilitated and results should be captured for inclusion into the After Action Report (AAR). Host An organism on or in which a parasite lives. Hot Wash Facilitated discussion amongs t exercise participants immediately following an exercise, designed to capture feedback about any issues, concerns, or proposed improvements player may have about the exercise. Each functional area (e.g., fire, law enforcement, medical) should conduct a hot wash, wh ich should be facilitated by the lead controller for that area. Survey & Certification Emergency Preparedness Initiative - All Hazards EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS ACRONYM & GLOSSARY LIST - Revised 9/2008 Page 26GLOSSARY HPAI Highly Pathogenic form of Avian Influenza. Avian flu viruses are classified based upon the severity of the illness and HPAI is extremely infectious among humans. The rapid spread of HPAI, with outbreaks occurring at the same time, is of growing concern for human health as well as for animal health. See LPAI. H5N1: A variant of avian influenza, which is a type of influenza virulent in birds. It was first identified in Italy in the early 1900s and is now known to exist worldwide. I Immune system The cells, tissues and organs that help the body to resist infection and disease by producing antibodies and/or altered cells that inhibit the multiplication of the infectious agent. Improvement Plan (IP) Portion of the After Action Report (AAR), which converts lessons learned from the exercise into concrete, measurable steps that result in improved response capabilities. It specifically details the actions that the participating jurisdiction will take to address each recommendation presented in the draft AAR/IP, who or what agency will be responsible for taking the action, and the timeline for completion. Incident An occurrence caused either by human or natural phenomena that requires an emergency response to prevent or minimize loss of life or damage to property and/or natural resources. Incident Command System (ICS) A standardized on-scene emergency management concept specifically designed to allow its user(s) to adopt an integrated organizational structure equal to the complexity and demands of single or multiple incidents, without being hindered by jurisdictional boundaries. It provides essential management using these aspects: common terminology, modular organization, integrated communications, a unified command structure, consolidated action plans, manageable span-of-control, predesigned incident facilities and comprehensive resource management. ICS does all of this by organizing any emergency response effort into five basic functions: command, planning/intelligence, operations, logistics, and finance/administration. Incident Management Referring to the totality of activities to be aware of, prevent, prepare for respond to, and recover from incidents. This term is emphasized in the National Response Plan and replaces the terms: Emergency Management, Disaster Management, Crisis Management, and Consequence Management.

Injects can be written, oral, televised, and/or transmitted via any means (e.g., fax, phone, e-mail, voice, radio, or sign). Isolation A state of separation between persons or groups to prevent the spread of disease. The first published recommendations for isolation precautions in United States hospitals appeared as early as 1877, when a handbook recommended placing patients with infectious diseases in separate facilities. Isolation measures can be undertaken in hospitals or homes, as well as in alternative facilities. isolate: A pure strain that has been isolated as from diseased tissue, contaminated water, or the air. Influenza: A serious disease caused by viruses that infect the respiratory tract. Infectious agent: Any organism, such as a pathogenic virus, parasite, or bacterium, that is capable of invading body tissues, multiplying, and causing disease. Hemagglutinin: An important surface struct ure protein of the influenza virus that is an essential gene for the spread of the virus throughout the respiratory tract. This enables the virus to attach itself to a cell in the respiratory system and penetrate it. Referred to as the \"H\" in influenza viruses. See neuraminidase. J Jurisdiction A range or sphere of authority. Public agencies have jurisdiction at an incident related to their legal responsibilities and authorities. Jurisdictional authority at an incident can be political or geographical (e.g., city, region, county), or functi onal (e.g., law enforcement, public health). K L Laboratory Biosafety Levels Four biosafety levels for activities involving infectious microorganisms and laboratory animals. BSL 1 - suitable for work involving well characterized agents not known to consistently cause disease in healthy adult humans, and of minimal potential hazard to laboratory personnel and the environment. BSL 2 - similar to BSL 1 and is suitable for work involving agents of moderate potential hazard to personnel and the environment. Survey & Certification Emergency Preparedness Initiative - All Hazards EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS ACRONYM & GLOSSARY LIST - Revised 9/2008 Page 28GLOSSARY BSL 3 - applicable to clinical, diagnostic, teaching, research, or producti on facilities in which work is done with indigenous or exotic agents which may cause serious or potentially lethal disease as a result of exposure by the inhalation route. BSL 4 - required for work with dangerous and exotic agents that pose a high individual risk of aerosol- transmitted laboratory infections and life-threatening disease. Lead Planner Manager of a planning team responsible for coordinating the design, development, conduct, evaluation, and corrective action planning of an individual exercise. Lessons Learned Knowledge and experience (positive and negative) derived from observations and hi storical study of actual operations, training, and exercises. Exercise After Action Reports (AARs) should identify lessons learned and highlight exemplary practices, and should be submitted to Department of Homeland Security (DHS) for inclusion in the lessons learned/best practices Web portal (www.llis.gov), which will serve as a national network for generating, validating, and disseminating lessons learned and best practices. Low Pathogenic form of Avian Influenza (LPAI) Most avian flu strains are classified as LPAI and typically cause little or no clinical signs in infected birds. However, some LPAI virus strains are capable of mutating under field conditions into HPAI viruses. See HPAI. M Master Scenario Events List (MSEL) Chronological listing of the ev ents and injects which drive exercise play. The MSEL links simulation to action, enhances exercise experience for players, and reflects an incident or activity meant to prompt players to action (e.g. implement the policy or procedure being tested). Each MSEL record contains a designated scenario time, event synopsis, controller responsible for delivering inject, any special delivery instructions (if applicable), expected action (player response expected after an MSEL inject is delivered), intended player (agency or individual player towards whom the MSEL inject should be directed), objective to be demonstrated (if applicable), notes section (for controllers and evaluators to track actual events against those listed in the MSEL, with special instructions for individual controllers and evaluators).

MMRS - Metropolitan Medical Response System - (DHS) A program intended to increase cities' ability to respond to a terrorist attack by coordinating the efforts of local law enforcement Multi-year Exercise Plan State or jurisdiction-wide strategic plan for the multi-year conduct of exercises, as produced in an Exercise Plan Survey & Certification Emergency Preparedness Initiative - All Hazards EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS ACRONYM & GLOSSARY LIST - Revised 9/2008 Page 30GLOSSARY Workshop (EPW). It comprises four major sections: current homeland security program status (e.g., State Homeland Security Strategy, current exercise activities); program goals and objectives; program exercise methodology (e.g., exercise activity cycle, building block approach); and a multi-year exercise timeline/schedule (2- year plans for designated urban areas, 3-year plans for States). Mutation Any alteration in a gene from its natural state. This change may be disease causing or a benign, normal variant. Specific mutations and evolution in influenza viruses cannot be predicted, making it difficult if not impossible to know if or when a virus such as H5N1 might acquire the properties needed to spread easily among humans. Mutual Aid Agreement (MAA) A written agreement between agencies, organizations, and/or jurisdictions to assist one another on request by furnishing personnel, equipment, and/or expertise in a specified manner.

O Objectives Targets for exercise perfor mance which define specific goals, provide a framework for scenario development, guide individual organizational objective development, and provide exercise evaluation criteria. (Note: Generally, planners will limit the number of exercise objectives to enable timely execution, facilitate design of a reasonable scenario, and adequately support successful completion of exercise goals.) Observer Briefing A pre-exercise overview given by one or more members of the exercise planning team to educate observers about program background, scenario, schedule of events, observer limitations, and any other miscellaneous information. (Note: Many times, observers will be unf amiliar with public safety procedures and will have questions about the activities they see. Designating someone to answer questions, such as a response agency Public Information Officer [PIO], will prevent obser vers from asking questions of participants, controllers, or evaluators. The observer briefing is generally conducted the day of an exercise and lasts one hour.) Observer/Media Area Designated area for observers and media during an exercise, intended to help avoid interference with exercise play. It should be adjacent to the exercise site, but should not allow interference with response routes or egress points. Survey & Certification Emergency Preparedness Initiative - All Hazards EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS ACRONYM & GLOSSARY LIST - Revised 9/2008 Page 32GLOSSARY (Note: Because many jurisdictions prefer to keep operations of groups such as special weapons and tactics teams, bomb squads, and explosive ordnance disposal [EOD] teams confidential, these activities could take place some distance from the observer/media area.). Observers Non-participating persons and/or organizations (e.g. local community stakeholders) viewing exercise activity on day(s) of conduct. Operations-Based Exercises A category of exercises charac terized by actual response, mobilization of apparatus and resources, and commitment of personnel, usually over an extended period of time. Operations-based exercises can be used to validate plans, policies, agreements, and procedures. They include drills, functional exercises (FEs), and FSEs. They can clarify roles and responsibilities, identify gaps in resources needed to implement plans and procedures, and improve individual and team performance.

(Note: The scope, type, and co mplexity of an exercise should determine the number of conferences necessary to successfully conduct an exercise. Discussion-based exercises usually include Initial Planning Conferences [IPCs] and Final Planning Conferences [FPCs], whereas, full-scales may call for an IPC, Mid-term Planning Conference, as well as a Master Scenario Events List [MSEL] Conference.) Players Exercise participants who respond to the scenario incident by either discussing (in a discussion-based exercise) or performing (in operations-based exercises) their regular roles and responsibilities. Point of Distribution (POD) (AKA point of dispensing). An emergency site for dispensing medicine and medical supplies from the Strategic National Stockpile (SNS) to the public in the event of a public health emergency (terrorist attack, flu outbreak, earthquake) severe enough to cause local supplies to run out. Pre-pandemic vaccine A vaccine created to protect against currently circulating H5N1 avian influenza virus strains with the expectation that it would provide at least some protection against new virus strains that might evolve . It would likely be the best vaccine defense available until a vaccine specific to the new strain could be developed. Preparedness (AKA Readiness) 1. The range of deliberate, critical tasks and activities necessary to build, sustain, and improve the operational capability to prevent, protect against, respond to, and recover from domestic incidents. Preparedness is a continuous process involving efforts at all levels of government and between govern ment and private sector and nongovernmental organizations to identify threats, determine vulnerabilities, and identify required resources. 2.

Survey & Certification Emergency Preparedness Initiative - All Hazards EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS ACRONYM & GLOSSARY LIST - Revised 9/2008 Page 34GLOSSARY Prevention Actions taken to avoid an incident or to intervene to stop an incident from occurring. Prevention involves actions take to protect lives and property. It involves applying intelligence and other information to a range of activities that may include such countermeasures as deterrence operations; heightened inspections; improved surveillance and security operations; investigations to determine the full nature and source of the threat; public health and agricultural surveillance and testing processes; immunizations, isolation, or quarantine; and, as appropriate, specific law enfo rcement operations aimed at deterring, preempting, interd icting, or disrupting illegal activity and apprehending potential perpetrators and bringing them to justice. Acti vities undertaken by the first responder community during the early stages of an incident to reduce the likelihood or consequences of threatened or actual terrorist attacks. Procedural Flow (PROFLOW) Exercise document which outlines a sequential flow of actions anticipated from participating organizations in response to a hypothetical situation. The PROFLOW allows controllers and evaluators to track and monitor expected actions to ensure their completion at designated times. (Note: The PROFLOW differs from the Master Scenario Events List [MSEL] in that it contains only expected player actions, e.g., establishment of decontamination, triage, treatment, and transport. The MSEL, on the other hand, is a comprehensive tool that contains expected actions and controller injects that prompt or initiate certain events. Typically, PROFLOWs are produced for national and international-level exercises to describe the procedures of departments and agencies that may or may not be published elsewhere.) Program Management The development and execution of an exercise program which includes: multi-year exercise program planning; budgeting and grant writing; planning and executing individual exercises; and tracking improvements. Project Management The management of designing, developing, conducting, evaluating, and improvement planning for an individual exercise. Prophylactic A medical procedure or practice that prevents or protects against a disease or condition (e.g., vaccines, antibiotics, drugs). Props Nonfunctional replications of objects, the presence or discovery of which requires ce rtain actions by exercise players. Examples include simulated bombs, bomb blast debris (shrapnel), mannequins or body parts, and foam bricks and beams. Simulants that mimic the effects of chemical hazards or that cause a positive reading of an Survey & Certification Emergency Preparedness Initiative - All Hazards EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS ACRONYM & GLOSSARY LIST - Revised 9/2008 Page 35GLOSSARY actual detection device are also considered props. (Note: Scripted newspaper ar ticles can make excellent props, and can enhance how scenario elements are related to participants.) Public Health Organized efforts of society to protect, promote, and restore people's health. It is the combination of science, skills, and beliefs that is di rected to the maintenance and improvement of the health of all the people through collective or social actions. The programs, services and institutions involved emphasiz e the prevention of disease and the health needs of the population as a whole. Public health activities change with variations in technology and social values but the goals remain the same: to reduce the amount of disease, premature death, and disease-produced discomfort and disability in the population. Public health is thus a social institution, a discipline and a practice. Public Health Emergency Occurrence or imminent threat of exposure to an extremely dangerous condition or a highly infectious or toxic agent, including a communicable disease, that poses in imminent threat of substantial harm to the population, or any portion thereof. In general, a public health emergency is one that requires a population-based approach. Examples of public health emergencies may include a natural outbreak of an infectious disease, i.e., influenza, Hantavirus, meningitis, salm onella, etc., intentionally caused biological threats such as smallpox, anthrax, and some accidents involving hazardous materials that threaten the health of the population. Public health emergencies can also be or evolve into medical emergencies. Likewise, medical emergencies can develop to an extent that they affect the populati on's health, and by definition, become public health emergencies. Response to public health emergencies will be led by the Department of Health and Human Services with assistance by local and State emergency management. Public Health Information Network (PHIN) Standards providing the basis for information technology projects for CDC. Public Works The work, construction, physic al facilities, and services provided by governments for the benefit and use of the public. Purpose A broad statement of desired ex ercise goals.

Q Quarantine The period of isolation decreed to control the spread of disease. Before the era of antibiotics, quarantine was one of the few available means of halting the spread of infectious disease. It is still employed today as needed. The list of quarantinable diseases in the U.S. is established by Executive Order of the President, on recommendation of the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, and includes cholera, diphtheria, infectious tuberculosis, plague, smallpox, yellow fever, and viral hemorrhagic fevers (such as Marburg, Ebola, and Congo-Crimean disease). In 2003, SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) was added as a quarantinable disease. In 2005 another disease was added to the list, influenza caused by novel or reemergent influenza viruses that are causing, or have the potential to cause, a pandemic.

Response also includes the execution of emergency operations plans and of incident mitigation activities designed to limit the loss of life, personal injury, property damage, and other unfavorable outcomes. As indicated by the situation, response activities include: applying intelligence and other information to lessen the effects or consequences of an incident; increased security operations; continuing investigations into the nature and source of the threat; ongoing public health and agricultural surveillance and testing processes; immunizations, isolation, or quarantine; and specific law enforcement operations aimed at preempting, interdicting, or disrupting illegal activity, and apprehending actual perpetrators and bringing them to justice. Response Area Large exercise space where operations take place, e.g., decontamination, triage, treatment, render safe procedure (RSP). Response Route Path traveled by responding emergency units to a simulated exercise incident. This route should be clearly marked and free of traffic that is unrelated to the exercise. It should lead from the assembly area to the exercise site. Risk A measure of the harm to human health that results from being exposed; uncertainty that surrounds future events and outcomes. Risk Assessment A process that involves determining the likelihood that a specific adverse health effect will occur in an individual or population, following exposure to a hazardous agent. Risk Communication Exchange of information concerning the existence, nature, form, severity or acceptability of health or environmental risks. E ffective risk communication involves determining the types of information that interested and affected parties need and want, and presenting this information to them in a useful and meaningful way. Scenario The storyline of the threat/haz ard which drives a exercise play. Scenarios provide: general context or comprehensive story; technical details necessary to accurately depict scenario conditions and events; and conditions which allow participants to demonstrate proficiency and competency in meeting the exercise objectives. Survey & Certification Emergency Preparedness Initiative - All Hazards EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS ACRONYM & GLOSSARY LIST - Revised 9/2008 Page 38GLOSSARY Scope An indicator of the level of government or private sector participation in exercise play , regardless of participant size. Scope levels include: local, multi-local, regional (within a state), state, multi- state, federal, national-level exercise, international, and private sector. Scope - International Level of exercise scope indicated when any foreign country participates in the exercise (e.g., cross border, TOPOFF). Scope - Local Level of exercise scope indicated when at least one local agency/jurisdiction/organization (e.g., city, town, county, parish, tribal nation, military installation, private entity) participates in an exercise. Scope - Multi-State Level of exercise scope indicated when multiple States and state-level agencies participate in an exercise (e.g., Idaho Bureau of Homeland Security and Mississippi Office of the Governor). Scope - National Level Exercise (NLE) Level of exercise scope indicated when any exercise is designated as a National Exercise. Scope - Non-governmental/Volunteer Level of exercise scope indicated when non-governmental/volunteer groups participate in an exercise. Scope - Private Sector Level of exercise scope indi cated when private sector organizations, other than volunteer or non-governmental organizations (NGOs), participate in an exercise (e.g., Major League Baseball). Scope - Regional Intrastate Level of exercise scope indicated when multiple geographically distinct jurisdictions within a state participate in an exercise (e.g., multiple cities, towns, counties, parishes). Scope - State Level of exercise scope indicated when at least one state-level agency (within the same state) participates in the exercise (e.g., Montana Department of Emergency Services and Montana Depart ment of Transportation). Seasonal flu A respiratory illness that can be transmitted person to person. Most people have some immunity, and a vaccine is available. This is also known as the common flu or winter flu. Seminars An exercise type generally employed to orient participants to, or provide an overview of, authorities, strategies, plans, policies, procedures, protocols, response resources, or concepts and ideas. Seminars provide a good starting point for jurisdictions that are developing or making major changes to their plans and procedures. Shift The process in which the existing H (hemagglutinin) and N (neuraminidase) are replaced by significantly different H Survey & Certification Emergency Preparedness Initiative - All Hazards EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS ACRONYM & GLOSSARY LIST - Revised 9/2008 Page 39GLOSSARY and Ns. These new H or H/N combinations are perceived by human immune systems as new, so most people do not have pre-existing antibody protection to these novel viruses. This is one of the reasons that pandemic viruses can have such a serve impact on the health of populations. See drift. Simulation Cell (SIMCELL) Location for controllers duri ng exercise conduct used to deliver scenario injects and portray nonparticipating organizations, agencies, and individuals who would likely participate actively in an actual event. For example, if Incident Command requests the closure of air space around an incident site, the SIMCELL would receive the call rather than the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). Or, if the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) is not participating, the SIMCELL may be used to simulate communication to and from the FBI Strategic Information Operations Center. Situation Manual (SITMAN) A participant handbook for discussion-based exercises, particularly Tabletops (TTXs). The SITMAN provides background information on the exercise scope, schedule, and objectives. It also presents the scenario narrative that will drive participant disc ussions during the exercise. (Note: The SITMAN should mirror the exercise briefing, supporting the scenario narrative and allowing participants to read along while watching events unfold.) Smallpox Variola, a virus that causes a serious, contagious and sometimes fatal disease, producing substantial morbidity and mortality. There is no specific treatment for smallpox and the only prevention is vaccination. Special Effects A technical, mechanical, or electronic scenario enhancement. Special effects typically require trained and licensed personnel, special permission for use, and additional safety and/or security precautions. Examples include the employment of pyrotechnics or explosives. Special Populations People who might be more sensitive or susceptible to exposure to hazardous substances because of factors such as age, occupation, sex, or behaviors (for example, cigarette smoking); populations with special needs for translations, special services or alternative channels of communication [such as the deaf]; populations with distinct cultural or community needs. Children, pregnant women, and older people are often considered special populations. Species A class of plants or animals having common attributes and designated by a common name. Theoretically, plants or animals of different species cannot interbreed. However, occasionally this does not hold true. Sponsor Primary funding organization for an exercise. Survey & Certification Emergency Preparedness Initiative - All Hazards EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS ACRONYM & GLOSSARY LIST - Revised 9/2008 Page 40GLOSSARY Stakeholder An individual, group, or organization that may be affected by or otherwise interested in a risk management decision. Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) A set of proscribed actions to be taken in response to a particular event. State Administrative Agencies (SAA) Agency primarily responsible wi thin each state to oversee the implementation and management of the state exercise program and implementation of the State Homeland Security Strategy. Strain A group of organisms within a species or variety. Strategic National Stockpile (SNS) A national cache of drugs, vaccines, and supplies that can be deployed to areas struck by disasters, including bioterrorism. (US) Subject-Matter Expert (SME) An individual who is a technical expert in a specific area or in performing a specialized job, task, or skill. Surge Capacity The accommodation by the health system to a transient sudden rise in demand for health care following an incident with real or perceived adverse health effects. As neither the risk of surge nor the size of surge can be estimated, neither can surge capacity be estimated. The proper approach to surge is surge management planning rather than surge capacity planning. Surveillance The systematic ongoing collection, collation, and analysis of data and the timely dissemination of information to those who need to know so that action can be taken. Surveillance is the essential feature of epidemiological practice Surveillance of Disease Scrutiny of all aspects of occurrence and spread of a disease that are pertinent to effective control. Included are the systematic collection and evaluation of: morbidity and mortality reports; special reports of field investigations of epidemics and of individual cases; isolation and identification of infectious agents by laboratories; data concerning the availability, use and untoward effects of vaccines and toxoids, immune globulins, insecticides, and other substances used in control; information regarding immunity levels in segments of the population; and other relevant epidemiologic data. Symptomology Cards Card provided to exercise actors describing the signs and symptoms the actor will portray, as well as information for medical providers. Tabletop Exercise (TTX) Type of exercise which involves senior staff, elected or appointed officials, or other key personnel in an informal setting, discussing simulated situations. This type of exercise is intended to stimulate discussion of various Survey & Certification Emergency Preparedness Initiative - All Hazards EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS ACRONYM & GLOSSARY LIST - Revised 9/2008 Page 41GLOSSARY issues regarding a hypothetical situation. It can be used to assess plans, policies, and procedures or to assess types of systems needed to guide the prevention of, response to, and recovery from a defined event. TTXs typically are aimed at fa cilitating understanding of concepts, identifying of strengths and shortfalls, and/or achieving a change in attitude. Participants are encouraged to discuss issues in depth and develop decisions through slow-paced problem solving rather than the rapid, spontaneous decision making that occurs under actual or simulated emergency conditions. (Note: In contrast to the scale and cost of operations- based exercises and games, TTX s can be a cost-effective tool when used in conjunction with more complex exercises.) Target Capabilities A list of capabilities, as iden tified by the Department of Homeland Security, needed collectively by the nation to prevent, protect against, respond to, and recover from incidents of national significance, including terrorism or natural disasters. Terrorism Any activity that (1) involves an act that (a) is dangerous to human life or potentially destructive of critical infrastructure or key resources; and (b) is a violation of the criminal laws of the Unit ed States or of any State or other subdivision of the United States; and (2) appears to be intended (a) to intimidate or coerce a civilian population; (b) to influence the policy of a government by intimidation or coercion; or (c) to affect the conduct of a government by mass destruction, assassination, or kidnapping. Terrorism The unlawful use of force or violence against persons or property to intimidate or coerce a government, the civilian population, or any segment thereof, in furtherance of political or social objectives. Threat/Hazard Realistic scenario element(s), either posing or causing harm, intended to drive exercise play towards the fulfillment of objectives. Fo r example, if the exercise objectives include validating public health or surveillance systems, then a biological threat/hazard would be appropriate. In a highly populated, high-profile community, the threat of chemical, biological, or radiological terrorism may be considered more of a risk, whereas in predominately rural areas, industrial or agricultural assets may be mo re vulnerable to acts of terrorism. Survey & Certification Emergency Preparedness Initiative - All Hazards EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS ACRONYM & GLOSSARY LIST - Revised 9/2008 Page 42GLOSSARY Threatening Communicable Disease Term used in relation to the reporting of communicable diseases in the Public Health Act and defined in the Public Health Emergency Response Act to mean: a disease that causes death or great that passes from one person to another and for which there are no means by which the public can reasonably avoid the risk of contracting the disease. The term does not include infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), or other infections attributable to infection with HIV. (Contrast with conditions of public health significance). U USDA U.S. Department of Agriculture, the government agency responsible for regulating the safety and development of food, agriculture, and natural resources. USAID United States Agency for International Development provides foreign assistance to developing countries in order to further America's foreign policy interests in expanding democracy and free markets while improving the lives of the citizens of the developing world. V vaccine A preparation consisting of antigens of a disease-causing organism which, when introduced into the body, stimulates the production of specific antibodies or altered cells. This produces an immunity to the disease-causing organism. The antigen in the preparation can be whole disease-causing organisms (killed or weakened) or parts of these organisms. Vaccination The injection, or inoculation, of a vaccine for the purpose of inducing active immunity. Venue The primary location of exercise conduct. In operations-based exercises, this is typically the facility or site the scenario will affect. For example, if a nonpersistent chemical agent (e.g., sarin) is selected as the threat/hazard, the venue should not be an open-air facility (e.g., stadium, park) because of the agent's dissipating characteristics. (Note: The venue used to conduct the exercise does not necessarily have to be the same venue described in the exercise scenario. For example, a stadium parking lot may be used to simulate an airport runway.) Virus The simplest type of microorganisms, lacking a system for their own metabolism. They depend on living cells to multiply and cannot live long outside of a host. Types of viruses include smallpox, Ebola, Marburg, and Lassa fever. Survey & Certification Emergency Preparedness Initiative - All Hazards EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS ACRONYM & GLOSSARY LIST - Revised 9/2008 Page 43GLOSSARY Virulent Highly lethal; causing se vere illness or death. W Waiver (1135) The HHS Secretary is authorized to declare a Public Health Emergency under section 1135 and temporarily waive or modify the following: The application of health care items and services furnished by a health care provider in any emergency area during an emergency period, Medicare, Medicaid or State Children's Health Insurance Program requirements, Any regulation pertaining to conditions of participation or other certification requirements for an individual health care provider or types of providers, Requirements that physicians and other health care professionals be licensed in the State in which they provide such services, if they have equivalent licensing in another State and are not excluded from practice in that State or in any Stat e included in the emergency area. An \"emergency area\" is defined as a geographical area in which an \"emergency period\" has been declared, during which an emergency or disaster exists that has been declared by the President under the National Emergencies Act or the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act; and a Public Health Emergency declared by the Secretary under section 319 of the Public Health Service Act. The term \"health care provider\" refers to any entity that furnishes health care items or services (e.g., hospitals, nursing homes) health care facilities, or other providers of or supplier of health care items or services, a physician, or other health care practitioners or professionals. The Secretary is authorized to waive the following: Sanctions relating to examination and treatment for emergency medical conditions and women in labor, or for a transfer of an individual who has not been stabilized if the transfer arises out of the circumstances of the emergency Sanctions relating to limitations on physician referral Deadlines and timetables for performance of required activities, except that such deadlines and timetables may only be modified, not waived Limitations on payments for health care items and services furnished to individuals enrolled in a Medicare+Choice plan by health care professionals or Survey & Certification Emergency Preparedness Initiative - All Hazards EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS ACRONYM & GLOSSARY LIST - Revised 9/2008 Page 44GLOSSARY facilities not included under such plan (the Secretary will reconcile payments, to the extent possible, to ensure enrollees do not pay more than would be required had they received se rvices from providers within their plan's network) Waterfowl Birds that swim and live near water, including ducks, geese, and swans. Weapon of Mass Destruction (WMD) (1) Any explosive, incendiary, or poison gas, bomb, grenade, rocket having a propellant charge of more than 4 ounces, or missile having an explosive or incendiary charge of more than one-quarter ounce, or mine or similar device; (2) Any weapon that is designed or intended to cause death or serious bodily injury through the release, dissemination, or impact of toxic or poisonous chemicals of their precursors; (3) Any weapon involving a disease organism; or (4) any weapon that is designed to release radiation or radioactivity at a level dangerous to human life. WHO World Health Organization, an agency of the United Nations established in 1948 to further international cooperation in improving health conditions. Workshop A formal discussion-based exercise led by a facilitator or presenter used to build or achieve a product. A workshop is typically used to: test new ideas, processes, or procedures; train groups in coordinated activities; and obtain consensus. Characteristics of a workshop include more formality than a seminar, and often use break-out sessions to explore parts of issue with smaller groups. Written Release Press release developed by the planning team and given to media outlets prior to an exercise. It serves as a means of informing the media and the public about general exercise information (e.g., location, date). Additionally, this information can be distributed to observers and senior officials, e.g., Very Important Persons (VIPs), management. This release should not contain detailed scenario info rmation (such as the type of threat or hazard, venue, or other sensitive information) and should not contain information that might hinder exercise outcomes if a participant were to see it. X Y Z Zoonoses Diseases that are transferable from animals to humans.
