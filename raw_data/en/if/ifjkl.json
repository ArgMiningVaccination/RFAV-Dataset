Immunoimaging is a rapidly growing field stoked in lar ge part by the intriguing triumphs of immunotherapy. On the heels of immunotherapy's successes, there exists a growing need to evaluate tumor response to therapy particularly immunotherapy, stratify patients into responders vs.non-responders, identify inflammation, and better understand the fundamental roles of immune syst em components to improve both immunoimaging and immunotherapy. Innovative nanomaterials have begun t o provide novel opportunities for immunoimaging, in part due to their sensitivity, modularity, capacity for man y potentially varied ligands (high avidity), and potential for multifunctionality/multimodality imaging. This rev iew strives to comprehensivel y summarize the integration of nanotechnology and immunoim aging, and the field's potenti al for clinical applications. 1. Introduction A variety of imaging modalities and approaches have been developed as tools to track disease initiation and progression, and to inform clinical practice with diagnostic, prognostic, staging and response-to-therapy data.

This field\u2014immunoimaging\u2014can yield insights into disease states based on the body's native immune responses,1-3 and in some cases can be engineered to also manipulate immunefunctions. 4,5Indeed, the recent successes of immunotherapy have helped drive the surge in interest in the in vivo interactions of the immune system with normal proce sses and disease targets, which has led to rapidly emerging immunoimaging technology anddevelopment. These strategies will advance our understanding of the clinical utility of the immune response; although still in its infancy, immunoimaging promises significant predictive capabilities for assessing disease progression and response totherapies, particularly in the development and use of immuno-therapies.

Early advances in immunoimaging using fluorescent tags to image at the microscale 6,7have led to tremendous immuno- logical insights in pre-clinical studies, and the early studieswith nuclear medicine tools such as positron emission tomo-graphy (PET) 8,9planar imaging with gamma cameras, and single photon emission tomography (SPECT) have provideduseful information on immune cell distribution for decades in the clinic. In contrast to these approaches that use labeled molecules, imaging with nanomaterials oers some advantagesthat include mitigating the need for radioactivity, aordingintelligent control over delivery, and increasing diagnosticsensitivity and specificity that would not be otherwise possible.Nanomaterials are particularly valuable in immunoimagingbased on their strong signal, enabling detection sensitivitydown to single cell visualization in some cases ( e.g., with optical and magnetic modalities), 10-12high specific immune cell selectivity/ avidity,10and the potential for multifunctionality including targeting, imaging diagnostics, and therapeutics ( e.g., theranostics).13,14The first immunoimaging nanomaterials were primarily iron oxideparticles used to label immune cells, particularly macrophages,to track cells using modalities such as magnetic resonanceimaging (MRI) and SPECT. 15 In this review, we strive to provide a foundation for asking immunological questions through imaging followed by a comprehensive overview of nano-immunoimaging, focused onthe nexus between imaging, nanotechnology, and immunology.We define nanoparticles as particles that are specificallyengineered between 1 and 100 nm in at least one dimensioncritical to its application. 16,17Furthermore, we will: (i) focus on the use of nanomaterials for imaging the immune system, particularly its many cellular subsets; (ii) review only nano- materials that have been used in vivo for imaging ( i.e., they have been injected into living subjects); and (iii) concentrate oninsights from the last 20 years (roughly the start of immuno-imaging). The sections are divided without regard to specificdiseases, and are intended to provide an introduction to the keyareas that comprise nano-immunoimaging. 2. Short primers i. Imaging Imaging technologies used for nano-immunoimaging span the suite of available modalities (Table 1), which are categorized into magnetic, optical, acoustic, nuclear and multimodalityimaging. 16There have been a number of recent reviews of these modalities, nonetheless, we briefly review these imagingtools below as a foundation for our discussion of nano-immunoimaging. The multimodality instruments and approaches,such as photoacoustic imaging (opt ical and acoustic), comprise two or more modalities from the four categories of imaging approaches (magnetic, optical, acoustic, and nuclear), and thus our description of the four categories provides a convenient framework for nano-material imaging in both single and multimodality approaches. Wewill acknowledge when multimodality approaches oer imagingbenefits as we describe the applications and questions in nano-immunoimaging. Magnetic imaging. MRI is a noninvasive imaging technique that employs magnetic fields to attain three-dimensional images generally based on the nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) of water protons in tissues. 18In a strong magnetic field, hydrogen nuclei absorb resonant radiofrequency pulses, andsubsequently, the excited nuclei relax and return to the originallower energy state. MRI contrast is generated by the dierentrelaxation processes of the su rrounding hydrogen nuclei in dierent types of tissues.

Optical ( other luminescence, absorbance, scattering, predominantly in the 400 to 1100 nanometer (nm region of the electro-magnetic spectrum) to interrogate cellular and molecular functions within the living body. Fluorescence images are generated by detecting emissivephotons from endogenous molecules ( e.g., FAD, hemoglobin) or exogenous materials ( e.g., dyes, reporter proteins, nano- probes) upon energetic excitation. Bioluminescence imagesare generated by detecting photons emitted internally fromenzymatic reactions that result in light production. Opticalimaging, capable of obtaining high temporal and spatial resolution with good sensitivity, has provided broad utility such as in the measurement of gene expression, protein-protein interactions, 25 cell engraftment, tagging superficial structures,26cell trafficking,27 and tumor growth and therapeutic responses.28While many uses of pre-clinical optical imaging are whole body, as a complementarymodality to other whole-body imaging strategies ( e.g.,M R Io rC T ) for immune imaging purposes, optical microscopy ( e.g.,s u p e r - resolution, intravital microscopy) has been exploited to visualize and understand the in vivo behavior of nanoparticles and their nanoscale interactions with the internal biology in real-time. 29-31 Current unmet needs in optical in vivo imaging include maximizing penetration depth of images (which come as a trade-off to spatialresolution) and minimizing convoluting auto-fluorescence back-ground signals; these needs can be solved in part with the aid ofnanoparticle contrast agents. 32 Acoustic imaging. Ultrasound is the most widely used diagnostic imaging tool in the clinic because it is inexpensive, portable, and allows real-time imaging without ionizing radiation.33Ultrasound provides anatomic images by directing high-frequency ultrasoundwaves into tissues, and receiving scattered and reflected waves.However, because most biological tissues display similar acousticimpedance, it remains challenging to generate strong echo signals. Therefore, gas-filled microbubbl es or silica nanomaterials may be administered into the systemic circulation to produce intense echogenic contrast. 34,35Recently, a novel imaging modality combining ultrasound with optical imaging has emerged:photoacoustic imaging (PAI) has great potential for molecularimaging by providing multi-centimeter image penetrationdepths at micrometer-scale spatial resolution, merging keyadvantages of each. 36PAI is based on a 'light in/sound out' approach, generating contrast by detecting the ultrasonic wavesfrom transient thermo-elastic expansion of molecules or tissues upon absorption of pulsed laser light excitations, thereby eciently combining the excellent spectral contrast of opticsand the anatomical features and penetration depth of ultra-sonic imaging. 37 Nuclear imaging. Radionuclide imaging r efers to the detection of high-energy photons from the decay of radioisotopes in asubject.38In positron emission tomogr aphy (PET), a radioactive decays along with the ejection of a high-energy positron. The emitted positron then annihilates a nearby electron, producing two g-photons. The detectors in a PET scanner then localize the simultaneous detection of these two gamma rays180 1apart. SPECT imaging is based on detection of photons emitted from labeled compounds in the body using a gammacamera with collimators to facilitate tomographic reconstruction.Radionuclide imaging is very sen sitive and robust in providing quantitative information about biochemical and physiologic processes as a functional imaging tool. 16,39 Computed tomography (CT) is a related imaging technique, also capable of whole body imaging, with high spatial resolutionand rapid image acquisition. I n CT imaging, the X-ray tube and detectors rotate 360 1during which the absorption of X-rays is measured from many dierent an gles. Subsequently, three- dimensional, tomographic images of the internal structures arereconstructed from these X-ray intensity profiles by computational algorithms. 40CT has been widely used in the clinic as an anatomical imaging tool, particul arly for visualizing bone struc- tures because of the apparent contrast dierence betweenelectron-dense bones and surrounding electron-poor soft tissues.However, due to the inherent low sensitivity of CT, contrast agentsare required to visualize the cha nges that occur in soft tissues. 41 These agents must display fairly hi gh electron densities to produce robust CT signal, and nanomaterials are among the optimal types of agents to do so based on the ability to fabricate particles of high- electron density entities with hundreds to millions of atoms, e.g., gold,42bismuth,43tantalum, and silver. If a CT scanner is equipped with dual-energy or filters, di erential absorption of X-rays by nanoparticles of dierent material composition can result in multi-spectral CT, allowing multiplexing. Given the anatomic informationthat CT provides, it is sometimes used as the anatomical overlayfor functional imaging modalities such as PET and MPI that do not intrinsically provide anatomic structural contrast. ii. Nanoparticles Nanoparticles (NPs) enable imaging and tracking targeted cells and molecules deep within tissues of the living body using avariety of imaging modalities. These include magnetic, nuclear,optical, acoustic, and 'adaptable' nanotechnologies, and combina-tions thereof. 16N P sd i s p l a yav a r i e t yo fa d v a n t a g e o u sp r o p e r t i e s , including multifunctionality and intelligent control. NPs attain imaging capabilities based on th eir unique functional properties (e.g., magnetic, optical, X-ray attenuation) originating from their component materials and nanoscale dimensions.44For example, in MRI, superparamagnetic iron oxide NPs (SPIONs; with size below20 nm) have been extensively used as T 2*M R Ic o n t r a s ta g e n t sd u e to the fact that these particles induce a local perturbation ofmagnetic fields in the MRI scanner, resulting in the shortening ofT 2relaxation and generating hypo-intense signals (dark contrast) on T2*-weighted MR imaging.45SPIONs are considered safe and allow ultrasensitive detection, and some iron oxideparticles can be visualized even down to the single cell/particlelevel. 12Materials with a high atomic number can absorb X-ray photons more eectively,46making NPs comprising high- ZReview Nanoscale Horizons Published on 11 December 2019.

Gold NPs tend to be the most attractive owing to their excellent biocompatibility, facile synthesis, and ease of bioconjugation.41,47,48However, high masses of materials are often required due to the relatively lowsensitivity of the approach. 16 NPs for immune cell imaging can be made fluorescent with linked fluorochromes. However, the photo-stability, highquantum yield of quantum dots (QDs) and their size-tunableemission, made QDs robust fluorescent tags of widespreadutility for optical immune imaging. 49,50Recently, to overcome the shallow tissue penetration depth of UV excitation, lanthanide- based upconversion NPs (UCNPs), which upon (typically600-900 nm), have emerged as new fluorescent NPs forimmune imaging with low backgrounds. 51,52Nuclear nano- materials are often formulated viathe surface decoration of NPs with radioisotopes ( e.g.,64Cu,124I,89Zr) through chelation chemistry, or by incorporation of the radioisotope within the NP.53,54Upon accumulation at a target site, radioisotopes in nuclear nanomaterials produce radioactive decays for detectionby a nuclear imaging modality such as PET or SPECT. Many nanomaterials display superior flexibility and modularity in chemical design over small-mo lecule or protein-based imaging agents. 55Multimodal imaging NPs detectable by two (or more) imaging modalities that can interact synergistically may signifi-cantly improve diagnostics capabilities. 56,57For example, MRI and PET are complementary modalities, that can, for example, provide structural (anatomic) and functional information,with the high sensitivity of PET balanced by the high spatialresolution of MRI. 58Various methods to prepare composite nanomaterials and endow them with multimodal imagingproperties have been developed ( e.g., therapeutic payloads into the nanoscale matrix, imaging NPs can also achieve multifunctional utility, e.g., theranostics (combination of diagnostic imaging and drug delivery). Examples of adaptable/multifunctional nanomaterials Immunology The immune system is a highly-regulated, complex, dynamic and interactive collection of cells and molecules that mediateresponses to insults such as infection and malignancy. Thedynamic nature of the immune system is required to combat awide variety of insults that are endogenous, i.e., derived from self ( e.g.cancer) with very subtle dierences from normal cells, or exogenous, such as bacteria and viruses. Viruses and somebacteria can live inside the host cells making them dicult targets for the immune system, and there are commensal viruses and bacteria that live in the body without causingdisease, necessitating the need for the immune system toassess the level of threat for each entity it encounters.To accomplish this very complex set of tasks, the immunesystem can both simply react without prior exposure, and itcan ''learn'' from previous encounters with the presumed threat; these two fundamental functions are referred to as the innate and the adaptive immune systems, respectively. These two aspects of the immune system comprise immune cells andeector molecules that are distinct, yet overlapping. The key cell types of the innate and adaptive immune system are organized by their primary functions, e.g., phagocytic innate cells such as macrophages, monocytes, and neutrophils thatengulf pathogens and foreign bodies. There are also antigen-presenting cells such as dendritic cells, macrophages, and monocytes that collect the markers (antigens) of the attacking entity and present these markers to other (adaptive) cells todetermine if they comprise a threat or not. This is calledantigen presentation. Once presented, there are a variety ofresponses that the organism can take based on this initialassessment. The immune system can launch a cellular attackon the invader that possesses the particular marker, and thiscan be a cell-to-cell attack by adaptive cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) or a molecular response with B lymphocytes making antibodies that bind to the threatening agent. There are alsohelper cells that support this attack that are also antigen-specific, called helper T cells. If the marker that is presentedis nonthreatening, then antigen presentation can lead to animmunosuppressive response in wh ich regulatory T lymphocytes (Treg) and other cells diminish the immune response. The innate immune response has been hardwired into the system and responds to entities t hat appear foreign by comparing these markers to self or by an inherited knowledge of what isforeign using cell surface molec ules such as those in the Toll-like family of receptors. 64,65Cells of the innate immune system include macrophages, foreign body-engulfing neutrophils, andnatural killer (NK) and natural killer T cells (NK-T) that eectivelyassess the molecular surface of the attacking entity and compareit to the appearance of self and kill those cells appearing to be non-self with perforating molecules (perforin) and toxins (e.g.granulysin). This is all tightly regulated by markers on the cell surface such as CD47 that tell phagocytic cells not toengulf them or markers that suppress the immune response\u2014theso-called check point inhibit ors. Both CD47 and checkpoint inhibitors are being targeted in the emerging cancer immuno-therapeutic space. 66There are circumstances when self-nonself recognition fails and this leads to autoimmune diseases such as type 1 diabetes, multiple sclerosis, and rheumatoid arthritis. The fact that immune cells can ''learn'' and change, circulatearound the body looking for foreign invaders, have a widevariety and varying levels of surface markers used for theiridentification and in vivo targeting, and typically divide rapidly upon encountering invaders, presents unique challenges\u2014andopportunities\u2014to the development of eective imaging toolsfor assessing immune functions and tracking responses over time. Nano-immunoimaging. At the nexus of imaging, nano- technology, and immunology lies the burgeoning field of nano- immunoimaging.

Major advances have thus resulted, which are providing in sights into native immune cell biology and cell tracking, yielding new applications to obtaindiagnostic and prognostic information, and allowing the ability toquantify the eects of therapeutic interventions. Immunologists,biomedical imaging engineers, and nanochemists have begunconverging to engage in massively multidisciplinary collabora-tions to advance the new concept of nano-immunoimaging.As for all nanomedical applications, nanomaterials must be biocompatible, but the needs of nano-immunoimaging are far beyond this simple requirement: nanomaterials must also be(i) imageable by at reasonablyachievable concentrations in vivo , and they (ii) must not modulate immunological signaling, which could adverselyimpact the phenotype and thus function of the imaged immunecells/molecules; the latter requirement must be rigorouslytested for each nanomaterial-immune cell type/molecule pair 16for potential eventual clinical utility. Indeed, detailed study and understanding of biocompatible nanomaterials,imaging, and the immune system, and the interactionsbetween them, are required to design imageable nanomaterialsappropriate for interacting with the cells and moleculescomprising the immune milieu. This is necessary to visualize and quantify spatial and temporal immunodynamics in the body. Hence, the application of nanomaterials and imaging to immunology has the potential to improve immuno- and othertherapeutic ecacies, such as chemotherapy, and diminishundesirable side eects, interweaving to form an exciting,entirely new field (Fig. 1). 3. Nano-immunoimaging applications i. Learning basic biology viaimmunoimaging One of the great challenges, and opportunities, in immuno- imaging is due to the changing and migratory nature of components of the immune system. Immune cel ls may originate in the bone marrow or spleen then migrate viathe blood stream to sites of infection, malignant growth, or immune stimulation, where they may collect an antigen or pathogen and then migrate through the lymphatics to draining lymph nodes or to the spleen. Throughout this process the immune cells will often mature, change theirphenotypes, and divide to increase their numbers. This necessitatesimaging over a range of scales, from macro- to micro-scopic imaging and incorporating imaging markers that persist through changing Fig. 1 Nano-immunoimaging. This review systematically summarizes the integration of nanotechnology and immunoimaging toward both a fundamental in vivo understanding of the roles of the immune system and advan cement of clinical diagnostics and therapeutics.Review Nanoscale Horizons Published on 11 December 2019.

The imaging strategies that provide a macroscale view can examine populations of i mmune cells in relatively large numbers as they accumulate in tissue targets, but can not, usually,be used to examine the phenotype or cellular activity of the labeledcells; this normally requires microscale imaging. Nearly all imagingstrategies have been directed at these problems of determiningcellular localization, concentrat ion, and activity for cells of the immune system and many of them oer opportunities to under-stand immunology and guide the development and clinical application of immunotherapi e s .I ne a c hc a s e ,t h e s ei m a g i n g modalities can benefit from the use of NPs as contrast and inmany cases NPs have been develo ped as multimodality agents that serve as an ideal link from macro- to micro-scopic imagingand in some cases can be used to reveal functional changes andmigratory patterns. 16,67 a. Microscale. The dawn of immunoimaging saw micro- scale imaging provide direct insights into in vivo immune cell dynamics and responses.6,7Once a tissue site or organ of interest has been located, the use of high-resolution imagingtools can be applied to reveal immune parameters such asphenotype, function, localization dynamics, and interactionpartners. The high resolution imaging modalities are largelybased on optical parameters such as fluorescence, 68,69scatter (e.g., optical coherence tomography (OCT) and ultrasound),70,71 absorption e.g., PAI),72or bioluminescence,25and will some- times involve removing overlying tissues to reduce the absorbance and scatter.13A common approach for high resolution imaging of immune cells is intravital micros copy (IVM), examining nanomaterials, dyes, andreporter genes, or endogenous, e.g., second harmonic imaging of collagen. 16,69,73-75IVM is employed either in single photon (one excitation photon, one emission photon) or multiphoton form,in which multiple photons of equal energy and longer wave- length are nearly-simultaneously absorbed by a fluorophore, allowing substantially deeper tissue penetration and label-freestrategies. 68,69,76However, what has not yet been well-studied is how to link macro- and microscopic imaging in single animals. Nanomaterials have provided i mmunological in sights across the spectrum microscale including IVM, OCT, photoacoustic the trafficking of inflammatory monocytes and macro- phages in brain tumors with subcellular detail,29,67while OCT has shown tumor-associated macrophage migration patterns in braincancer with high penetration depths. 71 b. Whole body. While microscale imaging provides insights into the detailed biologic mechanisms and pathways,and may inform on clinical decisions for certain indications,macroscale, whole body imaging is often most valuable whenclinical decision-making is required. Lesion/tumor/infarct size, whole lesion metabolism, spread of metastasis to lymph nodes or other sites, etc., are generally best measured using whole body techniques such as MRI, PET, SPECT, CT, and MPI. Imaging of cells of the immune system began initially as a means of seeking sites of inflammation with application toclinical infection 80,81and malignancy,82and transitioned toimaging of immune activation83as a potential tool for guiding therapies including immunotherapies in the clinic. These studies were performed using molecular contrast that had been developed for cancer imaging, particularly radiolabeled glucose(2-[ 18F]fluoro-2-deoxy- D-glucose, FDG) and imaged with PET and have been further developed to use molecular contrastthat is specifically directed at immune cell function. 8MRI, despite its tremendous soft tissue contrast, has considerablelimitations as a molecular or NP imaging modality with regardto sensitivity and the loss of signal used to localize magnetic NPs. To address the poor sensitivity of MRI, magnetic NP complexes have been used to increase the contrast. 12The iron oxide NPs used for MRI which lead to negative contrast, or'signal dropout' under standard sequences, are not ideal forradiologists reading the images. MRI, and other such modalities,PET, SPECT, CT, and MPI, are used for whole body, macroscopicimaging and have utility for clinical imaging. ii.

The delivery of NPs to immune cells inliving subjects can be broadly divided into two categories:(1)ex vivo labeling, outside the body, often with the aid of transfection agents; (2) in vivo targeting, which can be divided into passive targeting and active targeting. Passive targeting typically takes the form of immune cells which take up NPs non-specifically through phagocytosis. In active targeting, theNPs are typically functionalized with targeting ligands, whichcan selectively bind with proteins or other receptors on the cellsurface to increase the accumulation of NPs into particularimmune cell types (described in detail in Section 3(v)a). a.Ex vivo labeling.

To label DCs, copolymer, poly(aspartic acid)- e-caprolactone) were incubated with the cells. 91 Labeled DCs were unaected in their viability, proliferation, and dierentiation capacity, and exhibited excellent MRIsensitivity in vitro . The cells were detected by MRI in vivo in the draining lymph nodes of mice upon injections into thefoot pad, demonstrating a proof-of-principle of whole-body DCtracking in live animals. NK cells play important roles in innate immunity, and adoptive transfer of NK cells has attracted significant recent interest as a novel anti-cancer immunotherapy. 92Thus, the ability to image and track NK cells following administrationin vivo can greatly aid in the monitoring of NK-based therapy. 93 NK cells tend to display inherently low phagocytic activity. As a result, electroporation or a transfection agent 94,95is often utilized to introduce SPIOs and other NPs into them. These approaches can disrupt normal cellular function, with increasing SPIO concentrationsleading to lower cell viability. 94Nevertheless, SPIO-loaded NK cells were injected into liver cancer rat models. NK cells wereobserved in vivo byT 2*-weighted MRI for up to 24 hours. Histo- logical measurements confirmed increased NK cell delivery totumor, which correlated well with a decrease in T2* relaxation time in livers of tumor bearing mice compared to those in normal mice. Another method to assist NK cell transfection is to use a strong magnetic field.96Incubation of organic dye (Cy5.5) labeled SPIOs with NK-92MI cells placed under an externalmagnetic field loaded the NPs into NK cells. Real-time fluores-cence imaging of mice following NK administration allowedvisualization of NK cell accumulation at the tumor site. Inter-estingly, infiltration of NK cells into tumor could be enhanced 17-fold by placing an external magnet by the tumor. While optical imaging provides outstanding spatiotemporal resolution to visualiz e physiological and pat hological processes, its wide application in living subjects is hampered by the limitedpenetration of photons through mammalian tissue. UCNPsdesigned to permit deeper tissue penetration with strongupconversion luminescence were synthesized and coated withpositively charged polyethylenimine (PEI) or oligo-arginine. 52,97 The greater tissue penetration at these longer wavelengths isdue in large part to the reduced absorption of light by hemo-globin in the 800-1100 nm region of the spectrum, as well asdecreased optical scattering. Upon incubation with DCs,UCNPs to detected by luminescence imaging (Fig. 3). 52Further- more, a model antigen (ovalbumin) was adsorbed onto the UCNPs, inducing DC maturation and cytokine release, thereby providing a platform for combined (i) imaging of lymph nodedrainage and (ii) immune activation leading to enhanced Tcell proliferation, interferon gamma (IFN- g) production, and Fig. 2 Signal loss in MRI after subcutaneous injection of rhodamine B, SPIO labeled KHYG-1 cells were observed at the edge of mouse tumor 4days after np administration.

A second example of imaging deeply viaoptical strategies is the use of OCT to study immune cell movement and function in the tumor microenvironment. To enable visualization of tumor associated macrophages (TAM)by OCT, TAM were externally labeled with large gold nanorodsas optical scatter-based contrast. 71This approach can potentially allow deeper TAM tracking than would otherwise be possibleusing any standard IVM technique , enabling tracking potentially deep into biologically-complex tumor hypoxic or necrotic regions. In addition to innate immune cells, adaptive immune cells have also been labeled ex vivo . SPIOs via incubation. This strategy allowed detection of cells viaMRI with a detection threshold of 2 cells/voxel in vitro andB3 cells/voxel in live mice. This method enabled high resolution, clinically-relevant non-invasive imaging and spatiotemporal localizationof T-cell recruitment to tumors in vivo . Traditional MR imaging monitors changes in relaxation time of water molecules, which has relatively low sensitivitydue to the high background from water. 19F-MRI is a promising approach for in vivo imaging since natural levels of19Fi n the body are very low, resulting in essentially no backgroundin 19F-MRI, while conventional proton-based MRI can provide anatomical context. In an instance of immunotherapeuticmonitoring, T cells labeled with a nano-emulsion containing perfluorinated polyether were injected into mice intraperitone- ally in an inflammation model. 99Longitudinal19F-MRI over 21 days revealed dynamic accumulation and clearance of T cells inthe draining lymph nodes, with T cell numbers quantifiable via 19F MRI data (Fig. 4). Similar NP strategies have been applied to label T cells for tracking diabeto genic T cells to the pancreas in a diabetic mouse model,100to track Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) T-cells in patients,101to track macrophages in vivo with 19F for detection of acute allograft rejection via19F-MRI,102and recently to perform multimodal19F-MRI and ultrasound for visualizing the localization of therapeutic DCs.103 Nuclear imaging, with its ultra-high contrast, has also been tested to monitor CAR-T cell therapy. Electro-transferred goldNPs (GNPs) functionalized MicroPET/CT revealed the in vivo biodistributionof CAR-T cells, ensuring these cells were at the intended site, but not elsewhere potentially producing side eects, thereby highlighting the utility of radiolabeled GNPs for PET-based CAR-T cell imaging.104 b. In vivo labeling. Ex vivo immune cell loading approaches are suitable for adoptive cell transfer studies. However, nano-materials can also enable monitoring of endogenous immunecells without the need to isolate cells first. For example, inatherosclerotic plaque detection studies, model animals including rabbits and ApoE /C0//C0mice were injected intravenously with dextran coated SPIOs (typical concentration 56 mg Fe per kg),105-107which are preferentially taken up by macrophages in part due to theirinherently strong phagocytic power. SPIO-labeled macrophageswere enriched in atheroscleroti cp l a q u e st h a th a dh i g hl e v e l so f inflammation. To enhance the contrast between plaque sites andthe blood, MRI was usually performed 24 hours post-SPIOinjection to allow sufficient clearance of SPIOs from the bloodpool. Significant MRI contrast changes in inflammatory plaque sites were observed via T 2*-weighted MRI, providing a non- invasive approach to detect atherosclerotic plaques in liveanimals. Changes in plaque MR intensities correlated with number of macrophages determinedthrough histological analysis, yielding a semi-quantitativeSPIO-based proxy of the degree of inflammation at the specificplaque sites. 108Several groups have exploited this phenomenon by fluorophore-labeling SPIOs and exploring their in vivo inter- actions using IVM.109,110Other types of labeling involving active, ligand-directed targeting, and intrinsic selectivity aredescribed in Section 3(v)a. In ge neral, either native cellular phagocytosis or molecular targeting (enabled by NP surface-conjugated ligands) is typically used to directly label cells in vivo . 13 Endogenous SPIO-labeling of macrophages can also be used to track the innate immune response to stem cell transplants.The host immune system may often reject allogeneic cell transplants, but the time-scale and mechanism is not well- understood. By combining MRI and IVM in a form of multi-modality imaging that bridges the micro- to the macroscales,stem cell rejections were detected, yielding insights neitheralone could have provided. 111In this green fluorescent Fig. 4 In vivo MRI of19F-labeled T cells in a mouse inflammation model.

Immune-mismatched cell implants demonstratedstronger MR signals than immune-matched cells due to increasedstem cell death and subsequent recruitment of SPIO-laden macro-phages to engraftments. MR signal changes correlated well withIVM images, due to increasing quantities of GFP-expressing andrhodamine-positive macrophages in the mismatched transplants. NP-based tools can thus help overcome the challenging immunogenicity (or allogenicity) that may occur in cell therapydue to consequent inflammation or immune-related conditions.Smart NPs were recently designed to reveal early immunerejection-induced apoptosis o f MSCs. These nanoprobes are composed of an SPIO backbone an d peptides with activatable fluorophore ''light-up'' features in the presence of activatedcaspase-3, 112an marker. NPs w ere exogenously labeled to either immune-matched (mouse MSCs) or mismatched stem cells (pig MSCs), and the cells were transplanted into cartilage defects in mice. T2*-weighted MRI signals from SPIOs successfully localized in cell engraftments throughout the body. Oncelocalized, the intense ''turn-on'' fluorescence signals wereobserved viaIVM imaging in apoptotic pig MSCs with a decrease in the overall cell numbers. While such strategiesdisplay the promise of NP-based probes, they will likely require a mechanism to control potential unexpected proliferation or dierentiation of MSCs for successful clinical translation. Micrometer-sized iron oxide magnetic particles (MPIOs) have higher relaxivities per particle compared to SPIOs so thata single MPIO particle\u2014and thus single cell\u2014may MRI. 12,113Imparting high sensitivity, MPIOs were administered intravenously to rats receiving a heart transplantation. Macro-phages readily took up the particles in vivo and infiltrated the heart as observed by MRI in live animals, providing a macrophage-based proxy to sensitively detect acute cardiacrejection after solid organ transplantation. In an example of an immunoimaging approach that is made possible by nanotechnology, magneto-motive ultrasoundimaging (MM-US) was employed using intravenously-injectedSPIOs. MM-US, like MPI, requires magnetic NPs as contrastin order to generate images, with signal existing where NPs localize and nowhere else; this results in extremely high contrast-to-noise ratios akin to nuclear imaging modalitiessuch as PET and SPECT. MM-US creates signal by focusingstrong magnetic fields to induce motion in tissue, which inthis case was measured using ultrasound, 114but can also be measured using OCT or PAI.16After injection, the pattern and dynamics of macrophage SPIO uptake in the liver was readilyquantified. Imaging techniques in which NPs are required such as MM-US and MPI are gaining visibility, and particularly have strong potential for sensitive, non-radioactive whole-bodyimmune cell tracking applications. Nuclear imaging has likewise proven valuable to visualize macrophages. Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) arecancer progression indicators, and TAM influencetherapeutic responses to immunotherapy. Therefore, a 64Cu-labeled polyglucose NP was developed for TAM quantification. Intriguingly, PET data showed that TAM-rich tumors accumulated 4700% higher amounts of a model therapeutic NP compared to TAM-deficient tumors, suggesting that the radiolabeledTAM-targeted polyglucose NP strategy could be eventually usedfor patient stratification in immunotherapy trials. 115 iii. Monitor inflammation/cellular activation Commonly-used, clinically viable non-invasive imaging approaches with PET using tracer FDG, or with MRI using gadolinium as the contrast agent, can be used to provide the metabolic and anatomicinformation (respectively) that is often associated with the patho-physiology of inflammation. 116,117FDG-PET has tremendous sensitivity with spatial resolutions limited to about 0.5 cm inhumans, whereas MRI provides higher-resolution images but withmuch lower sensitivity to molecular contrast. FDG-PET signal isdictated by glucose utilization in vivo , and since activated immune cells increase their energy needs, they can be preferentially visualized. However, the heart, brain, and malignancies aretissues with high glucose utilization, so their inflammation cannot easily be imaged with FDG. Other PET tracers have beendeveloped for T cell activation to p rovide insights into inflamma- tion and immune cell therapies, b ut these are not yet widely used clinically. 8,118The multi-functional capab ility of NP-based probes can provide several t ypes of contrast, a ma jor strength that has propelled their use as multi modality imaging agents.13The purpose of this approach is to synergistically combine the advant-ages of each modality and overcome their limitations. As opposedto a single contrast agent or molecul ar tracer, NPs are customizable for multifunctionality based on th eir large surface area and struc- tural diversity, offering significant opportunities for imaging giventheir long circulation time in blood. These aspects of nanomaterialsmake them an attractive option to existing, and future, small molecule agents for in vivo molecular imaging. 119 Multifunctional imaging NPs based on a magneto- fluorescent NP structure were used for cardiovascular MRI todetect myocarditis. These NPs eectively discriminated betweengrades of inflammation in experi mental autoimmune myocarditis (EAM) rat models as they were take n up into various inflammatory cells within the inflamed myocardium. The NPs thereby enabledassessment of the progression of my ocardial inflammation in the same animal over time. 120In another example, the chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5), was targeted at a late stage of atherosclerosisusing 64Cu-DOTA-DAPTA-comb NPs to examine receptor specific uptake in PET/CT imaging.121These NPs accumulated in the lesions to a greater extent tha n in normal tissues based on targeting to various immune cells including macrophages, DCs,and T cells which express CCR5 for native homing purposes. iv. Monitoring immunotherapy as a theranostic The ability to monitor the ecacy of an immune treatment in real time is often critical for better therapeutic outcomesfor patients. 122Clinical readouts of ecacy generally rely on indirect measurements, which often do not fully reflect actualeects. All major in vivo imaging modalities have already beenReview Nanoscale Horizons Published on 11 December 2019. Downloaded on 10/12/2021 9:24:11 PM.

While various applications of immunotherapy monitoring were discussed in Section 3(ii)a, here we focus our discussion on the theranostic applications of nano-immunoimaging. Theranostics is an emerging biomedicalbranch nourished by development in the diverse fields ofmaterials science, synthetic chemistry, and molecular imaging.'Theranostic' is defined as a combination of therapy anddiagnostic imaging, 123merging these conventionally separate approaches into a single delivery 'package' which has the potential to overcome undesirable dierences in biodistribution and selectivity that currently exist between distinct imaging andtherapeutic agents. 124,125Immunotheranostic NPs can be highly beneficial both for drug delivery and monitoring immunotherapyin translational medicine. 124 a. Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB). Immune check- point blockade (ICB) therapy, using antibodies that targetprimarily cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4) and programmed cell death protein 1 pathway (PD-1)/programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1), shows great promise for a variety ofmalignancies. However, due to he terogeneity in patient response, ICB therapy still has less than a 30% success rate. Therefore,prompt identification of potential responders and nonrespondersto therapy is crucial for improving treatment decisions and patientoutcomes. 126ICB-based nano-immunoimaging approaches generally include conjugation of an ICB to an NP, such as anti-PD-L1 linked to gold NPs to serve as CT agents for visualizing NP uptake into PD-L1-expressing tumor cells to stratifyresponders to anti-PD-L1 therapy versus non-responders. 127However, visualization of the immune response to ICB in the nano-immunoimaging paradigm is still an emerging field. One recent example of ICB imaging adopted optical imaging in the near-infrared window to aord high-resolution imagingat sub-centimeter tissue depths. Multiplexed molecular imagingc a nb ec o n f i g u r e dt oe n a b l es i m u l t a n e o u so p t i c a lm o n i t o r i n go fseveral dierent molecular targ ets, including PD-L1 expression and immune cell status to enhance prediction of immuno-therapeutic response.

Given that PD-L1 is a checkpoint related to CD8+ T cellability to destroy tumor cells, simultaneous quantification of the localization of PD-L1 and cytotoxic CD8+ tumor cells could help predict whether anti-PD-L1 therapy is likely to be successful inindividual patients.

By contrast, highly prominent PbS-aCD8 signals in the liver and spleen, with reduced tumor signals, were observed in tumor-bearing mice injected with PbS-aCD8 alone without PD-L1 antibody treatment.Nanoscale Horizons Review Published on 11 December 2019.

CAR-T cell therapy is an approach for treating cancer involving programming patient-derived T cells to target cancer cells once they are reinfused. Although CAR-T cells have produced impressive results in several ongoingclinical trials assessing the safety and ecacy of CAR-T celltherapies in patients with leukemia and solid tumors, theapproach is expensive, can take several weeks to complete,and requires special expertise and equipment. To make CAR-Tcell therapy potentially accessible to more patients, an NP wasdeveloped, containing DNA instructions to make a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) that recognizes leukemia cells, to specifically target T cells. 129The goal was to make an ''o- the-shelf'' CAR T-cell nanotherapy and contained several keyelements: (i) the gene for a CAR that binds to CD19; (ii) peptidescontaining microtubule-associated sequences and nuclearlocalization signals, as a means to facilitate fast-track nuclearimport of the genetic cargo T cell-targeting anti-CD3e for selective T cell binding; (iv) GFP/Luc was incorporated into the NP, and its in vivo activity and location were monitored via optical imaging, yielding a theranostic that can be used to helpimprove NP ecacy. In a mouse model of acute lymphoblasticleukemia treated with the NPs, CAR T-cells expanded rapidly,increasing 5.5-fold over 6 days. Mice treated with functionalNPs went into remission or had a substantial reduction intumor number and size, indicated by the bioimaging methods, and lived significantly longer than the control mice ( Po0.0001). Unfortunately, due to the promi scuous CD3-based targeting, some NPs bound to immune cells other than T cells and a smallproportion of these cells took up the NPs and expressed the CAR,but this expression diminished over time. However, with thecurrent NP design, the CAR gene inserts randomly into T cellDNA, potentially resulting in a harmful mutation; toxicities arisingfrom CAR expression in non-T cells clearly must be further evaluated. 129Imaging of the tracking and proliferation using o p t i c a lt e c h n i q u e sw i l lb eak e yt ot h i se v a l u a t i o n ,e n s u r i n gt h a tthe mechanism of action and potential toxicities are understood. Human cytokine-induced killer (CIK) cells loaded with gold nanorods (AuNRs) were used in a nano-immunotheranosticapproach which paired photoacoustic imaging with photo-thermal therapy to diagnose/treat gastric cancer. 130Human CIKs were labeled with silica-modifi e dA u N R sb yi n c u b a t i o n .L a b e l e d CIK cells inhibited the growth of gastric cancer MGC803 cells in vitro by inducing cell apoptosis an d killed MGC803 cells under low power density near-infrared (NIR) laser treatment. The labeledCIK cells actively targeted and a llowed imaging of subcutaneous gastric cancer in vivo via photoacoustic imaging at 4 h post- injection. These cells enhanced immunotherapy ecacy and IFN-g, and successfully killed gastric cancer tissues viaphoto- thermal irradiation using AuNRs. Novel carbon nanodots (CDs) were incorporated in an ordered framework of mesoporous silica (CD@MSNs) as adierent type of cancer nano-immunotheranostic strategy. 131 These NPs display biodegradable features via swelling induction and gathering dispersive CDs for elevated targetingaccumulation/retention in the tumor with subsequent photo- thermal imaging-guided Photo Thermal Therapy (PTT). In a novel advance, biodegraded debris could selectively enter immune organs with accompanying tumor-associated antigens(TAAs) from the malignant tumor cells. Therefore, CD@MSNs-mediated PTT synergistically achieved immune-mediatedinhibition of distant tumor metastasis by stimulating the pro-liferation and (IFN- gand innovative insights into biodegradable NP-associated anticancer immunity. Nevertheless, the potential for clinical translation in these studies may be limited for severalreasons: (i) optical imaging a nd photothermal imaging suer from limited signal penetration due to tissue attenuation, whichrenders them relevant only to very specific superficial humanapplications; and (ii) length of degradation time, tumor tissue selectivity, and potential NP to xicity-induced side eects. c. Nanotheranostics for inflammation. Islet transplantation has emerged as a clinical modality for restoring normoglycemia in patients with type 1 diabetes. The survival and function of isletgrafts is compromised by immune rejection-related factors.Protection of islet grafts from immune-mediated rejection, forexample using RNA interference, holds promise for improvingislet graft survival post transplantation. A theranostic NPconjugated to small interfering ribonucleic acid (siRNA) targetingb(2) macroglobulin (a component o f the major histocompatibility class I complex) enabled monitoring of graft persistence non- invasively viaMRI; this approach, which does not measure immune cells directly, represents an indirect class of immuno-imaging. In particular, longitudinal MRI monitored humanislets labeled with these protective nanodrugs and showedsignificant improvement in preservation of graft volume\u2014indicative of a reduction in immune-mediated rejection. Indeed,animals transplanted with protect ive nanodrug-labeled islet graft showed a significant delay in diabetes onset post-adoptive transfer of T cells versus controls due to significantly reduced CD8+ T cell infiltration in islet grafts as verified by histology. 125For clinical translation, limitations remain. One limitation of this siRNAt h e r a p ym e t h o di st h a tb yb l o c k i n gM H Cc l a s sIm o l e c u l ee x p r e s -s i o n ,N Kc e l l sw o u l db ea c t i v a t e db e c a u s et h e ya r ei n h i b i t e db yubiquitously expressed MHC clas s I molecules. To overcome this problem, cocktail siRNAs might be used to target other cell types or molecules which are related to immune rejection, including NK cells, in future studies. Another limitation related to this ther- anostic method is the imaging mod ality used for monitoring islet grafts. Despite the overall safety of transplanted islets labeled withSPIO NPs, image interpretation a nd quantification of the trans- planted islets remain very challenging. Signal voids in MR imagesproduced by iron labeled islets/islet clusters may be dicult todistinguish from other low MR signals produced by tissues, including intestine and blood ve ssel structures, or artifacts. v. Molecular nano-immunoimaging a. Molecular targeting. To enhance NP selectivity and detection sensitivity, an alternative to passive targeting (as describedin Section 3.2) is active targeting, which has been explored byReview Nanoscale Horizons Published on 11 December 2019. Downloaded on 10/12/2021 9:24:11 PM. View Article Online640 |Nanoscale 628- -653 Royal Society of Chemistry 2020functionalizing NPs with ligands11and allows the selective binding of characteristic proteins and receptors over-expressed on the surface of specific subsets of immune cells. Selective immune cell targeting can also arise intrinsically from NPs, such as thecase of NPs very selectively taken up into inflammatory mono-cytes (described below). The vast majority of active targetingrequires a biomolecule ligand, and in the following, we divideour discussions according to the type of ligand utilized. Bothinnate and adaptive immune cells can be targeted and imagedvialigand-based approaches. I. Carbohydrate targeting. Carbohydrates are ubiquitous in nature, and play many important roles in biological recognitionincluding immune cell interactions with their targets. 132NPs coated with carbohydrates on the surface can potentially mimic immune recognition processes, allowing NP interaction with immune cells. For example, CD44 is a cell adhesion moleculeover-expressed on the surface of immune cells, includingmacrophages. 133The endogenous ligand for CD44 is repeating glu-curonic acid disaccharides linked with N-acetyl glucosamine; 134 HA can bind ICAM-1, LYVE-1, TLR-4 expressed on macrophages. To target macrophages, SPIOs were coated with HA on the external surface through amide bonds (HA-SPIOs).135,136 These NPs were biocompatible wit h cells and colloidally stable in the presence of serum proteins . The HA immobilized on SPIOs retained its biological recogni tion of CD44. Cellular studies demonstrated HA-SPIO uptake b y activated macrophages was HA- and CD44-dependent, and the level of HA-SPIO uptake was4 times higher than that of SPIOs without HA coating. HA-SPIOs can be used to non-invasively detect inflammatory atherosclerotic plaques. 135In a rabbit model of atherosclerosis, upon administration of the HA-SPIOs, significant contrastchanges in aorta walls were observed in T 2*-weighted MR images, allowing detection of atherosclerotic plaques. Withthe advantage that HA-SPIOs strongly bind to CD44-expressingmacrophages, the dosage of HA-SPIO (0.21 mg Fe per kg of bodyweight) needed was much lower than that typically used for SPIOswithout HA coating (56 mg Fe per kg of body weight), highlighting one benefit of NP molecular targeting. One potential drawback for SPIOs is their inherent inflam- matory activities, including induction of oxidative stress andtoxicity in cells. 137While HA coating reduced inflammatory responses, upon incubation with macrophages in vitro or intravenous injection into mice, HA-SPIOs can elicit significantinflammatory cytokine production, such as TNF- a. Interestingly, nanomaterial morphology impacted their inflammatoryactivity. Worm-like iron oxide n anoworms (NWs) were synthesized a n df u n c t i o n a l i z e dw i t hH A , 138and were shown to induce much lower inflammatory responses in macrophages in vitro and in mice than the corresponding spherically-shaped HA-SPIOs at the samedose, suggesting key NP shape eects. 75,139Cellular uptake of HA-NWs was also significantly higher than that of sphericalHA-SPIOs. Thus, HA-NWs were able to detect atheroscleroticplaque in a mouse model of atherosclerosis (Fig. 6) based ontheir superior immune cell-targeting, safety, and in vivo perfor- mance properties. Besides imaging, HA-NPs can have therapeutic eects. A type of HA-NP was prepared by reacting PET/MRI of rabbits demonstrated6-fold higher standard ized uptake values compared to the control tissue. Therapeutic eects of HA-NPs were studied on athero- sclerosis in ApoE /C0//C0mice, which received weekly injections of HA-NPs for 12 weeks. The results showed the HA-NP-treatedmouse lesions were significantly smaller than the controlgroup, and contained approximately 30% fewer macrophages.Histological examination further revealed that both local andsystemic HA-NP-im mune cell interactions si gnificantly decreased throughout disease progression. 140 Carbohydrate mimetics as targeting agents.

During inflammation, the levels of E-selectins are upregulated, which can lead toenhanced binding of sLeX-coated NPs, and thus serve as a proxyfor enhanced leukocyte tracking. Due to the syntheticchallenges in accessing sLeX, sLeX mimetics such as 1have been designed to interact with sele ctin; these mimetics have been immobilized on NPs, polymers, lipids (Fig. 7). 142-144When injected intravenously into a murine hepatitis model, sLeX-SPIOsinduced a significantly lower attenuation of MR liver signalintensity compared to healthy mice or uncoated SPIOs in hepatitismice, suggesting that sLeX-SPIOs a re suitable for MRI diagnosis of inflammation. Sialoadhesin (Siglec-1 or CD169) is a member of the sialic Ig-like lectin (siglec) family expressed on macrophages. 145Its macrophage-specific expression makes it an attractive target for antigen delivery through Siglec-1 mediateduptake. 146Siglec-1 can bind sialyl- LacNAc trisaccharide 2. Structure- modification based on molecule 2led to the analog 3(Fig. 8), which has significantl y enhanced selectivity toward siglec-1 over other members of the siglec family. Fluorescently-labeled lipo-somes formulated with analog 3were internalized much more readily by siglec-1-expressing cells than naked liposomes. 146 Furthermore, over 10-fold improved selectivities were observedin Siglec-1 cells compared to cells expressing other siglec receptors.The Siglec-1-targeted liposomes d ramatically enhanced the delivery of to macrophages for presentation to, and enhancedproliferation of, antigen-specific T cells in mice. II. Peptide and protein targeting. Beside carbohydrates and their mimics, peptides have been utilized as targeting agents. For example, peptide sequence CDSDSDITWDQLWDLMK,identified viaphage display, binds tightly to E-selectin with K din the nM range. The peptide was immobilized on fluorescently- labeled SPIOs through the N-terminus cysteine,147which was important to preserve the interactions with E-selectin. The selectinbinding peptide-SPIOs were rapidly internalized by activated human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) mediated by E-selectin, which was readily de tected by optical fluorescence imaging versus SPIOs with a scrambled control peptide. The high selectivity of peptide-SPIOs toward E-selectin by fluorescence imagi ng of the activated in a mouse tumor model. Thus, pept ide-based selectin targeting complements choices of carbohydrate ligands as NP-directed cular adhesion and the transendothelial migration of leuko-cytes, such as macrophages and T cells (see also Sections 3.3and 3.4c). It is associated with the progression of diseases suchas atherosclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, and cancer. 148To detect inflammatory cell in at herosclerosis, VCAM-1 targeting VHPKQHR these VCAM-1 targeting nanoprobes not only helped identify inflammation in ea rly atherosclerotic development, but also enabled real-time detection of VCAM-1 expressionin vivo for monitoring pharmacotherapy-induced reductions of inflammation reflected in VCAM-1 expression levels. To target dying cells in vivo , the protein Annexin V was bound to SPIOs and injected into a rabbit model of athero-sclerosis, the Watanabe Heritable Hyperlipidemic-Myocardial Infarction rabbit. 150Since Annexin V can bind to phosphatidyl- serine presented on the outer m embrane leaflets of apoptotic cells, injected SPIOs tended to localize in dying/dead macro-phages and debris within the athe rosclerotic plaque, providing an MRI-based assessment of plaque progression using T 2*- weighted MRI. The use of this mole cular targeting strategy not to a cell type, but to a particular ce ll state (apoptosis) primarily experienced by macrophag es in plaques, permitted B200-fold less SPIOs to be injected for MR detection of inflamed plaque versus untargeted SPIOs. A multifunctional core-shell NP system was developed for DC-based cancer immunotherapy.61These NPs are composed of an SPIO core coated with a photonic zinc oxide (ZnO) shellwith diameters of 16 nm. Novel peptides were developed tobind the ZnO shell, providing a new approach to anchorantigens on the NP surface and deliver those antigens to DCs. Interestingly, the Fe 3O4-ZnO NPs were taken up more rapidly than Fe 3O4NPs without the ZnO shell, although the final levels of uptake were similar at 24 hours. Injection of DCs loaded withNPs into mice successfully boosted anti-cancer immunity,enhancing tumor antigen-specific T-cell responses, inhibiting Fig. 7 Structures of sLeX and sLeX mimetic 1used as a targeting ligand for NP imaging.

MRI was used to track the NP-labeled DCs in draining lymphnodes after ipsilateral footpad injection in the animal models,ensuring that treatment occurred at the appropriate site andallowing longitudinal measurements (Fig. 9). This type of core-shell NP design could be a platform for DC-based immuno-therapies that track DCs in vivo for consistent clinical efficacy. Immunosuppression bestowed by Tregs in tumor micro- environments is a major mechanism of tumor immune escapeand a significant hurdle to suc cessful cancer immunotherapy. 151 Neuropilin-1 (Nrp1) is a cell glycoprotein a is peptide was functionalized with a phospholipid fluorescently labeled D,L-lactide- co- glycolide) (PLGA) NPs.153The inclusion peptide uptake of the NPs 3-fold compared to bareNPs. Upon administration of tLyp1-NPs into tumor bearingmice, fluorescence imaging exhibited significant signal fromTregs residing in tumor tissues. In contrast, little fluorescencewas found in mice receiving NPs bearing the control peptide, demonstrating that tLyp1 eectively targets intratumoral Tregs. Understanding where and how much immunosuppressionoccurs in the context of disease is an important and rapidlyburgeoning field, and diagnostic NPs that can spatiotemporallyand quantitatively provide such information can lead the way.For clinical applications, it is likely that instead of fluorophoresthe NP will bear nuclear or magnetic contrast for PET, SPECT,or MR imaging of Tregs. III. Antibody targeting. Antibodies can be attractive alter- natives to carbohydrates and pep tides for immune-targeting due to their potentially high specific ities, as well as the widespread availability of monoclonal an tibodies (mAbs) against many biologically-important targets. Disadvantages may include theirrelatively large size, particularly with respect to peptides, carbohydrates, aptamers, and small molecules. mAb-based inflammation detection is a rapidly growing sub-field. For example, dual-targeted MPIOs were prepared containing mAbsagainst P-selectin and VCAM-1 on their surface. 154The anti- bodies retained their binding specificities upon immobiliza-tion. When administered into ApoE knockout mice the probes bound overlaying atherosclerotic plaques, and were quantifiablebyex Higher levels (5- to 7-fold) of the dual-targeting probes were found at the plaque sites compared to those with a single mAb against either P-sele ctin or VCAM-1, indicating the advantage of dual targeting. However, interestingly, detection ofatherosclerotic plaques in vivo by MRI using mAb-MPIOs has yet to be demonstrated. CD56 and CD16 are standard phenotypic markers of NK cells, suggesting that NK-92MI cells could be labeled with NPsbearing anti-CD56 or anti-CD16 mAbs. 155QDs are suitable for fluorescence imaging due to their high quantum yields and excellent photostability, which can improve detection andimaging sensitivities in vitro and in vivo cells incubated with anti-CD56-QDretained their viability, as well as the ability to produce IFN- g and lyse target cells. This approach, which combines ex vivo labeling and re-injection with molecular targeting, can be more advantageous than electroporation or using positively-charged transfection agents due to the mildness of the labeling method.After intratumoral injection into mouse tumor xenografts, NKcells tagged with QDs could be tracked up to 12 days through QDsignals in human malignant melanoma xenografts in mice. 155 CD8+ T cells are important eector cells of the immune system which can directly kill antigen-matched tumor cells. Totarget endogenous CD8+ T cells, anti-CD8 mAbs were reduced and cleaved. 157The resulting antibody binding (Fab) were immobilized onto fluorophore DiD-labeled PLGA NPsbearing sulfhydryl-reactive mal the anti-CD8 NPs, over 90% of the CD8+ T cells in theblood, spleen and tumor tissues were bound by the NPs as detectedby DiD fluorescence. The NPs persisted on CD8+ T cells for morethan 48 h. Importantly, because only Fab fragments were used,cells labeled by the NPs remained viable without being recognized and killed by Fc receptor-bearing NK cells. In addition, immune activating agents such as TLR7/8 agonists and inhibitors of TGF b signaling could be encapsulated inside the NPs for CD8+ Tcell-targeted delivery to enhance the eects of immunotherapy.This type of theranostic NP can co-deliver various therapeuticagents and imaging agents to target cells and tissues (seeSection 3(iv)). Therefore, suitably-designed theranostic NPs thatcan monitor immune cells or immune responses provide intri- guing opportunities for rapid evaluation of therapeutic eects as well as optimization of treatment processes. Immune cell NP targeting by mAb is modular. Judicious choice of the mAb on NPs could enable targeting of somewhatdefined subsets of endogenous immune cells (although manycells require multiple surface markers to identify them, leading Fig. 9 (left) In vivo T 2weighted MRI images of draining lymph nodes of a mouse 48 hours after injection with DCs labelled with Fe 3O4-ZnO (red arrow) or ZnO NPs (yellow arrow) into the ipsilateral footpads. Localizedhypointense regions within the lymph node marked with the red arrow were identified, indicating the presence of the NP-labelled cells. (right panel) A draining lymph node (green arrow) of cell-free Fe 3O4-ZnO NP- injected mouse showed no contrast changes, indicating it is critical that Fe3O4-ZnO were encapsulated in DCs to lead to MRI contrast changes.Nanoscale Horizons Review Published on 11 December 2019.

Future in vivo imaging strategies could apply such NPs, such as, for example, human caveoline-1 NPs (termed with anti-CD4, anti-CD20, and anti-CCR5mAbs target CD4+ T cells, B and memory CD4+ T cells,respectively. These fluorescently-labeled NPs 158were able to selectively recognize the appropriate target cells within physio-logical mixtures of primary human blood immune cells. Weanticipate that such ecient and flexible immune cell-targeted NP systems will be increasingly employed for the development of advanced nano-immunoimaging approaches, immuno-therapeutics, and vaccines. IV. Intrinsic selectivity. Some NPs display an apparently intrinsic cellular selectivity. While many NPs are preferentiallytaken up by cells like macrophages due to phagocytic prowess,NPs which are themselves intrinsically selective can provide many advantages due to the ability to: (i) target cell subsets other than macrophages, and (ii) inject the NPs in vivo without requiring cell removal viablood draw, isolation, and reinjection. The cost, time, and risk of the cell phenotype changing during thereinjection process makes intrinsic in vivo labeling an extremely attractive alternative to ex vivo labeling. Typically, the biggest challenge is to target a particular cellular sub-populationselectively enough, given that most cell types are identified by a set of multiple cell surface receptors ( e.g., by flow cytometric analyses). Nevertheless, while delivery strategies generally donot require 100% accuracy in targeting to be eective inimaging (and therapy), there must be relatively high specificitywith little o-target uptake. Ly-6Chi murine monocytes in blood took up SWNTs, and less than 3%of any other circulating cell type, including other monocytesubsets, took them up. IVM visualization of these processesrevealed extremely rapid uptake of SWNTs into inflammatorymonocytes and subsequent 'Trojan Horse'-like deposition intothe tumor as observed by IVM 10(Fig. 10) as well as PAI.13The challenge to increase the number of dierent immune cellsubsets ( e.g., high-value targets such CD8+ T cells, NK, and NKT cells) that NPs can target with ultra-high selectivity is a dicult, yet high-reward objective in nano-immunoimaging,one that is critical especially to minimize o-target uptake andpotentially confounding image signal. b. Immune cell-mimicking nanoparticles. NPs are power- ful tools for imaging. One potential complication for the in vivo application of NPs is immune clearance due to immunerecognition of the particles. Poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG), which is believed to provide a steric barrier when attached to NPs, is commonly used to improve NP circulation time. 159However, recent studies have shown that a second dose of PEGylatedNPs is more rapidly cleared when administered several daysa f t e rt h ef i r s td o s e ,l i k e l ya sar e s u l to ft h ed e v e l o p m e n to fl o w -specificity, anti-PEG IgM antibodies. 160One strategy to overcomethis challenge is to coat the nanomaterials with membranes from endogenous cells,161particularly to mimic immune cells.162Early studies used red blood cells (RBC ) as the source cells, obtaining RBC membrane through hypotonic treatment and coatingNPs by extrusion. 163Cell membrane coatings have been expanded to platelets164,165and nucleated immune cells such as neutrophils.166,167These biomimetic NPs present the surface structure of a phospholipid bilayer and other inherent char-acteristics of a cell membrane to the in vivo physiology, helping to extend the circulation time, avoid non-specific immunesystem recognition, and promote tumor targeting. For example,fluorescently-labeled PLGA NPs have been synthesized andcoated with membranes from murine platelets (PLT-NPs). 165 Fluorescent imaging and quantification showed that comparedto bare NPs or red blood cell membrane-cloaked NPs, thePLT-NPs showed significantly enhanced retention in collagens.Furthermore, PLT-NPs reduced uptake by macrophages andparticle-induced complement activation, suggesting membrane bestowed ''stealth'' characteristics to theNPs. Paralleling platelet homing injury sites and interactingwith immune cells, PLT-NPs displayed platelet-like properties by binding to damaged human and rodent vasculatures, and accumulating in inflammatory sites of coronary restenosis.This, in turn, enabled selective drug delivery to treat restenosis.While membrane-coated NPs have yet to be utilized extensivelyto specifically image immune cells, their primary use maybe to image the 'immune-cell-like' NPs wrapped in immunemembrane coatings, such as those of neutrophils, 167in order to track native-like immune homing to tumors and imaging by MRI,164upconversion fluorescence,168or treatment in the anti-cancer vaccine and drug delivery166,167,169paradigm. Despite improved immune escape and long blood retentiontime for cell membrane mimicking NPs, the ability to activelytarget cells and accumulate in targeted tissues requiresimprovement. 170 Fig. 10 SWNT uptake into circulating cells and deposition into tumour in a mouse model of glioblastoma multiforme (u87-mg (SWNT)-laden circulating in tumour vasculature (one example cell is circled).

View Article Online644 |Nanoscale 628- -653 This journal is \u00a9The Royal Society of Monitoring cellular communication viaextracellular Extracellular vesicles (EVs) comprise a variety of nano- vesicles released from all types of cells in the body, and exist in bodily fluids including blood, serum, urine, and bile. Hetero-genous populations of EVs origin: exosomes (30-100 nm in membrane andmicrovesicles (50-1000 nm in diameter) are products fromdirect of plasma membrane. 171EV cargos are cell type-specific ( e.g., DNA, mRNA, proteins, lipids, and metabolites), leading to much recent EV interest due to their potential utility as circulating biomarkers for various diseases.172This attention arises because EVs comprise a mode of int ercellular communication. The most prominent trait is that EVs enclose and transmit biomoleculesencapsulated by a lipid bilayer t o distant organs and often carry selectively-sorted molecules to influence (patho)physiologicalconditions of the recipient cells, which may influence thecellular physiology of distant organs. 173Vital roles of EVs include regulation of cancer progre ssion, metastasis, angiogenesis, immunity, diabetes, and Alzheimer's diseases.174-176 The first report on EV-mediated immune response showed that exosomes bearing MHC-II released from B lymphocytescan present peptide-MHC-II complexes to activate T-cellresponses. 177Numerous exogenous and endogenous methods have been reported for labeling EV membranes or cargo includingfluorescent or bioluminescent reporter molecules, 178,179ultra- radioisotopes such as111In-oxine181and Technetium-99m (99mTc)182for SPECT imaging both in living cells and animals. In vivo use of these tools is providi ng useful information on cell-cell communicat ion during pathogeni c processes in addition to potentially uncovering novel immune cell responses in theform of released vesicles. For example, EVs can be indirectlylabeled with bioluminescent molecules such as gaussia luciferase by fusing the gene to the EV lactadherin, a membrane-associated EV protein. 183SPIO- and99mTc-labeled EVs can allow visualization of their native communicationswith lymph nodes when they are derived from tumor cells, asthey traffic to a specific microanatomical location. 184,185EVs derived from red blood cells have hepatic macrophages. in co-isolation of unwanted proteins during EV purification; moreover, since EVs are derived from cells andnot fully engineered de novo , they may display unanticipated in vivo behaviors. 188While EV imaging remains in its infancy, we project that it will continue to grow eventually into a clinicalproxy of disease pathogenesis, dissemination, communication,and outcome. Key issues in nano-immunoimaging. Although there is agreement on the potential held by the field of nano-immunoimaging,critical issues must be addressed before clinical translation ofrelated nanomaterials: (1) a k ey challenge confronting both in vitro andin vivo loading of NP-based imaging agents to targeted cells is that some NPs ( e.g., those incorporating radioisotopes 189)aect the viability and functions of labeled cells. (2) Precise quantification of cell numbers in vivo : cells take up NPs unevenly,190and imaging accuracy and sensitivity based on NP labels in cells decreases over time due to cell division.(3) Evading o-target uptake of NPs is an ubiquitous problem inthe field of in vivo NP labeling of cells. For instance, injected NPs are invariably taken up by the mononuclear phagocytesystem, in which NPs are rapidly shuttled out of the circulationto non-target organs such as the spleen and liver, which canlead to serious adverse side eects and simultaneously decrease the amount of NPs available to home to the target tissue. For this reason, maximizing selective interactions of NPs with theirimmune targets, typically viaNP surface engineering, is critical. (4) In nano-immunotheranostics, a hybrid between nano-immunoimaging and nano-immunotherapy, a common issueis the dierence in the required mass administered and/orcirculation time between a therapeutic and NP imagingcontrast probes. In vivo imaging strategies aside from nuclear imaging approaches often require higher doses (compared to therapy) to readily discern signal from the area of interestcompared to the surrounding tissue/background (which is thereason why most imaging tracer/contrast probes are designedto be quickly cleared from the blood). Conversely, therapeuticsusually are designed for the opposing eect: to have longercirculation times in order to ensure adequate uptake andsucient therapeutic eects in the t arget cells/tis sues. Balancing the diagnostic and therapeutic parameters requires forethought, thorough understanding of the underlying biological mechanisms,and sometimes good fortune. 4. Potential for clinical translation While nano-focused immunoimaging has a key role to play inpre-clinical imaging (such as elucidating the roles of immunecells and guiding optimal pre-clinical therapeutic approaches),it must succeed in the clinic to fulfill its compelling promise.Currently, the great potential of nano-immunoimaging lies inits ability to quantify if adequate numbers of immune cellstrac to the site of interest, whether and when they are activated, and how long they persist. 8These eorts could make possible a diverse array of revolutionary strategies: (1) idealpatient stratification for a parti cular therapy, especially immuno- therapy, to bolster patient therapeutic outcome; (2) rapid assessmentof patient therapeutic response; (3) companion monitoring tools forpatient management to inform when to switch drugs, and whichnew drugs to select; (4) assessment of delivery localization for locallyor systemically injected therapies; and (5) potentially as a surrogate for disease diagnosis and particularly prognosis. i. Early examples Several pioneering human nano -immunoimaging trials pave the route toward future applications in cancer, atherosclerosis, andhost of other inflammatory and immune-related conditions. 13,67,104 Most trials involve iron oxide nanomaterials, an in vivo labeling agent which tends to tag highly phagocytic cells such asNanoscale Horizons Review Published on 11 December 2019.

Because of the lack of selectivity, these agents have informed on the approximate biodistribution and dynamics, but thus far have not provided a true representationabout macrophage location or activity. On the other hand, Figdor,Bulte, and colleagues magnetically labeled autologous dendriticcells with iron oxides and re-injected them into melanoma patients'lymph nodes. 191Their MRI strategy ensured accurate delivery of the cells within the lymph nodes and tracked inter- and intranodalmigration patterns\u2014key data points that could not have been obtained otherwise, such as with scintigraphy. A potential limitation of this strategy is that MRI signals may not accurately reflect thelabeled autologous dendritic cells. If/when labeled cells die, NPsm i g h tb er e l e a s e da n dc o u l db ef r e ew i t h i nt h ei n t e r s t i t i a ls p a c eo rtaken up by other cells; thus, under some conditions, some MRIsignal could be false positive. Nev ertheless, these groundbreaking examples of clinical nano-immunoimaging help direct pre-clinicalfocus to fulfill the promise of the field. ii. Vision for the field and clinical roadmap The last approximately half a decade has seen explosive growth in pre-clinical nano-immunoimaging, driven by the successesof immunotherapy in the clinic. Nevertheless, there remainsoutstanding opportunity in the as-yet-unexplored areas of thefield. Innovations in nanomaterials chemistry will inevitablydrive enhanced nano-based multifunctionality, theranostics, as well as newer imaging modalities that require NPs to function such as MPI and MM-US, 13but key to the growth of the field and its clinical applications is to match nanomaterials,immune cells, and disease models with the appropriate appli-cation. Too often, nanomaterials are employed with the easiestavailable model to provide proof-of-principle immunoimaging,rather than developing the collaborations with physicians andrelated scientists that are necessary to pinpoint the most relevant or appropriate application. Likewise, improvement in animal models of disease, part icularly those with complete, unadulterated immune systems, is a related field that will stronglyimpact the clinical translatabi lity of nano-immunoimaging. Another major pre-clinical field that is likely to increasingly impact nano-immunoimaging involves living nano-contrastagents ( e.g., contrast agent-producing bacteria) that were recently introduced and that may be capable of dividing intracellularly and thus be used to address the problem of probe dilution during cell division (recently reviewed). 192,193 These 'living NPs' loaded into th e cytoplasm of living mammalian cells have been used to image labeled cancer cells in animalmodels of human disease 194,195but the opportunities oered by living contrast agents to counte ract dilution due to cell division have yet not been realized, and the agents have not yet been usedin immune cells. The initial nano-immunoimaging patient applications most likely to be successful will minimize disruption to clinicalworkflow. Thus, given the needs o f its sister discipline immuno- therapy, immunotheranostics and b asic cell tracking are likely to be the first clinical applications. For instance, CAR-T cells aregenerally already engineered outside the body, therefore ex vivolabeling using iron oxide or gold NPs for MRI, PET, and/or CT (or some combination thereof) is likely to be relatively inexpensive and straightforward in order to track t heir localization, persistence, and dynamics in patients. Transplanted pancreatic islet cells loadedwith contrast NPs may likewise serve as a strong early clinicalapplication to track persistence and survival of pancreatic islet graftsas a proxy for immune rejection. 5. Conclusions Nano-immunoimaging is a rapidly burgeoning field. It islimited by many of the same challenges that face the fieldsthat comprise it: in nano, there are materials, size, and surfacecoating-based toxicity barriers to overcome in order to attainregulatory approvals and common clinical usage; in imaging,one faces the limitations inherent in each imaging modality (e.g., MRI is expensive, uses large magnetic fields, has fairly low sensitivity, and takes fairly long times; PET and SPECT employradioactivity and have relatively poor spatial resolution, etc.); in immunology, one is limited by both the basic biology of theimmune system, such as the molecular markers and functionsthat dierentiate one cell type f rom another, and by our knowledge of it. Aside from the specter of improving basic immunobiology, allthe other challenges are currently being investigated feverishly in the respective fields. We therefore anticipate that in the near-term, initial clinical applications in cell tracking will showcase the utilityof nano-immunoimaging, while pre-clinical studies will drive thefield toward its full potential. In the medium- to longer-term, attheir best, nano-immunoimaging agents will integrate seamlesslyinto the clinical workflow, helping physicians stratify their patientsfor treatment planning, monitor their patients' therapeuticresponses to rapidly change treatment plans as necessary, and ultimately to treat and transmit diagnostic and prognostic information simultaneously as nano-immunotheranostics.
