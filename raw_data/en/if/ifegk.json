So, how about taking some time to reflect upon the various ways in which cooking affects our whole being? Quality Ancient wisdom teaches us that the quality of the food we eat is intrinsically linked with our level of health and the quality of our lives. In the past 200 years, since the advent of modern agriculture and food processing, our diet has progressively moved further and further away from the natural foods, which sustained traditional people all over the Earth for centuries. It is vital to return to basics, to honour and use more natural ingredients, especially the ones that come from mother Earth, such as: vegetables, grains, beans and vegetarian proteins, seeds, nuts, fruits... We all know by now, that providing our body with the best possible quality is the optimal recipe for health and well-being. Using organic foods as well as good quality water, should be the first step towards: * Strengthening blood quality. Keeping the right pH in our blood, so that the body doesn't need to keep using minerals, vital for our bones, teeth, and nervous system, to maintain the blood alkaline level required; * Strengthening our immune system; * Regulating blood sugar level. Maintaining a steady level of energy during the day; * Providing our bodies with the ability to cleanse naturally. Cooking Styles Cooking operates on many levels, the most obvious of which consists in the preparation of foods to nourish our body, creating fuel to generate vitality and energy. But each cooking style will create a very different effect in us, according to the amount of flame, time, seasonings and amount of water used. This may be something that we never experienced or thought about previously. Eating a raw salad will create a more cooling effect, very appropriate for hot weather, whereas a long hot casserole will produce a deep and internal heat, very useful in a damp and cold weather. There are many different cooking styles, for example: marinating, pickling, pressing, sprouting, blanching, boiling, steaming, quick stir-fry, grilling, pan frying, frying, stewing, baking, roasting, barbecuing, Pressure cooking, casseroles, etc., just to mention a few. Not only will these cooking styles affect our body temperature, but they will also generate different qualities of Energetic Effects in us. For example: stir-frying (high flame, lots of movement) will generate a more active effect in us than if we eat something steamed or cooked over a small and slow flame, a method very useful when we want to relax after a very active day. |Cooking Styles With:||Will weather| The Alchemy of Cooking Depending on the nature of the ingredients and cooking methods chosen, different reactions and effects will be produced in the body - effects that are not only related to calories, vitamins, minerals and fibres, but also to Energy and Vibration. When we speak of Energy, we are speaking of the force we call Life. The Chinese refer to it as Ch'I Energy and liken it to the streams, rivers, lakes, seas and oceans of Earth. This Life Force flows in and around us like a current, although we cannot actually see it, we can see the manifestation of it and feel its effects. Food also contains Life Force or Ch'I, and so the choice of the food we eat will determine the quality of the energy present in our body, mind, emotions and spirit. We are very readily happy to accept the healing power and effects of natural herbs, like camomile, thyme, sage, fennel, etc, but perhaps have never questioned the effect of other plants, like vegetables, fruits, grains, seeds, nuts... All foods have Life Force and will create different reactions, according to their 'personality' and nature and how they are prepared. We already know some of this at an unconscious level. In the summer, we prefer to eat more fresh salads and fruits than in the cold winter months. Maybe, this is because we know that these foods will cool us down and will produce a more refreshing reaction? At the same time, we prefer a hot soup or stew when it is cold, wet and damp, maybe because applying fire to our cooking, will create a more deeper warming effect than raw food? These are things we know instinctively although we may never have thought them out in this way. Daily Cooking Time inevitably has to be set aside each day for preparation of fresh, wholesome foods, yet with some forward thinking and planning, the amount of time spent in the kitchen need not be excessive. Eating frozen, tinned and ready-prepared foods, is certainly one way of saving time, but the consequences of failing to give due care and attention to the preparation of wholesome meals will soon affect our overall level of vitality and well-being. The long term effects of relying on devitalized, saturated and processed foods will be noticeable at all levels of our being, as the purpose of eating reaches far beyond nurturing the physical body. Interestingly enough, people that say they don't have time to cook, eat processed foods and ready-prepared meals, and are usually the ones that spend the whole day snacking. Maybe this is due to a lack of deep satisfaction and deep nourishment? Is it much better to have wholesome meals, and then forget totally about physical foods for many hours?? Our digestive system also needs proper breaks. Do you want to live in order to eat or to eat in order to live? The choice is always ours! It seems that the whole of humanity has a deep lack of sweetness in life?! Maybe this important lack starts in the kitchen? Our mothers and grandmothers cooked every day, adding the most important ingredients of love and presence to their stews, casseroles and soups. Love is generated by attention and time. In our lives, if we give time to 'something or somebody', we will harvest Love too. Vibrant, fresh and simply cooked foods are required to create clarity and a sense of direction in our lives. Cooking with this awareness doesn't have to take forever, especially if the ingredients remain simple. Needs and Wants So many people are stuck in this circle all their lives, because they don't understand their body messages. They think it is important to eat healthy foods, but their 'wants' are very different to their 'needs'. They keep tormenting themselves and unnecessary inner-battles and self-judgements creating in their lives, with not only loss of outer vitality and energy, but also their self-confidence and will. The answer, is very simple. We need to understand the energy and effect that our body wants at a particular moment, and to observe if we are lacking that specific effect in our daily cooking. This is the body's way to speak to us, we just need the translation. Example 1: Maybe our body wants lots of chocolate and sugary cakes. Maybe we are not providing our body with the right: * Sweetness; * The 'creaminess'; * The right amount or quality of protein; * Or we are hardly eating any slow, staple carbohydrates; * Maybe we are lacking in fresh vegetables or fruits; * Or our intake of salt and salty snacks is excessive; * Or maybe, it is not a physical need at all, but an emotional need that cannot be satisfied with physical foods? Example 2: Maybe our body wants excessive amounts of fried foods, crisps and chips. Maybe this because we are lacking in: * The right amount of good quality oils during proper meal times? * Or lacking in good quality and quantity of proteins? * Maybe, wanting to be 'healthy', we drastically cut down on animal proteins? Remember quick and drastic changes don't last! They create more imbalances, as happen when we lack in knowledge and respect for our physical body. * Or richness, in general, and not just connected to oils. Richness comes from long-cooking stews, bean casseroles, hearty hot-pots; Maybe, we had been on a cleansing diet, overdid it, and now need rich greasy food? * Or maybe, everything we eat is wet and damp, and we need the dry and crunchy texture of fried foods? * Or maybe, we are eating crunchy cold salads and fruit, to be healthy, but our body is craving warmth and warming foods? * Or perhaps, it is an emotional need, rather than a physical one? |Our body's needs are for:||In the form of:||Naturally supplied by:| |Energy and vitality, Nourishment of our Nervous system||Carbohydrates||Complex sugars in form of whole cereal grains, will give a constant supply of energy and vitality.| |Body building and repair||Proteins||Good quality organic animal foods (especially fish), as well as vegetarian proteins (beans, seeds, nuts, tofu...)| |Regulating blood pH, nourishing the nervous system, muscles, bones...||Minerals||Unrefined sea salt, organic root vegetables, sea vegetables.| |Promotion of metabolic processes, fibre||Vitamins||Land vegetables (roots rounds, dark leafy greens), fruits.| |For proper functioning, body temperature||Fat/Oils||Cold pressed unrefined oils, nuts and seeds.| |To restore intestinal flora, better absorption of nutrients||Fermented Foods||Traditionally fermented foods (pickles, soy sauce...)| The causes are endless, but with a deep energetic knowledge of the effects of foods and preparations, we can create a completely different perspective of this vital ritual that is nourishing to ourselves. We can also be totally free of guilt, as we become more open and accepting of our inner messages and needs, providing them with care, compassion and understanding. Healthy natural food and cooking, doesn't mean boring, with lack of colour, shapes, textures and excitement. Nature provides us with an incredible abundance of colours and natural flavours: from the bright green broccoli, to the wholesome pumpkin, carrot or sweetcorn, to the pungent taste of radishes and red cabbage, to crunchy bitter salads, endives, watercress, or juicy cucumbers, etc. The variety is endless and as we try to cook more simply, we will slowly grow to enjoy the flavours of natural ingredients.

Case Study Marylyn M Marylyn, a 49-year-old secretary, had started to develop a range of debilitating menopausal symptoms. She discovered she had a fibroid the size of a grapefruit and was advised to have a hysterectomy. She decided to decline the offer of surgery, and first try a natural diet and life-style under my supervision. Symptoms: Severe back pain, due to a condition of stress and imbalance of the kidneys, plus long-standing itching and running ears, which needed regular syringing, also directly related to her weak kidney condition. She also suffered from extreme fatigue, depression, a small patch of eczema on the face, lack of concentration and poor memory. She was very tense, with a history of heavy smoking, alcohol abuse and an excess consumption of dairy products. She was no longer smoking and had enormously reduced her alcohol intake, but she still lived on and loved cheese, gold top milk, yoghurts, egg sandwiches and marmite. She would constantly nibble hard salty cheese prior to menstruation. Her menstrual cycle had begun to shorten, but was not giving cause for concern. A diet was formulated to help regenerate her kidney energy, and at the same time cleanse her body of the deep accumulating effects of excess of eggs and dairy products. The natural diet style recommended an abundance of a variety of lightly cooked vegetables, sea vegetables and some whole grains. The protein was provided by mainly vegetarian protein (from a variety of beans and vegetable proteins such as tofu, tempeh and seitan), as well as some seeds and a small amount of white fish. Some specific dishes, drinks and compresses were also recommended to help with the cleansing process. Energetically (and physically), fibroids are merely a collection of fats, combined with, of course, emotional and mental unprocessed issues. Marylyn's fibroid had taken many years to accumulate and was a result (at a physical/ dietary level) of past extreme eating and a lack of fibre and vegetables. In her new diet, oil was reduced as well were a lot of raw fruits and cooling juices, which can have a cooling effect, freezing existing fats. Cooked fruits were recommended instead for a while. Marylyn's pain subsided and her ear condition improved dramatically. Her progress was monitored on a monthly basis. Our energetic needs keep changing and as they do so, we can't follow the same directions as a few months previously. When Marylyn visited her GP for an examination six months later, she was delighted to be told that the fibroid had halved in size. Over the course of the next few months, Marylyn's energy levels continued to rise, her cycle lengthened and other symptoms were considerably. She had a further medical check after another six months and was told that the fibroid was now so small that it was difficult to locate. An operation was deemed unnecessary. As her symptoms gradually improved and totally disappeared, her diet was extended and relaxed to be part of a life-style that could be maintained as a natural way of life.
