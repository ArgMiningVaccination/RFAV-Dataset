The Center for Diversity and Inclusion, in partnership with numerous departments and advisory groups at OHSU, has created or cultivated a number of resources to help meet the institution's diversity goals. Below is a sample of information and support available to the OHSU community. [Faculty Diversity Fund](#accordion-26646-1) This fund serves to supplement financial support for faculty recruitment and retention, on a limited duration. A decision may take 2-4 weeks depending on the availability of executive reviewers. [President Diversity Fund Request for Recruitment and Retention application](https://www.ohsu.edu/sites/default/files/2020-11/Faculty%20Diversity%20Fund%20Request%20for%20Recruitment%20and%20Retention%20Form%5B1%5D.pdf) Please fill out the form and email Linzy Rodrigues at the Provost Office. [Community Diversity Resource Guide](#accordion-26646-2) A list of community resources, organizations and businesses in the Portland area that serve the needs of diverse, multicultural communities. We offer this Community Diversity Resource Guide for general information only and not as an endorsement or guarantee to any services or service providers listed in the guide. [Diversity Resources on Campus](#accordion-26646-3) The Center for Diversity and Inclusion has developed a campus resource guide to foster growth while meeting the needs of a more diverse community. The Exploring Diversity at OHSU guidebook includes information about affinity and special interest groups, resources to enhance awareness, professional and personal development, recruitment and planning, prevention and reporting, as well as designated spaces for prayer, meditation and quiet reflection. [Cultural Awareness Guide for Religious and Spiritual Accommodations](#accordion-26646-4) To enhance awareness around cultural and faith-based practices and events, the Center for Diversity and Inclusion created the Cultural Awareness Guide for Religious and Spiritual Accommodations. It serves as an educational resource for the myriad of religions and beliefs. While we made every effort to include all major religious holidays and practices, we realize we may have missed one that is important to you. If you would like us to consider an addition, please contact the Center for Diversity and Inclusion at [cdi@ohsu.edu](mailto:cdi@ohsu.edu).

This new service, linked from the MedlinePlus homepage, benefits people who prefer to read consumer health information in their native language. It also helps the information professionals and health care providers who serve them. "}
