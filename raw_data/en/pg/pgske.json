INTERACTIONS FAQS A: We recommend taking this product in the morning or afternoon, preferably before exercising. Although 7-Keto Lean is not a stimulant, we feel it is better to avoid taking this product at night as it contains herbs to support fluid balance that are best used in the daytime. Additionally, metabolism tends to be more active in the daytime. Some may experience mild gastrointestinal upset, in which case we suggest taking this product with food.
