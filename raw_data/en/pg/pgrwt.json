It is a system of natural health care and has been practiced for over 200 years. There are two basic principles of homeopathy. The first principle assumes that the body knows what to do. Symptoms are the way in which the body takes action to overcome an illness. Living organisms have this automatic healing response. It is called the vital response. The second principle requires that only 'the minimum dose' should be administered. It is based upon the understanding that the stimulus of the medicine works from within. Just enough is given to begin the healing process, which then continues on, motivated by its own internal healing mission. - Homeopathic treatment works along with the body's own power to heal. This creates health and well-being. - Each patient is treated individually, not given a label - Homeopathy treats all the symptoms at every level of being; emotional, spiritual, physical and mental.
