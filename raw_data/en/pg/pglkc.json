This project interties the two crucial water systems, resulting in improved efficiency, substantial cost savings and the elimination of the Cedar Ridge Water Treatment Plant. The project also included installing a new pump station at the Crystal Falls Water Treatment plant which pumps water into the Cedar Ridge system, enhancing the reliability and efficiency of water supply and distribution within the region. This consolidation project is part of a larger effort by the District to retire aging infrastructure, improve economies of scale, and ensure sustainable and affordable water service in the future. The long-term vision of the District is to optimize water service to our customers by constructing a regional water treatment and storage facility at Sierra Pines with the capability to consolidate 8 water treatment facilities, 16 thanks and 12 pump stations. The Crystal Falls/ Cedar Ridge Water Treatment Consolidation Project is part of TUD's ongoing commitment to undertake critical Capital Improvement Projects aimed at ensuring the long-term reliability, safety, and efficiency of our water system. Don Perkins, General manager of Tuolumne Utilities District, expressed his satisfaction with the project's successful completion, stating, \"This intertie project marks an important milestone in TUD's ongoing system consolidation efforts to strengthen our water infrastructure and improve service delivery. This project will not only provide greater resilience to our water system but will significantly reduce ongoing operational costs.\" TUD is proud to have completed this project that will benefit its customers for years to come and remains committed to providing quality water service and investing in the critical infrastructure necessary to support its community.
