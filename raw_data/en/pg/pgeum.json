Healing brings hope - for all the fullness of life God intends for us. GraceMed is a holistic healthcare ministry with more than 300 employees, including providers and support staff, dedicated to bringing that hope to thousands of underserved Kansans. One medical home for all the Hopecare you need. Your whole health is made up of a lot of complex pieces. GraceMed brings several medical services together to present a coordinated, united front in the battle to treat and prevent a wide range of conditions, from medical to dental to vision and behavioral health. We're probably closer than you think. We've found that convenient access can make a lot of difference, so we've tried to go into neighborhoods and communities that would otherwise be much farther away from care. We even have several clinics next door to the schools your kids attend. Find the clinic near you and meet your provider. You deserve affordable care. This is where you get it. There's no reason not to get the care you and your loved ones need as long as there's GraceMed to make it affordable. Many of our patients qualify for fees that are adjusted to fit their household income. We take every insurance plan, and for those who qualify, we can help you apply for either Medicaid or Marketplace insurance. "}
