Both have their purpose, but when a traveler is in need of healing, high vibes, or an epiphany or two, these are the places that professional healers recommend hightailing it to. To determine which destination has your personal blend of medicine at the ready, turn to a popular tool among healing pros: intuition. \"I have been traveling solely for spiritual reasons for 17 years, and I'd recommend really checking with yourself before you go to any of the sacred places on earth,\" says New York-based healing practitioner and self-described \"seer\" Deborah Hanekamp. \"Your heart knows whether you're meant to visit these places or not.\" Bali, Indonesia\"My healing place is Bali,\" says New York-based intuitive healing artist Debbie Attias. Though she also leads international retreats, Attias travels to the island solo when she needs to recharge. \"When I travel alone, it's about meditating, connecting to elements, and listening to the wind,\" she says. For Attias, that place of connection happens at a seaside temple called Uluwatu. \"It's tall cliffs, blue-green ocean, and the air coming up at you,\" she says. \"I have a very strong connection with the air element, so this is such a power spot for me.\" Tulum, MexicoAttias has also experienced the freeing sensation of \"letting the wind blow through you and feeling like a wild woman\" on the beach in Tulum. \"There's one little spot, called the Temple of the Wind God, on the edge of the cliff,\" she says. \"The water's so blue, and the wind is insane. There's an intense energy there.\" Gala Darling, who holds retreats that teach \"radical self-love\" through healing rituals, is leading an excursion to Tulum in the fall. \"When you're there, you don't wear shoes for a whole week. Everything is on the water, and it's an extremely beautiful, natural environment,\" she says. \"It's like a healing vortex.\" Oaxaca, MexicoAnother part of Mexico calls to Lisa Levine, the natural healer and Reiki master behind healing center Maha Rose. \"My favorite place to travel to is the coast down in Oaxaca,\" she says. \"I go every winter, so that's been my magical recharge place. It's such amazing medicine for New Yorkers to go to the beach. The city is so masculine and intense; the beach is feminine, sunny, and soft.\" Levine is so drawn to the destination that she's purchased a bit of land in Oaxaca: \"Eventually, we'll have a Maha healing vibes\u2014and epiphanies\u2014in Marrakech. \"Because you're so out of your regular routine and comfort zone, it's very different,\" she says. \"It's a Muslim country, and there are calls to prayer five times a day. It's very spiritual. When I'm there, I feel like I have emotional breakthroughs every few days. It's really intense.\" Not to mention colorful: \"Everything is Technicolor; no one wears black. There's so much stimulus\u2014from the color to the fragrance in the air to the people who are so different from you\u2014that being there inspires you to look at your own life in a very holistic way.\" Kauai, HawaiiShiva Rose, a Los Angeles-based holistic-living expert, also uses travel as medicine. \"I have a few places I go to over and over again because they fill me up and I find them very healing,\" she says. One of those places is the Hawaiian island of Kauai. \"It's a magical place where you feel so in tune with the wilderness,\" Rose says. \"People who know Kauai say that there are areas where it really feels like a vortex\u2014like you go to another dimension.\" Visiting the ocean in Hawaii feels particularly cleansing for Rose, and she conducts beauty rituals along its shores. \"I'll sit by the ocean and rub coconut oil and sand along my body,\" she says. \"It's the most incredible little spa treatment.\" Ojai, CaliforniaRose also travels frequently to Ojai. \"It's another vortex that has an intense energy; you're sort of cradled by it,\" she says. \"I go to the river there and conduct healing ceremonies; I'll also go to the hot springs. It's a mystical place where you feel nourished by the Topatopa Mountains.\" Mount Shasta, CaliforniaHanekamp names another California mountain town\u2014Mount Shasta\u2014as a magical place to explore. \"Right after my daughter was born, I felt myself being called there,\" she says. \"The mountain kept showing up in my dreams.\" With her then-1-year-old daughter in tow, Hanekamp embarked on a camping trip where she bathed in waterfalls, explored the hot springs, and drank from the Sacramento River. Being in the charged atmosphere engendered an intense moment of bonding with her wee one. \"The mountain itself has a very profound spiritual energy,\" she says \"My daughter had just learned to talk at the time, and she was calling the mountain 'purple.' I see auras around people and places, and to me, the mountain was purple also.\" Lake Titicaca, PeruA bit farther from home, \"Lake Titicaca is known as the second chakra of the earth, and it seems to me to be a very good place to birth ideas,\" says Hanekamp. \"The lake has a sacred energy. There's something about looking at it as a giant crystal ball or a looking glass or a mirror\u2014it can reflect back different inspirations that are to come.\" Ibiza, SpainRuby Warrington, founder of conscious lifestyle platform The Numinous\u2014and author of the soon-to-be-released book, Material Girl, Mystical World\u2014travels to Ibiza when she's in need of healing vibes. \"It has the reputation for being a real party island, and it does have a very vibrant nightlife scene,\" she says. \"But one of the reasons for that is that there are natural high vibes on the island. It's the kind of place where you'll find people dancing on the tables after lunch because they're feeling so happy and uplifted.\" And that's not just because of sangria. \"There are all kinds of myths and legends about why the island has such potent energy,\" Warrington adds. \"There are certain key lines that pass through Ibiza and are shared with Bali and Glastonbury. I think that what these three places share is an atmosphere that engenders love for being human and all the pleasure that we experience "}
