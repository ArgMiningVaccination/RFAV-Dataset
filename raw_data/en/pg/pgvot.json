EVD Several candidate vaccines tested in human trials Monovalent cAD3 -EBO Z (Zaire strain alone) Bivalent cAD3 -EBO (combination of Zaire and Sudan) 2 monovalent cAD3 -EBO VRC -(Sudan researchers -are-tackling -ebola - 121517Why the Need for Vaccines Vaccines remain a critical component for preparedness and response Outbreak containment requires, resources and cross -border collaboration to prevent /minimize spread to new regions Despite the many outbreaks, countries remain with limited capacity to manage the outbreak. Global multidisciplinary efforts are key. With vaccines, transmission and fatality rates may be reduced. Why the Need for Vaccines Progress with Ebola Zaire vaccines and therapeutics No vaccine or antiretrovirals against Marburg virus This continued reemergence of MARV highlights the need for vaccines to prevent future MVD outbreaks.Pathways to Licensure of Vaccines Three main pathways \"Traditional\" Approval Accelerated Approval \"Animal Rule\" All pathways require demonstration of clinical safety and demonstration of effectiveness So, Which Pathway Then? To promote access to safe, high -quality medicines Mainly genericsChallenges of several regulatory pathways Regulatory systems ensure safety, efficacy and quality of medicines and other health technologies. LMICs have small markets, limited human and financial resources, making less attractive for product developers hence less developed regulatory systems. Pan American Health Organization proposes an approach to regulatory system strengthening that can help them accomplish the most important regulatory functions more efficiently through adoption of efficiencies, such as regionalization and reliance . Preston C, Freitas Dias M, Pe\u00f1a J, et al. Addressing the challenges of regulatory systems strengthening in small states. BMJ Global Health 2020;5:e001912. doi:10.1136/ bmjgh -2019 -001912Different regions of the world have different regulatory requirements and guidelines for licensure of vaccines and medicinal products makes the licencing processes cumbersome for developers to quickly bring products to the different markets Leads to delays in access of critical medicines and vaccine Some of the licensure pathways are less appropriate for filovirus given the need for human efficacy data and the sporadic and short nature of the outbreaksChallenges of Several Regulatory PathwaysIs Global Licensure, Harmonization of Possible? Key Opinion Leader Meeting Series \"Fostering Global Understanding and Coordination for Ebola Sudan and Marburg Virus Vaccine Development & Licensure Pathways\" Hosted by the Sabin Vaccine Institute R&D Team (2021 -2022) Taken from Slides by Sabin Vaccine Institute The European Commission example How did it manage to \"harmonize inter-state commercial interests while preserving national \"autonomy.\" http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jacbts.2016.06.003 Do we mean harmonization of regulations or is harmonized review ?This Conference To discuss considerations for regulatory approval pathways and harmonization Understanding existing regulatory mechanisms to vaccine licensure in the absence of human efficacy data. Brings together several stakeholders including regulators, vaccine developers, researchers to gain insights on regulatory alignment Issues for Consideration Precedence: Anthrax vaccine licensure -How was it done? Which regulatory were considered and Mvabea what do we learn? Lessons from COVID-19 pandemic, on accelerated vaccine development, emergency use licensure, global collaborations help? Are correlates of protection well established? What constitutes an acceptable correlate of protection?Issues for Consideration What clinical or animal data is needed to license a vaccine without human efficacy data? Is this possible? \"Nothing for us without us\" -Community preparedness, involvement. How do we ensure public confidence, generating demand, acceptance of vaccines? What policies are in place for vaccine roll out? Are they sufficient for filovirus vaccines? How are vulnerable populations catered for? ( pregnant women, children, immunocompromised etc)Update on The Recent Sudan Ebola Outbreak in Uganda Uganda Ebola Outbreak, 2022 24-year- old man fever, diarrhea, abdominal pain, vomiting blood on 11 September 2022. Samples were collected on 17 September 2022 and SVD was laboratory -confirmed on 19 September. The patient died on the same day, five days after hospitalization. Declared on 20 September 2022 Uganda's fifth outbreak with Sudan ebolavirus strain Ugandan Districts Affected Affected the western and central regions of the countrySummary of Cases 164 cases (142 confirmed and 22 probable) 55 confirmed deaths 87 recovered patients 19 healthcare workers were infected 7/19 of the infected healthcare workers died National and District Task Force Pillars for Epidemic Response Coordination Case Management Surveillance Community Engagement Research Communication Essential Care ServicesWHO USAID CDC UNICEF Several other partners including vaccines developers, researchers and donorsPartnerships and Collaborations on Ebola Vaccines Vaccines received by MOH (not tested) 1000 ChAd3 -SUDV Oxford vaccine) 2,000 SV-SUDV (U.S. manufacturer Merck).MOH Partners WHO Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (funds vaccine development to prevent pandemics) USAID CDC UNICEF Several other partners including vaccines developers, researchers and donorsVaccines to be tested in the Solidarity against Ebola Trial Candidate vaccine consignment -Receipt by MoH officials The global community was yet again too late! Vaccines not deployed for response Efficacy data not collectedOutbreak was declared over on 10 January 2023Ebola National Survivors' Programme Established by MoH with support WHO and partners, in the three most affected districts -Entebbe, Kasanda and Mubende to: Maintaining disease surveillance to respond promptly to any flare- up. Stepping up support to 87 people who recovered from the virus Providing comprehensive medical and psychosocial support. https://www.afro.who.int/photo -story/caring -ugandas -ebola- survivorsLessons Learned from the Outbreak Ability to contain Ebola outbreaks has changed over the several outbreak experiences, new technology, including tests, treatments and vaccines. Much improved partner mobilization and coordination leading to faster response Mobile P.C.R. test laboratories that can give results in about four to six hours. Came off the back of COVID -19 so communities were still aware of need for transmission interruptions Experimental monoclonal antibody treatments and remdesivir were used to treat infected health care workers under compassionate use mechanism. Important to identify livelihood options, especially for Ebola affected community members. Outbreak response lab in MubendePeople are increasingly knowledgeable about outbreaks, and they seek information. Accurate, consistent & constant messaging from the response teams is vital Continued capacity building and trainings needed for community surveillance and epidemic response and case management. Continued need to handle stigma for health workers, infected persons and volunteers who work on responses - need for psychosocial support cannot be underestimated Resource mobilization before and during an outbreak Emergency funds needed for initial response activities -Most critical! Lessons Learned from the Outbreak \"Preventive, not reactive, vaccination is needed to fight Ebola\". Lessons Learned from the OutbreakRemaining Challenges Advanced vaccines for EBOV. Deliberate efforts to address other strains particularly the Sudan strain and also Marburg Understanding clearly the safety, magnitude and durability of responses for the SUDV vaccines Further safety evaluations in subpopulations; Pregnancy and immunocompromised populations How to incentivize manufacturers to produce the vaccines commercially when demand may not be high enoughAcknowledgements All conference organisers, speakers and attendees "}
