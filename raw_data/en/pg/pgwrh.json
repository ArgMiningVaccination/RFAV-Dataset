In recent years, the use ofcomplementary and alternative medicine (CAM)has grown in popularity worldwide. In the UnitedStates, use of CAM increased from 34% in 1990to 42% in 1997. 1;2CAM therapies were used by 20% to 50% of the population in Europeancountries and 52% in Australia. 3-5 In Singapore, although modern Western medicine is the main form of health care, CAMenjoys considerable popularity, with traditionalChinese medicine (TCM) being the most popular. 6;7It is estimated that about 45% of the population in Singapore has consulted a TCMpractitioner previously, and about 12% ofoutpatient attendances daily are to TCMpractitioners. 6A recent local survey also revealed that 67% of respondents used traditional medicineand believed in its efficacy, while 49% of thepublic were ignorant of the hazardous effects ofthe preparations of traditional medicine that aremarketed. 7 The TCM Practitioner Act was passed on 14 November 2000 to regulate TCM practitioners.

Methods A total of 555 first to fifth year medical students completed a questionnaire (54% response rate) designed to assess their knowledge, beliefs and attitudes to CAM in general and 16 common CAMtherapies.Results Acupuncture was the best known therapy, with 57% claiming to know at least something about it. No students claimed they knew a lot about chiropractic, osteopathy, Ayuverdic medicine, homeopathyand naturopathy, and many had not ever heard of these therapies. Knowledge of commonly held beliefsabout the 16 CAM modalities was generally poor, even for modalities which students claimed to knowmost about. A significant number of students had knowledge about CAM that was erroneous. Lack ofscientific support was considered to be the main barrier to implementation of CAM. Attitudes to CAMwere positive, with 92% believing that CAM includes ideas and methods from which conventional medicine can benefit, 86% wishing to know more about CAM and 91% stating that CAM would play animportant role in their future medical practice. Conclusion As the public' s use of various healing practices outside conventional medicine accelerates, ignorance about these practices by the country' s future medical practitioners risks broadening thecommunication gap between the public and the profession that serves them. The majority of medicalstudents recognise this risk and are keen to bridge this gap.

Incontrast, few such studies come from East Asiawhere traditional oriental medicine is widely practised. A survey conducted in Hong Kong onthe attitudes of medical students toward differentmodalities of treatment for cancer showed that thestudents used a Chinese versus non-Chinesecultural framework in conceptualising modalitiesof treatment (including Qi Gong, TCM andtraditional Chinese religions) outside theconventional Western medical model. 21In view of the recognition that TCM is becoming establishedin Singapore and the fact that, to the best of ourknowledge, no such study has been done locally,we aimed to gauge the understanding, interest and importance of CAM among medical students in alocal university. In addition, given the limited timeavailable in the current syllabus for the teaching of CAM, it is hoped that the results of this surveymay provide useful information for a review of themedical curriculum. Methods A self-completed questionnaire survey wasconducted among the medical students of theFaculty of Medicine, National University of Singapore. Prior approval to conduct the surveywas obtained from the Dean' s office. There is no formal teaching of CAM in our curriculum,although there is an elective on acupuncture whichattracts 5-10 students per year. Subjects The study was originally targeted at the entirecohort of 1,023 first to fifth year medical students.Due to time constraints and the scattering ofclinical year students between six teachinghospitals, we tried to approach groups of studentsafter major lectures and class tests so as to obtainas high a response rate as possible. As the purpose of this survey was to determine the knowledge ofthe students at the point of administration of thequestionnaire, the option of completing the surveythrough the internet or via email was not pursuedas that might have introduced bias. The studentswere told that their participation was anonymous and entirely voluntary, and there was no rewardfor taking part. They were invited to complete thequestionnaire immediately. The authors werepresent on hand to answer questions or clarify anydoubts that they might have. The questionnairewas administered to the subjects between December 2001 and March 2002. Design of questionnaire The questionnaire was adapted and modified fromseveral similar previous overseas surveys. 9-21In the introduction to the survey, complementarytherapies were defined as: 'Approaches to healing not usually included in a doctor' s undergraduate training nor offered inpublic hospitals. Included are traditional medicines,practices and beliefs borrowed from othercultures, the so-called natural therapies, the plant-based medicines of homeopathy and herbalism,and the manipulative techniques of chiropractic,osteopathy and massage. It does not includephysiotherapy, occupational therapy, or self-medication with non prescribed treatments such asvitamins.' The questionnaire was divided into three portions: A, demographic information; B,knowledge of CAM; C, general attitudes/perceptions of CAM. The questions on knowledgeof CAM were designed with the help of a CAMtext that used an evidence-based approach. 22 Sixteen complementary therapies were chosen that are commonly used locally by different ethnic groups, from the complete list of modalitiesasked about in previous surveys. The 16 wereacupuncture, herbal medicine, traditional Chinesemedicine, chiropractic, osteopathy, massage, Tai Chi,Qi Gong, reflexology, aromatherapy, Ayurvedicmedicine, naturopathy, yoga, homeopathy,hypnosis, meditation and relaxation techniques. The results were calculated as sums and percentages of the cohort. The planned statisticalcomparison between the preclinical and pre-Papers 21ACUPUNCTURE IN MEDICINE 2005;23(1):19-26. www.medical-acupuncture.co.uk/aimintro.htmclinical students was not carried out as only 45% of the clinical students (years 3 to 5) participatedin the survey. Results A Demographic informationA total of 555 students participated in this survey,an overall response rate of 54%. Table 1 gives thebreakdown by year, including the response rate foreach year. Most of the students surveyed wereChinese. There were 508 (92%) Chinese, 11 (2%)Malays, 26 (5%) Indians, 5 (1%) Eurasians, and 5(1%) of other races. The majority of participatingstudents were Christians, Buddhists or 'free-thinkers'. Two hundred and twenty six (41%) students described themselves as Christians/Roman Catholics, 121 (22%) as Buddhists, 16(3%) as Taoists, 16 (3%) as Muslims, 14 (3%) asHindus, and 162 (29%) as 'free-thinkers'. B Knowledge of CAM Students' self-perceived state of knowledge aboutCAM therapiesFor the majority of the CAM therapies listed, most students either have heard of, or know somethingof, the particular therapy, as shown in Table 2. Thebest known therapy was acupuncture, of which315 (57%) knew either or 'a lot'. Thiswas TCM (290 [52%]) and herbal medicine (276 [50%]). However, few studentsclaimed that they knew 'a lot' for each therapy: thehighest acupuncture, with No students claimedthey knew 'a lot' about chiropractic, osteopathy,Ayuverdic medicine, homeopathy and naturopathy, and many had not ever heard of these therapies. There was little difference in the claimed knowledge about CAM between students in theirpre-clinical and those in their clinical years.

Again, knowledge ofacupuncture was greatest (89%), at least in its usefor pain (Table 3). The majority of the students'did not know' the efficacy, uses and side effectsof St John' s Wort, echinacea, ginseng, and gingko.Other questions that a surprisingly high number ofstudents 'did not know' included whetheracupuncture can be used to decrease withdrawalsymptoms, whether chiropractic specialises inspinal manipulation, or whether garlic can lowerblood lipid levels. However, among those who believed they knew, most of them got the factright. However, 70% of students who believed thatthey knew the answer to the statement 'ginsengcan be used safely in people with high bloodpressure' were incorrect. C General attitudes and perception of CAM effectiveness and harmful effects of various CAMmodalitiesMost students, whether in their clinical or pre-clinical years, were not sure of the effectiveness ofmany CAM therapies, with the exception ofacupuncture, herbal medicine, TCM, massage andmeditation (Table 2). However, in general, morestudents believed that the various CAM therapieswere effective rather than ineffective. Most students believed in the effectiveness ofacupuncture (429 [77%]), herbal medicine (344[62%]), TCM (343 [62%]), massage (299 [54%])and meditation (288 [52%]). Similarly, the majority of the students were not sure of the harmful effects of the various CAMtherapies, though they believed that the various therapies were not harmful. On the contrary, asignificant proportion of students believed herbalmedicine (137 [25%]), TCM (137 [21%]), QiGong (102 [18%]), Tai Chi (101 [18%]) andhypnosis (66 [12%]) had harmful effects. Comparing students' views on herbal medicine and on TCM in pre-clinical and clinical stages oftheir education, among the pre-clinical students26% and 24% respectively believed these twotherapies were not harmful, while 12% and 14%believed they were harmful. Among students intheir clinical years only, only 16% and 9%respectively believed these therapies were notharmful, while 31% and 38% respectivelybelieved they were harmful. Osteopathy, homeopathy, naturopathy and Ayuverdic medicine are the therapies which the greatest number of students was unsure of either effectiveness or harmful effects (Table 2). Perceived need for CAM education When asked if they desired some introduction orexposure to CAM during their course of study as a medical student or a practising doctor, 479 (86%)students indicated that they did. The positiveresponders were then asked which of the 16 CAMmodalities interested them. The five modalities ofgreatest interest amongst students relaxation techniques (207 [37%]). Students were also asked to state their preferences for the part of the curriculum theywould like this teaching to be included in, andTable 3 Numbers and percentages of students who claimed that they 'did not know' the efficacy, uses and side-effects of various CAM modalities Questions asked Correct response Did not know St John' s Wort is commonly use for the treatment of mild to moderate depression 60 (11) 415 (75)Echinacea is commonly used for cold and flu symptoms 55 (10) 409 (74)Long-term use of Echinacea is recommended 43 (8) 419 (75)Garlic can lower blood lipid levels 213 (38) 271 (49)Ginseng can be used safely in people with high blood pressure 58 (10) 367 (66)Gingko biloba is commonly used in people with Alzheimer' s disease 173 (31) 311 (56)Acupuncture can be used to decrease withdrawal symptoms from drugs 109 (20) 246 (44)Acupuncture can be used to relieve pain 493 (89) 58 (10)Chiropractic specialises in spinal manipulation and is used to treat lower back pain 94 (17) 288 (52)All figures are number of students with percentages in bracketsPapers 23ACUPUNCTURE IN MEDICINE 2005;23(1):19-26. www.medical-acupuncture.co.uk/aimintro.htmwere allowed more than one option. The pre- clinical and clinical year students had similarpreferences, with 35% favouring pre-clinicalintroduction, 33% favouring introduction and 23% electing to have it intheir own time. Only a small minority welcomedthe other available options, such as introduction ofCAM during the pre-registration or medicalofficer training years. Attitudes towards efficacy of CAM as opposed to Western medicine Of those surveyed, 365 (66%) are of the opinion that CAM is m ore efficacious than Western medicine in the treatment of certain ailments, withno differences between the pre-clinical and clinicalcohorts. Some of the common ailments whichthey believe respond better to CAM include chronic pain, psychiatric disorders such as depression,bone and joint problems such as sprain andarthritis, 'heatiness', and headaches. Other conditionssuggested were viral infections eg HIV and influenza,nausea and vomiting due to chemotherapy, livercirrhosis and control of hypertension and bloodcholesterol levels. A small minority also believedCAM to be more efficacious but were unable tospecify any specific conditions. Perceived barriers to the utilisation of CAM practicesWhen asked about the perceived barriers to theuse of CAM practices in a Western medical setting(Table 3), 532 (96%) students believed that a lackof scientific evidence was the main reason and462 (83%) felt that a lack of trained professionalsposed a significant barrier. The pre-clinical andclinical students differed in their perceptions ofthe relative importance. While more students intheir clinical years felt that concerns about legalissues took precedence over a lack of appropriateequipment, students in their pre-clinical years feltotherwise. However, both groups concurred thatthe length of time required for treatmentprocedures and the healing process were the leastof the barriers. General attitudes towards CAM In our survey, we included nine statements towhich they could either agree/agree strongly, or disagree/disagree strongly. Five of these statements were general statements, and four wereconstructed to elicit each individual' s personalstance towards CAM (Table 5). The great majority of students agreed that CAM includes ideas and methods from whichconventional medicine can benefit, with 69%agreeing and a further 23% agreeing strongly withthe statement. In line with this, the majority (60%)did not believe that the results of CAM can beattributed mostly to a placebo effect, and as manyas 90% agreed that clinical care should integratethe best of conventional and CAM practices, (with31% agreeing strongly). Similar positive attitudeswere displayed by the high level of agreement that health care professionals should be able to advisetheir patients about commonly used CAMmodalities, and that knowledge of CAM isimportant to them as future practising healthprofessionals. However, patients' responsibilitiesin this area were reflected by the high belief thatpatients should inform their doctors of their use ofCAM. Interestingly, over 40% of students did notagree with discouraging CAM therapies that havenot been tested in a scientific manner. When asked if personal spiritual or religious beliefs influenced their attitudes toward CAM,314 (57%) students agreed and 241 (44%)disagreed. Between the two largest religiousgroups represented in the survey cohort, 47% of the Christians agreed and 53% disagreed, while55% of the Buddhists agreed and 45% disagreedthat their religious beliefs played a part in theirattitude towards CAM.

One hundredand forty-six (26%) students felt that this shouldbe encouraged, while 47 (9%) thought it would bewiser to discourage. Four hundred and sixty-four(84%) students also indicated that they would bewilling to actively discuss with patients theoptions of using CAM as a form of treatment Exposure to CAM education Prior to the survey, 480 (87%) students had neverattended any course or module in CAM, whileanother 75 (14%) students had done so either withNational University of Singapore (NUS) or otherorganisations. Of the 14% who had, more thanhalf had attended a two weeks elective onacupuncture offered by the Department ofAnaesthesia, NUS. It was also noted that themajority of these students (61%) who hadattended the course or module were in theirclinical years. Discussion Knowledge of CAMThis survey showed that most students havelimited knowledge of CAM. Most of them wereunaware of CAM modalities that are commonlypractised in the West (such as naturopathy,homeopathy, osteopathy and chiropractic) andwere deficient in specific knowledge on the efficacy of CAM modalities which they claimedto know about. The two CAM modalities that thestudents claimed to know something about wereacupuncture (57%) and TCM (52%). This couldbe due to the cultural background of the students(92% Chinese), but also these two modalities havebeen widely used by the general public. 6;7 Recent reports have highlighted the need for physicians to have basic knowledge of CAM,especially the use of herbs. 23;24For example, while the efficacy of St. John' s Wort as a treatment formild to moderate depressive disorders has beendemonstrated by evidence-based medicine, 25 dangerous herb-drug interactions involving hepaticcytochrome P450 microsomal oxidase enzymes have been reported. 22;26The lack of knowledge on CAM modalities suggests that medical studentswill not have sufficient knowledge to advisepatients properly upon graduation. When comparing the results of our study against those of other countries, it is pertinent tonote the CAM modalities included in thequestionnaires of the various studies. In our study,Ayurvedic medicine, Tai Chi and Qi Gong were included because these were specific to the majorethnic groups in Singapore, namely the Chinese,Malays and Indians. In contrast, these modalitieswere not included in questionnaires designed for predominantly Caucasian societies. 9;10;13Nevertheless our questionnaire did include CAM modalitiesfound in the other studies, such as meditation,herbal medicine and acupuncture. Thus, we hopethat our study will facilitate comparisons betweenTable 5 Medical students' attitudes to CAM Statement Agree and Disagree and strongly agree strongly disagree CAM includes ideas and methods from which conventional medicine can benefit. 513 (92.4) 42 (7.6)The results of CAM are in most cases due to a placebo effect. 220 (39.6) 335 (60.4)CAM therapies not tested in a scientific manner should be discouraged. 328 (59.1) 227 (40.9)Clinical care should integrate the best of conventional and CAM practices. 507 (91.4) 48 (8.6)Health care professionals should be able to advise their patients about 483 (87.0) 72 (13.0) commonly used CAM methods.

All figures are number of students with percentages in bracketsPapers 25ACUPUNCTURE IN MEDICINE 2005;23(1):19-26. www.medical-acupuncture.co.uk/aimintro.htmmedical student communities across national and cultural boundaries. Studies in other countries revealed a geographical difference in the knowledge of CAMmodalities among medical students. TheAustralian students' self-perceived knowledge ofacupuncture, meditation and massage was thehighest, 9British students' knowledge of acupuncture, yoga and homeopathy were highest,10 whilst the American students were most knowledgeable on massage, herbal medicine andmeditation. 13There were many CAM modalities which students of all four countries were found to have more knowledge of, namely acupuncture,meditation and massage. The therapies that weremost understood by students were also perceivedas most effective - a finding consistent with otherstudies. 9;14 General attitudes and perception of CAMWhile the majority believed in the efficacy ofcommon CAM modalities, many were not sure oftheir possible harmful effects. In fact, manystudents believed that the various therapies werenot harmful. A higher number of clinical studentsthan pre-clinical students perceived TCM andherbal medicine as harmful, probably due to theformer' s greater knowledge on pharmaceuticaldrug interactions. Moreover, the majority of thestudents who had attended the CAM module werein their clinical years. There were other similarities between our findings and those of the three above-mentioned studies. 9;10;13The students in all four studies were trained in Western medicine and the majority werenot exposed to CAM. Most students had limitedknowledge of CAM modalities and professedinterest in learning CAM, so that they could betteradvise their patients on this subject. Most (86%) students welcomed the inclusion of CAM in the medical curriculum, a finding thatis similar to that of other surveys. 9;14;18Wetzel et al suggested that a good starting point for theinclusion of CAM is to equip students withknowledge of the therapies commonly used by thelocal population, 27which, in our context, are acupuncture and TCM.7This coincides with the modalities which our respondents expressed thedesire to know about the most.Although 96% of the students cited the lack of scientific evidence as the major barrier to widerapplication of CAM, 41% of the students wouldaccept CAM techniques that had not been testedin a scientific manner. This could signal thegrowth of CAM in Singapore in the future, despite the lack of scientific evidence. Similar sentimentswere also expressed by Australian students. 9The teaching of CAM should be evidence-based, as areother therapies. More and better research usingvarious investigations is needed to guide choices in this uncharted territory. 28There were only slight differences in the perceived barriers to CAMbetween pre-clinical and clinical students,amongst which, legal issue was a greater prioritywith clinical students. This is possibly due to theirsuperior knowledge of the medico-legal aspects ofclinical practice. As half of the students believed that their spiritual and religious beliefs influenced theirattitudes towards CAM, this could pose a problemwhen managing patients with different religions or beliefs who are undergoing CAM treatment.However, observing the opinions of Christians andBuddhists, it is noted that students from thedifferent religious groups were almost equallydivided. This implies that these believers were notreally affected by their specific religion per se butby their individual perceptions and convictions towards their own religion. Although there is no information on the views of practising physicians on CAM, this surveyshowed that the medical practitioners of the futureare open to CAM. Many students acknowledgethat they will encounter CAM in their medicalpractice in future; 91% felt that knowledge ofCAM is important to them as practising healthprofessionals. Most would neither encourage nordiscourage patients from using CAM withWestern therapy, but the majority (84%) are open to discussion of CAM with their patients. Manyalso felt that CAM includes ideas and methodswhich conventional medicine can benefit from. These feelings were shared by medical students inother countries. 9;13;14 Despite our effort to obtain a high response rate, the overall response rate of the study wasonly 54%. We acknowledge that the opinions inthis study may not be representative of students inPapers 26ACUPUNCTURE IN MEDICINE 2005;23(1):19-26. www.medical-acupuncture.co.uk/aimintro.htmtheir clinical years (45% responded), particularly those in their final year (22%), and that there maybe limitations to our results. As the public' s use of healing practices outside conventional medicine accelerates, ignorance ofCAM by future medical practitioners can cause acommunication gap between the public and theprofession that serves them. It is encouraging thatthe majority of medical students in this surveyrecognise and are keen to rectify this lack ofknowledge. The results of this survey are timely inview of the changing legal status of acupuncturistsand TCM practitioners in Singapore.
