Hi Caro and Maria, maybe we can start at the very start - the idea - how did you come up with the idea for your business? We grew up in a small city of Colombia surrounded by nature and fresh food that came straight from the farms. We inherited our love for nature and medicinal plants from our grandmothers and parents, who used plants and food as medicine. When we moved to the U.S our lifestyles changed a lot. We got a little lost and disconnected from our roots. Our lives became fast paced, stressful and overall unhealthy. Our bodies reacted to these changes bringing hormonal imbalances, digestive issues, anxiety, and inflammation. So we both looked for ways to heal and regain balance in our bodies in natural ways. Maria dived deeply into skin care, and Caro immersed herself in the world of holistic health. We both became passionate about alternative healing therapies and self-care, we reconnected with our true essence, and found our healthier, natural lifestyles again despite our busy, modern lives. For years, we have realized that people are going through the same skin and health problems we experienced in the past. In general people are also disconnected from nature and from themselves. So, our biggest wish is to help people live healthier lifestyles that focus on plant medicine and avoid chemicals that are harmful not only to us but to the environment. We know that health starts from the inside out, and that is why we integrate what we believe has been an essential part of our health, and that is self-care rituals. Through daily rituals we can connect to our essence, be more present, calm and live healthier, happy lives. The love we have for Mother Nature and the knowledge and experience we have gained throughout the years is what inspired us to unite forces, and create Calma Rituals. A holistic approach of skin and body products that are made with 100% natural ingredients, that are free of harsh chemicals. All of our products are handcrafted in small batches, they are vegan and cruelty-free, made with powerful plant extracts, and infused with loving intentions. Alright, so for those in our community who might not be familiar with your business, can you tell us more? Calma Rituals is a skin care and holistic beauty brand rooted in eco-friendly, sustainable beliefs and practices. Our goal is to bring you closer to your inner wisdom and to nature through our products and through our self-care rituals. That is what sets us apart. We want to create a holistic approach to wellbeing where we can use plants as medicine to prevent illness and to heal internally and externally. And we want to incorporate all important aspects of holistic wellness: mental, physical, spiritual, emotional, and environmental. We believe that regaining our lost connection with nature will not only heal us but will also heal the earth. This is why we created products for people and for the planet. Products we know have powerful proven benefits. We are proud to be a sustainable brand that uses high-quality and 100% natural organic ingredients in our products. Ingredients are grown and produced in sustainable and ethical ways and are free of harsh chemicals from the soil to the bottle. We deliver our high-quality artisan potions in eco-friendly packaging and we highly encourage our clients to reuse, up-cycle and recycle, and we have great plans for the future to continue improving our sustainability practices. We are also working closely with organizations in the Amazon Rainforest to support the efforts to preserve ancestral indigenous knowledge and the conservation of the rainforest. Right now we sell two products that come straight from indigenous communities in the Amazon. If you had a friend visiting you, what are some of the local spots you'd want to take them around to? Hmmmm, Miami has many interesting places, but nowadays we enjoy hanging out outdoors in nature! So, on Saturday morning we would take our dear friends to a great yoga class at Legion Park, then after take a stroll and get some lunch and goodies at Legions Farmers market (We love supporting local small businesses!) In the afternoon we could relax by a pool. And at night, we'd have a special, home cooked meal, some wine and even get some dancing going on!! Hey we are Colombian. On Sunday we would bike ride from our home to the South Pointe Park area on South Beach, catch some sun and waves, and on our way back, get something to eat at Pura Vida SoBe. On Monday, we would take them to Perez Museum and take a stroll by the park, get something to eat at Carrot Express. On Tuesday we could take them to the Coconut Grove area, where there are beautiful parks for meditation, yoga and an afternoon picnic. On Wednesday we could take them to Key Biscayne and we could paddle board or kite surf and watch the beautiful sunset from there. Thursday is rest day and we could just chill out at home and do some meditation and yoga. In the afternoon we could go to Sushi Garage on South Beach and get some happy hour cocktails and food. Friday we could hang out at the pool and then go for a walk around the Design District and Wynwood for some cool pictures. The Shoutout series is all about recognizing that our success and where we are in life is at least somewhat thanks to the efforts, support, mentorship, love and encouragement of others. So is there someone that you want to dedicate your shoutout to? We want to give thanks to our mother Marina Blandon, who was a small business owner herself and taught us all about strong work ethic, mindset and will power. She has always been there to support us, and she raised us with so much love, always wanting us to be in connection with the soil, plants and natural spirit. She is a plant lover, an amazing gardener, the best mom, and the most supportive family-oriented person we have ever known.
