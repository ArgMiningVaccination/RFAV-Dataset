Homeopathy is a form of natural therapy that can ease symptoms from illness with minute doses of certain natural substances according to the patients own individuality. Based on Hippocrates great medical principle of \"like cures like\", Dr. Samuel Hahnemann of Germany developed the first text on the art and science of homeopathy in 1810. Homeopathy practically disappeared in America by the 1950's, due mostly to the advances in modern medicine.
