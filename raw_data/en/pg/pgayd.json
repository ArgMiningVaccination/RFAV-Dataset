Therefore, we investigated potential connections between vaccine efficacy and nAAb levels. We were also interested in the impact of immunomodulatory therapies on vaccine efficacy. Clinical residual samples were used for the assessment of the COVID-19 vaccine-elicited immune response (IR) (n=255), as well as for the investigation of the immunization-associated expansion of the nAAb pool (n=185). In order to study the potential interaction between immunomodulatory therapies and the vaccine-induced IR, untreated, healthy individuals and patients receiving anti-TNF or anti-IL-17 therapies were compared (n total =45). In-house ELISAs (anticitrate synthase, anti-HSP60 and-70) and commercial ELISAs (anti-SARS-CoV-2 ELISAs IgG, IgA, NeutraLISA and IFN- release assay 'IGRA') were applied. We found significant differences in the IR given to different vaccines. Moreover, nAAb levels showed plasticity in response to anti-COVID-19 immunization. We conclude that our findings may support the theorem about the non-specific beneficial 'side effects' of vaccination, including the broadening of the nAAb repertoire. Considering immunomodulation, we suggest that anti-TNF and anti-IL17 treatments may interfere negatively with MALT-associated IR, manifested as decreased IgA titers; however, the modest sample numbers of the herein presented model might be a limiting factor of reaching a more comprehensive conclusion.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2023-03-29", "cleaned_text": "Complexity of the Immune Response Elicited by Different COVID-19 Vaccines, in the Light of Natural Autoantibodies and Immunomodulatory Immunoserology [1](#B1-ijms-24-06439)]. Using serologic assays, we evaluated and compared the immune responses triggered by the different vaccines. 1.2. Natural (Auto)Antibodies (nAAbs) [2](#B2-ijms-24-06439)]. Natural antibody-producing B-1 B cells are considered an intermediate stage of evolution between innate and adaptive immunity [ [3](#B3-ijms-24-06439)]. Circa 5% of the B cell population are considered to be B1 cells, amounting to 5 \u00d7 107 B1 cells in an average human, which suggests that nAbs are a significant part of the systemic antibody pool [ [4](#B4-ijms-24-06439)]. [5](#B5-ijms-24-06439)]. [4](#B4-ijms-24-06439)]. Many individuals possess antibodies directed against common epitopes in highly mutating viral infections, such as influenza and HIV. These so-called \"broadly neutralizing antibodies\" share some characteristics with nAbs [ [4](#B4-ijms-24-06439)]. [5](#B5-ijms-24-06439)]. Importantly, nAbs provide various essential functions within the immune system, ranging from scavenger activity by elimination of apoptotic cells and cell debris to the ability to provide protection against bacterial, viral and fungal infections [ [5](#B5-ijms-24-06439)]. [6](#B6-ijms-24-06439), [7](#B7-ijms-24-06439)]. This explains how vaccination\u2014one of the main pillars of modern medicine\u2014induces not only the formation of memory B cells and antibodies that confer immunity to disease-causing pathogens, but also has an unintended impact on the natural antibody repertoire [ [7](#B7-ijms-24-06439), [8](#B8-ijms-24-06439)]. [9](#B9-ijms-24-06439)]. However, it has been recently proposed that nAbs may serve as potential screening targets to predict the strength of the antigen-induced immune response [ [10](#B10-ijms-24-06439)]. 1.3. Citrate 1.4. Nonspecific Effects of Vaccines (NSEs) [15](#B15-ijms-24-06439)]. It has already been described in cases of laboratory rats that immunization enhances the natural antibody repertoire. In other words, immunization is associated with a larger natural antibody repertoire and stronger antibody binding, which also implies an enhanced total nAb binding ability [ [7](#B7-ijms-24-06439)]. Earlier studies also described that the measles vaccine (MV) had beneficial nonspecific side effects (NSEs) [ [16](#B16-ijms-24-06439), [17](#B17-ijms-24-06439), [18](#B18-ijms-24-06439)]. In a review of the potential NSEs on child mortality of the BCG, DTP and MV, this latter vaccine was associated with a 46% reduction in mortality [ [18](#B18-ijms-24-06439)]. The measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine, used in high-income countries (e.g., Denmark and the USA) instead of MV, has also been associated with beneficial NSEs [ [19](#B19-ijms-24-06439), [20](#B20-ijms-24-06439)]. BCG vaccine studies examining in vitro IFN- responses and measles vaccine studies examining lymphoproliferation to microbial antigen stimulation consistently suggest nonspecific immunological effects [ [21](#B21-ijms-24-06439)]. [15](#B15-ijms-24-06439)]. In order to achieve more efficient vaccination practices, we need to understand how training of the immune system can be optimized to increase general disease resistance and decrease vaccine failure. Likewise, we need to understand which individual parameters may be screened to predict vaccine efficacy [ [17](#B17-ijms-24-06439)]. 1.5. Heat Shock Protein 60 and 70 (HSP60 and HSP70) [22](#B22-ijms-24-06439)]. It has been recently described that human cord blood contains IgM autoantibodies to various peptide epitopes of both HSP60 and HSP70 [ [22](#B22-ijms-24-06439)]. Based on this finding, it can be hypothesized that natural autoantibodies to HSP60 and HSP70 seem to be part of the healthy immune system [ [22](#B22-ijms-24-06439)]. HSPs are ubiquitously found in almost all living organisms studied so far. The DNA sequence that makes up this family of genes is highly conserved across species. This family of genes was named because of their expression after exposure to heat [ [23](#B23-ijms-24-06439)]. [23](#B23-ijms-24-06439), [24](#B24-ijms-24-06439), [25](#B25-ijms-24-06439), [26](#B26-ijms-24-06439), [27](#B27-ijms-24-06439), connections between SARS-CoV-2 and HSPs, it has been recently described that HSP60 has been implicated in inappropriate inflammatory reactions that exacerbate the progression of COVID-19 [ [29](#B29-ijms-24-06439), [30](#B30-ijms-24-06439)], while two of the HSP70s in host cells have been implicated in the modulation of SARS-CoV-2. Hsp70A1L was reported to be epigenetically modulated by SARS-CoV-2, among other genes, including those from the Hsp70A1L family of proteins [ [31](#B31-ijms-24-06439), [32](#B32-ijms-24-06439)]. 1.6. COVID-19 and Autoimmunity [33](#B33-ijms-24-06439), [34](#B34-ijms-24-06439), [35](#B35-ijms-24-06439)]. A link between COVID-19 and the development of autoimmunity has been reported [ [36](#B36-ijms-24-06439), [37](#B37-ijms-24-06439)]. A possible explanation could be molecular mimicry between the virus and human proteins, where immune responses raised against SARS-CoV-2 cross-react with human proteins that share peptide sequence molecular shapes with the virus. Peptide sharing has been found between SARS-CoV-2 antigenic epitopes and different human proteins, including chaperones [ [36](#B36-ijms-24-06439), [37](#B37-ijms-24-06439), [38](#B38-ijms-24-06439)]. 1.7. Serologic Response to COVID-19 Vaccines in Patients Treated with Biological Therapies [41](#B41-ijms-24-06439), [42](#B42-ijms-24-06439)]. Biological agents targeting these cytokines are key players in the treatment of psoriasis [ [42](#B42-ijms-24-06439)]. Anti-TNF and anti-IL-17 are prominent examples for different classes of biologics that are used to treat (IL) 17 cytokines are important for immune cell recruitment to infection sites to promote clearance, while also activating downstream cascades of cytokines and chemokines [ [39](#B39-ijms-24-06439)]. For these reasons, the question has emerged of whether stopping immunomodulatory therapy can reduce the infection-associated risks during the COVID-19 outbreak [ [40](#B40-ijms-24-06439)]. For this subject, divided opinions are found in the literature. It has been described that blocking TNF signaling may save lives in the COVID-19 pandemic [ [46](#B46-ijms-24-06439)] and that discontinuation of biological treatments can result in the loss of response when treatments are reintroduced or even result in the formation of antibodies to the discontinued biologic [ [40](#B40-ijms-24-06439)]. [44](#B44-ijms-24-06439), [47](#B47-ijms-24-06439), [48](#B48-ijms-24-06439)]. It has already been described that patients treated with anti-TNF exhibited lower serologic responses one month and six months after vaccination (COVID-19 BNT162b2) compared to those not treated with anti-TNF or to healthy controls (HCs) [ [44](#B44-ijms-24-06439)]. Additionally, compared with the placebo group, anti-TNF-treated patients showed a moderate increase in susceptibility to upper respiratory infections (URIs) [ [49](#B49-ijms-24-06439)]. Though serum levels of TNF have been noted to be elevated in patients with viral respiratory illnesses such as influenza, no significant elevation of TNF was detected in the serum of patients with SARS, suggesting that the immune response to SARS may differ from that of other respiratory illnesses [ [42](#B42-ijms-24-06439)]. [49](#B49-ijms-24-06439)]. The latest common position regarding IL-17 inhibition is that it does not interfere significantly with the capacity of patients to develop the expected responses to SARS-CoV-2 [ [42](#B42-ijms-24-06439)]. 2. Results 2.1. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Vaccination- or Infection-Induced and IgA Antibody Levels [Table the highest sero-positivity ratios in terms of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG were measured in the mRNA and the vector vaccine groups, while the highest sero-positivity ratios in terms of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgA were detected in the mRNA and the unvaccinated, infected groups. [Figure anti-IFN- (IGRA) IgG were found in the mRNA vaccine and the unvaccinated, infected groups, while the highest sero-positivity ratios in terms of the neutralizing antibody titers (NeutraLisa IgA/G/M) were measured in the vector vaccine and the mRNA vaccine groups. [Figure 2](#ijms-24-06439-f002), in terms of anti-IFN- (IGRA) titers, there was a significant difference between the inactivated virus vaccine and all the other three vaccination groups (mRNA vaccine, vector vaccine and unvaccinated, infected individuals) (p < 0.001 in all cases) ( [Figure 2](#ijms-24-06439-f002)a). 2.3. Increase in Antibody Titers of Biological Therapy-Treated Patients from the 4th to 8th Week Post-Vaccination [Figure 3](#ijms-24-06439-f003), the means of results of patients with different immunomodulatory therapies (anti-TNF or anti-IL17) and with mixed vaccination backgrounds ( [Supplementary Table S1](#app1-ijms-24-06439)) have been compared to each other, in terms of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgA and IgG antibody titers. For the sample measurement and subsequent data analysis, three venipunctures have been performed: time point zero was used as a negative control (on the day of immunization and before vaccine administration, when there were no detectable antibody levels), followed by time point one (4 weeks post-vaccination) and time point two (8 weeks post-vaccination). (For the vaccine group nomenclature used for the figures, please see [Supplementary Table S2](#app1-ijms-24-06439)) [Supplementary Table S1](#app1-ijms-24-06439)). 2.4. Comparison of Vaccine Efficacy Results of Recipients of Immunomodulatory Therapies with Untreated, Healthy Individuals [Figure 4](#ijms-24-06439-f004)a), by the 4th week post-immunization, statistically significant differences were detectable between patients receiving biological therapies and healthy recipients of vector vaccines (p = 0.028). Interestingly, at this time point, between patients receiving biological therapies and healthy recipients of mRNA vaccines only a tendentious statistical difference (trend) was observable (p = 0.088). By the 8th week post-immunization, statistically significant differences were detectable between patients receiving biological therapies and healthy recipients of vector vaccines (p = 0.037), as well as between patients receiving biological therapies and healthy recipients of mRNA vaccines (p = 0.040). Neither by the 4th nor the 8th week post-immunization were significant statistical differences between untreated vector and untreated mRNA vaccine recipients observed. [Figure 4](#ijms-24-06439-f004)b), by the 4th week post-immunization, statistically significant differences were detectable between patients receiving biological therapies and healthy recipients of mRNA vaccines (p = 0.001). At this time point, between patients on biological therapies and untreated recipients of vector vaccines, no statistical difference was observable. By the 8th week post-immunization, statistically significant differences were detectable between patients receiving biological therapies and untreated recipients of mRNA vaccines (p = 0.002). Comparing patients receiving biological therapies with untreated recipients of vector vaccines, we can say that by the 8th week post-immunization, their IgG antibody titers reached similarly high levels. Interestingly, by this latter time point, the difference between healthy recipients of vector and mRNA vaccines became significant (p < 0.001). 2.5. Dynamic Adaptation of IgM Isotype Anti-CS Natural Autoantibodies (nAAbs) [Figure 5](#ijms-24-06439-f005), significant positive statistical connection was found between the nAAb anti-CS IgM and the immunization-induced humoral and cellular immune response. In the case of positive anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG, IgA and interferon- results, significantly higher anti-CS IgM levels were measured. 2.6. Dynamic Adaptation of IgG Isotype Anti-CS Natural Autoantibodies (nAAbs) [Figure 6](#ijms-24-06439-f006), nAAb anti-CS IgG and the immunization-induced anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG results, both in the case of the undivided, total sample cohort and in the case of the mRNA vaccine group. 2.7. Dynamic Adaptation of Anti-HSP70 IgG Antibodies [Figure 7](#ijms-24-06439-f007), statistically significant positive connections were found between the immunization-induced anti-SARS-CoV-2 humoral and cellular immune responses and the anti-HSP70 IgG levels. 2.8. Dynamic Adaptation of Anti-HSP70 IgG Antibodies 2.9. Dynamic Antibodies [Figure 9](#ijms-24-06439-f009), in the undivided total cohort, as well as in the mRNA vaccine group, statistically significant positive connection was found between the immunization-induced anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG isotype of the humoral immune response and the anti-HSP70 IgG levels. 3. Discussion 3.1. Vaccine Efficacy [50](#B50-ijms-24-06439)]. Lower antibody levels elicited by different COVID-19 vaccines are associated with breakthrough infections after vaccination, prompting consideration of booster doses or choosing a different type of vaccine [ [49](#B49-ijms-24-06439)]. Wild-type infection may enhance protection from vaccination\u2014especially at the levels of IgA antibodies and cellular response\u2014emphasizing the importance of a complex immune response (IR). In the first step, our objective was to examine the SARS-CoV-2 spike IgG, IgA antibodies, cellular response (using IGRA assay) and neutralizing antibody titers by comparing different vaccines (used in Hungary) to each other and to unvaccinated, infected (i.e., disease-experienced) individuals. 3.2. Potential Interference of Biological Therapies (Anti-TNF and Anti-IL17) with Vaccine Efficacy [49](#B49-ijms-24-06439)]. The risk of serious infections is unchanged or low over the short term; therefore, in the acute setting of COVID-19, the benefit of anti-IL-17 might outweigh the risks of infection [ [49](#B49-ijms-24-06439)]. According to current knowledge, IL-17 inhibition does not interfere with the capacity of patients to develop the expected responses to SARS-CoV-2 [ [42](#B42-ijms-24-06439)]. [45](#B45-ijms-24-06439)]. Though serum levels of TNF have been noted to be elevated in patients with viral respiratory illnesses such as influenza, no significant elevation of TNF was detected in the serum of patients with SARS, suggesting that the immune response to SARS may differ from that of other respiratory illnesses [ [42](#B42-ijms-24-06439)]. Anti-TNF is a mainstream therapy in certain autoimmune conditions (e.g., IBD and psoriasis); however, it may be associated with increased susceptibility to infections and a lower vaccine response [ [44](#B44-ijms-24-06439)]. It has already been described that patients treated with anti-TNF exhibited lower serologic responses one month and six months after vaccination (COVID-19 BNT162b2) compared to those not treated with anti-TNF or to healthy controls (HCs) [ [44](#B44-ijms-24-06439)]. [Figure 3](#ijms-24-06439-f003)). We can conclude that the anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgA titers become visibly higher by the 8th week, although in statistical terms this proved to be only a trend (p = 0.091). At the level of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG titers, by the 8th week post-immunization, the visible increase in humoral response was also manifested in statistical terms (p = 0.024). [Figure 4](#ijms-24-06439-f004)), it can be stated that the immunomodulatory therapies tend to interfere more negatively with the IgA isotype antibody production. In the case of patients receiving biological therapies, after the expectedly suboptimal IgA antibody levels at the 4th week post-immunization, even by the 8th week post-immunization the IgA levels remained lower compared to healthy individuals. Moreover, by the 8th week post-immunization, differences became even more prominent compared to healthy vector vaccine and healthy mRNA vaccine recipients (p = 0.037 and p = 0.040, respectively). 3.3. Vaccines (or Infections) and nAAbs [33](#B33-ijms-24-06439), [34](#B34-ijms-24-06439), [35](#B35-ijms-24-06439), [51](#B51-ijms-24-06439)]. Recently, a link between COVID-19 and the development of autoimmunity has also been proposed [ [38](#B38-ijms-24-06439), [52](#B52-ijms-24-06439)]. It has also been suggested that SARS-CoV-2 causes the development of new-onset IgG autoantibodies. While pathological innate immune activation is well documented in severe diseases, the impact of autoantibodies on disease progression is less well defined [ [53](#B53-ijms-24-06439)]. A recent study concludes that COVID-19 patients exhibit dramatic increases in autoantibody reactivity compared to uninfected controls, with a high prevalence of autoantibodies against immunomodulatory proteins including cytokines, chemokines, complement components and cell surface proteins [ [53](#B53-ijms-24-06439)]. [54](#B54-ijms-24-06439)]. [3](#B3-ijms-24-06439), [55](#B55-ijms-24-06439)], according to recent findings [ [54](#B54-ijms-24-06439)] and our current results ( [Figure 5](#ijms-24-06439-f005)), and also supported by newer literature data [ [7](#B7-ijms-24-06439)], we suggest that this approach might be reviewed. A 2017 study performed on laboratory rats focused on the immunization-induced production of natural antibodies [ [7](#B7-ijms-24-06439)]. It was described that larger immunization-associated differences in natural antibody binding were seen with IgM antibodies compared to IgG antibodies. This fits with the dogma of immunoglobulin class switching, where the acute phase of primary antigen exposure is characterized by prominent IgM production [ [7](#B7-ijms-24-06439)], and it confirms the theory about the plasticity and the (restricted) capacity of adaptation of nAAbs. [56](#B56-ijms-24-06439)]. It has been found that Hsp70-derived epitopes interact with the immune cell components, consequently stimulating the humoral autoimmune response and production of the anti-HSP70 autoantibodies [ [56](#B56-ijms-24-06439)]. Considering the phenomenon of molecular mimicry, it has already been described that 17 human HSP proteins belonging to inter alia Hsp60, Hsp70 and Hsp90 chaperones share immunogenic epitopes (at least six amino acids) with SARS-CoV-2 proteins, as analyzed by the free Immune Epitope Database and Analysis Resource [ [57](#B57-ijms-24-06439)]. Evidently, the plasticity, being one of the most important features of the immune response, is also true in the case of HSPs [ [58](#B58-ijms-24-06439)]. Through molecular mimicry, the infection may cause the exposure of nonself-antigens to the immune system. The evolutionary conservation of heat shock proteins induces cross-reactivity with self-HSP antigens [ [58](#B58-ijms-24-06439)]. Considering all of these, it was expected that we would find connections between anti-HSP70 results and the immunization-induced immune response. In fact, a statistically significant positive connection was found between IgG isotype humoral antibody levels and anti-HSP70 results, as well as between IFN- release assays (IGRA) and anti-HSP70 results. Additionally, connections were observable between the different vaccination groups (vaccine types) and the anti-HSP70 IgG levels. [11](#B11-ijms-24-06439)]. In a previous paper, we examined the potential association between adaptive antibodies (formed as a result of the childhood measles or MMR vaccine) and nAAbs, citrate synthase and the F4 fragment (anti-F4) of I. We found significantly higher anti-CS IgG titers in the antimeasles IgG-sero-positive 0.011) compared to antimeasles IgG sero-negative individuals. The same trend was observable in the case of anti-F4 antibodies as well. [15](#B15-ijms-24-06439)]. Although epidemiological evidence for the nonspecific effects of vaccines is accumulating, the lack of biological feasibility has been an obstacle in the in-depth identification and study of these effects. Therefore, it is important to reveal those immunological mechanisms that may mediate nondisease-specific events [ [15](#B15-ijms-24-06439)]. 4. Materials and Methods 4.1. Human Blood Samples [Supplementary Table S2](#app1-ijms-24-06439)). 4.2. Human Serum Samples for the Comparison of Healthy Individuals versus Autoimmune Patients Receiving Biological Therapies [Supplementary Table S1](#app1-ijms-24-06439)). For the sample measurement and subsequent data analysis, three venipunctures were performed: time point zero was used as a negative control (on the day of immunization and before vaccine administration, when there were no detectable antibody levels; data is not shown), followed by time point one (4 weeks post-vaccination) and time point two (8 weeks post-vaccination) ( [Supplementary S2](#app1-ijms-24-06439)). ELISA Assays [3](#B3-ijms-24-06439)]. Following this, the saturation of nonspecific binding sites with our alternative, combined blocking buffer (0.5% polyvinyl alcohol solution combined with bovine gelatin solution, at a ratio of 2:1) at room temperature (RT) for 2 h was performed. After being washed with PBS + 0.05% Tween 20 (washing buffer; WB), sera were diluted (1:100 in WB) and incubated 50 min at 37 \u00b0C. The secondary antibodies were incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 45 min and rabbit Clara, CA, US). TMB substrate solution (Sigma-Merck, Munich, Germany) was used to visualize the HRP enzymatic reaction, and the reaction was stopped by 1 M H2SO4. Reading was performed at = 450/620 nm using the BEP2000 Advanced automated system. Results are expressed in absorbance (OD) and in quantitative (standard curve-based) results. For data comparison, results were handled as continuous, non-normally distributed integers and the alterations of titers were considered. 4.5. Neutralizing Antibody Measurement\u2014Virus Neutralization ELISA (sVNT) [59](#B59-ijms-24-06439)]. The ELISA assay was performed as per the manufacturer's instructions. The test results obtained are given as percentages of inhibition (% IH). In the test, the 'First WHO International Standard for anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin (human) NIBSC code: 20/136' is used as the reference material [ [60](#B60-ijms-24-06439)]. % IH < 20 negative; % IH 20 to 35 borderline; and % IH > 35 positive. 4.6. Interferon- ELISA [61](#B61-ijms-24-06439)]. The CoV-2 IGRA BLANK tube contains no activating components for immune cells; thus, no interferon- secretion is induced. The plasma thus obtained is used for individual background determination. The CoV-2 IGRA tube is coated with components of the S1 domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. The CoV-2 IGRA mitogen, causing an unspecific interferon- secretion. The plasma thus obtained is used to verify whether the sample contains immune cells in a sufficient quantity and with a sufficient ability to be activated [ [61](#B61-ijms-24-06439)]. The ELISA assay was performed as per the manufacturer's instructions. The calibrator material of the test was adjusted to the international reference material 'Non WHO Reference Material INTERFERON (HUMAN, rDNA derived) NIBSC code: 87/586' [ [62](#B62-ijms-24-06439)]. Results are expressed in international units per milliliter (mIU/mL). Result < 40 mIU/mL negative; result 40 to 50 mIU/mL borderline; and result > 50 mIU/mL positive. 4.7. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 ELISA (IgG, IgA) 4.8. Statistical Analysis 5. Conclusions [7](#B7-ijms-24-06439), [8](#B8-ijms-24-06439)]. In this paper, we demonstrated the concomitance of vaccine (or infection)-induced antibodies and elevated levels of nAAbs with the ensuing positive statistical connections. Based on our current results, we also suggest that the earlier dogma regarding the relatively constant level of nAAbs throughout life\u2014especially regarding the IgG isotype, which might resemble a transition between adaptive and innate immunity\u2014might be reviewed. Based on our current and previous findings [ [54](#B54-ijms-24-06439)], it seems that these nAAbs, under certain circumstances, may be capable of showing a certain level of dynamic plasticity. Nevertheless, we would like to note that supplementing the current set of sera with pre-vaccination samples (obtained at time point zero, before the administration of the vaccine) and longer-term post-vaccination samples (e.g., 8 months after immunization), as well as a broader examination of the potentially expanded memory B cell functions (e.g., dynamic titer changes in different IgG subclasses, with special regard to IgG4) [ [63](#B63-ijms-24-06439)] might have contributed positively to the quality of the study.

They were compared at 4 and 8 weeks post-vaccination. For the sample measurement and subsequent data analysis, three venipunctures have been performed: time point zero was used as a negative control (on the day of immunization and before vaccine administration, when there were no detectable antibody levels; data is not shown), followed by time point one (4 weeks post-vaccination) and time point two (8 weeks post-vaccination). (For vaccine group nomenclature used for the figures, please see [Supplementary Table S2](#app1-ijms-24-06439).)The sample numbers were as follows: untreated, healthy individuals and recipients of the mRNA vaccine (Moderna and Pfizer-BioNtech) = 22. Untreated, healthy individuals and recipients of vector vaccines (AstraZeneca and Sputnik V) = 16.
