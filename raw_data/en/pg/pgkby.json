We are being invited to meet forces of fear, hate and doubt with the power of hope, love, and faith. Understanding the human being through the lens of Anthroposophic Nursing can give us strength in these times to support ourselves, our loved ones, our community, and our world in this time of evolution and becoming. Care for your Spirit: Creating, developing or finding meditative practices can be very helpful and Anthroposophy has many offerings in this way. Start Now edited by Christopher Bamford holds many offerings from the work of Rudolf Steiner. Continue with the practices that you have, which strengthen your connection to your Spirit and the Divine. Care for your Soul: Read inspiring works, dance or do Eurythmy or other forms of movement, sing even just to yourself, garden, spend time in nature, spend time with an artistic craft, cook or organize and beautify your AN care supplies. Deeply nurture what means most to you, your Self, your family, your friends. Remember the Soul mediates between Spirit and Body - so enlivening your soul life is very important to your sense of well-being. Anything creative, artistic, nature based or relational will support the healthy life of the soul. Care for your Body: Get rest, fluids, sleep, and good nutrition. Bring your AN toolkit out for yourself and your loved ones. Work with nourishing oils or a compress to invite and create a relationship with well-being and your body. Take the time to do something loving for your physical body every day. The gifts of AN knowledge and care are there for you every day in so many ways. Re-read the 12 Nursing Gestures and make them Life Gestures! Take the time to open your heart and become the best version of your Self - put that into the world and watch your world change for the better. We at NAANA wish the very best for you and your families in this time, and hope what we have offered and what we will offer will support you on all levels, body, soul and spirit! Please find on the next page a verse given by Rudolf Steiner that can bring strength in these times.

We must acquire serenity in all feelings and sensations about the future. We must look with absolute equanimity to everything that may come and We must think only that whatever comes is given to us by a world direction full of wisdom. It is part of what we must learn in this age namely, to live out of pure trust. Without any security in existence, Trusting in the ever-present help of the spiritual world. Truly nothing else will do if our courage is not to fall. Let us discipline our will and let us seek the awakening from within ourselves every morning and every evening. Anonymous - from Rudolf Steiner lectures Rudolf Steiner showed a special interest and great admiration for Tourmalines for good reason. He clearly understood how significant and influential this crystal stone was for spirituality and personal transformation. Tourmaline is aluminum borosilicate, being primarily structured of aluminum, boron, silicon and oxygen. No two tourmaline stones have the exact same color, ranging in color spectrum from pale to vibrant pink or magenta, to meadow green to teal-blue, and even vibrant yellow to black. Some tourmaline crystals display diverse color zones within a single crystal, can possess bi-colors or tri-colors such as the 'watermelon' tourmaline. This stone is sometimes called the rainbow stone and has longitudinal sections which polarize light. Watermelon tourmaline which has a combination of both red and green colors, is said to promote fast recovery from emotional problems. Tourmaline instills positive thoughts and can offer one peaceful sleep. This colorful mineral stone is historically revered as a \"supernatural\" stone that is capable of protecting whoever wore it. This has to do with its uncommon and very special ability to generate an electric charge and emit negative ions and far infrared rays. When heated it yields positive electric charge at one end and a negative charge at the other. This phenomenon is called pyroelectricity. It also has piezoelectricity attributes which are induced by rubbing the stone or by mechanical stress. These invisible waves of energy are far infrared rays which can be measured, and known to be able to penetrate all layers of the human body and reach the inner-most regions of tissues, muscles and bone. These far infrared rays and negative ions gently soothe, stimulate and detoxify the body and mind. Negative ions are also implicated in being important in determining one's mood. Tourmaline is not only beautiful in its brilliant arrays of color, and its exclusive electrical potentials, tourmaline feels good to have around you. Folk use as well as contemporary science confirms what Rudolf Steiner intuitively knew was significant about this stone. Nature's Healing Art: Tourmaline Crystal by Valerie Cooksley is a Nurse-Aromatherapist pioneer and best-selling author of nine natural health books. She is the Founder of the Institute of Integrative Aromatherapy/Houston, a nationally accredited correspondence course in the art, science and bio-energetics of essential oil therapy.

NAANA NEWS VOL.3, NO. 2 | Issue 2 3 Demonstrating a fever compress, Tina Galgon-Herr On January 25th, 2020 from 10am-12:30pm in Denver, CO there was a workshop for the community, Whole Child Treatments for Fever and Earache. We had approximately 22 participants. It was advertised as a free workshop and we did collect donations to benefit Angelica Village, a non-profit organization which supports families seeking refuge from war and violence and homelessness. The workshop was offered by Adam Blanning MD, Rianne Clark FNP, Tina Galgon-Herr RN, Dona Totten RN and Barbara Cavanagh, our wonderful photographer. Adam began the workshop with research about fever in childhood immune development and how to support a strong immune system at home. The therapies demonstrated by the nurses supported a child with fever (lemon calf wrap) by Tina, earache (onion poultice) by Rianne and anyone experiencing upper respiratory congestion (chamomile inhalation) by Dona. Therapies were presented in a practical way so participants left with a feeling that they could do this at home. We all felt it was a success and hope to do more of these workshops in the future.

She attended the first meeting of the group of nurses that became ANAA in 1984. Mentored by Margaret Rosenthaler in the mid 1980s, Margaretta studied rhythmical massage with Jean White and Barbara Cavanaugh in Germany under the tutelage of Frau Marbach in the late 1980's. She went on to develop her own nursing practice in Durham, NC where she provided rhythmical massage, einreibungen and anthroposohical nursing for her community, as well as offering numerous courses on creating a healing environment and the care of the sick. She assisted ANAA in developing The Art of Nursing curriculum in the mid 1990s while serving on the education committee and as an instructor for the Art of Nursing courses as well as giving courses at PAAM and Artemisia. Many of us remember she and Jean White hosted the ANAA annual conference in 1992 at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, which was the first ANAA conference in an academic setting and the first to offer CEUs. Margaretta was known for her deeper understanding of the human being as an incarnating being and that anthroposophical nursing was not limited to compresses and wraps. She was fond of saying, \"Meet people where they are and accompany them on their journey toward healing.\" She was known for her profound capacities with rhythmical massage and die Einreibung. She was active in the Chapel Hill anthroposophic community and was a mentor to nurses, doctors, health care professionals, parents and lay care givers. Many thanks to Ris\u00eb Smythe-Freed, past-President, ANAA, for these kind memories of Margaretta. Dear colleagues, We would like to invite you to join us on Saturday, August 1st, 2020, 1pm EST/10am PST, when the Anthroposophic Health Association will host an online meeting to celebrate 100 years of Anthroposophic Medicine. We are hoping that as many AHA members and friends as possible can come together so that we can collectively gather forces and intention for the start of the next 100 years! The meeting will run about 75 minutes, with introductory thoughts, a chance to share with colleagues in small groups about what we imagine can be our gift(s) - our offering- to the next 100 years, then a continent-wide eurythmy \"Halleluiah.\" Our goal is for this to be a sharing of resources and inspiration, a salutogenic vortex of gratitude for all that has been shared and done so far, partnered with enthusiasm, hope, and love for all the future will bring. Please save the date. Detailed information will be sent out in July. Please also make note that the AHA Annual General Meeting will be held on Thursday, August 20th at 8:30pm EST/5:30pm PST. All members are invited to hear specific updates about our organizational work over the last year and as well as plans for the future. Warm greetings to all, with wishes for good health, peace, and deep love for one another, Adam Blanning, Elizabeth Sustick, Tonya Stoddard, birthday celebration planners, for the AHA board President's Message by Elizabeth Sustick NAANA NEWS VOL.3, NO. 2 | Issue 2 5 Dear Friends, I spent 25 years being a co-worker at the Fellowship Community. It was there that I learned my anthroposophic nursing having come to the Fellowship as an RN. In the 1980's through the 1990's there were many opportunities to administer compresses and healing creams. Watching a bedsore or ulcer heal with consistent attention with Weleda essences and creams was watching a miracle. At that time anthroposophy and the medical work were at the forefront. Biodynamic gardening included the growing of kitchen herbs and medicinal herbs. Some of our raised beds were filled with calendula for Weleda to use. Without going into detail I would like to share that the work with compresses has fallen into the background. Some are very interested but somehow the outer work takes over with so many other tasks to tend to (such as an immense amount of paper work for our nurses). That is why we are in search of an anthroposophic nurse who can share in the life of the work with our older individuals but also help develop our compress work. I am doing a small amount and try to help others but I am not actively in the trenches. If you or you know of anyone who might be interested in joining us at the Fellowship, please contact me. I can share much more, especially if someone were open to visiting. Thank you for whatever help you can offer. Warm greetings, Judith Brockway Aventuro judithbrockway@gmail.com Often times in Anthroposophic circles one hears a person say, \"Rudolf Steiner said\", yet we all know that we must have our own experiences of what Steiner said in order to come to a deeper awareness of ourselves and the world. I have just returned home from our first ever NAANA Continuing Education course for Anthroposophic Nurses who completed a basic NAANA sponsored AN course and Rolf Heine came from Germany to join us. The course was AWESOME and during our 5 days together we were nourished, awakened, challenged and affirmed in all aspects of our nursing work. Along the way, I kept notes of some of the pearls of wisdom Rolf shared with us and now instead of saying \"Rudolf Steiner said\", we can say, \"Rolf Heine said\". Of course, our experience will inform us of the truth living in these words. 1. \"When we think of the heart, we think also of the outer periphery of our community building\" 2. \"Consciousness is the activity of letting things appear. We must give things the chance to emerge\". 3. \"The exercise of Impartiality is to be open to the wonder of healing, open to perceive the unexpected, the Divine\". 4. \"All existing forms are examples for something existing anywhere\". 5. \"The heart is formed out of the stream of fluids and is the first organ to begin to pulsate and the last organ to complete its pulsing\". 6. \"To study our memory is to come close to what the etheric is\". 7. \"Awareness of how we come to a conclusion is close to the process of perceiving the etheric\". 7 Pearls of Wisdom: \"Because Rolf Heine Said\" by Teresa Ferrari Anthroposophical Nurse needed for Hilltop House at Fellowship Community NY by Judith Brockway NAANA NEWS VOL.3, NO. 2 | Issue 2 6 On Saturday, 18 July 2020, IVAA and the Medical Section at the Goetheanum are hosting an international Webinar on Covid-19 with interdisciplinary anthroposophic medical contributions. The Webinar will be held via Zoom, from 12.00-16.40 CET. With this online seminar we gather first experiences from around the world with multi-disciplinary AM contributions. Among others, we will consider experiences leading towards an overall therapeutic AM treatment concept; give practical recommendations for external applications and nursing practices in prevention, treatment and recovery of the disease; and will take a closer look at lessons learned with four case-studies from around the world. To understand the diverse implications of the Covid-19 pandemic, the spiritual aspects of the crises will be explored through a deeper perspective, closing with questions to the forthcomings: What are the possible learnings from this pandemic? With this question in mind, the Webinar will be an opportunity to collect the diverse international experiences of AM and discuss future developments. We hope that this online seminar will be an occasion to collectively think about different AM viewpoints on the global pandemic, through both practical, hands-on aspects and deeper perspectives, learning about the new challenges as a possible therapeutic answer to human development. The main speaking language will be English, and Spanish simultaneous interpretation will be available. Please feel free to share this information with your colleagues and your organisation.

Ermengarde is a pioneer of anthroposophic nursing. As co-author of the first comprehensive book on Anthroposophical Nursing (\"Nursing at Home\"), which has been translated into several languages, she has become internationally known. For decades she was a member of the International Initiative Circle for Nursing at the Medical Section and played a major role in shaping the transition to the International Forum for Anthroposophical Nursing. As a nurse and teacher she has been responsible for the development of nursing in the formulation of important principles (\"Caring-Mediating-Accompanying\"), for community building in Holland and in the world, and for fostering the relationship with the spiritual world. I also want to mention I spoke with Joan Smith via zoom a few days ago- she sends us her warm greetings and best wishes. 5 years ago, Joan had a catastrophic illness and came close to dying. She just turned 80, is living quietly in Forest Row, and has a wonderful anthroposophic community to support her fragile health. Joan was a key support to bringing out IPMT training into focus. I think some of us remember her at IONS when she was invited by Alicia to offer an Orientation Course. The following year Christoph arrived and the rest is history.
