Yes, the 79th Annual Golden Globes will still air this Sunday, January 9, honoring the best in film and television from the last year. But rather than appearing on live TV, the event will be streamed elsewhere. And according to [Page Six](https://pagesix.com/2022/01/04/golden-globes-2022-wont-have-a-red-carpet/?utm_medium=browser_notifications&utm_source=pushly&utm_campaign=1767030) and [Variety](https://variety.com/2022/film/columns/golden-globes-no-celebrity-presenters-1235146563/), the show will not be the star-studded extravaganza it usually is\u2014in fact, there will be no celebrity presenters or red carpet. In part, this is due to the highly transmissible omicron variant of COVID-19, but it doesn't help that the event has become so controversial in recent years. So how did we get here? Here's what we know so far. What's [the controversy](https://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/film-tv/a36386699/golden-globes-controversy-explained/) surrounding the Golden Globes again? The Hollywood Foreign Press Association came under fire in 2021 after a [Los Angeles Times](https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/business/story/2021-02-21/hfpa-golden-globes-2021-who-are-the-members) report revealed that zero of the organization's 87 members at the time were Black, and that much of the group's nomination process was influenced by over-the-top gifting. Following the report, Tom Cruise returned his three Golden Globe awards, while his peers such as Scarlett Johansson and Mark Ruffalo urged fellow Hollywood actors back\" from the HFPA. Netflix, Amazon, and WarnerMedia also boycotted the awards show. In response, the HFPA updated its bylaws. The organization has also added 21 new members in what it describes as \"its most diverse class to date.\" The ceremony won't be televised. Due to the controversy, NBC opted to not televise the ceremony for 2022. \"We continue to believe that the HFPA is committed to meaningful reform,\" the company said in a statement at the time. \"However, change of this magnitude takes time and work, and we feel strongly that the HFPA needs time to do it right. As such, NBC will not air the 2022 Golden Globes. Assuming the organization executes on its plan, we are hopeful we will be in a position to air the show in January 2023.\" Rather than appearing on another network, the awards show will be broadcast elsewhere with more details regarding how to watch to come. There will be no red carpet. According to Page Six, due to the ongoing pandemic, there will be no step-and-repeat red carpet ahead of the streamed ceremony. Over the years, the Golden Globes have remained one of the highlights of awards season fashion, and under normal circumstances would have served as a prime opportunity to see Hollywood heavyweights at their sartorial best. \"I think we all know that it's not going to be a celebrity-driven event that it has been in the past\u2014no red carpet and nothing flashy,\" HFPA president Helen Hoehne [told The Hollywood Reporter](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/general-news/golden-globes-nominations-2022-hfpa-snoop-dogg-1235061622/) previously. There won't be any celebrity presenters. According to [Variety](https://variety.com/2022/film/columns/golden-globes-no-celebrity-presenters-1235146563/), the original plan for the Golden Globes was to have celebrity presenters in attendance\u2014similar to 2021's scaled-back ceremony. But with the racial demographics controversy still looming, the show was unable to confirm any celebrity attendees. \"Variety has obtained a copy of an email from the Globes talent booker that was sent to several publicity agencies inquiring about their clients participating in the show,\" the report read. \"However, sources say, no celebs have agreed to take part.\" Members of the HFPA are expected to be in attendance. The email also revealed that the event will have \"limited guests\" and enforce \"strict COVID protocols\" that include proof of full vaccination including a booster shot, as well as a negative PCR test. So, what will be happening? According to a statement from the Globes' planning committee obtained by Variety, the 2022 Golden Globes will focus on highlighting the \"diverse, community-based programs that empower inclusive filmmakers and journalists to pursue their storytelling passions.\" The statement also said, \"The Golden Globes will move forward with a small event on January 9th that will not only award the best performances in television and film for 2021, but also on recognizing the importance of supporting diverse creatives across the industry.\" Bianca Betancourt is the culture editor at [HarpersBAZAAR.com](http://harpersbazaar.com/), where she covers all things film, TV, music, and more.
