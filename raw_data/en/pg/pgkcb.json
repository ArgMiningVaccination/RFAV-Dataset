Pro hockey, basketball and baseball are rolling out plans for mostly fan-less participation. In the meantime, your patients have been returning to athletic pursuits when and where appropriate, whether it's jogging, golf, tennis or other sports with appropriate social distancing. Whether you specialize in sports chiropractic or not, you have sports chiropractic patients of all ages, and they're itching to put cabin fever behind them and again take to the field or court. \"In the coming months we can anticipate a mental health tsunami,\" says Spencer Baron, DC, DACBSP, on the mental difficulties, along with the physical, of returning to sports in a pandemic world. Baron served as a team chiropractic physician for the Miami Dolphins for 19 years and directs DoCS (Doctors of Chiropractic Sports), an organization committed to creating camaraderie and coaching within the chiropractic profession. \"Our athletes and active patients are completely out of sync from an unparalleled and disrupted year of conflict, fear and confusion. [And] prolonged muscular inactivity, such as what some have faced during the pandemic, inevitably leads to a loss of muscle mass and functional capacity. It affects their strength, stamina and coordination. This is a recipe for athletic disaster.\" In this issue he discusses helping athletes to regain homeostasis, \"the balance between chemical (nutritional), physical and mental well-being, or the 'Triad of Health.'\" Also on the athletic tip in this issue is advice on high-level athletes (and subsequently your recreational and weekend warriors) and orthotics, and how laser treatments have transformed college and professional rehab. The Florida Chiropractic Association gives us an inside look at The National conference in Orlando in August, and if you've ever wanted to up your webinar game, or try one for the first time, we've got advice from one of the most popular chiropractors in the business.Keeping chiropractic out front As chiropractic practices reconnect with patients during the pandemic, the American Chiropractic Association (ACA) is among a number of organizations that should be lauded for making chiropractic an \"essential service\" while other health care providers were shut down by the U.S. government. The ACA over the first six months of 2020 successfully: Petitioned the U.S. Dept. of Homeland Security to list chiropractic as an essential health care provider; Maintained the profession's integrity by delineating between spinal adjustments and improving immunity to COVID-19 in a sea of misinformation; Promoted the vital role DCs play in helping patients improve their health \"through their physician-level clinical practices, which includes guidance on preventing obesity, metabolic diseases like diabetes and heart disease;\" Continued to support the Chiropractic Medicare Coverage Modernization Act, or H.R. 3654; And worked with major media groups (Wall Street Journal, Washington Post) during the pandemic to provide the public with strategies to prevent injuries while working from home, and directing new patients to chiropractic. \"For the first time in history, chiropractic is rightfully recognized as essential by the federal government: you are an essential health care provider,\" writes Debra Brown Hagan, CEO of the Florida Chiropractic Association, in this issue where she previews The National. \"As the world adjusts to the new normal, health care remains a priority. It is a time to revamp, diversify your offerings and better serve the needs of your patients. The COVID-19 global pandemic has changed the world.\" To your practice's success, Richard Vach EDITOR-IN-CHIEF SPORTS & ATHLETIC PERFORMANCE \"OUR ATHLETES AND ACTIVE PATIENTS ARE COMPLETELY OUT OF SYNC FROM AN UNPARALLELED AND DISRUPTED YEAR OF CONFLICT, FEAR, AND CONFUSION.\" FOUNDED 1954 William L.

ChiroEco.com/alyssa-humphreyFace masks critical to COVID-19 prevention A study by a team of researchers led by a Texas A&M University professor has found that not wearing a face mask dramatically increases a person's chances of being infected with the COVID-19 virus. The research is published in the current issue of PNAS (Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences). The team examined the chances of COVID-19 infection and how the virus is easily passed from person to person. From trends and mitigation procedures in China, Italy and New York City, the researchers found that using a face mask reduced the number of infections by more than 78,000 in Italy from April 6-May 9 and by over 66,000 in New York City from April 17-May 9.

Women's Health 1st Annual Women's Health Issue ChiroEco.com/ magazineTWITTER DISCUSSIONRESOURCES @CHIROECO.COM SOCIALMARKETING What are the most common injuries you see among your patients who play sports?3 new marketing trends to watch As a chiropractor, you should be using top-notch digital marketing communications to reach out to prospective patients, with the goal of positioning chiropractic as a natural, safe alternative to standard medical care. Here are three to consider: Video marketing. If you already have social media as part of your marketing, you've likely noticed that Facebook and Instagram are placing more emphasis on their video capabilities, particularly for businesses. Facebook Live allows you to stream a video live at a specific time. For example, you can announce a talk or demonstration on your Facebook page, then use Facebook Live to stream it. Viewers can leave comments and ask questions as they watch. Chatbots. If you have ever interacted with an online program that behaved like a live customer service representative, you've encountered a chatbot. These interface programs are meant to simulate live help desk conversations with users. In a chiropractic setting, chatbots could be used to remind patients about appointments, answer general questions about chiropractic care or offer health tips. They can easily handle basic inquiries and switch users over to a live person if needed. Infographics. You will likely find that one of the most-visited pages on your site will be the FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions). One way to market is to create infographics, which provide complex answers in a graphic format that is easier for users to understand than if you only provided text. These tactics can become a vital part of your campaign to bring in new patients. \u2014Tina Beychok For more social marketing ideas, visit the Business Tips section of chiroeco.com.Each month we'll ask a new question on our Facebook page.

The opportunity comes by way of an agreement between Logan and CAVHS. A recent law change in Arkansas now allows chiropractic students to gain hands-on educational experience, as Arkansas had historically been an \"observation-only\" state. Michael DuPriest, DC, PT, DPT, FACO, ('87) worked to make the opportunity possible. DuPriest, lead chiropractor at CAVHS, began working toward his goal to change chiropractic laws in Arkansas when he met Jason Goodman, DC, PhD, director of clinical education at Logan, at a training seminar in Fort Wayne, Ind., a few years ago. DuPriest shared his vision with Goodman about working to amend the Arkansas law to eventually allow a \"hands-on\" experience for chiropractic students. DuPriest and his team lobbied at the state legislature in Little Rock until the law was finally reformed on June 1. Shortly after, the affiliation with Logan was formed. \"Little by little, more states are starting to change their laws to allow hands-on clinical rotations,\" Goodman said. Participating in a preceptorship in a VA setting is extremely competitive. \"An opportunity like this really teaches students the framework to feel fully confident working with these patients,\" said Goodman. \"Logan strives to form as many partnerships as possible with VA facilities to allow our students to rotate in a highly- robust clinical environment.\" Goodman says this affiliation could not have been formed at a better time. \"This positive news was such a nice, welcomed change of pace from what our students have been going through the past few months,\" Goodman said.

We asked Erin Jackson, managing partner and health care attorney at Jackson LLP Healthcare Lawyers, to answer some questions about telehealth liability. Her firm advises health care entities and practitioners about legal and regulatory compliance, including telemedicine issues. What is the most important thing that chiropractors need to keep in mind when using telehealth to protect both them -selves and their patients? It's crucial to remember that not all patients and not all condi - tions can be cared for via telehealth while also meeting your standard of care. Your legal standard of care is the level of skill that you're required to provide to ensure you're meeting your duty to your patients. This is oversimplifying it, but it essentially asks whether a reasonable practitioner in your shoes would have acted differently. In regard to licensing concerns, if they're treating people over state lines, what do they need to be aware of with tele - health liability? Coronavirus (COVID-19) has rapidly spread across the U.S. and the world, and Americans are being advised by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) to remain vigilant and take precautions, particularly social distancing and avoiding unnecessary contact and gatherings, and for personal protection, maintaining a healthy diet and strong immune system. Telehealth liability during a pandemic: advice from a health care attorneyCORONAVIRUS CENTRAL 16 CHIROPRACTIC ECONOMICS JULY 31, 2020 CHIROECO.COMThey need to know the licensing laws in the state where the chiropractor is located, but also of the requirements in the state where the patient is located. As a general rule, most medical boards have concluded that the services are being rendered in the state where the patient is located. Typically, the DC will be held to the license restrictions and duties of both states while offering those services. Note that there have been some Medicare waivers and relaxation of these rules for COVID, but if the state(s) haven't also adopted these waivers, then practicing across state lines may still violate the state laws. How can they abide by HIPAA regulations? They are mandated to maintain written HIPAA policies and procedures which address their specific efforts to comply with the privacy, security, and breach notification rules, as well as their state medical privacy requirements. Simply using a HIPAA-compliant EMR/EHR or telehealth platform is completely insufficient. What else should DCs be aware of regarding telehealth? They must be sure that their liability insurer covers telehealth visits. They need to have a plan for what happens if the patient has a medical emergency, or for what happens if they are inad - vertently disconnected from their patient during the visit. If they will be billing insurance, they need to be sure that they're using the right billing codes. Insurance is regulated state-by-state, and insurer-by-insurer. The Medicare waivers implemented for some providers for telehealth parity are set to expire, so we're watching the regs on that carefully. Be sure that patients aren't surprised if telehealth visits aren't covered when in-person visits were. Be careful about the business relationships with telehealth platforms. Many new platforms are coming online which want to be compensated by taking a per-booking fee or a percentage of patient revenues. Many of these payment schemes violate state practice act fee-splitting prohibitions. \u2014 Michele Wojciechowski CORONAVIRUS CENTRAL CORONAVIRUS CENTRAL Follow Us on Social Media @ChiroEcoMag @ChiroEcoMag@chiropractic-economics @ChiroEcoMag For the latest COVID-19 info for doctors of chiropractic, including upcoming webinars, updates, resources and articles from Chiropractic Economics, go to chiroeco.com/coronavirus-covid-19.Free Webinar: Working with fitness, mind-body patients during COVID-19 For chiropractors dealing with COVID-19 who work with rehab, fitness or the mind-body connection with patients, the GWS Global Wellness Collaboration hosted the webinar available on-demand, \"Fitness & Mind-Body: Insights on Reopening, Resetting, Reimagining.\" Fitness and mind-body is a robust, $595 billion sector of the global wellness economy, with unique challenges and opportunities.

CHIROECO.COM JULY 31, 2020 CHIROPRACTIC ECONOMICS 17SPONSORED BY :NEW PRACTITIONER WHETHER YOU'VE RECENTLY HUNG UP YOUR SHINGLE OR YOU'VE BEEN IN THE CHIROPRACTIC BUSINESS FOR 30 YEARS , you can always improve \u2014 both at what you do and with what you offer to your patients. According to Robert Koser, DC, a chiropractic physician and clinical business development professional at iRISE Spine and Joint in Tampa, Fla., \"The single best piece of advice I could give is to invest in your niche interests that help others.\" Koser explains that while some DCs are passionate about rehab-based care such as the McKenzie Method, other DCs may prefer pursuing something like a manual therapy such as Active Release Technique. Make a plan for change Before making any changes, like adding or adjusting features, Koser says that DCs should have a change management plan. \"It is important to know why a change is happening and what is the desired goal,\" says Koser. If you need help, reach out to a mentor or a reputable consultant.\" When you've implemented your change(s), Koser says to consistently review them to make sure that they're meeting your expectations. When chiropractors decide to take steps to enhance their career development, one way would be through modalities. \"Choosing the right modalities for a chiropractor to add to their practice really is dependent on their patient population and conditions treated,\" says Koser. In some cases, incorporating new modalities could broaden a DC's demographic scope. For instance, Koser is acupuncture certified, and at times he's received referrals from primary care doctors to work with the geriatric community in the co-management of their pain. Offer supplements or package deals Many chiropractors also deal with supplements for patients \u2014 either by prescribing them and/or selling them as well. Koser says that if you decide you want to add supplement sales, make sure that you have the space to both display and store inventory. He also suggests that DCs do their research. \"Choosing a reputable company to work with is very important to ensure patients are receiving the highest quality products possible,\" Koser says. \"I recommend sourcing from Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP)-certified companies.\" If you're looking to add passive income to your practice, Koser recommends offering membership or subscription- based services. \"Many doctors do this by offering massage therapy packages, personalized health coaching and even personal training,\" Koser says. \"Implementing an ethical and value- based program can be an instant game changer for your patients and practice.\" Red flags Koser adds that when developing your career, it's important to keep a lookout for red flags. \"When expanding services, red flags should be going off if any opportunity is outside the scope of practice for your prospective state or violates the standard of care,\" he says. \"Yellow flag offerings would be anything you are not entirely comfortable doing at that moment in time. \"Whenever a chiropractor 'ups their game,' so to speak, with services and knowledge, the benefits are two-fold \u2014 you help the community, and you rise up in the profession. Patients are your best referral source. If you treat individuals with compassion, respect, and utmost leading expertise, you'll certainly see positive effects on your practice.\" ADVERTORIAL About Dee Cee Labs Founded by Dr. Harry Hester in 1962, Dee Cee Labs has a company culture focused on helping folks discover a healthier quality of life through good, sound nutritional products.

IN THE COMING MONTHS WE CAN ANTICIPATE A MENTAL HEALTH TSUNAMI. Our athletes and active patients are completely out of sync from an unparalleled and disrupted year of conflict, fear and confusion. We went from social distancing (the virus) to social gathering (the protests) in a matter of weeks and it has taken its toll. CHIROECO.COM JULY 31, 2020 CHIROPRACTIC ECONOMICS 21Case study: mental to physical pain Beth is a 37-year-old mother of two who plays tennis twice a week, jogs and weight trains. She presented with non-specific, insidious onset of transient low-back pain, but after a two-week trial of chiropractic treatment three times a week, there was no change. I was slightly frustrated. Every visit was filled with new questions, and old ones that were just worded differently. I was looking for the puzzle piece that would make Beth's clinical picture clearer. Finally, one day, she joked about getting a doctor's note to get out of having sex with her husband. That's when I realized what was going on. Beth was on the verge of divorce, so her low-back pain may have been subconsciously psychosomatic. A doctor is a health detective and muse who finds the problem and provides hope by inspiring the patient. Working with all levels of athletes, this is a \"must-have\" aptitude when dealing with injuries and peak performance strategies. It is time to stand firm on what we know \u2014 and what we can learn \u2014 so we can better serve our athletic patients. Most DCs were taught in chiropractic college that homeostasis is a balance between chemical (nutritional), physical and mental well-being. It is called the \"Triad of Health\" and oriented as a triangle with even sides. Here are some tips for each one: Mental health People who have extraordinary athletic competence are masters of mental toughness and resilience. What's the difference between these two qualities? Mental toughness \u2014 the learned quality of sustaining ideal performance despite whatever life throws at you. Good players use this toughness through their years of training and playing, but great players let it use them. Over time, it becomes so natural and innate that they never even think about it. They are simply mentally tough; there is no possibility of being any other way. Resilience \u2014 the quality of using adversity as a tool for motivation and inspiration. This describes players who bounce back from adversity easily and maturely. They are able to immediately refocus on the future and identify how an event has presented an unexpected opportunity without feeling defeated or overwhelmed. The combination of these two characteristics enables superstar athletes (and you also, if you choose) to focus on specific desired results and how best to achieve them. Jethro Toomer, PhD, a psychologist formerly with the Miami Dolphins, teaches that comparing mental toughness and resilience \"...is like comparing a two-by-four piece of wood to a palm tree. One can keep being hit over and over again without a change in their attitude, while the other can sway and bend and resume its position.\" The way you develop resilience and mental toughness is to change your vocabulary. When an athlete uses extreme words like \"awful,\" \"terrible\" or \"horrible\" to describe performance, it allows their mind to lead their body into debilitating despair. Sometimes, simply changing the words that describe the event FEATURE STORY [Resilient athletes] are able to immediately refocus on the future and identify how an event has presented an unexpected opportunity without feeling defeated or overwhelmed. 22 CHIROPRACTIC ECONOMICS JULY 31, 2020 CHIROECO.COMcan significantly affect the athlete's ability to reframe and recover from a disappointing incident. An attentive coach might suggest changing \"hate\" to \"dislike\" (my mom's personal favorite) or \"problems\" to \"challenges.\" The hope is to stimulate inspiration rather than perspiration. Softening the words can minimize negatives and enhance positive impacts. Nutritional health The lockdown from COVID-19 has hindered some athletes nutri - tionally. Yet, proper diet is as critical to an athlete's body as it is to an academic's brain. How can you help an athlete with nutritional health now that they're returning to training and play? Remind them that if you drink too much fluid before, during or after eating, the digestive acids in their stomach become less effective. It can also result in gas, bloating and cramping. Athletes can avoid this by reducing how much they drink 30 minutes before and 60 minutes after a meal. Next, researchers are noting a growing phenomenon called \"food sensitivity.\" This is different from a full-blown allergic reaction; it is a more subtle reaction to substances (either natural or synthetic) in foods and often occurs with foods that are eaten frequently. The cheapest, easiest and most effective way to find sensitivities within your athletes is to have them journal their reactions after they eat. This helps identify the problem foods so they can be eliminated. Be aware that eliminating these foods may actually cause FEATURE STORY (573) 745-1086 The ECLIPSE Electric Flexion Starting at only $3,295 The Nova Introductory price of only $2,495 New hinge down abdominal section * Incredible strength and construction * Tild heald with adjustable face cushions * Rear lateral flexion with removable guide-flex handle * Electric spring tension control * Ankle extension with ankle strap * Choice of upholstery colors and table heights * The best priced manual flexion table for the price anywhereThe Comet Introductory price of only $3,595 Rear lateral flexion with removable guide handle Variable flexion speed Tilt head with adjustable face cushions Hingedown abdominal Ankle extension and patient traction handlebars Whisper quiet and glass smooth flexion Choice of heights and upholstery color One of the best built, most versatile and affordable of any electric flexion tables on the market The Medray Acoustic Wave Only $4,495 * Dual power settings * Fully Adjustable parameters * All controls on handpiece(table shown with optional drops)(table shown with optional drops) (table shown with optional drops)Variable electric flexion speed * Front lateral flexion * The quietest table on the market * Hinge down abdominal section * Adjustable patient traction bars * Much, much more!

But the upside is that they will feel healthier and more energetic as their bodies no longer struggle to process foods they cannot effectively manage. A costlier but more accurate approach is a food sensitivity test, which requires drawing blood. Physical health Prolonged muscular inactivity, such as what some have faced during the pandemic, inevitably leads to a loss of muscle mass and functional capacity. It affects their strength, stamina and coordination. This is a recipe for athletic disaster. The post-pandemic protocol is the same as the protocol used following an injury. Get up and move as soon as you can to minimize weak muscles. This helps avoid injury and brings blood flow to the needed areas. Also, I keep hearing about strengthening your core, ad nauseam. During my intensive search for the most effective and efficient muscle conditioning practices, I came across several studies touting \"the best\" practices for abdominal conditioning. However, each was similarly and critically flawed because it did not consider or evaluate potential damage to the lower back. To this day, the only exercise I've ever found that remains the most scientifically sound is the V-Up. This exercise is the most effective for the abdominals while having the least effect on the low back. To do it, lie on the floor supine and extend your legs and arms straight up to the ceiling. Next, touch your fingers to your toes. Hold this position for five seconds. Start with 10-15 repetitions and increase gradually as you get stronger. That's it!Seek to understand the athlete Never take for granted the amazing lives that our athletes live and consider what it takes to keep them strong and healthy. It takes years of hard work, endurance and persistence to get \u2014 and stay \u2014 where they are. Additionally, behind any inherent skill stands an incredibly talented and dedicated team of support staff and health care professionals. These professionals deserve far more than the few accolades they receive. They are the true contenders in the health care arena and they never stop learning what it takes to get their patients healthier, faster and stronger each time they face the field, court, track or stadium. Achieving this type of goal and helping athletes return to form involves using a three-pronged approach that is utilized with compassion and concern. It's an approach that entices athletic patients to want to follow your lead, because they don't care how much you know until they know how much you care.

HIGH-LEVEL ATHLETES AND ORTHOTICS Enhancing form and function are goals for elite athletes \u2014 as well as everyday patients BY KURT A. JUERGENS, DC, CCSP TIME TO READ: 10-12 MIN. IN 1987, WHILE A STUDENT AT TEXAS CHIROPRACTIC COLLEGE, I HAD THE PRIVILEGE OF BEING A STUDENT OF JOHN NASH, DC, one of the great pioneers in sports chiropractic. He enthusiastically shared his passion for all sports, as well as his passion for teaching students the complexities of sports performance. His passion and dedication to his students ultimately led to the creation and implementation of the gait analysis training program at Texas Chiropractic College. Through this program, students had numerous opportunities to provide gait analysis at running events in and around the Houston area. The program was a huge success, and TCC's sports chiropractic students were then invited to provide gait analysis to elite runners outside the Houston area as well. One of the most memorable events for me as a student was the New Jersey Waterfront Marathon. The positive impact that our gait analysis had on so many elite runners set the stage for my own passion of studying running gait and foot biomechanics. CHIROECO.COM JULY 31, 2020 CHIROPRACTIC ECONOMICS 27FEATURE STORY Sports medicine teams and orthotics Shortly after opening my private practice, the U.S. Olympic Trials track and field team asked me to serve on their sports medicine team. This experience allowed me to work with renowned sports doctors and therapists of all disciplines, as well as the elite athletes on the team. I learned so much from both the providers and the athletes, and I also realized the importance of treating every future patient as if they were a world-class athlete. Correcting misalignments, enhancing form and function, and allowing individuals to work or perform at their best are goals for the elite athletes as well as the non-athletes performing activities of daily living. All patients will benefit when body parts are aligned properly, adequately supported, sufficiently mobile, and capable of responding appropriately to external forces. Fitness balance and biomechanics Fitness by definition is a balance between strength, conditioning and flexibility. These different components are important for the general population, but in elite athletes, they are vitally important for preventing injury and maximizing athletic performance. Another critical area to address in this effort is sound foundational biomechanics. During the gait cycle, the foot initiates a cascade of events that travel up the kinetic chain. The foot's structure greatly impacts how force travels throughout the body. The foot has three natural arches: the transverse or metatarsal arch, the medial longitudinal arch and the lateral longitudinal arch. Collectively, these arches make up the foot's plantar vault. This vault is a dynamic structure and is elevated to allow the foot to absorb and disperse energy at impact. It also allows the foot to transition smoothly from heel strike to mid-stance, and then finally to the toe-off phase of the gait cycle. Technical issues of the feet such as supination, over-pronation, pes planus, flexible pes planus and forefoot valgus cause a myriad of biomechanical distortions which negatively impact the normal gait cycle as well as lower extremity alignment. The start of the kinetic chain During the initial phase of the gait cycle, the heel strikes the ground. How the body responds next will determine whether impact is absorbed at the foot or is transferred to other struc - tures up the kinetic chain. Adequate architectural support throughout the plantar vault, along with proper biomechanics, will allow maximum gait cycle efficiency and minimize stress and strain on the intrinsic structures of the lower extremity. The structure and biomechanics of the feet play a critical role in keeping athletes at the top of their game. Anatomical misalignments, poor training methods, technical errors, unfamiliar techniques, and environmental factors (including athletic surfaces) have been implicated as contributing factors to lower-extremity injuries. These factors all start in the feet. Therefore, in every athlete, examination of the feet should be paramount, noting any evidence of flattened feet, foot flare, genu valgus, or bowing of the Achilles tendons.

Ankle inversion sprains are the most common traumatic injury in athletes.\u00b9 Improper jump landings and rolling over the lateral aspect of the foot while in the toe-off phase of the gait cycle are the usual mechanisms of injury. A previous ankle sprain is the single greatest risk factor for a future ankle sprain injury. Therefore, every effort should be taken to stabilize the foot's foundation in order to encourage proper landing and reduce the risk of an ankle sprain injury. Case study A few years ago, a two-time world champion professional basketball player presented to my office complaining of medial knee pain and left-sided lower-back pain. After examining the areas of issue, I informed the elite athlete I would be looking at other areas that may be contributing to his knee and back pain. I explained simple biomechanics associated with the kinetic chain and how the foundation of the foot affects the knee and back. I informed him that I would be taking a laser weight bearing image of his foot in order to determine the presence of any technical issues that could be contributing to his pain. The results showed significant over-pronation, which correlated with my exam findings: foot flare, bowed Achilles tendon and an accentuated genu valgus deformity. Custom orthotics were warranted in this case. I explained the link between his foot, knee and back, and he understood the value of incorporating custom orthotics. His laser images were sent to the laboratory, where his custom orthotics were built. His custom orthotics arrived the following week, and ever since have been a game-changer for him. For this athlete, the orthotics addressed the technical issues with his feet and helped to drastically reduce the pain in his knee and back. He has ordered multiple pairs since I first saw him and to date, does not step on the court without his custom orthotics. This is just one example of literally hundreds of athletes I have seen benefit from wearing custom orthotics. All patients will benefit when body parts are aligned properly, adequately supported, sufficiently mobile, and capable of responding appropriately to external forces.

A properly supported plantar vault will ensure proper alignment and allow the foot to perform its function of absorbing and dispersing energy at impact, thus preventing many common lower extremity conditions. Custom orthotics have become a popular tool that clinicians utilize to address their patients' biomechanical issues. By using technology that provides a 3D image of the feet, athletes can easily see any areas of concern regarding their lower limb biomechanics. This visual, along with a verbal explanation of the image, clarifies how untreated malfunctions in the feet negatively impact other structures up the kinetic chain, and ultimately increase risk of injury and reduce performance. 3D foot technology Using 3D technology to educate the athlete fosters understanding of their condition and the importance of incor - porating custom orthotics into their training program. Elite athletes want to do whatever it takes to compete at the top of their game. Helping them do so, and witnessing their success, stirs up the same positive emotions I experienced long ago at the New Jersey Waterfront Marathon. And I am reminded of why I'm still passionate about the running gait and the biomechanics of the feet.

CBD is also known for its high intra- and inter-subject absorption variability in humans. To overcome these limitations a novel self-emulsifying drug delivery system (SEDDS) based on VESIsorb \u00aeformulation technologyincorporating CBD, as Hemp-Extract, was developed (SEDDS-CBD). The objective was to evaluate the pharmacokinetic prole of SEDDS-CBD in a randomized, double-blind, cross-over design in 16 healthy volunteers under fasted conditions. As reference formulation, the same Hemp-Extract diluted with medium-chain triglycerides (MCT-CBD) was used. CBD dose was standardized to 25 mg. Pharmacokinetic parameters were analyzed from individual concentration-time curves. Single oral administration of SEDDS-CBD led to a 4.4-fold higher C maxand a 2.85-/1.70-fold higherAUC0-8h/AUC0-24h compared to the reference formulation. T maxwas substantially shorter forSEDDS-CBD (1.0 h) compared to MCT-CBD (3.0 h). Subgroup analysis demonstrated a higher bioavailability in women compared to men. This dierence was seen for MCT-CBD while SEDDS-CBD mitigated this gender eect. Overall, SEDDS-CBD showed a signicant improvement for all determined pharmacokinetic parameters: increased CBD plasma values (C max), favorablyenhanced bioavailability (AUC) and fast absorption (T max). No safety wide variety of phytocannabinoid compounds,including the constituent cannabidiol (CBD) [ 1]. In recent years, CBD has gained increasing interest dueto its various health benets including antiseizure, analgesic, neuroprotective, anxiolytic, antidepressant, and antipsychotic eects, well as displaying antioxidative and anti-inflammatory properties [ 2-7].CBD has a favorable safety and tolerability prole in humans [ 8,9]. Even high doses of oral CBD donot cause those eects that are characteristic for [10]. Cannabinoids typically consumed by smoking, vaporization, buccal spray or ingested orally in the form of soft gels, oil drops, or cookies [ 11,12]. The absorption of CBD administered by the mentionedapplication routes is limited, erratic and results in highly variable pharmacokinetic proles [13-19].

Call or visit our website today for FREE SAMPLES and monthly CBD updates from Dr. Meletis PRACTICE CENTRAL PBM and sports injuries When Petrone uses superlatives to describe the modality of photobiomodulation (PBM, or laser therapy) for the treatment of sports injuries, we all should pay attention. \"It works really well on soft tissue injuries,\" he says. \"We see a lot of those in the training department. Whether it is contusions, sprains, strains, or other soft tissue injuries, we have found that the sooner we get the laser on the area, the faster they get out of pain and the injury heals.\" Photobiomodulation is defined as \"A form of light therapy that utilizes non-ionizing forms of light sources...in the visible and infrared spectrum. It is a non-thermal process involving endogenous chromophores eliciting photophysical (i.e. linear and non-linear) and photochemical events at various biological scales. This process results in beneficial therapeutic outcomes including but not limited to the alleviation of pain or inflammation, immunomodulation, and promotion of wound healing and tissue regeneration.\" Class IV Laser Fundamentals Why are wavelengths so important? Wavelengths determine a therapeutic laser's depth of penetration in tissue that specifically target beneficial chromophores to simulate the photochemical reaction. Power & pulsing Class IV therapy lasers utilize a proprietary combination of peak power, frequency and pulse duration to maximize the wavelengths' dosage and penetration depths, ensuring the best healing environment possible. Why is it necessary to use different frequencies? Studies prove that pulse frequencies elicit different physiological responses, and that different tissue types (muscle, connective tissue, bone, etc.) respond better to pulse frequencies. Protocols use continuous wave and various pulse frequencies in combination with four therapeutic wavelengths to optimize clinical outcomes. \"Whether it is contusions, sprains, strains or other soft tissue injuries, we have found that the sooner we get the laser on the area, the faster they get out of pain and the injury heals.\" TheWeightLossPractice.com Learn The \"Turn-Key\" FUNCTIONAL Weight Loss System That Has Doctors SCALING Weight Loss In A Big Way! ...Even If You've Tried Other Programs!

PRACTICE CENTRAL PBM treatments are proven to improve collagen fiber reorganization in damaged calcaneal tendons, and should be applied as soon as possible after any injury. \"This is what tells me the laser is really working,\" Petrone says. \"When an athlete re-injures an area, and the first thing they do is ask for the laser, it tells me that they know it works, that they can trust it to help them heal again.\" For inflammation, injuries and pain The primary effects of PBM occur when chromophores absorb photons of red and infrared laser light. Class 4 therapeutic lasers are FDA-cleared prescription medical devices that can deliver laser light to the large volume of tissue required for treatment of sports injuries, especially in larger athletes. \"I am amazed at how well the laser works on plantar fasciitis,\" Petrone says. \"We will use the laser together with bracing, taping and strengthening to help with inflammation and pain.\" Proper treatment for plantar fasciitis would be a surface dosage of 4-8 joules per centimeter squared, for a total dose of 2,400-4,800 joules. \"College athletes have a finite playing career; they only have so many practices, so many chances to compete,\" Petrone concludes. \"I can list numerous cases where the laser has helped the injured athlete with reducing pain and inflammation, and actually helping the injured tissues heal. Laser treatments mean a lot to our athletes. They genuinely appreciate that we have the best laser in our training department.\" PHIL HARRINGTON, DC, CMLSO, FASLMS, is clinical manager, human medical director and laser safety officer at Summus Medical Laser.

THE TAKEAWAY Integrating instrument-assisted soft tissue mobilization can improve patient outcomes and increase the diversity (and volume) of patients along with revenue. Equipment costs and trainings are marginal, and procedures can be performed by staff. SOFT TISSUE MOBILIZATION AND MANIPULATION DATES TO SEVERAL THOUSANDS OF YEARS AGO with one of the first known techniques in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) known as Gua Sha, to \"scrape away illness.\" Even during such times, the intent was to improve stagnant blood flow (Gua is the scraping, spooning or coining, and Sha refers to the blood stasis). Although through the years, both TCM and its associated techniques have evolved, Gua Sha's intent remains as both a local treatment to a body region, and also a more global and multisystemic influence on health such as inflammation, heart rate variability and menopause.1-3 Modern once again Overall, modern soft tissue techniques can be associated with a lineage to James Cyriax's cross (deep) friction massage, itself based on Mennell's concept from even earlier in the 1900s.4 The premise was for the use of cross friction massage techniques to provide a controlled \"clinical injury\" to chronic tendon lesions that had stalled out in the healing process. The earlier theory suggested that cross friction techniques break down adhesions and re-stimulate the inflammatory response, allowing for tissue healing to occur. We now know PRACTICE CENTRAL 46 CHIROPRACTIC ECONOMICS JULY 31, 2020 CHIROECO.COMPRACTICE CENTRAL that although there is a relationship to the insult energy (pressure), a true \"reinjury\" is not required to progress through a newly-established tissue regeneration environment (remodeling and resorption).5 In fact, mechanically-applied stress may attenuate the negative inflammatory process (seepage of blood into compartments from damaged cells and tissues) to reduce the effects of injury.6,7 However, these too must be controlled. Although the terminology can be confusing or misleading, the release of \"pro-inflammatory\" mediators (e.g. IL-6 and IL-8) during this stage of the healing process is often misunderstood and considered to be the same as the edema formation that occurs from damage to vessels. These \"pro-inflammatory\" mediators are a controlled increase in microcirculation to promote next stages in healing. Techniques, reported benefits and indications There are various implements and techniques used in IASTM, including polymers, metals and alloys, natural materials and mechanically generated forces. Some of today's techniques have extended beyond simply rubbing or scraping an area of concern to include diagnostics, stroking patterns and pres - sures, and assisted motion of the involved articulation. Other techniques generating force into the tissue are mechanically generated, and as an alternative to using friction and pressure from an implement, the use of electromechanical, piezoelectric, and pneumatics are used to produce acoustic waves to deliver a pressure (radial pressure or pulsed wave, Fig. 1, next page) or focused shockwave (Fig. 2). Although the manual techniques provide most influence to superficial structures, the depth is controlled by pressure force, tissue pull, and potential active or assisted motion of the area being treated. Pressure wave generation has a diverging energy that penetrates up to six centimeters, whereas focused shockwave, also referred to as extracorporeal shockwave therapy (ESWT), has a convergence of energy and can have a therapeutic influence as much as 12.5 cm. Influencing normal tissue and function again Much of the literature has focused on outcome measures such as range of motion, strength and pain.8-11 This is through influencing soft and connective tissue such as ligaments, tendons, muscles and fascia, and occasionally articulations. Proposed mechanisms include increasing metabolism, microcirculation, fibroblastic activity and growth factor release, and even apoptosis and other resorption.6,7,12 Overall, the goal is to influence dysfunctional tissue and regions of the body to reestablish, or as close to rees - tablishing as possible, normal tissue and function.

There seems to be an evolving list \u2014 however, generally superficial IASTM is indicated for superficial muscle pain, tendinopathies, ligamentous conditions, acute joint injury, myofascial dysfunction, decreased range of motion, back and neck pain, small joint instability, shoulder impingement and myofascial trigger points. Mechanically-generated pressure, having more control over impact delivery and depth, has previously been mentioned, and has further indications to much deeper tissues, as well as to more acute conditions in men and women. These are not only common conditions treated in the chiropractic clinic, but are also consistent with commonly- occurring conditions that consume a great deal of health care dollars when managed with more invasive and expensive procedures, including pharmaceuticals and surgical interventions.Implementing into practice Integrating instrument-assisted soft tissue mobilization likely has several advantages to a clinic, from patient outcomes to career longevity. The use of implements, compared to hands only, can deliver greater lever force, surface-area contact and depth of penetration while reducing digital and hand effort, potentially reducing work-related injuries for the clinician. It is also an opportunity to possibly increase the diversity (and volume) of patients, adding billable codes and possibly even cash-based revenue, while enhancing patient outcomes with high satisfaction rates consistent with chiropractic clinics. For manual devices, the implements are a marginal cost, and even for those with more technique-oriented approaches, the investment will likely cover your state license continuing-education requirement. Many payors will cover additional soft tissue mobilization codes, versus adding more techniques associated with articulation manipulation falling under the 98xxx procedures. Electronic- (pressure and focused shockwave) based devices may expand your treatment offerings, e.g. men's and women's health, as well as provide high outcome-based cash revenue streams in the former, and for musculoskeletal conditions, as they are not typically covered under third-party payors. These are also less technique-oriented and can be performed by similar staff. The future of less-invasive treatment There is a continuous shift in providing less invasive and lower-cost treatment options for not only specific neuromus - culoskeletal issues such as low-back and chronic pain, but also the comorbidities that result from not moving \u2014 both of which consume some of the highest health care costs of any society. There may also be an advantage to combining soft tissue mobilization with biologics, as some studies have shown increased efficacy in combining therapies.13-15 CHRISTOPHER PROULX , DC, PhD(abd), ATC, CSCS, is the founder of Effective Motion Strategies and a clinical education manager at DJO LLC in the Chattanooga division.

As a chiropractic doctor and frequent public speaker, I've rounded up my tips for delivering an impactful webinar, plus insights as to how these tips will benefit your chiropractic practice right away. Extending your reach Delivering webinars allows chiropractors and functional medicine practitioners to extend their reach beyond the doors of their office and the local community of patients. Webinars allow you to present on a variety of topics within your area of expertise and reach an online audience located anywhere in the world. While many webinars in the chiropractic field are generally slide presentations, you can foster better audience engagement using a video platform like Zoom. With a dynamic video presentation, you hold greater power to inspire and educate your audience. Diversifying your revenue stream Another benefit of delivering impactful webinars is creating a diversified revenue stream. As a chiropractor or functional medicine practitioner, you may have already experienced a time or times of decreased revenue \u2014 such as a lull in in-office visits during COVID- 19. Webinars present an opportunity to make up for that decrease by adding a new revenue stream to your business model. Being authentic People attending your webinar will relate best to a presenter who demonstrates authenticity. Deliver your webinar from your actual work-from-home space, roll with interruption and smile through technical issues. Showing your humanity and being your authentic self builds trust with your HOW TO DELIVER AN IMPACTFUL WEBINAR IN CHIROPRACTIC MEDICINE Tips and benefits for extending your reach and growing your audience BY ROBERT G. SILVERMAN, DC, DACBN, THE TAKEAWAY Whether live or taped, webinars give doctors of chiropractic the opportunity to increase the expanse of their messaging and collect patient data to build an audience and reach new patients. 52 CHIROPRACTIC ECONOMICS JULY 31, 2020 CHIROECO.COMTECH TALK attendees \u2014 and helps you engage an audience that was otherwise focused elsewhere. Choosing a webinar type that works for everyone You can also extend your reach by diver - sifying the type of webinars you give. Live webinars are an excellent opportu - nity to connect with your audience by allowing attendees to interact with you virtually. On-demand, or pre-recorded, webinars have their own set of benefits. As an attendee, you can watch the presentation when it's convenient for you. As a practitioner, creating content for on-demand webinars not only saves you time in the long run, but helps you iterate your message with every new download. Regardless of which type of webinar you choose, both present an opportunity to collect patient data for future outreach. Whether an attendee signs up for your live webinar or selects to access your on-demand content, he or she does so with an email address. That contact information helps you build your online audience and reach potential new patients. Delivering your message with energy Webinars are a great opportunity to improve your public speaking skills, without the pressure of an in-person audience: \u0084Practice what you're going to say ahead of time to avoid delivering your content in a mechanical way. \u0084If you plan to read from a script during your webinar, finish each sentence by looking at your audience (or camera) to make your presentation feel natural. \u0084Body language goes a long way in a virtual presentation. Smile at the audience, even when you can't see them. \u0084Speak in an upbeat tone \u2014 gesture in the direction of your audience. Doing these things will help deliver your message with a strong presence. Not only will you engage your audience, but they will leave your webinar feeling energized instead of Zoom fatigued. Making your webinars interactive Engaging with your audience will go a long way in making them feel heard and connected. During your webinars, interact with your audience by incor - porating polls in your presentation. Encourage participants to use the live chat to ask questions, and be sure to leave time to answer questions or respond to comments during your webinar, as well. Another way to make your webinars interactive, especially if you're creating on-demand content instead of a live presentation, is to feature a guest on your webinar.

Try to do this within a day or two of your webinar. Ideally, you should follow up with a recording of the webinar for your audience to rewatch \u2014 and hopefully share! \u2014 but at the very least, include the presentation slides. Providing both options increases the chance of your audience revisiting, remembering and referencing the content, as well as returning to garner more of your expertise in the future. Admittedly, there are some downsides to delivering webinars, such as the inability to conduct a hands-on demonstration. However, the benefits mentioned above outweigh the negatives and will help complement the services you offer in your practice. By delivering webinars, you're able to extend your reach to an audience you otherwise wouldn't have access to. Whether you provide your webinars live or on-demand, this telehealth approach will not only diversify your revenue stream; it will also help amplify \u2014 and solidify \u2014 your thought leadership in the field.

You'll know when you're overwhelmed with issues and revenue losses BY ED SHARP TIME TO READ: 5-6 MIN.PRACTICE CENTRAL THE TAKEAWAY The cost of a consultant can be, or should be, easily offset by increasing the income of a practice. What areas does your practice struggle in, or which areas create extra work with no apparent answers? WHEN IS THE PROPER OR BEST TIME TO HIRE A CONSULTANT? The answer to that question varies depending on the one asking the question and the situation at hand. When operating one's practice one can run into many difficult areas and may need help grabbing and getting them under control. When the owner is busy delivering, hiring, training staff, doing the marketing, doing the sales, etc., he or she will find it difficult to look at their practice objectively and locate the areas that need to be straightened out first. Looking with an objective eye There can be issues with marketing, staff, production flow lines, efficiency, financial planning, time management, and general management skills, such as how to close patients for care and getting staff more productive. It can vary all the way down to how to answer the phone properly. One basic factor that I have taught for years is that if an area is not being controlled properly, then it is not under one's control and therefore is losing money in that area and creating extra work. A consultant should pay for themselves in increased revenues. There are many different types of consultants \u2014 from software to marketing to effective staff hiring, etc. Some consultants advise in areas like implementing new services to deliver in your clinic. A lot of service suppliers give advice on how to implement and sell their products to your patients. Most have training or courses one can attend. 56 CHIROPRACTIC ECONOMICS JULY 31, 2020 CHIROECO.COMNew Greens First PRO CBD Topicals!

Today's marketing has gotten very diverse and complicated in most cases. It used to be one could call the newspaper or yellow pages and get an ad placed. With the advent and continuing complications and competitions concerning social media marketing, a consultant is strongly suggested. There are areas such as one's website and search optimization, what Facebook will allow you to say in ads, which form of marketing is most effective for your practice, etc. There is also radio and television or cable ads. Newspaper ads are not yet totally ineffective, either. Some advertising companies have expertise in one sector of the industry, say social media marketing, and others in different areas. This could require one to hire possibly several companies to consult on multiple areas of advertising. There are also companies that can do it all \u2014 fully direct all of one's marketing and advertising campaigns and needs. If this is the case, unless one is very savvy in social media marketing themselves, it could be advised to hire someone competent in these various areas and make them one's full-time, in-house marketing assistant. All-around consultants One of the more major needs for a consultant is in what I will call a \"general all-round\" consultant \u2014 ones who teach how to run a clinic more successfully. In school one probably did not get the knowledge of how to successfully direct and run a thriving practice. That knowledge is offered by this type of consultant. There have been many good ones over the years and some are still around. They have everything from scripts, video training for staff, and seminars to attend, to one-on-one phone consulting. One has to really assess one's needs here. Does your practice need a total practice management overhaul or just some tweaking? When choosing this type of consultant, first see how one communicates with the individuals that will be consulting with them. Can one get their answers quickly and easily? The individual and independent type of consultant is generally less expensive than a full-service consulting company; however, they may not have all the bells and whistles one needs. Regenerative medicine consulting Another upcoming area that could benefit from consulting help is regenerative medicine. There are several good companies I could recommend currently, but here, too, is what type of delivery does one want to do? What type of services does one want to deliver in the clinic in this field of medicine? How does one shift from an insurance-based chiropractic practice to a cash practice? How much time and money is one willing to invest into the changeover to working with a nurse practitioner or MD? These are very important questions to ask oneself making a selection. Most consultant companies will allow a potential client to come to a seminar to check them out. Take advantage of this if possible. Finding the best fit Interview potential consultants, check out their programs and costs, and check out what others using their services have to say about them. Cost should be a minor consideration in choosing the right consultant because the selection of the right consultant should increase one's income to easily compensate for the costs, such as travel, staff pay for training, program costs, etc. One should also consider if they are willing to do the steps and actions suggested by the consultant. Whether one hires a consultant or goes the route of learning by themselves, there is always some type of help out there to assist a practitioner to be more successful, and to help one be able to help more patients with excellent care. Remember, too: One of the main factors is one should be enjoying doing their job. A consultant's whole purpose should be to assist one to do just that.

Prior to being admitted to this type of program, you must have also completed at least 90 credit hours in an undergraduate course. Some chiropractic schools require students to have a bache - lor's degree. Coming in prepared Cleveland University shares that bachelor's-level programs beneficial to future DCs include those that focus on human biology, kinesiology and exercise science. One additional four- year option to consider is a bachelor's degree in health science. In broad terms, health science refers to the study of health and wellness. Secondarily, it includes applying information learned from this research to enhance quality of life for both humans and animals. Though every health science program is slightly different, many include courses designed to educate students in areas such as: the history of health care anatomy and physiology biology chemistry physics medical terminology medical math CPR As a health science major, you will find that many schools require you to complete both in-classroom and laboratory work. This comprehensive program offers pre-chiropractic students a couple of distinct benefits. Advanced knowledge of health The first part of health science involves studying what health truly means. This requires breaking the body, its systems, tissues and organs down to the cellular level to learn what each one does. It includes gaining a better understanding of how various parts of the body interact with each other to either advance or regress health. The study of health exists on a macro level as well. Students are taught not only about what makes an individual healthy or sick, but also how an entire demographic or even society can lean one way or the other. You begin to understand how illness and disease progresses through the human body and how it can transfer from one person to the next. This is important in cases of communicable disease, contagious viruses, and even societal STUDENT DC STUDENTS AND CHIROPRACTIC SCHOOL PREPARATION The benefits of a health science degree coming into a DC education BY CHRISTINA DEBUSK TIME TO READ: 6-8 MIN. THE TAKEAWAY Health science involves studying what health truly means, and can give chiropractic students a leg up before entering a chiropractic college or university. 60 CHIROPRACTIC ECONOMICS JULY 31, 2020 CHIROECO.COM\u00a9Fenix Nutrition 2018STUDENT DC factors that can impact health, such as exposure to workplace toxins and pollutants in the air. Education with application The second part of health science is all about application. It's about taking what you've learned about health and wellness and applying it in real-world situations. This is when you are able to use the data presented to improve patient health. In a health science program, this application is typically practiced in a laboratory setting. This application becomes helpful once you begin chiropractic college and, subsequently, enter into practice. You begin to create a process whereby education leads to application which ultimately leads to healing.Finding the right health science program for you Before enrolling in a health science program, it can be bene - ficial to decide where you will be earning your doctor of chiropractic degree. Each school has different enrollment requirements. Identifying these beforehand ensures that you will select a health science program that meets those needs. It may also be advantageous to reach out to the chiropractic college to learn whether it has any partnerships with schools that offer a health science program. This can make it easier to transfer credits from one to the other because they already have an existing relationship. When choosing a health science program, also consider other factors such as: Application deadline and class start date. This will dictate whether you are able to apply to the program now or if you Is the course a four-year program or does it offer the option to complete it at a faster pace? Some bachelor's degrees can be accelerated for students who are willing to go to school year-round or take heavier course loads.

Some bachelor's degrees can be accelerated for students who are willing to go to school year-round or take heavier course loads. Program cost. A survey conducted by U.S. News & World Report found that the average 2019-20 tuition at an in-state public school is $10,116. Go to a private college and this jumps to $36,801 for the year. What does the school that you want to attend charge for tuition? How does this fit into your budget? Student 'perks.' Research the health science schools you're interested in to learn what other types of programs they offer that may assist you as you work toward a career in chiropractic. Maybe it provides access to tutors if you're struggling in a certain class, or it has groups and organizations you'd be interested in joining. Sometimes these perks make it easier to separate one school from the next. Earning your health science degree before attending chiropractic college can provide a solid foundation for advanced studies in this area. Choosing the right program for you is part of this process.

This issue: IN-HOUSE VS. OUTSOURCING MARKETING COUNTERPOINT 'You don't need to study sign painting if you want your name on your building' There is no reason computer-savvy doctors can't maximize their own web presence. And there are definite advantages to it: It is cost-effective (if you subtract the opportunity cost of the time spent to do it). Getting your hands dirty helps you to understand this part of your business. When you know what you like and know how to tell your story, you will be better positioned to explain what you want to consultants. That said, consider whether developing your own web presence is the best use of your time. If you are already a web wizard, it may be a great idea. If you are just wading in to save some money, think twice. You have a practice to run and grow, so separate the things only you can do from those that can be done by others. You don't need to study sign painting if you want your name on your building. With your practice growth in the balance, this may not be the best time to learn on the job. There are service providers who will help you increase your business, and there are \"those other guys\" who may charge a lot and deliver little. Fortunately, just as there are review and rating sites for doctors, there are also review sites for web consultants. Doctors who hand over their web duties to others should put away their rose-colored glasses \u2014 it never hurts to start small and build slowly from there. Ultimately, success in marketing hinges on your ability to tailor your message and type of communication to that of your target demographic. Talk to your ideal patients in the way and in the places they most strongly prefer. \u2014 Rick LehtinenPOINT In-house marketing, even if you don't like to be on camera Even if you don't like to be on camera, I built a six-figure income from an online store using a simple PowerPoint presentation with a Walmart microphone and a free online app called Screencastify to record my voice and screen. I then uploaded that onto YouTube. I have developed more than 100 online courses that way and have never appeared on camera (even though I am quite dashing to gaze upon). Next you want to start driving traffic to your educational videos using email lists and Facebook. Use email to send a \"personal invite from the doctor,\" and your Facebook account to drive traffic with a zero ad spend. Start with a few different posts to see which works better in your area and for your audience. Start with one screenshot of your video (start playing your video and pause it at an appropriate time, use a free snipping tool, save the screenshot and upload as a Facebook post). Use some fanciful wordsmithing to create curiosity and direct viewers to click on the image and have it take them to your YouTube educational video. You can also market the video by finding Facebook groups and in their discussion section, if appropriate, offer to post your educational video for free or provide a link. You can also create a simple e-book for them to download and in the e-book mention your YouTube videos. Use YouTube and Facebook in tandem to combine social media platforms and engage your email contacts, expose them to your brand, and get them into your office. YouTube and Facebook really can work well together. \u2014 Bryan Hawley, DC 64 CHIROPRACTIC ECONOMICS JULY 31, 2020 CHIROECO.COMThat's the rate of annual growth Cash Practice\u00ae doctors experience on average during the first three years of implementing our systems.
