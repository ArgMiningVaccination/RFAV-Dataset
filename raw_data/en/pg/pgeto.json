On a sound epistemological basis and in the context of current debates, it analyses basic concepts of physics, chemistry, genetics morphogenesis, biology, neurobiology, psychology, and philosophy of mind, with an emphasis on the problems of life, mind-body interactions, and free will. The result is a non-reductionistic anthropology acknowledging the emergent properties of body, life, soul, and spirit as equally real entities. This concurs with the basic concepts of anthroposophy and anthroposophical medicine, the justification of which is discussed in relation to the history and methodology of science as well as evidence based medicine.

It will become a valuable resource for all those clinicians, researchers, educators and students who, having been confronted with the paradox of the circulation, are looking for a broader interpretation. This extensively revised second edition traces the development of the basic concepts in cardiovascular physiology in light of the accumulated experimental and clinical evidence. It considers the early embryonic circulation, where blood circulation suggests the existence of a motive force, tightly coupled to the metabolic demands of the tissues. It proposes that rather than being an organ of propulsion, the heart serves as an organ of control, generating pressure by rhythmically impeding blood flow. New and expanded chapters cover the arterial pulse, circulation in the upright posture, microcirculation and functional heart morphology.

Understanding Deeper Developmental Needs - Holistic Approaches for Challenging Behaviors in Children by Adam Blanning MD Lindisfarne Books, October 2017 How do we best help a child who is struggling? By learning to look carefully. Enlivening our observation skills allows us to see consistent behavioral patterns and dynamics that show up in children's movement, learning, sensing, and memory. Within those activities we can learn to see archetypal pathways of development. Watching the way a child moves, listens, eats, or sleeps others use insights into a child's experience of the world. Those gestures help tell the child's story. We learn to think in living processes, not checklists. Constitutional, or fundamental, polarities\u2014as introduced by Rudolf Steiner\u2014allow for individualized, therapeutic approaches to challenges such as aggressive behaviors, attention problems, anxiety, autistic behaviors, and depression. Teachers, counselors, and medical doctors will find tools here that can enriching their work with children. These constitutional pictures are accompanied by diverse therapeutic indications that will encourage children to unfold new growth and maturation, from the inside out.

In this book, a serious attempt has been made to offer a broad, up-to-date look at the topic from a specifically anthroposophic viewpoint. It is a relatively voluminous work (approx. 450 pages) directed primarily at the anthroposophically-practicing health care practitioner, but also accessible to parents, educators and other lay \"stake holders. Overall, the primary intent of the book was to give a much-needed basis for understanding Rudolf Steiner's research and how that might shape our understanding of these complex issues in our contemporary life. A novel aspect covered in the book is the relationship between the immunization intervention and the possibility of overcoming its damages through a Waldorf type education.

Nurses form a bridge between treatment of the body and treatment of the patient's soul and spirit by actively valuing the human body, paying attention to touch, using warmth, cold, air, and light to promote healing processes, and much more. Although physical wellbeing, autonomy, and youthfulness are central to our modern materialistic culture, our bodies actually receive little respect and appreciation, especially when they become ill and eventually old. Nursing values need to be rediscovered that respect the debased human being, embrace illness as a part of existence, and allow time for healing. A key aspect of this book involves the idea and practice of \"nursing gestures,\" relating inner attitudes and practical nursing activities to one another in detail through numerous examples and overviews.

The authors of this book introduce one specific therapy and make a case for integrative health in general, including anthroposophically extended medicine, naturopathy, and other holistic approaches. Mistletoe therapy has long been considered a viable treatment for cancer by the European medical community and is beginning to gain recognition in North America, as well. The mistletoe plant possesses many remarkable properties. As a therapy, it represents a rediscovery of ancient wisdom and shows us how the science of modern medicine might expand its reach and reconnect with a more human-centered medicine. The book was structured following the syllabus for a three-day practitioner training hosted by the Physicians' Association for Anthroposophic Medicine (PAAM). The chapters highlight several of our key lectures in a condensed form. The book serves as an introductory summary of\u2014not a replacement for\u2014those intensive professional trainings. While this book should not be regarded as a treatment or diagnostic manual, it is intended to both prepare practitioners to begin mistletoe therapy training and to make this information available, in an accessible form, to anyone interested in learning about this approach to treating cancer.
