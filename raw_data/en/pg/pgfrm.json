I'm no expert on the subject, but I have felt more supported, more grounded and more peaceful since creating a deeper relationship with these special stones. They help my home feel more energetically and physically protected while providing a renewed sense of harmony and balance. Read on to learn more about a few of my favorites and where to place them in your home. Entryway: Black Obsidian Black Obsidian is a great crystal for absorbing negative energy. It's also known as the warrior stone, as our Paleo-Indian ancestors used it to protect them against invaders and the dangers of hunting. Obsidian also consists of grounding and stabilizing properties, which can help with scattered energy. work space: citrine I use citrine in my home office as a way to bring me fresh ideas and creativity. Citrine helps with clarity in addition to abundance, wealth and success. Another thing that I love about this stone is that it supports the flow of positive vibrations in the physical body as well as the home. bedroom: Rose Quartz For those who live with a partner, like me, I like to use Rose Quartz in my bedroom. Rose Quartz is the love crystal known for boosting romance, sensuality and relationships. I've found working with rose quartz in pairs amplifies partnership of any kind. This can be romantic partnerships, a new project you are creating, business endeavors. All relations can be strengthened through opening our hearts and trusting love. Placing pairs together on your dresser or nightstand is a beautiful reminder upon waking. living room: amethyst Amethyst is an amazing crystal to use in all areas of your home. Amethyst cleanses your space of negative energy and also helps clear your thoughts. I like to put it in my living room for it's relaxing properties, as that's where most guests gather to chill, connect and speak freely. Selenite is another good one to place in front of windows if you have a neighbor causing you disharmony. Selenite is the ultimate purifier and can cleanse and charge all other crystals and healing tools. "}
