Love, Love, Love these guys! I wouldn't take my pets anywhere else!Bonnie G. Amazing staff that is so compassionate. You guys saved my Tootsie Roll!!Lindsay S. We were very pleased with our most recent visit to Ina Road Animal Hospital. Dr Reed is very knowledgeable and answers questions thoroughly. The vet techs I spoke with about our dog's blood work were very kind and helpful. We have also seen Dr Devy in the past and really liked her as well. They are a very busy clinic so we were really grateful they took the extra time to explain things to us so well.Angela R. Amazed every time with this place... I came in with emergency and couldn't believe the love and care they had for my dog.. after my one visit I decided to move all my animals to Ina Road as their permanent vet. My cat had some unexpected dental done and once again exceeded my expectations.. prices NEVER disappoint either... I've been to multiple vets in Tucson and I cannot recommend Ina Road enough!Courtney J. I've tried a few others' vets in the past couple of years, and no-one has a staff as competent and compassionate at IRAH. Highly recommend!Ember D. One of the best animal hospitals in town. Wonderful customer service. I have been taking my beloved pets there for years and will continue to do so. Everyone who works there provides the best service you can ask for when it comes to your and your pets needs. Thank you!!!Maria G. They have been extremely awesome with our little guy and his issue right now. I am so grateful for their help, the Dr's took their time speaking with me, answering my questions which I appreciate, I don't feel rushed or like just a number. Thank you to the front desk, techs and Drs!Michele Great staff and friendly techs and doctors. We had an emergency and had to put our dog down and they made it a bearable experience. We now use them for our new puppy and kitties. Great, knowledgeable, patient people. My puppy loves everyone there.Vanessa H. "}
