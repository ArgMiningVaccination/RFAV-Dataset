When I first saw Richard I was suffering great pain from arthritis in both my knee and back, and a pinched nerve in my lower back. I was unable to perform simple tasks. Almost from the beginning of treatment my pain began to fade and my mobility improved. Thanks to Richard I have been able to meet my goals, I am 77 years old, I enjoy socializing with friends, living independently and performing necessary household chores on my own.Arthritis, Knee and Back Pain Acupuncture with Dr. Richard Stillo has made such a positive difference in my life. I have suffered with back pain most of my adulthood due to inoperable scoliosis. In August, 2016, the pain was so severe that I was having trouble walking and going to work. After two different opinions from two orthopedic doctors, MRI's, physical therapy, all kinds of pain medication and a lot of money spent, I thought there was no hope for me and since I was getting older (early 50's), this was just something that I had to endure for the rest of my life. My sister begged me to go for acupuncture. Since nothing else worked, I decided to give it a try. After three visits with Dr. Stillo, I was back on my feet, back to work and pain free. It was like a miracle happened. Dr. Stillo has just recently treated me for shoulder pain that I was having for months. Again, after a few visits, I am now pain free. I highly recommend acupuncture with Dr. Stillo in their clean, comfortable and friendly office environme For me, it is the best way to get long-lasting results.Back Pain & Shoulder Pain My name is Jim I am 54 years old, I was in excruciating pain in my legs and had a very difficult time walking and sitting due to bulging and herniated discs in my back.
