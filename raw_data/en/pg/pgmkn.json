Instead, the producers of these products registered the product's name, symbol, or bottle shape, making their product a proprietary medicine. In practice, few consumers made the distinction between patent and proprietary medicines, and instead referred to all of them as \"patent medicines\" (Cramp [1912](/article/10.1007/s41636-022-00371-2#ref-CR16):9). This article employs the language of the period and refers to both types of medicine as \"patent medicines.\" The artifacts from Five Points were analyzed and temporarily stored in Building 6 of the World Trade Center complex. All but a handful that were on loan were destroyed in the attacks on 11 September 2001. This project is thus based heavily upon the site report (Yamin [2000](/article/10.1007/s41636-022-00371-2#ref-CR123)) as well as photographs of the objects and other publications, such as Brighton ( [2008](/article/10.1007/s41636-022-00371-2#ref-CR15)). The popular Irish perspective about the importance of hearty food in healing seems to have influenced professional medicine in Ireland and subsequently in the U.S. The renowned Irish physician Robert Graves (1796-1853), for example, became famous, in part, because he saved many fever patients in Dublin by going against the widely accepted official medical prescription of bleeding and withholding food to \"starve a fever\" (Logan [1981](/article/10.1007/s41636-022-00371-2#ref-CR55):9). Graves's gentler treatment was controversial in professional medical circles and yet so successful that legend has it Graves jokingly said he wished to have \"he fed fevers\" inscribed on his tombstone (O'Brien [1983](/article/10.1007/s41636-022-00371-2#ref-CR86):145). Thanks to Severin Fowles for this suggestion to consider how some consumers might have purchased patent medicines as acts of care for another, whether or not they were confident in the efficacy of the products. The desire to do something, anything for a suffering loved one might have been a primary motivator. References Adams, Samuel Hopkins 1912 Great American Fraud.
