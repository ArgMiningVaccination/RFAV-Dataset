Vitamin C is a powerful anti-oxidant. The anti-oxidant capabilities aid in optimal cellular functioning, energy production and help combat the oxidative stress incurred from daily living. It is believed that Cancer cells react uniquely to intravenous Vitamin C by taking up 5x more Vitamin C than our regular tissue. Inside the cell cancer cell Vitamin C converts to hydrogen peroxide, and as cancer cells don't have the normal intracellular organelles to handle hydrogen peroxide they are destroyed. Healthy cells do not respond this way to vitamin C. Thus, the intravenous administration of high doses of vitamin C can target and destroy cancer cells in the body while not harming healthy cells. We require any patients wanting to use high dose vitamin C for cancer therapy have the approval of an oncologist or specialist in integrative cancer therapies. IV vitamin C above 25,000mg require a G6PD lab result prior to administration. Copyright \u00a9 2018 Optimal Health - All Rights Reserved. -Feel Your Best- "}
