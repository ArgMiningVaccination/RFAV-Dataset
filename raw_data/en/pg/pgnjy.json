Objectives: - To be able to situate specific integrative medical knowledge and practices within the larger framework of integrative medicine and the variety of approaches to its practice. - To gain practice with the functions and functionality of the learning management system that will be used for each module. Integrative Cardiometabolic Health The module's reading material will cover relevant topics pertinent to cardiovascular and metabolic health. Articles included will cover the bigger picture of cardiovascular disease than the conventional LDL cholesterol-lowering approach. Endothelial dysfunction will be covered in great depth and the current available tests will be eluded to so that as a practitioner, one can not only understand the concept of endothelial dysfunction, but also how to diagnose and manage the condition. The metabolic syndrome and insulin resistance will be discussed in detail and the available medicines and nutraceuticals for the management of metabolic syndrome will be reviewed. Hypertension protocols using natural medicines will be discussed as will hypercholesterolemia. Expanded lipid profiles and particle size and number will be reviewed. Cardiovascular risk profiles will be looked at and nutraceutical management thereof will be discussed in depth. Frequently patients are these days using drugs and nutraceuticals and the correct combinations will be discussed, for example it is very important to remember that statins deplete the body of coenzyme q10 and that supplementation is essential if taking a statin. Not only is coq10 depleted by statins, but also vitamin e, d, omega 3 and this will be looked at in this module. A protocol for the treatment of statin induced rhabdomyolisis will be included as well. Nutrition and the nutraceutical management of hypertension will be reviewed. Coenzyme q10 physiology and indications for use in cardiovascular medicine will be reviewed. As far as metabolic issues are concerned, iron overload and the impact on heart disease will be discussed, as will the apo e gene, and vitamin d3 and k2 and NADH, nutrition, fiber and lifestyle. Objectives: - To understand, review and apply in clinical practice cardiovascular risk factors, lab testing and nutraceutical supplementation in addition to lifestyle change, nutrition and exercise - Protocols will be provided for the management of vascular disease, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, endothelial dysfunction and insulin resistance - To understand the role that coenzyme q10 plays both in supplementation and treatment of cardiovascular diseases - To understand how to put into practice a comprehensive program to combat cardiometabolic disease. - To understand the metabolic and genetic factors that compound the risk for heart disease and diabetes - To fully grasp the nutraceutical equivalent of drug treatments for diabetes, insulin resistance and the metabolic syndrome. Functional Neurology and Neurotransmitters This module teaches functional neurology from a symptom basis as well as systems basis. The most common neurologic complaints in clinician's offices today include chronic pain, fibromyalgia, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), incontinence, dementia/memory difficulty, insomnia and mood disorders. By utilizing peer reviewed literature that summarizes the neuroanatomy and neurophysiology of these common disorders, learners will gain a thorough knowledge of the complexities of these clinical presentations. The peer reviewed literature will discuss many of the traditional medical therapies that are utilized for these disorders. Discussions on the integrative nature of neurology and its intersection with gastrointestinal, endocrine, immune and urinary systems are included in the literature. This sets the stage for the broadening of functional neurology to include immunology and endocrinology and integrates systems that continuously work together and cannot truly be separated in clinical practice. A new approach will address optimal management of neurological disorders based on objective test outcomes. This offers learners new opportunities to optimize nervous system health. This integrative and innovative approach includes diet and nutrition, nutritional supplements, lifestyle changes, amino acid therapy for neurotransmitter support, stress hormone balancing and immune system support. Case studies demonstrate the integration and application of neuroendoimmunology and they summarize this new model of functional neurology. Learners will easily integrate clinical applications from these case studies upon completion of this module. Objectives: - To learn, understand and apply the basic anatomy and neurophysiology of central and peripheral nervous systems in regards to pain, fibromyalgia, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), incontinence, dementia, insomnia and mood disorders. - To understand the risk factors for, and frequent comorbidities of, common neurological complaints and clinical presentations including chronic pain, fibromyalgia, irritable bowel syndrome(IBS), incontinence, dementia, insomnia and mood disorders. - To recognize and apply the integration of the physical, cognitive and emotional aspects of clinical neurology. - To learn, understand and apply objective testing protocols and subsequent clinical applications that integrate neurology, endocrinology and immunology into clinical practice. This is the practice of neuroendoimmunology. - To review traditional neurologic treatments for the most common neurologic complaints noted above. Learn and apply new and emerging treatments for these same complaints, optimizing patients' individual nervous system function. These new treatments will include diet and nutrition, nutritional supplements, lifestyle changes, amino acid therapy for neurotransmitter support, stress hormone balancing and immune system support. Infectious Disease: A World of Diseases This module will cover a natural medicine approach to infectious diseases, both in terms of treatments and prevention, prebiotics, probiotics and the implications on gut health and overall health, supplementation and natural strategies against, and management of HIV, Natural medicine approach to viral infections, and a natural medicine approach to parasitic infections. Objectives: - To understand how low grade infections such as CMV, EBV, Chlamydia, yersinia, ricketsia, HSV, hepatitis, lyme, helicobacter, TB, trichomonas, fungi, worms need to be treated but careful consideration should be made to immunotoxins that can be avoided: for example sugar, aspartame, alcohol, smoking, cooked fats, food allergies such as wheat/gluten, dairy products, potatoes, etc. - To understand and apply the proper use of pharmaceuticals to treat acute and chronic infections. - To understand the role of infections in chronic degenerative diseases. - To understand and analyze Lyme disease: symptomatology, diagnosis and treatment, and yeast overgrowth. - To understand monovalent vaccines, timing of vaccination, making informed decisions about declining or delaying vaccinations and a suggested protocol to entertain for vaccinations. - To apply practices for the prevention of tuberculosis and malaria. - To understand and apply complementary and nutritional treatments for infectious diseases.

Case Studies in Integrative Medicine This module will cover a wide variety of medical conditions and explore through applied case studies how to implement the integrative medicine model into practice. The module offers 20 cases which address a broad range of integrative diagnostics and therapeutics. *There are no module pre-requisites required to complete this module which begins to address each topic covered in the entire program. Objectives: - To understand the integrative approach to practicing evidence-based medicine to address a broad range of health and disease issues. - To apply integrative diagnostics and therapeutics to applied case studies. Integrative Clinical Imunology A sound knowledge of the immune system is of paramount importance to the Integrative Medicine practitioner due to the following factors that need to be both understood and implemented into practice: - The incidence of autoimmune diseases is on the rise - Gluten sensitivity (not only celiac disease states) increases the risk for \"leaky gut syndrome\" and autoimmune disease states - Predominantly Th2 immune system responses are common with aging people and this leads to an increased incidence of allergies, autoimmune disease states as well as cancers - Immune deficiency states, such as inherited immune deficiency states, and acquired like HIV infection, need an integrated approach to manage best - Gut flora is of great importance to maintaining immune system and overall health - Only in Integrative Medicine can Gut health be addressed appropriately to restore overall immune quality and health - Most disease states begin in the gut and it is not surprising that the gut hosts the major part of our immune systems - It is important to understand the differences in th1 and Th2 immune system responses and the cytokines responsible for each of them - Certain \"immune interventions\" can be put in place with integrative medicine modalities to restore immune system health - Understanding an Integrative approach to autoimmune diseases, asthma, allergies and aging per se will be learned in this module - Inflammatory changes in the body begins in the gut and an approach to inflammation and an approach to immune surveillance is important. Objectives: - To understand the anatomy and physiological make up of the immune system - To have an understanding of the immune system on a Th1 and Th2 level - To understand the significance of lymphatic drainage to maintain optimum health - To have an understanding of the integrative approach to autoimmune disease states - To understand how detoxification is vital to maintain an optimum immune system - To understand the environmental toxicity relevance to autoimmunity and immune toxicity - To understand how dietary interventions can improve immune system functioning for example anti-inflammatory diets for autoimmunity and gluten free diets for autism spectrum disorder and celiac disease - To understand some of the major cytokines involved in the immune system - To understand vitamin d's role in the prevention of cancers such as breast cancer, prostate cancer, lymphoma and colon cancer - To understand the role of iodine in autoimmune thyroid disease states - To realize the importance of low dose naltrexone in the management of autoimmunity Nutraceuticals and Supplementation It has become increasingly aware that most of us are not deriving our optimal intake of nutrients from diet alone. In this module, the reasons for this will be discussed, as well as the differences in recommended daily allowances and optimal daily allowances for vitamins and minerals. Various protocols using nutraceuticals and natural medicines (including scientifically verifiable doses) for different medical conditions will be covered in depth. The definition and types of nutraceuticals will be covered in great detail along with the definition and a short explanation of functional foods. The module presents articles discussing natural medicines. Case studies involving nutrition, lifestyle and nutraceuticals will be included as well as herb-drug interactions, vitamins, minerals, omega fatty acids and amino acids. Finally, this module looks at glyconutrients. Objectives: - To understand and apply practical nutraceuticals and supplementation for patient education and office programs - To understand and apply guidelines for nutritional status assessment through blood, urine, and diet analysis - To evaluate RDA guidelines versus optimal and therapeutic levels of nutrients o Nutritional supplements properties: dose adequacy, variety of forms, manufacturing guarantees of potencies and avoiding toxic contaminants - To utilize nutritional medicine resources and current research to evaluate special diets and nutritional supplement protocols Detoxification and Inflammation Optimization of health includes combating inflammation and ongoing detoxification in an ever-increasing environmental toxic load. There is overwhelming proof that we are exposed to environmental toxins, including heavy metals on an ongoing basis. This module is designed to teach the practitioner how to detoxify the body of this burden. Detoxification is one arm of the functional and integrative medicine approach and the other modules are important to grasp to understand the fundamental principles of detoxification. Information covered in the modules on infectious disease, gut health, nutraceuticals and supplementation, nutrition and diet are thus important to grasp to fully understand this module. Objectives: The student should feel equipped to fully understand the following: - Evidence-based approaches to detoxify patients - Grasp phase 1 and 2 liver detoxification - How and what heavy metals we are exposed to - The diagnostic testing's to test for toxin exposure and presence in the human body - The concept of a provocation urine test - The significance of hair heavy metal analysis - Grasp the principles of both oral and iv chelation therapies - Have a full understanding of nutrients required to support the detoxification process - Realize the importance of inflammation in the health of patients, and also learn how to combat chronic inflammation - How to do a liver and gall bladder flush - Grasp how to do a kidney cleanse Nutrition and Diet Nutrition is a fast evolving science and practitioners are flooded with a lot of conflicting and unfounded nutrition information provided in the media, by nutritional supplement companies and even from poor designed published studies. Nutritionists themselves promote a wide variety of nutritional theories and clinical approaches, yet often conflicting. Many nutritional courses that are included in medical degree curriculums provide general but minimal theoretical information. They often offer insufficient applicable components for solving clinical problems integratively. At the same time, curriculums of standard nutrition degrees lack up to date information about the clinical applications of nutritional supplements and special diets. Their typical emphasis is on the \"food pyramid\" and a limited, very conservative set of nutritional interventions for hospital based nutrition. This module is based on up to date scientific knowledge from the fields of biochemistry, human physiology, testing objective nutritional biomarkers, as well as food and nutritional supplements chemistry and toxicology. This module is designed to support practitioners in their ability is to utilize the most effective and safe nutrition interventions for disease prevention or reversal, while optimizing the patient's vitality and performance. The information is structured to provide a well organized core of clinical nutrition solutions, a foundation that is easy to build on with updated information. Objectives: - To analyze and apply guidelines for nutritional status assessment through blood, urine, and diet analysis. - To analyze and apply RDA guidelines versus optimal and therapeutic levels of nutrients. (Focus on nutritional supplements properties: dose adequacy, variety of forms, manufacturing guarantees of potencies and avoiding toxic contaminants.) - To analyze and apply guidelines to utilizing useful nutritional medicine resources current with updated research Nutrigenomics The goal of this module is to equip you with a basic understanding of genetics, but specifically nutrigenomics and nutrigenetics. Highlighting how genetic factors may predispose to disease, and how genetic variation interacts with diet and lifestyle to alter or impact the development or progression of chronic diseases. The field of nutrigenomics offers health professionals an important new tool in their assessment of risk, and in formulating their approach to disease prevention. The genes we carry significantly impact our health and susceptibility to various diseases. The discovery of prognostic genetic markers is increasing at an astonishing rate, and continues to improve target identification, test accuracy, disease detection and treatment selection. Nutritional genomics, which studies the genome-wide influences of nutrition, has far-reaching potential in the prevention of diet-related disease. It is highly likely that during this decade the nutritional supplement, food industries and healthcare companies will grow in response to advances in nutritional genomics research and its applications. Parallel to this growth will be impressive progress in understanding the specific influence of certain food components on metabolic pathways and on long-term risk for disease One of the greatest technological accomplishments of the last 100 years has been the complete mapping of the human genome, first announced in 2003. This has given scientists a greater understanding of the mechanisms of health and disease at a molecular level, forever changing the face of clinical diagnosis and treatment. The module will cover the following topics: - Genetic Variants Associated With Heart Health, - Genetic Variants Associated With Endogenous Antioxidant Genes, - Genetic Variants Associated With Bone Health - Genetic Variants Associated With B Vitamin Pathways - Polymorphisms and Responsiveness to Diet - Nutritional Influences on Estrogen Metabolism - The human genome and molecular medicine - Telomeres and telomerase as natural therapeutic targets Objectives: - Students will understand relevant terminology of genetics and nutrigenomics, and aspects of the biology of DNA, especially genetic variation and Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNP). - Students will understand different types of genetic testing - Students will understand what is meant by nutrigenomics and nutrigenetics, acquiring knowledge on specific diet-gene interactions, which play a role in processes that impact chronic disease development. - Students will become aware of the Ethical, Legal and Social Issues (ELSI) of nutrigenetic testing, including privacy and the use of genetic information, informed consent and genetic counseling. Herbals, Phytonutrients and Complementary Alternative Medicine Sometimes called Natural Medicines-CAM involves the use of natural substances to treat and prevent disease. CAM generally is more effective for preventive medicine goals such as reducing risk of heart disease, cancer, immune complaints, diabetes, menopausal symptoms, chronic inflammation, depression etc, than it is for acute conditions such as pain, fever, injury and infection, although CAM can be useful for these conditions too. CAM works via multiple health end-points rather than merely 1 or 2. Eg Fish Oil Omega 3 fats & co-enzyme Q10 work by improving entire cardiovascular health, rather than focusing on treating only hypertension or only cholesterol. Therefore we say that CAM \"complements\" the body, meaning it works with the body to improve health, thereby reducing risk of disease. Another aspect of CAM is that its primary focus is on preventing disease before it manifests, rather than treating the disease after the fact. This is achieved through improving health generally, rather than focusing on one specific symptom. This is what is meant by the statement that CAM is preventative medicine. Finally CAM can be used also with conventional allopathic medicines to either reduce side-effects (e.g. co-enzyme Q10 reduces some of the toxicity of statin medications) or to improve effectiveness (such as co-enzyme Q10 enhancing the hypotensive effects of anti-hypertensives). Combining CAM with allopathic/conventional medicines is known as Integrative Medicine. However sometimes there can be an increased risk of side-effects, eg combining prescription anti-depressant (SSRI's) with St Johns Wort (a natural SSRI) could result in serotonin syndrome. Sometimes a combination can result in a reduction in efficacy (such as soy isoflavones, blocking access to estrogen receptors, rendering hormonal HRT less effective; or St Johns Wort inducing liver enzymes that metabolize oral contraceptives, rendering them ineffective). In such cases it is not a good idea to combine CAM with allopathic medicines. Objectives: Learners will: - Understand the definition of complementary alternative medicine and the subdivisions thereof. - Have an understanding of both minute dose medicine and naturopathic medicine. - Grasp the principles of herbal medicines - Understand the value of phytonutrients - Understand what is meant by a food supplement - Know the doses of certain vitamins and nutraceuticals that may be dangerous - Understand herb-drug interactions and which should be used with caution together. - Have an indication of which nutraceuticals to use for which medical condition. - Case studies using natural medicines and homeopathy will be provided. Integrative Medicine Lab Testing The goal of this module is to organize and explain various tests that are available so as to make their use more applicable to medical education and clinical practice. There is a new standard of care emerging in medicine, and recent science in molecular medicine has challenged the fatalistic approach to the mere management of disease with the pharmaco-therapeutic approach. The predisposition model recognizes that we all inherit genetic vulnerability, but it incorporates unfolding evidence that environmental and nutritional factors interact with our genome to produce a unique phenotype and the eventual clinical outcome. In order to identify the causative determinants that must be addressed in clinical situations, an objective mechanism is required to explore those nutritional and toxicological factors that are contributing on a molecular basis to health outcomes. Accordingly, laboratory testing to evaluate biochemical, toxicological and nutritional status in individual patients is an absolute prerequisite in modern health care to adequately investigate and manage health problems, particularly in patients with complex problems. The following lab tests will be discussed in terms of meaning of results, including actual lab results and how to interpret them: - 2 and 16 Urinary Oestrogen Metabolites in the urine - Adrenal Hormone Profile on saliva - Amino Acid testing urine - Baseline Hormone Profiles - Baseline Plus Adrenal Hormone Profiles - CDSA (comprehensive digestive stool analysis) - Comprehensive Urine Elements Profile - Organic acid/krebs cycle investigations - Essential Fatty Acids - Female Hormone Profile - Functional Liver Detoxification Profile - Genetic Diagnostic Testing - Hair Mineral Analysis - IgG food allergy testing FAQs - IgG Food Sensitivity Profiles - Intestinal Permeability testing (lactulose/mannitol test) - Melatonin Profile - Metabolic Analysis profile - MTHFR - Osteoporosis Risk Assessment NTx - Saliva vs Serum explanation - Secretory IgA testing - Iodine challenge test - Thyroid Hormone Profile - Urinary Iodine Objectives: Learners will: - be familiar with the functional laboratory testing done in Integrative medicine - have a good understanding of what optimal 2:16 OH estrone ratio is in the urine - know which nutraceuticals, foods and nutrients improve 2 hydroxylation of estrogen - know which hormones can be tested on saliva and understand that saliva reflects tissue levels - know the symptoms of antioxidant deficiency states and know which antioxidants are tested in the functional medicine lab - know the functions of the various B vitamins - understand what is meant by a comprehensive digestive stool analysis and know what can be tested with this test - understand the functions of ALA, EPA, DHA (omega 3 fatty acids) - know why homocysteine testing is important in Integrative Medicine - know how to test for growth hormone levels in the functional medicine lab - know the causes of elevated reverse t3 and decreased t3 - know the significance of IgA saliva testing - understand phase 1 and 2 liver detoxification Integrative Management of Fatigue Chronic fatigue is very prevalent in modern day society.
