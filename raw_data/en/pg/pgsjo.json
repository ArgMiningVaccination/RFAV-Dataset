Bradford , District 35, Democrat Criminal fees Recommended Position SPONSOR X SUPPORT SUPPORT if amended OPPOSE OTHER & Describe Summary Senate Bill 586 would end the assessment and collection of 60 administrative fees imposed against people in the criminal legal system. SB 586 builds on Assembly Bill 1869, which abolishe d 23 administrative fees in the criminal system , was based on the successful first in the nation San Francisco fee elimination that preceded this bill, and was signed into law by the Governor in the last legislat ive session. SB 586 will dramatically reduce the suffering caused by court -ordered debt and enhance the economic security of system - involved populations, ushering in an era of more just criminal justice policy that does not rely on stripping wealth from communities of color and low -income communities. Background/Analysis Each year, California counties place hundreds of thousands of people in the criminal legal system. Currently, California law permits counties to charge people administrative fees for diversion programs, drug and alcohol testing, civil assessments, record sealing, and even a fee for being put on a payment plan. These fees can quickly add up to thousands of dollars for a single person and pose significant barriers to reentry. Unpaid fee s can be enforced via wage garnishment, bank levy, and tax refund intercept. For example, in criminal and traffic court, a single missed court date causes the immediate imposition of a $300 civil assessment fee, easily doubling the amount of fines and f ees owed. The fee is extremely difficult to get rid of and remains in place even if the underlying case is dismissed. Processing and other add ons often add an additional $15 or $20 dollars. Last session, the Governor signed Assembly Bill 1869, which abolishes 23 administrative fees in the criminal system effective July 1, 2021. In 2018, San Francisco became the first county in the nation to stop charging these fees to people who are exiting jail and the criminal justice system. The legislation was unanimo usly approved by the Board, and had the support of leaders across our city, including our Mayor, Public Defender, District Attorney, Chief of Probation, and Sheriff. Since then, Alameda County, Contra Costa County, and Los Angeles County have also eliminated local criminal administrative fees. Challenge After years of research on fines and fees in California, including a review of state law, county policies and practices, state and local data, and the experiences of individuals in the criminal justice syst em, the Debt Free Justice California Coalition has found that these fees are unjust, high pain and low gain. Page 18 of 66 High Pain : These fees are burdensome and create financial hardship and limit employment prospects for individuals seeking to reenter their commun ities. The fees disproportionately harm low -income people and people of color. Low Gain : Counties are authorized to charge administrative fees to pay for costs associated with the justice system. Yet counties net little revenue from these fees. For examp le, in Alameda County, the rate of collection on probation supervision fees was just four percent. Similarly, in San Francisco, the Office of the Treasurer and Tax Collector found that more than 80 percent of the fees went unpaid. Because of the high costs and low returns associated with trying to collect fees from low -income people, most of the fee revenue pays for collection activities. Further, a benefit -cost analysis by researchers at U.C. Berkeley found that fee debt can cause families to spend less on positive social goods, such as education and preventative healthcare, which imposes long term costs on families, communities, and society by prolonging and exacerbating poverty. Solution/Recommended Proposal SB 586 would build on AB 1869 and end the assessment and collection of 60 administrative fees that are imposed against people in the criminal legal system. Specifically, this bill would: - Repeal the authority to collect most criminal administrative fees and make the unpaid balance of any most court - imposed costs unenforceable and uncollectible and would require any portion of a judgment imposing those costs to be vacated. - Delete the authority of the court to impose liens on the defendant's property and make a post -trial determination of the def endant's ability to pay and to order the defendant to pay the costs of the public defender. - Repeal the authority of the court to impose a civil assessment of up to $300 against a defendant who fails to pay all or any portion of a fine ordered by the court. - If the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to the statutory provisions noted above. Departments Impacted & Why Approximately 60 fees will be eliminated by this legislation.

Low , District 28, Democrat Public social services programs: financial assistance demonstration and research programs Recommended Position SPONSOR X SUPPORT SUPPORT if amended OPPOSE OTHER & Describe Summary AB 1338 will exempt unconditional cash payments from a pilot or resea rch program from interfering with recipients' eligibility for state social safety net benefits (CalWORKs and CalFresh) and state tax calculations affecting Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC). Background/Analysis Over recent years, the changing economy has concentrated wealth more and more in the hands of the few, not just in the United States (U.S), but around the world. In the U.S., this inequality is having a significant impact of communities of color as it has been stacked on top of historically and structurally reinforced systems that concentrate wealth among white Americans. To address the impact on people and the economy, many countries are beginning to explore guaranteed income. Guaranteed income payments are distributed to residents regardless of employment, unconditionally, with no restrictions on how the money is spent. The San Francisco Office of Financial Empowerment, joined by the Department of Public Health, Human Services Agency, Office of Economic and Workforce Development, Arts Commission, and other Departments have increasingly been supporting, developing, and/or implementing guaranteed income programs, and protecting recipient benefits is a crucial barrier to program implementation and success. Supervisor Haney recently introduced legislation creating the San Francisco Guaranteed Income Taskforce, which will kick off on April 16 th. Pilots for guaranteed income have been done in Finland, the Netherlands, and Canada. In the U.S., the State of Alaska gives residents a dividend of anywhere from $300 to $2,000 each year from the state's Permanent Fund \u2014monies derived from oil revenues and invested by a state -owned corporation. In California, the City of Stockton experimented with a form of guaranteed income by giving a select group of 125 mostly low -income residents a grant of $500 per month for 24 months. Initial data from the Stockton Economic Empowerment Demonstration (SEED) show that recipients, by and large, spend the money on essentials like food, clothing, and utility bills. Earlier this month, SEED released its preliminary findings from the first year of the experiment which show unconditional cash enabled recipients to find full- time employment and recipients were hea lthier, showing less depression and anxiety. Page 20 of 66Recently, the city of Compton launched the Compton Pledge, which will pay $300 to $600 a month to 800 Compton residents for two years. In addition to robust guaranteed income work in San Francisco, other California cities like Oakland, Los Angeles, Long Beach, South San Francisco, Santa Cruz, and West Hollywood are exploring guaranteed income programs too. Guaranteed income would ensure that all Californians have enough to get by -- this would include those sti tching together part- time work, those engaged in unpaid work like childcare, and those pursuing further education. It would also provide those with full employment with the security of knowing they would continue to receive unconditional income even if the y were to lose their job. Challenge The global COVID -19 pandemic and resulting economic crisis has sparked renewed interest in providing residents with a guaranteed income payment as a solution to address economic inequality. Experiments and pilots over the last 40 years in countries around the world have shown that cash transfer programs have meaningfully positive impacts on study participants. However, more research is needed to fully understand the impact that it would have in the United States. There are open questions on the ideal frequency of delivery and amount of payments, as well as the effects of these payments on labor force participation in different sectors, health outcomes, domestic violence, entrepreneurship, caregiving, re -entry for the formerly incarcerated, and income inequality when broken down by race. Currently, launching a guaranteed income pilot program means that any program participants that receive state benefits may be penalized for their participation by losing part or all of th eir benefits, as the money distributed through guaranteed income is counted in the calculation of income for most needs tested benefits. This reduces ability of low -income people to participate in pilots, making quality research significantly more difficult to conduct, and potentially penalizing poor and homeless populations involved in studies. \\ Solution/Recommended Proposal AB 1338 will allow public and private organizations to conduct high- quality pilot programs of unconditional cash assistance without jeopardizing the benefits and tax credits of those receiving payments. Specifically, AB 1338 would: Exempt unconditional cash payments from inadvertently impacting recipients' eligibility for CalWORKs and CalFresh benefits; Exempt the income from state tax calculations affecting EITC; Require the programs to register with the Department of Social Services (DSS) and submit a report upon conclusion; and Require DSS to post on its website a list of these organizations. Departments Impacted & Why It is likely that SF HSA would have to spend some staff time on training, however City Departmental costs should be limited. On the other hand, the legislation would support successful implementation of programs either already launched or in development by several Departments, including DPH, OEWD, HRC, and the Arts Commission. Fiscal Impact Fiscal analysis has not yet been conducted on this bill, which would be expected to incur some costs for DSS . It would not, however, create new CalWORKS or CalFresh grant recipients, merely protect existing benefit levels for pilot programs.

Reyes, District 47, Democrat California Commission on Human Rights Recommended Position SPONSOR X SUPPORT SUPPORT if amended OPPOSE OTHER & Describe Summary AB 412 would establish the California Commission on Human Rights, an advisory committee tasked with reviewing the status of human rights across California and providing periodic reports and policy recommendations. Background/Analysis Defending and uplifting human rights is crucial in promoting equity and justice for all California residents. Various governing bodies, spanning from local to international, have defined and outlined the importance of human rights. Currently, there is no formal mechani sm tasked with reviewing the status of human rights within California. The need for a government entity with oversight regarding human rights is critical especially in light of the COVID -19 pandemic. Community based organizations and nonprofits have typica lly served to survey the status of human rights and flag abuses. However, because of the economic impact of the pandemic, the nonprofit sector's ability to help fulfill parts of this role could be hindered for the foreseeable future. Because of the disprop ortional impact of the COVID -19 pandemic on marginalized communities, it has become even more crucial to ensure the human rights of all are met. Solution/Recommended Proposal This bill establishes the California Commission on Human Rights to serve as an advisory board. The Commission would review the status of human rights across the state of California, identifying human rights abuses and concerns, develop policy recommendations, and advocate for them accordingly. The commission will meet regularly and produce reports for the Legislature and Governor. This bill would also establish the California commission on human rights fund to aid in carrying out its task.

Nazarian , Assembly District 46, Democrat Marks -Roos Local Bond Pooling Act of 1985: electric utilities: rate reduction bonds Recommended Position SPONSOR x SUPPORT SUPPORT if amended OPPOSE OTHER & Describe Summary AB 758 will allow the state of California's 45 Publicly Owned electric Utilities (POUs) to use rate reduction bonds as a low -cost financing tool, already available to water and wastewater agencies and to investor -owned utilities (IOUs), thereby allowing customers to financially conserve. Background/Analysis Maintaining affordable electric rates is critically important. The average California household pays about $1,700 per year for electricity. Rate reduction bonds offer lower interest rates and financing costs than traditional revenue bonds because the repay ment relies on a dedicated charge on customer bills, as opposed to integrating the costs into customer electric rates. Rate reduction bonds are also issued through a joint powers authority (JPA). The debt issued by the JPA is considered \"bankruptcy remote, \" meaning it is separate from the utility's debt so even a utility bankruptcy does not create risk to the bondholder. Thus, rate reduction bonds consistently result in a AAA bond rating because bondholders are highly confident the payments will not falter. This saves both customers and utilities. POUs offer electric rates that are, on average, 15% lower than private IOUs . But upward pressure on rates is growing and maintaining customer affordability has become more challenging as regional, state and local efforts have ramped up to address climate change and wildfire mitigation, alongside the ongoing financial impacts of COVID -19. POUs need the opportunity to finance debt for their investments through less expensive rate reduction bonds. IOUs regularly t ake advantage of the low -cost financing offered by rate reduction bonds. For example, IOUs relied on rate reduction bonds after the 2001 energy crisis to finance billions of dollars of debt. More recently, IOUs used rate reduction bonds to finance new Cali fornia Department of Water Resources (DWR) debt to support a wildfire fund authorized by AB 1054 (2019) and to finance costs and expenses authorized by SB 901 (2018) arising out of catastrophic wildfires. Just this past year IOUs were authorized by AB 913 to finance COVID -19 related debt. Challenge The Legislature passed and the Governor signed AB 850 (Nazarian) in 2013 and AB 305 (Nazarian) in 2019. These bills, which passed unanimously, allow public water and wastewater agencies to utilize rate reduction bonds for lower cost financing. IOUs have Page 23 of 66also used rate reduction bonds in many instances for cheaper financing. However, while water agencies, wastewater agencies, and IOUs may finance projects using rate reduction bonds, the state's 45 POUs are not ye t authorized to do so, denying their customers the savings provided by this low -cost financing tool. There is no policy rationale for this inequity . In allowing POUs, like the SFPUC, which provides power to San Francisco's schools, MUNI, streetlights, City Hall, SFO Airport, the Zoo, and other civic institutions and private facilitie s, to take advantage of this financing tool, the utility along with customers will benefit. Solution/ Recommended Proposal AB 758 would allow POUs to use the statutorily created rate reduction bond structure that already is authorized for public water and wastewater agencies. By doing so, AB 758 would provide an option to POUs that would enable them to make investments and meet state mandates at a lower cost to their custo mers. The low -cost financing option could be used for any major utility project, such as wildfire mitigation efforts and system upgrades, renewable energy projects and potentially smoothing out revenue losses caused by COVID -19. Creating this financing option for the SFPUC stands to positively impact electric customers along with the businesses, institutions, and transit powered by the agency's resources. Departments Impacted & Why SFPUC , MUNI, SFO Fiscal Impact AB 758 would allow the SFPUC to finance projects using rate reduction bonds, resulting in lower financing costs and potentially lower bills for General Fund departments, compared to traditional utility financing mechanisms.

Portantino , District 25, Democrat Electrical corporations and other load -serving entities: allocation of legacy resources Recommended Position SPONSOR X SUPPORT SUPPORT if amended OPPOSE OTHER & Describe Summary This bill aims to create fair and equal access to the benefits of legacy contract resources for all customers and ensures that Investor - owned utilities (IOUs) portfolios are managed to maximize value and reduce unnecessary costs for all customers. Specifically, this bill: 1) Provides customers equal access to the legacy products they are paying for in proportion to what they are paying. 2) Requires the CPUC to recognize the value of greenhouse gas ( GHG )-free energy in the same way renewable energy or RA products are recognized. 3) Requires IOUs to annually sell any remaining excess legacy resource products not taken by former customers to the wholesale market. 4) Requires IOUs to transparently engage legacy resource holders in re- negotiating, buying out, or otherwise reducing costs from these contracts. Background/Analysis Early state mandated procurement of renewable energy by IOUs resulted in California's rapid transition to renewable energy. As renewabl e resources have grown to scale, both prices and market value for renewable energy have declined, leaving a significant portion of the IOU initial renewable contracts financially underwater. These contracts, often referred to as \"legacy contracts\" have pro duced billions of dollars of above -market costs that are recovered from all ratepayers. While these resources produce high costs, they also produce valuable products such as renewable energy, GHG -free energy, and resource adequacy, products needed by all energy providers to meet their clean energy goals and remain in compliance with reliability requirements. However, under the current structure, these products are retained by the IOU for its own compliance purposes. Challenge Over the last decade, more than 11 million investor -owned utility (IOU) customers , across California, have transitione d from IOU electric service to Community Choice Aggregators (CCAs), local government - owned utilities choosing to purchase electricity on behalf of their communities. Including 376,000 San Francisco residents and businesses in San Francisco's CCA, CleanPowe rSF. Page 25 of 66As part of this transition, CCA customers must share in the cost responsibility with IOU customers for the resource contracts entered into by IOUs prior to their departure for CCA service. While CCA customers must pay their fair share of the contracts, they do not have access to any of the benefits the resources from these contracts provide as those benefits are retained by the IOU for their customers. Solution/Recommended Proposal At present, customers of CCAs such as CleanPowerSF, must pay for redundant resources to meet compliance requirements even though they already pay for the products as part of their obligation for transitioning to a CCA. There is no good policy rationale for this inequitable treatment of CCA customers versus their IOU counterparts. This legislation corrects this inequitable treatment and is crucial at this time as more procurement requirements are placed on CleanPowerS F and CCAs across the state. Departments Impacted & Why SFPUC (CleanPowerSF ) Fiscal Impact CleanPowerSF is San Francisco's CCA and provides power to more than 376,000 San Francisco residents and businesses.

Caballero , District 22, Democrat Domestic violence: protective orders: information pertaining to a child Recommended Position SPONSOR X SUPPORT SUPPORT if amended OPPOSE OTHER & Describe Summary This bill would close a gap in the implementation of existing protections against a third party's disclosures of a minor's protected information under a domestic violence restraining orde r by providing courts the ability to restrict an abusive partner from accessing records and information pertaining to the health care, education, childcare, recreational activities, or employment of a minor child of the parties. It would also require certain third parties that provide services to children to adopt protocols to ensure that restrained parties are not able to access records or information pertaining to the child. Background/Analysis Currently, the Domestic Violence Protection Act (DVPA) sets forward procedural and substantive requirements for the issuance of a protective order to prevent abuse (commonly known as a Domestic Violence Restraining Order). Existing law authorizes a minor or their guardian to petition a court to designate the minor's information as confidential, and, if granted , prohibit s third party recipients of the confidential information from further disseminating the information unless certain conditions are met. Thi rd parties who violate these requirements are subject to a sanction only if they disclose the information in a manner that recklessly or maliciously disregards these requirements. Additionally , an intentional violation of a domestic violence restraining order is a misdemeanor punishable by a fine of not more than $1,000, or by imprisonment in a county jail for not more than one year, or by both that fine and imprisonment. Challenge While minor's information in connection with restraining orders can be protected, t his bill seeks to close a gap in the implementation of existing protections. T he potential for inadvertent disclosure of a minor's information by a third party reveals a key vulnerability confronting minors with a restraining order , that last year resulted in the tragic death of a survivor of domestic violence. Calley Jean Garay , a 32- year -old mother of three, left her husband and obtained a domestic violence restraining order against him. Two months later, she was shot to death while shielding her children in the parking lot of a health center in Madera, following a medical appointment. It has been alleged that the husband was the killer and that he learned of Calley's whereabouts after the health center mistakenly called him when attempting to confirm Calley's appointment. Moreover, over half of the Page 27 of 66killings of women in the United States are related to intimate partner violence, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Solution/ Recommended Proposal This bill authorizes a court to include a provision restraining a party from accessing records and information pertaining to the health care, education, daycare, recreational activities, or employment of a minor child of the parties in an ex parte restrain ing order. Th is bill requires certain third parties that provide services to children to adopt protocols to ensure that restrained parties are not able to access records or information pertaining to the child in the possession of the third parties. At a m inimum, the protocols must include designating appropriate personnel to receive such protective orders, establishing a means of ensuring that the restrained party is identified and not able to access the records or information, and implementing a procedure for documenting receipt of a copy of the protective order. These protocols must be adopted by February 1, 2023 by \"essential care providers\" defined to include organizations that frequently provide essential social, health, or care services to children. \" Discretionary services organizations,\" defined as organizations that provide non -essential services to children, such as recreational activities, entertainment, and summer camps, are required to adopt a protocol only if they are provided with a copy of a restraining order. This bill prohibits e ssential care providers and discretionary services organizations that are provided with a restraining order from releasing information or records pertaining to the child to the restrained party . This bill requires the Judicial Council to update forms or rules as necessary and becomes operative January 1, 2023. These changes will result in restraining orders that make it clear when a party must withhold the minor's information from an abusive parent. The need for clarity in such orders is especially important given that the vast majority of family law litigants are unrepresented. Departments Impacted & Why The bill requires changes to forms and protocols for courts and certain third parties that provide services to children, such as medical offices, schools, and childcare centers by February 1, 2023. Recreational organizations and summer camps would only need to develop protocols if provided a copy of a restraining order that restricts the information of a minor . Fiscal Impact No fiscal impact.

SB 331 builds on the 2018 Senate Bills 820 and 1300 that curbed these tactics in cases of sexual harassment and sex discrimination to include any unlawful activity , unless requested by the complainant . Background/Analysis Non-disparagement Agreements (NDAs) are written agreements not to criticize an employer or perpetrator publicly. They can be part of employment contacts at the time of hire or part of settlement agreements or severance deals when an employee separates from an employer. At the time of separation, they can also accompany non- disclosure agreements, t o bind the parties to secrecy. Existing law pro hibits settlement agreements that prevent the disclosure of factual information relat ed to a claim filed i n a civil action or a complaint filed in an administrative action, in regard to an act of sexual assault, sexual harassment, workplace harassment or discrimination based on sex, failure to prevent an act of workplace harassment or discrimination based on sex, act of retaliation against a person for reporting harassment or discrimination based on sex . Currently, an employer cannot require , in exchange for a raise or bonus, an employee to sign a release of a claim of employment discrimination, harassment, or retaliation for reporting or opposing employment discrimination or harassment or a non -disparagement agreement or other document that purports to deny the employee the right to disclose information about unlawful acts in the workplace. However, other forms of unlawful harassment and discrimination, including on the basis of race, sexual orientation, disability, or religion, are not covered under existing laws, which leaves victims at risk of being silenced through NDAs. Challenge Serial harassers have avoided responsibility for their conduct through using legal tact ics such as non -disclosure agreements (NDAs) in settlement agreements and the use of non- disparagement agreements in employment contracts. Secret settlements have drawn attention for their use in high -profile sexual harassment and assault cases, including by former USA Gymnastics team doctor Larry Page 29 of 66Nasser and Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein, which form victims to remain silent. Although California passed SB 820 and SB 1300 in 2018 to restrict the abuse of NDAs to claims of sexual harassment and sex - based discrimination, the same type of protection is not offered to victims of other types of unlawful activity. Solution/Recommended Proposal Senate bill 331 would prohibit provisions in settlement agreements that prevent or restrict workers from speaking out against harassment and discrimination in the workplace. The bill would permit the disclosure of factual information relating to all claims involving discrimination, harassment, or retaliation for reporting or opposing harassment or discrimination pursuant to the Fair Employment and Housing Act, regardless of the protected class on which the claim is based, with an exception for a provision that shields the identity of the claimant and all facts that could lead to the discovery of t he claimant's identity. SB 331 would also prohibit provisions in employment severance agreements to the extent that they have the purpose or effect of denying the separated employee the right to disclose information about unlawful or potentially unlawful acts in the workplace.

Chiu , District 17, Democrat Vehicles: speed safety system pilot program Recommended Position X SPONSOR SUPPORT SUPPORT if amended OPPOSE OTHER & Describe Summary AB 550 directs the Secretary of CalSTA to bring together a stakeholder working group to establish program guidelines for the piloting of two speed safety camera programs: one on dangerous local streets and the other in active state or local works zones. Pilot programs must comply with the State's guidelines to be implemented. Background/Analysis Every year, 30 people are killed and more than 500 are seriously injured while traveling on San Francisco streets. These crashes are avoidable , and cities such as San Francisco, are prohibited from using proven tools to bring the number of deaths to zero. Vision Zero traffic safety initiatives underway have made some progress, but these efforts to date have not brought about the necessary reductions in injuries and deaths. Half of San Francisco's most dangerous streets -the 13% of streets where over 75% of collisions occur -are located in low-income communities of color, where people rely heavily on walking and transit as their primary means of transportation. While only a third of our City's streets run through historically disadvantaged communities, streets in these neighborhoods are almost twice as likely to be on the High Injury Network as compared to other areas. Vision Zero efforts have historically focused on a traditional law enforcement respons e to speeding and other dangerous driver behaviors, as well as education and engineering efforts. However, these traditional enforcement methods have had a well -documented disparate impact on communities of color, and implicit or explicit racial bias in po lice traffic stops puts drivers of color at risk. Jurisdictions around the state are seeking alternatives to traditional enforcement mechanisms that will protect public safety while being responsive to community concerns. Challenge Across the United States, numerous peer - reviewed studies have shown that speed detection systems reduce the number of severe and fatal collisions by as much as 58 percent. Despite an established history, California law currently prohibits the use of these systems. Studies h ave shown that speed is the leading factor when determining fault in fatal and severe collisions, yet existing efforts have not led to the reduction in speed and traffic violence needed to save lives and make communities safe. California must provide commu nities with the option to pilot this public safety tool to create the expectation of regular speed checking on the most dangerous streets, and in work Page 31 of 66zones where traffic work crews are in dangerous proximity to fast -moving vehicles. Solution/Recommended Proposal AB 550 directs the Secretary of CalSTA to bring together a stakeholder working group to establish program guidelines for the piloting of two speed safety programs: one on dangerous local streets, and the other in active state or local work zones. Pilot programs must comply with the following specific requirements in order to operate : Program Operation : Must be operated by a jurisdiction's transportation department or similar administrative agency. Privacy Protections : Jurisdiction must adopt a pol icy setting out clear restrictions on the use of data and provisions to protect, retain, and dispose of that data. Data from a system cannot be used for any other purpose or disclosed to any other person or agency except as required by law or in response t o a court order or subpoena. Facial Recognition Ban : Jurisdictions are prohibited from using facial recognition technology in a program. Citation Type : Citations are civil in nature, not criminal, and shall not result in a point on a driver's record. Fine Amount : The total penalty amount, including fees, is capped at $125. Adjudication : Jurisdictions must provide for a hearing and appeal process for contesting citations. Equity : Jurisdictions must offer a low - income driver diversion program with specified alternative remedies in lieu of payment and reduced fines for qualifying individuals. Oversight and Evaluation : Each jurisdiction must submit a report and evaluation to the Legislature within two years of the start of the program and annually thereafter Reports must include a specific analysis of racial equity and financial impacts of programs developed in collaboration with stakeholder groups.

Irwin , District 44, Democrat Mobility devices: personal information Recommended Position SPONSOR SUPPORT SUPPORT if amended OPPOSE X OPPOSE unless amended Summary This bill would remove a public agency 's existing authority to collect deidentified shared mobility device data , and only authorize them to collect anonymized data, as defined, from shared mobility device s, including from shared bicycles, scooters, transportation network companies (TNCs), and autonomous vehicles (AVs). AB 859 is a reintroduction of AB 3116 (Irwin) from last year, which SFMTA a ctively opposed. In 2019, AB 1112 (Friedman) sought to limit shared mobility device data, as well. SFMTA opposed that bill and it was held in Committee. Background/Analysis SFMTA has developed data -driven permit programs for docked and dockless bikeshare and e -scooters to address key safety, consumer protection, and equity concerns, and integrate emerging mobility modes with the city's transportation infrastructure. We require access to individual device data from permittees to enforce geographic distribution requirements, ensure adherence to the permitted number of devices on our streets, and monitor coverage of required service areas. We also use it to analyze how shared scooters and bikes use our streets so we can adequately plan for bike lane s to improve safety for all users. These are all critical to achieve our mobility equity and accessibility goals. San Francisco does not collect any personally identifiable information about riders of shared mobility devices. We only collect data about the device itself, such as whether it is available for service or not, and trip origin and destination, to inform our regulatory and enforcement efforts. Cities also apply methods to ensure that the bike and scooter data we receive cannot be associated wit h the rider. This is in stark contrast to what private service providers collect, which is extensive personally identifiable information about their users, including detailed individual user information such as names, credit card numbers, and addresses. We do not request nor receive this type of information. San Francisco International Airport (SFO) pioneered the use of real -time trip data to regulate TNCs, implementing the App-Based Transportation Clearinghouse (ABTC) in 2015. SFO uses real -time data to collect TNC trip fees, audit the TNCs' self -reported trip fees, enforce permit terms, identify unauthorized TNC vehicles on Airport property , monitor and regulate driver behavior, investigate incidents involving TNC vehicles, control and optimize curbside access, monitor and control greenhouse gas emission and forecast future activity to allocate and optimize use of the Airport's limited spaces and resources . SFO only collects information from TNC vehicles on Airport property and the portions of US Page 33 of 66Highway 101 adjacent to Airport property, and collects no information from customers. Challenge This bill would directly interfere with ou r ability to manage the public right -of-way. Without individual device data, we would have no way to verify device data by an audit trail, which would leave us unable to ensure compliance with our permit regulations. We would have limited capacity to understand how shared mobility devices are operating within our City's transportation network, which could result in public safety hazards. Outside of compliance with permit regulations, the data is only used for analysis in an aggregated form (or with key attributes modified or removed to help ensure anonymity) and is only made available to staff in a summarized view. In addition to limiting local's ability to ensure compliance with regulations for modes we regulate including shared scooters and bikes, AB 859 expands this limitation to TNCs and AVs. This broad limitation would hinder what little regulation exists today for TNCs by the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) and the California Air Resources Board (CARB) and would preemptively tie our hands from having any information about AVs in the future. These restrictions would leave us in the dark when it come s to understanding how these for -profit services operate on the public right of way, while potentially increasing congestion, safety, and environmental concerns. This bill would also compromise SFO's ability to regulate TNCs on Airport property. The provis ion of real -time data is vital for the Airport and the San Francisco Police Department - Airport Bureau (SFPD -AB) to monitor and manage TNC activity and traffic flow and congestion. Without real- time data, it would be impossible for SFPD -AB officers in the field to ensure compliance with Airport policies and permit terms , thus compromising safety and security. Without real -time data, the Airport would have no way to verify and audit TNC trips, which would affect our ability to collect trip fees that support the Airport's transportation infrastructures. A lack of individual trip transaction data would also prevent the Airport from distributing activity efficiently along its limited staging facilities and curbside frontages, leading to increased congestion, em issions, and the uneven use of its constrained facilities. Solution/Recommended Proposal To effectively regulate and manage the City's transportation network, SFMTA needs to maintain our existing authority to collect deidentified individual device data from shared mobility operators. SFMTA staff have been working closely with other cities on what amendments to AB 859 would look like that both ensure our ability to collect the information we need to effective ly manage our streets while ensuring data privacy.

Bloom , District 50, Democrat Vehicles: video imaging of parking violations Recommended Position SPONSOR X SUPPORT SUPPORT if amended OPPOSE OTHER & Describe Summary AB 917 (Bloom) will expand state law to allow all transit agencies in California to install forward- facing cameras on buses to capture images of vehicles and cite those that park in transit -only lanes , bus stops, and transit stations . AB 917 is modeled after the successes of Muni and AC Transit's existing camera enforcement programs and aims to improve travel time and reliabil ity. Background/Analysis In efforts to improve services, transit agencies across California, including SFMTA, have expanded transit -only lanes. Expanding these lanes is a key part of SFMTA's COVID -19 Transportation Recovery Plan to ensure frequent and reliable Muni service . There are currently 43 miles of transit -only lanes in San Francisco. In a 2019 study by UCLA Institute of Transportation Studies, researchers found that designated transit -only lanes have led to increased sp eeds, decreased variability in travel times, gains in ridership, and safer streets for cyclists and transit users. The study also argued that enforcement is essential to efficacy. SFMTA established the Transit -Only Lane Enforcement (TOLE) program through AB 101 (Ma, 2007) to implement a pilot program that installed automated forward - facing cameras and issue citations for vehicles that are illegally parked or stopped within a designated bus lane for four years. The program was extended for another four years in AB 1041 (Ma, 2011) . The sunset date was eventually removed entirely by AB 1287 (Chiu , 2015). While SFMTA already has authority to use forward -facing cameras for enforcement of parking in transit -only lane violations, this bill would expand that authority, and allow SFMTA to use cameras to cite parking violations in all bus stops and transit stations, in addition to in transit -only lanes. Challenge In recent years, the growing number of cars in California roads have made it difficult for public transit to function properly. Illegal parking in bus stops and violations of bus -only lanes by personal cars, moving vans, delivery trucks and corporate rides hare services have negatively impacted transit services. Parked vehicles make it difficult for operators to maneuver around heavily congested lanes, consequently creating unsafe conditions for boarding and drop- offs. The violations have also led to increa sed travel times, reduced ridership and exacerbated congestion issues. Solution/ Recommended Proposal AB 917 will expand state law to allow transit agencies Statewide to install forward -facing cameras on buses to capture images of Page 35 of 66vehicles that violate transit -only lanes , bus stops, and transit stations during peak hours. The images w ould be sent to local parking officers, or a contracted enforcement agency, to review the images and issue citations, if needed. AB 917 is modeled after the successes of Muni and AC Transit's existing camera enforcement programs , and aims to deter bus-lane violations and improve travel time and reliability. As public transit agencies across the state work to address declining ridership, AB 917 would provide transit agencies with a cost - effective strategy to remain competitive in attracting more riders and ensure safe and rapid bus -service.

Background/Analysis Food insecurity is a critical social determinant of health and is directly associated with some of the costliest health conditions in California. Food insecure pa tients have a 200 percent increased likelihood of developing diabetes, a 47 percent increase in hospitalization and emergency room visits, and a 53 percent increased likelihood of developing chronic disease. The San Francisco Health Network's low-income patients bear a disproportionately high burden of food insecurity and resulting health impacts such as hypertension and diabetes. Black/African- American (B/AA) patients with hypertension have lower rates of controlled blood pressure compared to the total population (53 percent versus 61 percent under control in 2015). Furthermore, 45 to 70 percent of patients in SFHN experience food insecurity . The COVID -19 pandemic has exacerbated racial health disparities and the rates of food and nutrition insecurity. There is an urgent need to build resiliency among vulnerable populations, especially those with underlying medical conditions, by focusing on preventive care that may help Medi- Cal beneficiaries avoid chronic conditions before they start . At San Francisco Department of Public Health (SFDPH) , addressing food security is a high priority issue . The department has had a leadership role on the Food Security Task Force and also participates in the Food as Medicine Collaborative (FAM) . FAM is a multi -sector coalit ion bridging healthcare and food systems to address food insecurity, support nutritional behavior change, and advance health equity. The collaborative supports on - site food programming within healthcare settings through robust clinical- community linkages ( i.e. Food Pharmacies), promotes culture and systems change in healthcare to embrace food insecurity as a healthcare issue, and supports policy change such as getting health insurers to pay for food as a Page 37 of 66covered medical benefit. In 2020, 16 clinics in 5 hea lth systems participated in the Food Pharmacy program , serving 1,779 patients across 8,615 total visits (January -October). Through the program , clinic staff refer patients to \"fill\" prescriptions for healthy groceries weekly, paired with interactive nutrit ion education, cooking demonstrations, cooking toolkits, on -site hypertension management by clinicians, health coaching, and effective referrals to local food resources. Challenge Food prescriptions are an effective medically supportive food intervention used to treat, reverse, and prevent chronic health conditions like diabetes, hypertension, and depression. Studies show m edically supportive food interventions like food prescriptions can significantly improve a patient's quality of life and health status , while also reducing health care costs. Medi -Cal supports a range of medical interventions for enrollees, but to date, the program does not cover medically supportive food programs and services, such as food prescriptions. While these programs are up and running in several CA cities and counties, their expansion is severely limited because many health insurance payors, including Medi- Cal, do not reimburse for these services, Solution/Recommended Proposal AB 368 would establish a two -year, food prescription pilot program to be administered and evaluated by the California Department of Health Care Services (DHCS) in partnership with the Medi - Cal managed care plans in three pilot counties. The pilot will provide me dically supportive food (i.e. nutrient -rich whole food, including fruits, vegetables, legumes, etc.) through food prescription programs and services to eligible Medi- Cal enrollees considered to be at rising -risk because they have one or more diet related c hronic health conditions. The food prescription may be paired with behavioral, cooking, or nutrition education, coaching, and counseling. At the conclusion of the two -year pilot, DHCS will be required to evaluate the pilot's health outcome and racial disparities data. The health outcomes data generated from the evaluation of this pilot will help to better understand the impacts of food interventions funded through health care , and if positive, will be a proof of concept that this model can be effectively implemented , spurring broader adoption by DHCS and health plans statewide. For these reasons, SFDPH and Human Services Agency recommends a support position. Departments Impacted & Why No other City Department would be impacted by the bill.

Background/Analysis People experiencing homelessness (PEH) are often unable to receive needed medical and behavioral health treatment due to barriers to accessing health care. PEH, who are disproportionately people of color, have poorer health , and have life expectancies 30-years shorter than the general population. Enrolling PEH in Medi -Cal has been a recent strategy to address existing health disparities; however, even when insured, 73 percent have never seen a healthcare provider. Concerns for basic survival needs, transportation, difficulty keeping active insurance due to lack of a mailing address, lack of ID and mental illness, make it difficult, if not impossible, for PEH to access care in the traditional healthcare model. These issues are compounded by the initial barriers PEH experience trying to enroll in Medi- Cal, which is often due to lack of required documentation to verify eligibility. Without access to primary care, PEH overutilize hospital emergency rooms, where they present with multiple, untreated, advanced conditions. This leads to increased rates of hospitalization and higher rates of readmission. PEH have 740 percent more hospital days at 170 percent greater cost per day than people who are housed . Challenge In order to address the issue of health care access for PEH, San Francisco Department of Public Health (SFDPH) established the Street Medicine team. The team provides street - based clinical services to PEH with medical, mental health, and substance use needs. Street Medicine health workers and community partners offer care regardless of insurance coverage and opera te at locations where individuals are comfortable or residing - including streets, parks, encampments, sobering centers, harm reduction centers, navigation centers, and in open -access clinic spaces . The team provides multidisciplinary care by professional and peer staff highly knowledgeable in harm reduction, low - barrier medication for addiction treatment (MAT), and experience working with the target population. Each month, the team performs over 1,200 visits, about 20 percent (240) of which are new patient s. Annually, Page 39 of 66about 3,000 patients are seen, and 15,000 visits of performed. Studies have shown that street medicine programs can increase access to care, increase housing placement, improve health outcomes, and result in significant cost savings for Medi-C al and hospital systems. Overall, DPH's Street Medicine program has been an effective way to engage PEH, and ensure they continue receiving needed clinical care. Currently, the core set of medical services provided by DPH's Street Medicine are not reimbursable through the Medi- Cal program. To ensure that these services can be better sustained, and more PEH have access to these services , current barriers to receiving reimbursement through Medi- Cal for street -based clinical services should be removed. Solution/Recommended Proposal AB 369 will increase access to health and social services for people experiencing homelessness (PEH) and remove barriers to access ing Medi -Cal services through the following provisions: Allows Medi -Cal to cover services provided to PEH outside of traditional medical facilities, including street medicine teams, shelter -based care, or within transitional housing settings. Require DHCS to implement presumptive eligibility for individuals experiencing homelessness, under which an individual would receive full -scope Medi -Cal; and Prohibit Medi -Cal from implementing prior authorization/utilization controls, for services related to testing, preventing, treating, mitigating COVID -19. In addition, we request the bill be amended with the following changes: (1) Expand Medi -Cal to cover other related behavioral health delivery models for PEH care . SFDPH operates other innovative behavioral health outreach programs in addition to Street Medicine. These include, but are not limited to, the newly established Street Crisis Response Team (SCRT) and Comprehensive Crisis Services (CCS). SCRT provides a non -police response to 9 11-calls related to people suffering from mental health and substance use issues on City streets. DPH's CCS is a mobile multi- disciplinary, culturally diverse team that provides services to individuals who are experiencing an acute MH crisis and or have experienced community violence. Currently, these programs can only receive Medi -Cal reimbursement for certain services. AB 369 should also expand reimbursement for these program types to ensure their sustainability. (2) Ensure that PEH who are presumptively enrolled in Medi- Cal Fee for Service by Street Medicine and other like providers, as specified in the bill, have pharmacy benefit s. This change will ensure enrolled PEH can access their prescribed medication from a pharmacy. Collectively, the bill's current provisions and requested amendments will help to better ensure PEH have access to medical treatment, social services, housing assistance, addiction treatment, and other benefits normally covered by Medi- Cal. Departments Impacted & Why No other Department would be directly impacted by this legislation. Fiscal Impact The bill would likely have a positive fiscal impact to SFDPH due to increased reimbursement from the state for health care services being provided to PEH. In addition, the bill would likely decrease the cost of care for PEH, which is often shouldered by DPH, due to improved access preventative care. The bill would likely have a moderate impact to California 's General Fund , although the exact impacts are unclear as a bill analysis has not been released .

Davies , District 73, Republican Licensed facilities: duties Recommended Position SPONSOR SUPPORT SUPPORT if amended OPPOSE x OTHER & Describe : Support and Amend Summary AB 381 increases access to the opioid overdose reversal drug Naloxone by requiring substance use residential treatment facilities to keep the drug onsite and train staff in its administration. Amendments are sought to also apply the bill's provisions to mental health residential treatment facilities . Background/Analysis Two million Americans suffer from substance use disorders related to prescription opioids, heroin, and synthetics such as fentanyl. Statewide, overdose deaths are increasing, and in San Francisco there were 699 overdose deaths in San Francisco resulting from all street drugs in 2020. This was a 59 percent increase from 2019. There are significant inequities in these impacts, with overdose death rates four times higher among Black/African Americans than White/Caucasian San Franciscans . The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services identifies naloxone distribution as one of the top three strategies for addressing the opioid epidemic. Naloxone is a low cost, non- narcotic drug that reverses the effect of an opioid overdose. In 2018, the U.S. Surgeon General called naloxone a \"safe antidote\" to a suspected overdose, and urged more individuals to carry naloxone, including family, friends, community members, and those who are personally at risk. San Francisco has provided community access to naloxone since 2003, and in 2019 furnished 62,400 doses of naloxone. Bystander overdose reversals with naloxone have increased dramatically, approaching 2,700 in 2019 and 2,900 in 2020. Challenge Substance use residential facilities are an important site to improve access to naloxone . These facilities provide residential nonmedical services to adults who are recovering from problems related to substance use, and who need recovery, treatment or detoxification services. San Francisco have over 430 Substance Use Residential Treatment beds, which span across 13 programs. These programs serve thousands of individuals at risk of overdose. Recently, Department of Health Care Services (DHCS) issued new rules that allow the staff of substance use residential treatment facilit ies to administer naloxone to residents. Despite these changes, the availability of naloxone remains hindered due to slow uptake by facilities. Solution/Recommended Proposal In order to increase the availability of Naloxone to frontline staff who serve Page 41 of 66individuals at risk of opioid -related overdose, AB 381 would require facilities that provide residential nonmedical services including recovery services, treatment services, and detoxification services to adults (i.e. substance use residential treatment programs) to maintain naloxone on the premises at all times. Additionally, the bill requires at least one on-site staff member be trained by a pharmacist on the administration of naloxone , or be a licensed medical professional. The bill includes provision s that trained staff member s would be protected from legal action for administering Naloxone in good faith. SFDPH is supportive of most of these measures, but requests the following amendment s: (1) Expand the Types of Facilities Covered: Amend the bill to expand the types of facilities covered by the bill's provisions . Current regulations prevent residential mental health (MH) treatment facilities (i.e. social rehabilitation facilities) staff from administering naloxone to residents due to regulations by CA Department of Social Services (CDSS)'s Community Care License (CCL) and DHCS. This prohibition is similar to other regulations preventing staff from administering medications like Epi-Pens . Clients of Residential MH treatment facilities experience high rates of substance use disorders (e.g. Progress Foundation estimates 95% of residential MH clients have SUD) , and are at risk of overdose. Similar to substance use residential treatment facilities , MH residential treatment facilities are prevalent in San Francisco - the City has 174 MH residential t reatment beds across 16 programs. Given the high rates of co- occurring illness in these facilities, Naloxone should be readily available in setting s similar to substance use facilities . We therefore request the bill be amended to include MH residential t reatment facilities under the bill's provisions. (2)Reduce Staff Training Requirements: Amend the bill to remove the provision requiring staff training by a pharmacist on the administration of naloxone , as the naloxone training does not require specialized training. The current requirement that training be provided by a pharmacist is unnecessary, and create a barrier to access. Departments Impacted & Why No other City Department would be impacted by the bill.

Gabriel, District 45, Democrat CalFresh: educational programs Recommended Position SPONSOR X SUPPORT SUPPORT if amended OPPOSE OTHER & Describe Summary This bill would greatly expand the number of students receiving CalFresh benefits by requiring higher education programs that qualify under the Employment and Training (E&T) Services Program CalFresh student exemption to be certified by the State Department of Social Services by June of 2022. Background/Analysis Existing federal law provides that students who are enrolled in college or other institutions of higher education at least half - time are not eligible for SNAP benefits unless they meet one of several specified exemptions, including participating in specified an employment and training programs for low -income households that is operated by a state or local government, as specified. Challenge Food insecurity and hunger is widespread on California's college campuses. Nearly one in three California college students faces food and housing insecurity, according to a survey by the California Student Aid Commission. Students of color are more likely than others to report needs in both areas. According to California State University (CSU) one in five CSU students experience hunger. One in five University of California (UC) students report not having adequate access to adequate food or nutrition. The C OVID -19 pandemic has only exacerbated these economic and basic needs issues for students. Almost 3 out of every 5 students have reported experiencing basic needs insecurity during the pandemic. Lack of basic needs particularly threatens retention for stude nts of color. In a survey 74% of Indigenous and 71% of Black students have reported facing basic needs insecurity, illustrating how the pandemic has magnified pervasive racial disparities. Solution/Recommended Proposal California's institutions of higher education have numerous programs that qualify under a CalFresh student exemption known as the local programs that increase employability standard that would, upon program approval, grant CalFresh benefits to students in need. Unfortunately, most of these programs have not applied to qualify under this standard, leaving many students in want of well -deserved CalFresh benefits. By requiring these programs to apply, this measure will ensure that thousands of students will be newly eligible for CalFresh and that California takes full advantage of federal funding to support students in need at no additional cost to the state.

Recommended Position SPONSOR X SUPPORT SUPPORT if amended OPPOSE OTHER & Describe Summary AB 640 would bolster funding for Extended Foster Care (EFC) provided to non -minor dependents (NMDs) under AB 12 (Beall and Bass, Statutes of 2010). This bill would allow counties to establish federal Title IV -E funding eligibility for previously non -federal cases as a foster youth enters the EFC program. This would give counties some relief from the significant Extended Foster Care costs we incur today. Background/Analysis The federal Fostering Connections to Success Act of 2008 gave the states the option of extending foster care to age 21. California adopted this option through the passage of AB 12 in 2010. The EFC Program began implementation on January 1, 2012, and allowe d foster youth aged 18 to remain in care, without a new foster care eligibility determination, so long as that youth agreed to meet specified participation requirements. The original legislation included a cap on county contributions, after which the state General Fund would cover all non -federal costs. Since 2011 Realignment, however, the counties and the state have been in disagreement as to whether the state's obligation to fund program costs exceeding the county contribution cap remains in effect. Addit ionally, costs have been significantly greater over time than originally anticipated due to higher participation rates among foster youth than originally estimated. This has led to a considerable funding gap that counties continue to shoulder. Under federa l guidance, states are permitted to re -determine eligibility for Title IV-E at the time a foster youth enters the EFC Program. Under this process, it is more likely that an NMD will meet the Title IV -E eligibility because only the NMD's income and resource s are considered for eligibility. However, California's program is not currently designed to take advantage of this policy. AB 640 would correct that oversight and enable counties to determine eligibility at the time a youth enters EFC, without any disrupt ion to their services or support funding. Solution/Recommended Proposal AB 640 would bolster funding for Extended Foster Care (EFC) provided to non -minor dependents (NMDs) under AB 12 (Beall and Bass, Statutes of 2010). This bill would allow counties to e stablish federal Title IV -E funding eligibility for previously non -federal cases as a foster youth enters the EFC program. Based on the number of Non -Minor Dependents (NMDs) in California who currently are non -federally eligible and the current cost for non -SILP and SILP placements, combined with potential new administrative costs to implement this proposal, it is estimated th at net new federal funding could be approximately $28 million to counties. Since foster youth at this Page 45 of 66transition age have little to no resources under their own names, we expect that most will meet federal criteria for full EFC funding. These new federal resources will free up county funding that can be used for additional services in the CWS system.

Recommended Position SPONSOR X SUPPORT SUPPORT if amended OPPOSE OTHER & Describe Summary This bill creates the Children's Crisis Continuum Pilot Program to meet the needs of youth with complex care needs who have historically been sent out -of-state for treatment. AB 808 will c reate an integrated continuum of intensive and highly individualized treatment settings to support stabilization and step- down to home -based care. Background/Analysis Since 2015, the legislature has enacted a series of policy changes meant to improve the continuum of care provided to foster youth in the state of California. In order to reduce reliance on congregate care as a long -term placement setting, AB 403 (Stone) marked the transition away from group homes and into short term therapeutic treatment pro grams (STRTP's), meant to provide short -term, specialized, and intensive treatment for children prior to placement in family -based settings. Since AB 403, policy changes to the full spectrum of care settings have been made under the broader continuum of ca re reform (CCR) initiative, including AB 1997 (2016), AB 404 (2017), AB 1930 (2018), AB 819 (2019) and AB 2944 (2020). AB 2083 (Cooley, 2018) expanded on CCR by requiring counties to develop a memorandum of understanding (MOU) across agencies to better s erve youth in foster care who have experienced severe trauma. Existing law authorizes a child to be placed in an out -of-state group home if the juvenile court finds that certain conditions have been met, including that in -state facilities or programs have been determined to be unavailable or inadequate to meet the needs of the minor. Challenge Up until December of 2020, California was sending some de pendent youth with high - acuity behavioral needs to out of state settings with intensive treatment options. CDSS has since decertified all out -of-state facilities and worked with counties to return all foster youth to California. While most youth have been returned to California, the state has not created the capacity to meet the needs of youth who initially require a more intensive treatment environment than home based care. There is an urgent need to build that capacity so we can prevent the need for cont inued out -of- state placements in the future and properly support the highest -needs youth in our care. Solution/Recommended Proposal AB 808 will create the Children's Crisis Continuum Pilot Program to build the capacity for the in- state care of foster yout h who have been historically sent out -of-state for treatment. The program will include Page 47 of 66several integrated continuums of small, intensive, and highly individualized treatment settings throughout the state to support stabilization and step- down to home -based care. This program will be administered by the California Department of Social Services and will be tailored and highly individualized to serve children and adolescents who are experiencing mental health crisis.

Background/Analysis Development of LTSS Board is one of many recommendations out of Governor's comprehensive Master Plan for Aging Based on data from the 2015 American Community Survey, over 1,000,000 Californians will need long -term services and supports by 2030. Of those, 55 percent will be 65 years of age or older. As California becomes demographically older, the infrastructure of long -term services for adults and those with disabilities must be able to meet growing needs. . Challenge Aside from this impending increase, San Franciscans already struggle to access quality and affordable long -term care services and supports. Private options for care have dwindled in recent years and long -term care insurance remains unafford able f or too many San Franciscans , particularly women and people of color. Many low -income people in need remain ineligible to receive support through Medi- Cal and IHSS, while demograph ic changes continue to drive demand and impact budgets. Solution/Recommended Proposal Locally, our senior population is growing with real implications for our systems. By 2030, the number of San Franciscans age 75 and older will increase by 58%. Over half will likely have disabilities, and many will need formal supports and servi ces to maintain their independence. Our local trends underscore the need for this reinforcement. By 2030, we will have 60,000 more seniors than today. Our seniors are more likely to live alone than elsewhere in the state, and consequently, they are often m ore dependent on formal sources of support. AB 911 will address this crisis by creating the LTSS Board to manage and invest revenue deposited in the California Long -Term Services and Supports Benefits Trust Fund (LTSS Trust), which the bill would create i n the State Treasury, to, upon appropriation, finance long -term services and supports for eligible individuals. As a result, this bill will help further of the goals of Governor Newsom's Master Plan on Aging and improve equity, affordability and quality of care for elders and dependent adults.

Recommended Position SPONSOR X SUPPORT SUPPORT if amended OPPOSE OTHER & Describe Summary This bill would expand the California Food Assistance Program (state -level SNAP)for non-citizens, assuming other eligibility criteria are met. Background/Analysis Existing law requires the State Department of Social Services to establish the California Food Assistance Program for a noncitizen of the United States if the person's immigration status meets the eligibility criteria of SNAP in effect on August 21, 1996, but the person is not eligible for SNAP benefits solely due to their immigration status, as specified. Existing law also makes eligible for the program an applicant who is otherwise eligible for the program, but who entered the United States on or after A ugust 22, 1996, if the applicant is sponsored and the applicant meets one of a list of criteria, including that the applicant, after entry into the United States, is a victim of the sponsor or the spouse of the sponsor if the spouse is living with the sponsor. Challenge Adequate nutrition is vital for the health and wellbeing of all people, but many Californians struggle to make ends meet and put food on the table. COVID -19 and the resulting economic crisis have worsened hardship across the state, and our immigrant communities are among the hardest hit. CalFresh is a critical lifeline for millions of low - income Californians; but many immigrants are unjustly and explicitly excluded from CalFresh and our state -funded Califor nia Food Assistance Program (CFAP). Solution/Recommended Proposal This bill, commencing January 1, 2023, would instead make a noncitizen applicant eligible for the California Food Assistance Program if the noncitizen satisfies all eligibility criteria for participation in the CalFresh program except any requirements rela ted to immigration status. The bill would eliminate the distinctions based on when the noncitizen applicant entered the country and would eliminate the sponsorship and other listed criteria requirements for eligibility on a noncitizen who entered the coun try on or after August 22, 1996.

O'Donnell , District 70, Democrat California Clean Truck, Bus, and Off -Road Vehicle and Equipment Technology Program Recommended Position SPONSOR X SUPPORT SUPPORT if amended OPPOSE OTHER & Describe Summary This bill would extend the requirement that 20% of funding be made available to support early commercial deployment of existing zero- and near -zero-emission heavy -duty (HD) truck technology until December 31, 2026. The bill would further require at least 20% of that funding support early commercial deployment of existing near -zero-emission HD truck technology. The bill would define \"near -zero-emission heavy -duty truck\" and revise the definition for \"zero -emission,\" as provided. Background/Analysis The California Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006 designates the State Air Resources Board as the state agency charged with monitoring and regulating sources of emissions of greenhouse gases. The act authorizes the state board to include in its regulation of emissions of greenhouse gases the use of market -based compliance mechanisms. The California Clean Truck, Bus, and Off - Road Vehicle and Equipment Technology Program, upon appropriation from the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, funds zero- and near -zero-emission truck, bus, and off-road vehicle and equipment technologies and related projects. The program provides that projects eligible for funding include, among others, technology development, demonstration, precommercial pilots, and early commercial deployments of zero - and near -zero-emission medium- and heavy -duty truck technology, and requires, until D ecember 31, 2021, no less than 20% of funding made available for that purpose to support early commercial deployment of existing zero - and near -zero- emission heavy -duty truck technology. The program defines \"zero - and near -zero- emission\" for its purposes. Challenge To improve air quality in the most affected San Francisco communities, it is critical to reduce the emissions from medium- duty (MD) and HD vehicles. While representing a small percentage of all vehicles, MD and HD vehicles are responsible for about half of transportation PM of less than 2.5 micrometers in diameter (PM2.5) emissions in the City. Electrification of HD trucks is a critical part of the Citywide EV Roadmap. Solution/ Recommended Proposal This bill aligns with the City's zero emission vehicle goals and strategies, as described in the Citywide EV Roadmap. Page 52 of 66Departments Impacted & Why Department of the Environment, potential funding source for Citywide EV Roadmap implementation. City departments with HD truck fleets may also be impacted. Fiscal Impact Existing law requires all moneys, except for fines and penalties, collected by the state board as part of a market -based compliance mechanism to be deposited in the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund and to be available upon appropriation by the Legislature.

Horvath , District 76, Democrat Transportation: zero -emission vehicles Recommended Position SPONSOR X SUPPORT SUPPORT if amended OPPOSE OTHER & Describe Summary This bill requires the implementation of a Safe and Clean Truck Infrastructure Program to support the construction and operation of zero-emission medium - (MD) and heavy -duty (HD) vehicle parking and electric vehicle (EV) charging and hydrogen refueling infrastructure on public and private proper ties, and to encourage the use of zero-emission vehicles. The bill would require the program, by January 1, 2024, to conduct an assessment outlining regional zero -emission MD and HD vehicle parking and refueling deficiencies and strategies to address those deficiencies. Hydrogen refueling network infrastructure will be required as part of the assessment. Construction and operation of zero -emission truck parking, and supporting EV charging and hydrogen refueling networks, identified as part of the Safe and Clean Truck Infrastructure Program , will be eligible for funding. This bill would require the C PUC, in consultation with the Energy Commission and the state board, to establish a rate structure to promote the adoption of zero - emission vehicles and zero -emission freight equipment meeting certain requirements and a rate structure that incentivizes hydrogen production by electrolysis using electricity from eligible renewable energy resources . The bill would require the development of model rate structures consistent with those established for electrical corporations that a local publicly owned electric utility may adopt. Background/Analysis Existing law requires the Department of Transportation to develop and update every 5 years the California Transportation Plan. Under existing law, the plan describes the state's transportation policies and system performance objectives, includes broad transportation strategies and recommendation s, considers certain topics relating to the movement of people and freight, and addresses how the state will achieve maximum feasible emissions reductions to attain a statewide reduction of greenhouse gas emissions to 40% below 1990 levels by December 31, 2030, and other air quality standards. Existing law, except as provided, allocates revenues deposited in the Trade Corridors Enhancement Account for infrastructure projects and allocates certain federal funds for infrastructure projects, including truck co rridor improvements to mitigate emissions from trucks. Existing law requires the State Energy Resources Conservation and Development Commission (Energy Commission), working with the State Air Resources Board and the Public Utilities Commission (PUC), to pr epare and update every 2 years a statewide Page 54 of 66assessment of electric vehicle charging infrastructure needed to support the levels of electric vehicle adoption required for the state to meet the goals of putting 5 million zero-emission vehicles on California r oads by 2030 and of reducing emissions of greenhouse gases to 40% below 1990 levels by 2030. Challenge To improve air quality in the most affected San Francisco communities, it is critical to reduce the emissions from MD and HD vehicles. While representin g a small percentage of all vehicles, MD and HD vehicles are responsible for about half of transportation PM of less than 2.5 micrometers in diameter (PM2.5) emissions in the City. To support electrification of these vehicles, charging infrastructure and related parking is required. Solution/ Recommended Proposal This bill aligns with the City's zero emission vehicle goals and strategies, as described in the C itywide EV R oadmap. Specifically, this bill will create a program to conduct regional zero -emission MD and HD vehicle parking and refueling needs. Moreover, it will create a preferred rate to advance and accelerate businesses to adopt zero- emissions vehicles. Departments Impacted & Why Department of the Environment, potential funding source for Citywide EV Roadmap implementation. City departments with MD/HD fleets may also be impacted. Fiscal Impact The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement. This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.

The bill would require all state agencies, boards, and commissions to consider and prioritize the protection of biodiversity in carrying out their s tatutory mandates. Background/Analysis As established by Executive Order N -82-20, the California Biodiversity Collaborative, in consultation and with the support of state agencies, is tasked with establishing a baseline assessment of California's biodiversity, assessing the impacts of climate change and other stressors on the state's biodiversity, and identifying and advancing opportunities for collaborative efforts to protect biodiversity. The order tasked the Natural Resources Agency and other re levant state agencies to develop strategies to achieve the conservation of 30% of California's lands and water s by 2030 goal and report them to the Governor by no later than February 1, 2022. Challenge The fundamental challenge that this bill seeks to address is preventing mass extinction by furthering the state's biodiversity conservation goals as articulated in Executive Orders B -54-18 and N -82-20 . The bill's sponsors seek to align with the orders by making it law that state agencies, boards, and commissions prioritize the protection of biodiversity . Solution/Recommended Proposal This bill would require all state agencies, boards, and commissions to utilize their authorities to consider and prioritize the protection of biodiversity in carrying out their statutory mandates. The bill would require that strategies related to the goal of the state to conserve at least 30 percent of California's land and coastal waters by 2030 shall be made available to the public and provided to the Assembly Committee on Water, Parks, and Wildlife and the Senate Committee on Natural Resources and Water by no later than June 30, 2022. This bill makes it the policy of the state that public agencies shall not approve projects as proposed that are inconsistent with or would impair the successful implementation of the state's biodiversity strategies . Page 56 of 66Departments Impacted & Why The City's land management departments, e.g., Recreation and Parks or the Port, could be affected insofar as the state's biodiversity strategies could make more money available via state grant programs.

Ting, District 19, Democrat Hazardous C hemicals in Food Packaging and Cookware Recommended Position SPONSOR X SUPPORT SUPPORT if amended OPPOSE OTHER & Describe Summary Would ban the use of fluorinated chemicals from food packaging and require any durable cookware that claims to eliminate one fluorinated chemical to disclose whether any other fluorinated chemical is present. Background/Analysis Fluor ochemicals are a class of chemicals linked to cancer, thyroid disruption, cardiovascular and kidney disfunction and other human health concerns. These chemicals can migrate from food packaging and cookware into food and present a source of exposure to those consuming the food. These chemicals are commonly dubbed \"forever chemicals\" because they do not fully degrade in the environment , posing a persistent source of pollution for millennia to come . Challenge San Francisco banned the use of fluorinated chemic als in take -out foodware to prevent these chemicals from contaminating compost. However, there are many other types of food packaging, such as popcorn bags, cereal boxes and laminated wrappers than may contain fluorinated chemicals. Eliminating these toxic , persistent chemicals from food packaging will not only reduce sources of exposure to humans, it will also ensure that more food packaging is readily recyclable . Most non -stick cookware has historically contained fluorinated chemicals; when two chemic als in the class of fluorinated chemicals - PFOA and PFOS -- became widely known to cause human health impacts, manufacturers of cookware simply switched to similar fluorinated chemicals. Marketing claims indicating these products were PFOA or PFOS -free, d id not provide consumers with information about the substitute chemicals, which could pose similar health harms. Solution/ Recommended Proposal This bill would no longer allow fluorinated chemicals in food packaging and would not allow marketing claims to solely identify one chemical within the class of chemicals. Departments Impacted & Why SFPUC supports elimination of fluorinated chemicals from products, as they are a source of contamination to wastewater.

Background/Analysis Statewide beverage container recycling rates have fallen below 70% for the first time in 13 years. From 2009 to 2016, statewide rates were 80 perce nt or better. It also means that as much as $140 million in consumer refund values are failing to be redeemed. Challenge CalRecycle's 2020 cost survey demonstrates that the current payment formula fails to cover the cost of recycling for the vast majority of recycling centers (85 percent of those surveyed in 2018). Solution/Recommended Proposal AB 1454 proposes to respond to these iden tified problems and more as follows: - Provide immediate stabilization to the recycling infrastructure through targeted reinvestment of surplus recycling funds based on surveyed need; - Provide immediate, short -term 'start - up' incentives to expand convenient consumer recycling in unserved/underserved areas; - Update statutory framework to support innovation and more nimble response to evolving market conditions; - Update rules and incentive s for processors to support quality demands of a circular economy.

Dahle , Sen ate District 1 , Republican Photovoltaic Recycling Advisory Group Recommended Position SPONSOR SUPPORT x SUPPORT if amended OPPOSE OTHER & Describe Summary SB 207 requires th e Secretary for Environmental Protection to establish a Photov oltaic Recycling Advisory C ommittee consisting of specified members to review and advise the legislature on policies intended to r ecycle and recover photovoltaic panels and their components. This bill will also require the advisory committee to work with other relevantorganizations to submit to the Legislature policy recommendations which ensure that 100% of photovoltaic panels in the state are reused or recycled in a safe and cost effective way . Background/Analysis In 2015, SB 489 (Monning, Chapter 419 , Statutes of 2015) allowed DTSC the authority to adopt regulations to designate photovoltaic modules (solar panels) as universal hazardous waste. Universal hazardous wastes are commonly discarded items that present a lower risk than other hazardous wastes when managed according to established rules. The regulations were adopted in September 2020 and took effect in January 1, 2021. Designation as a universal hazardous waste facilitates the recovery, reuse, and recycling of photovoltaic panels . Challenge Under California law , the Renewable Portf olio Standard ( RPS) requires 60% of all California's energy to be generated eligible renewable energy resources, including solar energy, by 2030. According to the Solar Energy Industries Association, California will be decommissioning more solar panels than installing new solar panels in the next ten years . With more photovoltaic panels decommissioned and even more being manufacture d to meet California's renewable energy goal by 2023 , there is a n urgent need to develop strategies and policies statewide to ensure that discarded panels will be recycled or recovered . Currently few disposal options exist in California and most discarded panels are managed out of state or are stockpiled in violation of hazardous waste regulations. Solution/Recommended Proposal SB 207 will establish an Advisory Committee to develop and report to the legislature strategies and policies that aim to ensure the reuse or recycling of 100% of photovoltaic panels generated in California. We support this important effort with two amendments. We believe the time frame in the current legislation - 36 months to report to the Legislature - is too long and should be halved to 18 months. We also believe that the composition of the Committee should be expanded to include a representative of local government. Local governme nts are key stakeho lders in the collection and Page 60 of 66management of solid and hazardous waste and their perspective and experience will be essential to establish effective policy.

Wiener , District 11, Democrat Corporate Climate Accountability Act Recommended Position SPONSOR X SUPPORT SUPPORT if amended OPPOSE OTHER & Describe Summary SB 260 - the Corporation Accountability Act would require major corporations who do business in California and make over $1 billion annually to publicly disclose their full carbon emission s to the State and the public in an understandable and accessible way. Corporations would then have to submit \"science -based\" reduction plans that must be approved by both a third -party auditor and the state. Background/Analysis This bill will require those major corporations to set science -based emission reduction targets in order to avoid global temperature increases over 1.5 degrees Celsius, which is what the International Panel on Climate Change (IPPC) says is what is necessary in order to avoid catastrophic climate change. The California Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006 requires the State Air Resources Board (CARB) to adopt regulations to require the reporting and verification of statewide greenhouse gas emissions and to monitor and enforce compliance with the act. The act requires the state board to make available, and update at least annually, on its internet website the emissions of greenhouse gases, criteria pollutants, and toxic air contaminants for each facility that reports to the state board, as provided. This bill would require CARB on or before January 1, 2023, to develop and adopt regulations requiring publicly traded domestic and foreign corporations with annual revenues in excess of $1billion that do business in California to publicly disclose their greenhouse gas emissions . Challenge Climate change is an existential threat to San Francisco, California , and globally. With wildfires in California getting worse every year and sea levels rising, the people of San Francisco are already feeling serious impacts of climate change. It is imperative that all sectors of economy, including corporations make progress on climate change goals. Currently, many of the largest corporations doing business in California are not subject to carbon reporting laws, and those who do report their emissions usually do not report their full carbon footprint. Corporations who do currently report their emissions \u2014 in order to appear as though they have a smaller carbon footprint \u2014 may only report on some their activities, leaving out critical aspects of their supply chain and operations. The lack of transparency from corporate polluters makes it more difficult to regulate emissions and set appropriate reduction targets. Solution/Recommended Proposal SB 260 will help drastically reduce corporate pollution by providing an accurate Page 62 of 66representation of corporate emission data and thus creating strong market incentives for companies to lower their emissions. Under SB 260 companies will make annual public disclosures with a complete carbon emissions inventory encompassing three scopes: first, the corporations' direct emissions, including fuel combustion; second, their emissions from purchasing and using electricity; and third, indirect emissions stemming from a number of sources, mainly a corporation's supply chain. This will be the broadest and most comprehensive set of emissions reporting requirements in place for large corporations. Departments Impacted & Why No other departments impacted.

The bill would require the authority to consult with various state agencies and stakeholders in the development and implementation of the program. Background/Analysis Existing law, the California Pollution Control Financing Authority Act, establishes the California Pollution Control Financing Authority, with specified powers and duties, and authorizes the authority to approve financing for projects or pollution control facilities to prevent or reduce environmental pollution. Existing constitutional provisions require that a statute that limits the right of access to the meetings of public bodies or the writings of public officials and agencies be adopted with findings demonstrating the interest protected by the limitation and the need for protecting that interest. This bill would make legislative findings to that effect. Challenge To improve air quality in the most affected San Francisco communities, it is critical to reduce the emissions from MD and HD vehicles. While representing a small percentage of all vehicles, MD and HD vehicles are responsible for about half of transportation PM of less than 2.5 micrometers in diameter (PM2.5) emissions in the City. Solution/ Recommended Proposal This bill aligns with the City's zero emission vehicle goals and strategies, as described in the Citywide EV Roadmap. Specifically, the bill will create a first - of-its-kind financing program to enable businesses to transition to MD and HD zero emissions vehicles.

Background/Analysis Currently SB 1383 will require jurisdictions to implement comprehensive organics collection programs to reduce organics going to landfill by January 1, 2022. We oppose a blanket delay of the law but would support if amended language included targeted delays for local government reporting, phased -in enforcement, and phased -in and/or modified procurement of organic waste product requirement. Challenge The bill is an effort to provide relief from those requirements that could financially impact California jurisdictions during recovery from the COVID -19 pandemic. San Francisco's comprehensive zero waste programs and policies already ensure our compliance with most of the statewide laws. Solution/Recommended Proposal Delaying the requirement to ensure that businesses have sufficient recycling and composting collection access because of COVID -19 impacts is not in line with our statewide climate and recycling goals. In addition, the requirements as they stand will ensure that new and re -opening businesses are set up for proper separation of discards to avoid further climate impa cts of our discards.
