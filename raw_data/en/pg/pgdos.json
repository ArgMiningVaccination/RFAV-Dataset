I reflect on all of the clients I have worked with and what has been the most eective way to recover health. I try and make an interesting lecture based on this year of cases.\"Finding hidden foods allergies has revolutionized the way we can help people including myself and my own children.\"Steve Nenninger \"I can't believe that I lived with my symptoms for so long without knowing how to help myself.\"Jennifer S. \"I had tried everything, including alternative therapies for my digestive problems before nding my hidden food allergy. Not surprisingly when I stopped eating the food that was killing me I gotbetter.\" John G.Steve Nenninger, NDTHE TREATMENT OF CHRONIC LYME DISEASE: Part I by Steve Nenninger, ND Since so many people suffer with Lyme disease I felt like it was important to report the success in a case ofchronic lyme disease. This is a case where the personundertook the approach on her own and then asked meto monitor. This case is of a forty five year old womanwith severe allergies after being diagnosed and treatedfor acute lyme. The allergies that she developed after herlyme disease were severe, and affected every part of herhome life and work. The patient reported going througha box of tissues each night with her constant allergy symptoms. She had similar allergic symptoms during the day, in addition tojoint and body pains. The patient is a doctor herself. So in addition to trying many of her own solutions, she had been to many alternative, natural, chinese, homeo-pathic and conventional medical doctors. She had taken antibiotics with theoriginal diagnosis of lyme, so from the conventional medicine she had doneeverything right. Additionally the patient was also infected with alpha gal(galactose-alpha-1,3-galactose) which is a tick transmitted allergy to red meat. Another way of describing the condition in her body was a case of post lymes mast cell disorder. Mast cells are the cells that release histamine inreaction to infections, or problems the body sees as infections. The problemwith these cases of mast cell disorder is that once they get established, stud-ies have shown that antibiotics don't help with these symptoms. Indeed,unless there is an active infection showing elevated white blood cells fight-ing bacteria, then there is very little that conventional medicine can offer forthese patients. For years in practice there was a frustrating feeling in these and other similar cases. Some cases just seem to get locked into an inflammatory stateand can't get out of it. I am this type of patient myself, as are my 4 siblingsthat all have autoimmune diseases. The understanding of the role that a clear,half inch long animal that is a wide as a few hair can play in the functioningof our immune system has revolutionized the way that I think about my mostdifficult cases. In this lyme case I was not under the illusion that I was going to help this case with my expertise, and a with a small change in one of the therapiesshe had tried. Very difficult chronic cases do not need more of the same, theyneed a different perspective. As a patient myself, I was treated by many doc-tors and only received small incremental changes. The role my experienceplayed was not to waste time retrying things. I knew a lot of doctors that this patient had seen and they were skilled and knowledgeable in their profession, both the conventional and natural. So what do you do in a case where pharmaceuticals, energy work, psychic healing,homeopathy, nosodes, herbs, acupuncture and nutrients, and various elimina-tion or blood type diets have failed? Remember with lyme disease, we know about a few bacteria that can create problems, and we can test for a few of them. But we are not even close toknowing all the bacteria that ticks and other bugs can carry. Every so often, theyare finding new bacteria that can affect people's health. These other organisms may be even more likely to create symptoms than the classic lyme bacteria. If your mom ever pulled a tick off of you in thesummer then you do have tick transferred bacteria. Lyme disease existed before we discovered lyme bacteria. Even though we have identified borrelia burgdorferi only in the last few decades, the lymebacteria has been around for quite a while. They recently found a fifty millionyear old tick inside a piece of ancient amber. And inside that tick was the bac-teria that causes lyme disease. So this new disease is actually an old disease, atleast 50 million years old. Human-like creatures seem to have been around for a million or so years, so the bacteria was here before us and evolved with us. So we should beable to handle it better. Some people have tried to argue that the reason thatlyme is a problem today is that the co-infections are the new problem. Yet, if wewere to test that 50 million year old tick we would find other bacteria and virus-es and and other organism that can affect us like mycoplasms. There is no rea-son to assume that we are any more infected with tick borne illness than ourancestors. In fact, they probably had a much greater exposure. Obviously if you can avoid getting bit by ticks, that is the best way to manage tick issues. However, I have just seen many patients do their best toavoid tick bites and still seen them become infected with tick bites. Even if itcan be avoided now there are all of the bites many of us received in childhood.And the question is not so much how tick bites can be avoided, that informa-tion is not what patients come to us for. They come to us after that bridge hasbeen crossed. We have to treat the case as it comes to us, with the tick borne ill-ness transmitted. It is clear that ticks with lyme were around long before we were as humans, and they have been infecting our ancestors since we have had ances-tors. And yet, human beings have not only survived but have thrived. So howdid we survive with all of these deadly ticks constantly feeding on us?

A 2009-10 study entitled \"National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey\" suggests that two out of threeAmerican adults are overweight. Half of these overweightAmericans are classified as obese, possessing an increasedmortality risk of numerous diseases under one umbrella -\"metabolic syndrome\"- which includes a large waistline,high triglyceride level, low high-density lipoprotein (HDL)level, high blood pressure and high fasting blood glucose.Your risk of heart disease, diabetes and stroke increases withthe number of metabolic risk factors you possess and if youhave three or more, a diagnosis of metabolic syndrome iswarranted. During my 11-year tenure as fitness director at a local health club, one of my duties was performing orientations for members who had justjoined. After administering a health screen, I usually began the consultation by ask-ing the person what their objectives were and the typical response was an eye open-er. Regardless of age, sex or conditioning level, more often than not, people said that they were looking to change their appearance (often described as \"toning up\"),which might seem reasonable given the statistics regarding overweight/obesity thatI just mentioned. Very few made any mention of improving their health. Now, maybeit's just that most people think the two go hand in hand and, for the most part, theydo. However, there is a growing body of research focused on obese individuals whodo not display the typical metabolic and cardiovascular repercussions. These patientshave been termed the \"metabolically healthy obese\" (MHO). In a recent editorial in Metabolism, Mathew et al. review the literature regarding the MHO phenotype. They begin with an explanation of how under-standing this patient subset along with individuals who possess the unhealthy meta-bolic profiles of obesity despite being of normal weight (MUHNW) is important forensuring appropriate treatment and decreasing the healthcare costs of obesity (esti-mated at close to 128 billion dollars in 2008). The MHO phenotype was introducedby Herrmann et al. in 1982; however, in subsequent research, a specific classificationscheme for these patients has yet to be adopted. It is generally accepted that the MHO moniker applies to individuals who do not possess insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, dyslipidemia or hypertensiondespite meeting the traditional criterion for obesity (i.e., Body Mass Index greaterthan 30 kg/m2), classification in studies has varied with different cutoff points forblood pressure, blood lipids (HDL, LDL, total cholesterol, triglycerides or triglyc- eride-to-HDL ratio) and variable definitions of insulin resistance (e.g., classification based on fasting plasma glucose, hemoglobin A1c and/or homeostatic model assess-ment). Using Body Mass Index (BMI) to differentiate obese from normal-weight indi-viduals is also problematic because the value is based on body weight and not bodyfatness per se. The authors conclude that more consistent criteria are needed to deter-mine whether an individual is MHO before investigating the phenotype. Classifying MHO is challenging, but the MUHNW phenotype is even more difficult to define. In 1981, Ruderman et al. described non-overweight (i.e., BMI <25kg/m2) individuals who were hyperinsulinemic, insulin resistant, hypertriglyceremicand predisposed to subsequent development of type 2 diabetes and coronary arterydisease. Despite their \"normal\" body weight, these individuals also displayed otherpathological characteristics of their obese counterparts including abdominal fat dis-tribution and elevated blood pressure. Most studies have set the cutoff point for such\"metabolic obesity\" at three or more metabolic derangements although Lee et al. haverecently proposed using the TyG index (the product of fasting blood glucose andtriglyceride level) to identify patients who are not obese, but possess a metabolic pro-file as if they were. Mathew et al. stress that precisely classifying MHO and MUHNW is essen- tial because it will allow healthcare providers to more accurately determine the preva-lence of these conditions. For example, in 2010, Velho et al. found a prevalence ofMHO that ranged from 3.3 to 32.1% in men and 12.2 to 57.5% in women largelydepending on which criteria of MHO was applied. Moreover, Kim et al. found ahigher prevalence of MHO when the phenotype was classified by fat-deposition pat-tern. Specifically, using the visceral-to-subcutaneous fat ratio (V AT/SAT) as a cri- terion, the researchers found that 53.7% of overweight adults (BMI 23 kg/m2) had a V AT/SAT below 0.4, which classified them as MHO. Interestingly, these researchersalso report that the oft-used measurement of total serum LDL did not differentiateMHO subjects while a particular type of LDL particle did. Specifically, the authorsfound that a high proportion of very small, dense type B LDL particles was associat-ed with an inability to maintain metabolic health while being overweight. Theresearchers conclude that instead of the conventional lipid profile, a more compre-hensive lipoprotein subfractional analysis is required to determine whether meta-bolic health can be maintained despite being obese.

MAINTAINING METABOLIC HEALTH IN THE FACE OF OBESITY by Dr. Fred DiMenna, Ph.D., C.S.C.S. by DAVID MILLER, MD, LAc If you're experiencing chronic pain you're not alone. The Institute of Medicine has estimated that nearly 100 millionAmericans live with some type of recurrent or chronic pain syn-drome. Because of this tremendous burden on the population,coupled with newly available products and generally poor train-ing for doctors on non-pharmaceutical pain control options, theCenters for Disease Control reports that prescriptions for opi-oids nearly quadrupled over the past 15 years. Sadly, there were nearly 183,000 deaths from opiate overdose during that time. That number has risen to over 50,000 deaths in one year alone between2016-2017. While opioids do play a critical role for pain control in some conditions, theprotocol has become to start with pain-killers first rather than using them as a last resort. Fortunately, society and the medical profession are realizing alternatives must be found and fast. The Joint Commission, the largest accreditor of health care agenciesin the U.S., gave a clear directive that both pharmacologic and NON-pharmacologicstrategies should be considered for pain management including: acupuncture, chiro-practic, osteopathic manipulative treatment, massage therapy, physical therapy, relax-ation techniques and cognitive behavioral therapy. Let's focus on acupuncture. This option is massively underutilized at present, and deserves special attention. Acupuncture enables the body to release its own endoge-nous opioids, literally signaling the body to produce these pain-killing chemicals with-out taking a pill or a shot. Acupuncture has no negative side effects, is deeply relaxingand emotionally balancing. According to \"The Acupuncture Evidence Project\", the mostcomprehensive, scholarly, evidence-based review that studies the benefits of acupunc-ture, evidence showed acupuncture was effective for 117 different medical conditions. A 2012 article published by Evidence Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine entitled \"Acupuncture for the Treatment of Opiate Addiction\" by Jaung-GengLin et al, included a summary of how acupuncture seemingly works to suppress opioidaddiction: \"Manual acupuncture (MA) and Electrical Acupuncture (EA) - where a low current and/or a light stimuli is sent through the acupuncture needle or electrode intothe acupressure point - are capable of triggering a chain of events that can be understoodthrough controlled experiments. The best-known mechanism is via endogenous opiates and their receptors. Different kinds of endogenous opiates, such as -endorphin, enkephalin, EA. EA of low frequency (2 Hz) accelerated the release of -endorphin and enkephalin in the central nervous system whereas EA of high frequency (100 Hz) accel- erated the release of dynorphin... Neurochemical and behavioral evidence have shown that acupuncture helps reduce the effects of positive and negative reinforcement involved in opiate addiction by modulating mesolimbic dopamine neurons. Moreover, several brain neurotransmitter systems involving opioids and GABA have been implicated in the modulation of dopamine release by acupuncture.However, many unanswered questions remain regarding the basic mechanisms ofaction of acupuncture. Future research could better determine the influence ofacupuncture therapy on the regulation of dopamine and other neurotransmitters.\" Acupuncture is also extremely safe when performed by a properly trained practitioner. There are over 30,000 licensed acupuncturists nationwide, many of whomhave active certification of training with the National Certification Commission forAcupuncture and Oriental Medicine (NCCAOM). This makes finding a qualifiedpractitioner easy. Many medical doctors also have training in acupuncture, and they canbe found through the American Academy of Medical Acupuncture. Always ask the person you're considering for care about their training. Licensed acupuncturists have a minimum of 1,905 hours of schooling, with many com-pleting programs in excess of 3,000 hours. Medical doctors complete generally a mini-mum of 300 hours of acupuncture specific training (after medical school), and contin-ue life-long learning through their professional association and via other routes. Interestingly, while many health insurance plans do not cover acupuncture, use of acupuncture and other complementary and integrative modalities would actu-ally save our health care system millions per year if it were effectively integrated. Onestudy showed that, on average, patients who used integrative modes of treatment suchas acupuncture had lower average healthcare expenditures than patients with similarconditions who did not use these modes. We can reduce the over prescribing of opioids, decrease unnecessary deaths, decrease our total healthcare spending as a country, and live with less pain more natu-rally.

PAGE Healing: Platelet Rich Fibrin (PRF) by Howard Golan DDS & Jeffrey Etess, DDS The profession of dentistry is devoted to the maintenance and restoration of one's oral health. Unfortunately, dental caries is the number oneinfection worldwide, and this prominent infec-tion of the hard tooth structure is what destroysour precious teeth. Additionally, many adults inthe United States currently have some form of periodontal gum disease, which compromises and erodes the gum and bone that holds ourteeth in our mouths. Traditional treatments to restore gums to their original levels involvetaking tissue from one part of the mouth or from a human cadaver and placing it in thetreatment site. While these procedures are sometimes effective, they do require invasiveand painful mouth surgeries with sutures. When teeth are too damaged, they need to beextracted. Once teeth have been extracted, many people choose to replace these diseasedteeth with dental implants. But dental implants need to be placed in adequate disease freesound bone. Sometimes bone grafts are needed, which come from the patient themselves,synthetic materials, other animals like cows and pigs, or processed human cadavers. Synthetic bone is not adequate to use for dental implants because it cannot attach, support, and integrate to the dental implant, and because it is artificial, it can react with thebody in unanticipated ways. The bone from other animals, including human cadaverbone, only acts as a scaffold to hold the space for your own bone to replace. Some people worry about the transmission of diseases from cow and pig to humans, while others reject using another animal species of bone altogether because ofpersonal or religious beliefs. Using a patient's own bone for grafting is ideal, but usuallyrequires an invasive surgery taking the bone from other areas of the mouth, or other partsof your body like your hip. Any additional surgeries also bring increased cost to the patient, more treatment visits, unnecessary risk of pain, and the possibility of infection. Some dentists even pro-pose taking the very same diseased teeth which they have extracted, grinding them up,adding chemicals, and reinserting this concoction back into your mouth claiming it to beas good as bone. Such tooth grinding procedures however, might be the worst bone graft-ing method of them all. Now available at Golan Family Dentistry, Platelet Rich Fibrin (PRF), is a revolu- tionary leap forward in dental healing and grafting. Simply put, blood is taken chair-sidefrom your arm in the same exact delicate manner as the nurse does in your doctors' office,with no separate trips or visits. In about 10 minutes, the blood is prepared and processed with absolutely NO CHEMICALS, and it is ready to use immediately to help you HEAL YOU. The fibrin plugthat is created contains your own growth factors, growth proteins, healing plateletcytokines, and the all-important regenerative stem cells. The PRF becomes your owndynamic super biomaterial to biologically stimulate bone and soft tissue repair and regen-eration, and to aid and accelerate wound healing. In tooth extractions, PRF can be used to graft the extraction sites and \"cavitations\" for a safe, rapid, and predictable graft that turns into your own quality bone. By graftingat the time of extraction with PRF, you preserve the bone around the extraction site. By pre-serving this precious bone, the neighboring teeth are not subject to unnecessary bone loss.Additionally, now you will have enough superior bone for the placement of the dentalimplant. Without a bone graft, traditionally you need to wait 6 months or more to place an implant. With cadaver bone, you have to wait approximately 3 months. With a PRF graft,scientific studies have shown ready mature bone in less than 8 weeks. In some cases, thedental sinus might be too low and not allow enough room for a dental implant to beplaced. In this situation, a dental sinus lift is needed. There is no better material then PRF to be placed adjacent to the dental sinus to safely and predictably perform this procedure. Because of the consistency of PRF, it startsout as soft, so it is very gentle against the sinus membrane, which is very thin and delicate.The PRF will not only help to fully preserve the sinus membrane, but help hold the mem-brane in place while the PRF matures into new bone to safely and predictably accommo-date the implant. In gum recession procedures, PRF can be utilized to provide root coverage for treating gingival recession in a scalpel and suture free procedure. Traditional gum reces-sion involves using donor cadaver tissue or the patients own soft tissue grafts in order torebuild the gum line. The soft tissue would then be sutured in place and would join to theexisting gum tissue as it healed. A PRF minimally invasive plastic surgical gum lift would gently loosen the gum tissue and slide the gum-line to cover the exposed root structure. There are no grafts, nosutures and no incisions are needed. It simply involves the adjustment of the existing tis-sue and utilizes the amazing healing qualities of the PRF. PRF gum lifts will actuallyincrease the amount and thickness of the all important \"ATTACHED\" gum tissue. At Golan Family Dentistry, we strive to bring the latest in dental advances and techniques.

This is even truer in sports where the competi- tive athlete must perform in front of hundreds and some-times thousands of fans. If sports performance doesn't gowell, being shamed on a grand scale is a possible out-come. The only way that the athlete is able to manage shame is to have a large store house of self-esteem to tap intoduring those upsetting shameful moments. It dawned onme that shame is a central problem in sports when I observed that an athlete will typically say they feel relaxed when practicingalone but feel dread and anxiety when competing in front of others. The language used in sports also points to the importance of shame versus pride on the playing field. As an example, in golf, if you win a hole youare said to have \"the honors\" on the next hole and get to hit first. The term 'thehonors' implies the pride and respect given to you by the opponent. Psychoanalysis is especially suited to address emotions like shame, embarrassment, pride and esteem since this form of treatment regularlyexplores in inner feelings of the athlete as opposed to standard sport psychol-ogy interventions which attempt to suppress or push down feelings like angeror anxiety. And the reason that behavioral sport psychology has proven to beineffective is because many of the emotions felt on the playing field are sointense and unconscious. Gardner and Moore's text Clinical Sport Psychologydemonstrates this fact very well. Asking the athlete to use some deep breathing technique while they are facing competitive pressure during a match is like telling them to build asand castle on the beach and suggesting that will help them when the tsunamihits land. As a psychoanalyst and sport psychologist, I have found that someof Glen Gabbard's work with stage fright has helped me with my athletepatients. There are similarities between an actor who experiences stage frightand an athlete who has the yips or is choking. The late great British actor SirLawrence Olivier suffered with massive stage fright and Chuck Knoblauch ofthe Yankees suffered with the yips. The source of their problems comes fromthe same place. Psychoanalysts have suggested that infantile voyeuristic terroror narcissistic intoxication may produce stage fright. Others have pointed outthat feelings of genital inadequacy or loss of bowel control may be the cause.Some analysts have said that stage fright may be due to unconscious aggres-sion that could produce guilt about triumph over siblings. It may also be dueto separation anxiety when victory comes to rep-resent the finding of the true self and the leavingbehind of the mother. Heinz Kohut may be the most important psychoanalyst since Freud and he felt that anindividual with self-doubt and lowered self-esteem will experience disintegration anxiety atthe thought that a performance will be met bysilence. Gabbard suggests that an individualwho enters the limelight carries fear that othersmay become envious and thus they experience afear of success. I have worked with athletes for over twenty-five years and I can see how a large partof their sports experience relates to performing infront of others. This is the reason they play, but itis also the reason they feel anxiety. Almost all ofthem can relax and perform well during practice,but when the audience arrives, the fear, dreadand anxiety about failure and shame arrive withthem. Having tried many forms of treatment with the elite athlete, I am con- vinced that the psychoanalytic approach works best. Psychoanalysis gives theathlete a chance to vent feelings and to explore what is going on beneath the sur-face. This is a healing experience that allows the true self to become strong. Sports is a very intense and exciting experience but when the yips, chok- ing and anxiety take hold of an athlete, it can destroy a sport career. It should beno surprise that it takes serious intervention which go far beyond deep breathingand a pep talk to release athletes of their woes. Many in the macho world of sportsstill resist sport psychology out of fear of appearing weak, but those who have theindependence and insight to avail them of this kind of work, discover that it's aninteresting journey that can save a sports career and in fact allow the athlete toreach new heights of performance.

Thinkagain! The chemicals that are in conventional hair care products canactually make you lose your hair! How ironic is it that you bought that conditioner and sham- poo because the company marketed it promising thicker andshinier hair? What people don't know is that the chemicals in hair care products lead to allergic reactions that exacerbate hair loss by destroying keratinin hair follicles and irritating the scalp. Some of these chemicals includediethanolamine(DEA) and triethanolamine (TEA). The chemical that causes shampooto bubble and lather, sodium laurel sulfate (SLS), strips hair of fatty acids, breaksdown proteins necessary for hair integrity and stops hair growth. Sodium chloride(yes table salt) is used as a thickener and dries out hair. Polyethylene glycol (PEG) isanother thickener that strips hair of moisture. Parabens are used to extend shelf life ofproducts, but are estrogen disruptors that cause hormonal imbalances that lead to evenmore hair loss. Most hair care products contain alcohol or some form of alcohol whichdries out the hair even more. If you want to stop your hair from falling out, chose a hair care line that uses only all natural ingredients, as nature intended. Nickys Organic Hair Grow penetratesthe hair shaft and repairs damaged hair follicles. The line contains only natural andorganic ingredients, like avocado, argan and coconut oils, organic keratin, wheat pro-tein and aloe. These ingredients are immediately absorbed by the hair, restoring lost mois- ture. The natural oils contain essential fatty acids which protect the hair follicle andshaft from further damage, thereby restoring rough, dry, frizzy and unmanageablehair. Since the ingredients are all natural, there is no chemical build up on the hair,making hair naturally shiny and smooth all the time. These natural oils protect hairfrom future heat-and-chemical related damage, hair straightening and color treat-ments, harmful UV rays and other environmental factors like chlorinated shower andpool water. Here are some other tips to keep your hair looking great: Do not apply too much heat to your hair. Excessive heat can severely damage African American hair.Avoid overusing flat irons, curling irons and blow dryers in your hair care routine.Choose roller sets, wraps, twists or up-dos that don't require excessive heat. If you can,let your hair dry naturally. Wet hair is stretchier and has a tendency to break. Only use a wide-tooth comb on wet hair. Apply leave-in conditioner or detangler to make your hair more pli-able as you style it. Don't brush your hair too much! There is an old wife's tale thatsays brushing your hair 100 strokes a day will make it smoother -- but it will only causebreakage to your hair. When you do brush your hair, try a natural bristle brush like a boarbristle brush. These brushes distribute oils throughout your hair to make it softer andshinier. You don't need to shampoo and blow-dry your hair every day! Yes, that is cor- rect! This only speeds up the damage to your hair. Try going every other day then everytwo days without washing your hair. It really depends if you have naturally oily skin andhair. You will have to be the final judge on that! The secret to healthy-looking hair starts with the right hair care regime. Nickys Organic Hair Masque & Nickys Organic Shampoo/Conditioner includes patented tech-nologies to target dry and damaged hair. These two products smooth, strengthen, andhelp prevent split ends and breakage. MORE HAIR CARE TIPS Reapply relaxers and color only to the new growth (virgin hair that has never had chemicals applied to it). Most stylists will recommend a touch-up every 6 weeks; that isnever necessary. Eight weeks should be the minimum, if they ask for you sooner thanthat, run to the hills. They are looking for a quick buck and they don't really care aboutyour hair's health. Women with excessively dry hair should use a deep treatment like a hair masque once a week to regain moisture, strength and gloss. Leave-in treatments also help evenout the hair's porosity, reducing the need for over-styling and preventing further damageto the fragile hair shaft. Nickys Organic Hair Masque is 100% natural and is strongenough to reinvigorate coarse, dull hair. This helps keep the hair shaft strong, lesseningthe chances of breakage and damage so hair can grow longer. If you have extra dry hair,Nickys Organic Hair Grow can be used as the perfect daily moisturizer. Simply put asmall amount in the palms of your hands, rub together and apply to hair strands to keephair moisturized between shampoos. You were not born with skin problems or damaged hair. As children, we all had baby soft beautiful skin and insanely shiny hair. But as we got older, many of us begansubjecting our hair and skin to a lot of abuse. Alcohol-based hair sprays, chemicalprocesses, blow dryers, and styling irons all cause tremendous damage. Nickys Organic Shampoo/Conditioner is sulfate free and contains no parabens, phthalates, or petrochemicals. If you color your hair, you want to use a shampoo that isfree of sulfates to preserve the color. Sulfates are strong detergents that can cause color tofade and even turn another color - brassy or ash - faster. Marie Pierre is the founder and president of Nickys Organic Hair products made with 100% natural and organic ingredients. No chemicals, sulfates, phthalates, plastics, GMOs, fragrances, artificial colors, DEA or TEA, silicone, parabens, or preservatives are used.

Most recently, I was theVice President of Lightstone Financial where I taught financialadvisors about alternative investments. I am licensed with series 6,7, 63, 65 and Life and Health licenses and, when not helping myclients with wealth management, I am involved with local charitiesin the community and spend time with my family and young son.The decision to become a financial advisor in the independentarena was derived out of my innate desire to help individuals and families grow and preserve their assets in order to live comfortably in retirement, whilealso keeping their values in mind when choosing the right investments. After learning more about Vanderbilt's dedication to the environment and society through both their LEED Platinum certified headquarters and volunteer andcharity work, coupled with their focus on creating a positive change in the communi-ty through incorporating impact investing into their broker dealer platform, I knewthis company was the where I wanted to be. I'm excited to be working with individu-als who believed they can have a positive impact in solving some of the world's com-plex issues. This year alone, Vanderbilt has added 40 financial advisors; 30 of whom have dedicated their entire wealth advisory career solely to impact investing. There is a clearand evident indicator that Vanderbilt is a leader in the impact world in which they arecreating a quiet but powerful movement soon to explode mainstream. Vanderbilt was founded in 1965 and in 2002, CEO Steve Distante acquired the firm transformed it into a business with vision and purpose. Also known as TheSustainable Broker Dealer, Vanderbilt's values of \"GRITT\" (gratitude, respect, inno-vation, teamwork, and trustworthiness) are ingrained in their commitment to the envi-ronment and creating positive change. Vanderbilt's focus on Impact Investing was bornout of Steve's passion. He says, \"There is so much confusion in the industry - this is notphilanthropy, this is not a gimmick, this is a movement and deserves to be treated assuch. We want people to wake up to this very important investment strategy; advisorswho are looking to be prepared the future of their practices and capable of serving thenext generation need to pay attention and embrace Impact!\" As an independent financial advisor, Vanderbilt Financial Group is my Broker Dealer, which means they are the investment firm that bridges the gap between me andmy clients' investments. Vanderbilt provides continued education and training thatallows me to innovate and find the best investments for my clients.Vanderbilt's program called Impact U has been extremely helpful to me. Impact U is a free, collaborative, online community created to provide a unifiedplatform dedicated to spreading awareness and education about Impact,Sustainable, and Responsible Investing in addition to furthering the movement. Impact Investing refers to investments that are made with the intention to generate a positive environmental, social, or governance benefit alongside tradi-tional financial returns. In order to be considered an impact investment, the invest-ment must make a positive social, environmental, or governance impact that wouldnot have otherwise have been possible without the investment. I believe that through impact investments, we can create the change we want to see in the world by investing in alignment with our values. So, no matterwhat side of the political fence you fall on responsible investing can clearly canhelp our planet. Impact Investing can be confusing to advisors and clients; some people refer to Impact Investing as \"Sustainable Investing\", Social, Governance Investing.\" Impact U aims to connect thesedots through their two initiatives, www.impactu.info and www.impactu.fund. ImpactU.info is an online collaborative community that house education- al content from Impact Experts and Enthusiasts in the form of video, podcasts, ande-books. All content is completely free and meant to educate the masses. We alsohave a partnership with Concordia University's Sustainable InvestmentProfessional Certification (SIPC). ImpactU.fund is a crowdfunding portal that enables our citizens to vote with their dollar to positively impact the world. The portal will feature ImpactOrganizations and Entrepreneurial Projects that will have an ESG impact along-side returns. It's my goal to help new clients to create an impact portfolio. For clients who have existing investments, one strategy is to divest from non-impact invest-ments which is a surprisingly easy process that all starts with a conversation. I know that with Vanderbilt's support behind me, my efforts to supply my clients with the best investment solutions to generate positive benefits to our envi-ronment and society will only continue to be improved and innovated. I aim to pro-vide my clients with a customized approach that will allow me to ensure individ-ual and tailored financial advice specific to each person's unique needs, goals andvalues.

Growing up, I was a cheerleader and tumbler. In my mid 20s, I wanted to clean up my diet and exercise. Itwas then I found my passion for movement. What is your background/training? I stumbled upon the Lotte Berk Method in New YorkCity as I was answering a help wanted ad in the VillageVoice. I knew nothing about it, but instantly fell in lovewith the feminine, yet challenging workout. Explain what Barre is: Barre comes in many shapes and forms these days as ithas grown wildly in the mass market and abroad. Generally, barre is based on strength moves taken from modern and classical dance,Pilates, and orthopedic stretching. What makes doing exercise with a neutral spine as in Barre a unique exercise style? ost barre, especially barre from Lotte Berk Method, is not taught with a neu- tral spine. My studies of movement and anatomy led me to take the \"tucked\" pelvisout of my method in order to maintain the natural curves of the spine. I feel that ingeneral, this is safer overall for the client. Keeping the pelvis in the right placeallows it to support the pelvic floor muscles. It also will not compress the front (ante-rior) of the lumbar spine. The \"pull in and tuck under\" mantra of so many barre andgroup classes also encourages breath holding. This is a problem. I think of it like themore natural or neutral you are through movement, the more the oxygenated bloodcan circulate throughout because you are breathing and aligned. How does this exercise style b enefit the b ody? What does putting the b ody back into proper alignment do and how does it affect mental wellness and cognitive abilities? I believe that physically and mentally, if an exercise is done in the right form and alignment where you are challenged but also able to be and breathe, thebody will stay safe and change, and the mind will get refreshed and relieved fromdaily stresses. I teach from such a foundational level to set up my moves well andthen remind clients of form throughout, that often, people who have, say, rheuma-toid arthritis, adrenal fatigue, or fibromyalgia, benefit. My workouts do not poundpavement. They are non-punishing. They are energizing. Therefore, I am excited tohear success stories often. How did you \"invent\" BarreAmped? BarreAmped\u00ae came together after years of teaching barre and other styles of fitness. While I credit Lotte Berk Method with my barre education, I desired tosee more attention on the backside of the body (ie, posterior chain), more neutralalignment, and more \"feel-good\" cardio intervals. BarreAmped\u00ae has evolvedover the years. I am sure it will continue to. Explain the benefits behind rebounding...why is it an excellent form of exer- cise? (When I did your DVD on the Jumpsport, I found my back pain immediately went away, why is that??) Rebounding is amazing. It's my happy place. It's fun! But you need to have a good trampoline, so I chose JumpSport\u00ae after much research. When I real-ized I could add a handle bar to it that actually holds bodyweight, I immediatelytook my method to it. Since my method is taught with form and precision, put-ting it on the dynamic surface of the trampoline with mini bounce breaks, Ibelieve the benefits are endless. The time you need to work out is shortened, themuscles that otherwise wouldn't activate are awakened on the trampoline, andthe fact is, it's more challenging in a fun way. As for your back not hurting, I amso happy to hear that! It could be the strength moves that have an emphasis on theposterior chain which I know we need to focus on in our modern times. (I wantus to be less ab-centric and more balanced from front to back). Maybe it could bethe bouncing on a supportive mat and with elastic cording. Or it could be thatyour lower body muscles along with your core muscles were awakened and acti-vated in a way that took pressure off your back. While some trends in fitnessshow the more extreme is better, there is also the growing trend that less impact,less pounding, less punishing is actually better. Therefore, someone with a kneeissue or someone who is pregnant might be able to do BarreAmped\u00ae Bounce asopposed to some of the more choreographed or intense rebounding workouts. Isay to choose wisely. Words of advice for our readers? My advice is to choose everything you do well. With exercise, consider if what you are doing is energizing, uplifting, and healthy. Will it help you age well?Walk more. And breathe. What other causes are you engaged in? My one desire is to help end human trafficking. My company supports NightLight Bangkok which helps women get out of prostitution rings and intogood jobs. I want women to know they are valued and seen.

We general-ly are aware that taking care of our heart is one of the bestthings we can do to ensure better overall health and qual-ity of life. But there is relatively little public understand-ing of one key component to our heart health - a singlemolecule called nitric oxide (abbreviated \"NO\"). There'sgood reason for people to get \"in the know,\" so to speak, about NO - as maintaining healthy levels can make a big difference in your well-being. Medicine has only relatively recently begun to understand nitric oxide and its effects. In 1998, scientists won the Nobel Prize for Medicine for their workon the role of NO in the cardiovascular system. The molecule helps to keep ourarteries elastic - allowing for better blood and oxygen flow, helping to maintainlower blood pressure and reducing the chances of clots or blockages. Our bodies naturally produce nitric oxide, but as we age that function (like so many others) slows down and we don't produce as much. Other factorsthat can negatively impact nitric oxide production include high cholesterol,smoking, obesity and poor diet. Nitric oxide is so important to our overall health that the body has a few different ways of producing the molecule. The good news is that there are wayswe can kick start these natural systems to boost our nitric oxide levels and enjoythe resulting health benefits. Here are some tips: * Exercise: studies show that aerobic exercise increases NO production. In fact, studies show that highly trained athletes tend to maintain higher levelsof nitric oxide. For those of us who don't keep up elite athletic training - most ofus - getting active can boost our NO levels. Exercise that elevates your heart rateand increases your muscles' demand for oxygen and other nutrients helps to trig-ger nitric oxide production. Thirty minutes a day of moderate exercise, like abrisk walk, jog or cycling is a great way enhance NO production. * Eat Nitrate-Rich Vegetables: Perhaps the single most important factor in NO production is what you eat. One of the ways the human body makes NOis through our digestive system - converting nitrates from our diet into nitrites,then to nitric oxide. A diet full of nitrate-rich foods helps trigger this system.Nitrate-rich foods often fall in the leafy greens category: kale, collard greens,spinach, and arugula are some examples. Root vegetables like carrots, rhubarband particularly beets are also high in nitrates. * Use a Supplement: As a doctor, I know that behavior change is diffi- cult, and maintaining a special diet or an exercise program can be an obstacleto promoting cardiovascular health. Busy schedules, physical ailments, age andpersonal food tastes are just some of the factors that impact how effective weare at sticking to a healthy routine. A daily supplement with proven ingredi-ents can be a good solution. There is a new product widely available at drugstores, Berkeley Life Heart Health, which is based on the scientific findingsabout a nitrate-rich plant-based diet. The tablets contain the same bio-activesas those found in nitrate-rich plants, including leafy green vegetables. (Twopills contain the nitrate equivalent of more than a quarter pound of spinach.)This type of supplement is a convenient way to keep NO production steadyand, for some, may even function effectively as a drug-free way to support ahealthy blood pressure. How do you know if the above steps could improve your heart health? If you have some of the risk factors for diminished nitric oxide production - areaging, have a sedentary lifestyle, don't maintain a healthy plant-rich diet orhave high blood pressure or cholesterol - it's worth checking your NO levels. Until recently, it's been difficult for the average person to get a read of their own nitric oxide levels. But now there is a simple test strip, Berkeley Test,available over the counter (and in packs of the company's heart health supple-ments.) The strips make it possible to test how the changes you make in yourdaily routine - diet, exercise or supplementation - impact your overall nitricoxide levels. One of the most exciting aspects of my practice of lifestyle medicine is seeing important scientific discoveries eventually result in practical, everydayapplications that dramatically improve patient health. Deepening under-standing of nitric oxide, getting in the \"NO\", may have a profound impact onthe heart health conversation - both in general, and between you and your doc-tor.

Understanding the sun protection factor , or SPF , is crucial to ensure correct application. The SPF rating is a measure of the fraction of sunburn-producing UV rays that will reach the skin. For exam-ple, SPF 30 means that 1/30th of the burning radiationwill reach the skin. To determine the effectiveness ofsunscreen multiply the SPF factor by the length oftime it takes for an individual to burn without sun-screen. It is also important to remember that the high-er the number on the sunscreen doesn't mean that itwill remain on the skin any longer than the SPF witha lower number and it must be continually applied asdirected. \u0081 CLOTHING CHOICE- One should wear loosefitted, light weight and light colored clothing whenexercising in the sun. The light color will help reflectthe sun, the light weight material will aid in quickevaporation of sweat and the loose fit will allow forair to circulate between the skin and the material. \u0081 TIME OF DAY- If possible, complete all stren-uous exercise in the morning or the evening. The sunis strongest from 11 a.m. until about 3 p.m., so unlessyou are training for an event that will take place dur-ing the mid-afternoon heat, avoid training duringthose times. Exercising outside can be great, but not if we ignore what our bodies are telling us. Great benefitsand success can be seen in warm weather workouts aslong as you listen to your body and follow the abovetips!

During the summer, there are many addedbenefits to an outdoorworkout to include pro-duction of vitamin D3when the sunlight which isimportant bone tension due toenjoying ones workoutoutside, and savingmoney on those monthly gym memberships. On the other hand it is impor-tant to remember that exercising in the heat, if youare not prepared, can be dangerous. Below aresome tips to remember to ensure a safe workoutwhen exercising outside this summer. \u0081 PREHYDATE, HYDRATE AND REHY-DRATE- Our bodies crave water! This becomesespecially true during periods of high intensityactivity or extended heat exposure. Water con-sumption should begin 72 hours before activity bydrinking six to eight, 8-ounce glasses of water perday. During activity, one should drink six ouncesof fluid (preferably water) every 15 minutes andshould then rehydrate following activity with 32ounces of liquid per 1 pound of fluid loss.\u0081 WARM UP: Just because it is warm out-side does not mean that your body is 'warmed up'and ready to go. Complete a proper warm up forthe type of exercise program that you will be fol-lowing that day. Readying the body, or increasingblood flow to the muscle, in the form of dynamicstretches as well as plyometrics, will \"warm up\"the body's musculature and in turn sidelining injury (i.e.strains and sprains). \u0081 COOL DOWN: A cool down following atraining session should be gradual and is asimportant as a proper warm up. When coming tothe end of a workout, slow down your pace orintensity for a 3-5 minute period, allowing yourheart rate and blood pressure to graduallydecrease at a more natural pace to minimize therisk of a fainting episode. Static stretching follow-ing exercise, while your muscles are still warm,will help reduce the build-up of lactic acid, whichleads to muscle cramping and stiffness. \u0081 START OUT SLOW: We all know the pop-ular saying that \"Rome wasn't built in a day\" andwe need to remember to apply that same thoughtprocess to our bodies as well. Physiologically, ittakes the body six weeks to gain any type ofincrease in muscle endurance and strength nomatter how many hours you spent working out orhow many pounds you lifted in one day. If you area beginner, begin training with shortened sessionsand lower weights and gradually progress and ifyou are returning to your exercise program after along absence don't jump back in where you leftoff; scale back your workout and apply the samegradual progression as that of a beginner.\u0081 CROSS-TRAIN: Most people continuous-ly do the same type of workout with the same rep-etitions, resistance and rate because they are com-fortable with it. As we have learned from researchover the years, the body needs to be placed underdifferentiating demands to prevent the dreadedplateau and to reach advanced physiological lev-els. It is my recommendation to cross-train, orswitch up your workout routines, aerobically withdifferent cardiovascular formats such as cycling,running and swimming and anaerobically, withresistive training utilizing different body move-ments, repetitions and weights. Switching fromaerobic to anaerobic type exercises every other dayand incorporating your rest days will be your keyto success!\u0081 USE SUNSCREEN- Although the sun hasgreat benefits, it can be dangerous if we don't If you own a wholistic, progressive company and you would like to reach more people on the internet....

It's used widely by most famous FrenchNaturopath and experienced clay therapistRaymond Dextreit. This natural volcanic ash clay,obtained from a sub-surface mine in Californiaand possessing potent healing properties thathave NOT being contaminated by air or watersince its has been sealed by zeolite minerals forforty-three million years. Bentonite Clay is adietary supplement and when mixed with water,adsorbs positively charged toxins (heavy metals-mercury in the metal fillings, cancer causing freeradicals, pesticides like Roundup) like stickypaper and then absorbs these toxins, by drawingthem inside of the clay molecules like a porouskitchen sponge. Bentonite clay also boosts theimmune system by keeping viruses, fungus andbacteria out of the body as well as balancing thepH in the mouth, a key factor to keeping cavity-causing bacteria at bay and a must have for a per-fect digestion. \"Clay works on the entire organ-ism. No part of the body is left untouched by itshealing energies,\" says clay expert RanKnishinsky. But most importantly, the detoxifying heavy metal effect found in Calcium BentoniteClay starts to work directly from the mouth.Whether you are in the process of removing yourmercury fillings, already finished the removal orare just contemplating the process, any time is agood time to start your full body detoxificationprocess.

Essential Oils: Possesses highest antioxi- dant properties. Across Europe, India and Asia, itis a popular and ancient practice to ingest essen-tial oils and use them internally. Doctors and othermedical practitioners in those countries often pre-scribe the ingestion of essential oils to heal ormanage health issues and to bolster immunity.

With low bioavailability, the risk of developingsystemic toxicity is very low in dogs. Once the effects wane,the dog's liver metabolizes the cannabidiol and eliminatesit via the urine or bile in a sustained and safe manner. Thismight be the possible reason for achieving immediate butprolonged therapeutic response in CBD-treated animals. Over 61% to 95% of pet owners believe that CBD treats have offered \"moderate to excellent\" improvementsin their pet's health conditions. Some conditions helped byCBD Oil include pain, digestive and nervous systemissues, inflammation, anxiety, nausea and/or vomiting,tumors, seizures/convulsions, skin problems and phobias. It has been shown that cannabinoids can alleviate rheumatoid pain in humans. While dogs don't sufferrheumatoid arthritis, they do suffer from osteoarthritis(OA), a bone and joint disease that occurs as a result of jointwear-and-tear. OA can cause neuropathic pain, for whichcannabinoids can be helpful. Veterinary marijuana use has caught the interest of the scientific community and public, but, THC-contain-ing cannabis still remains a Schedule I drug criminalizedby the Federal government even though several states havelegalized it. This is why clinicians, medical and veterinaryresearchers have been fearful to conduct collaborativeresearch studies. Fortunately, encouraging research evidence is now surfacing that is helpful to gain public acceptance, and sev-eral independent organizations are demanding medicalmarijuana legalization across the globe. Marijuana advo-cates have petitioned the Drug EnforcementAdministration to whichhas been unsuccessful thus far. Prakash Janakiraman is a biomedical researcher and medical writer with extensive experience in pharma-cology, molecular oncology, stem cells science and clinicaltrials. He authored medical textbooks and several researchpublications in peer-reviewed medical journals.

The activation of thesereceptors with phytocannabinoidscould be helpful in treating underly-ing disease and imbalance.Cannabinoids, particularly cannabidi- ol (CBD), has the potential to treat various medicalissues in a non-toxic way. You may wonder if giving CBD to your beloved dog, cat, bird, small mammal or reptile friendis safe. Does it work? Is it really effective? Yes, yes andyes! THC, the psychoactive chemical in marijuana,may be harmful for pets, but CBD oil does not containTHC and no study has ever shown CBD to have neg-ative side-effects. More CBD products are making their way to your pet store. They include capsules, pure extracts,treats, food sprinkles, ointments and more. They areTHC-free, completely non-psychoactive and nontoxicto pets. These products are derived from hemp, insteadof marijuana. CBD oil is pure hemp plant's seeds and foilage. Themanufacturers don't make any therapeutic claimsbecause cannabinoid use has not been fully integratedinto most veterinary practices yet. CBD Oil supplements and edibles can safely treat inflammation, pain, seizures, neurodegenerativediseases, arthritis, cancer and palliative care. Most petowners don't want to see their pets suffer with inoper-able or late stage cancer, or with severe arthritis.Painful conditions can cause loss of appetite whichleads to muscle wasting further complicating yourpet's condition. CBD Oil helps improve quality of lifefor your pet through all life stages. For years, canine diseases have typically been treated with synthetic veterinary drugs. Pain medica-tions and steroids whether for human or animal use,have serious side-effects. Certain drugs can cause liverand kidney damage and yet, they are routinely pre-scribed by veterinarians simply because they remainunaware of CBD Oil's therapeutic benefits. Supplementing with CBD can decrease anxi- ety associated with separation, thunderstorms/fire-crackers, car travel and veterinarian visits. CBD Oilalso boosts your pet's immune system, reducesseizures and alleviates pain associated with many con-ditions including recovery from surgery. Studies have shown that the endocannabi- noid system and supplementing with cannabinoidscan prevent immune-mediated and inflammatoryallergic disorders, including skin problems in dogs.Another study has concluded that CBD has anticon-vulsant and with to Phenytoin andPhenobarbital, the conventional anticonvulsant drugs. Both the research evidence and the testimoni- als of the pet owners appear to be encouraging.Veterinary research studies to optimize safe and effec-tive doses of CBD for various medical conditions andfor different kinds of pet companions are quite diffi-cult to conduct. Additionally, these studies are expen-sive. The available pharmacological data on animals isscarce. Unlike humans, dogs metabolize cannabinoidsin a different way than humans. In dogs, 2-AG and anandamide are the pri- mary messenger cannabinoids. These chemicals acti-vate CB1 and CB2 receptors in the brain, organs andnervous system. Being an agonist, CBD weakly bindsto these receptors for a longer duration, evoking along-lasting therapeutic response without toxic effects. After intravenous infusion, CBD distribution was reported to be rapid, followed by prolonged elim-ination with a terminal half-life of 9 hours. The totalbody clearance may take up to about 17 hours afteradministration.

Whatever adapta-tions we employed in our vulnerability usually carry for-ward to adult situations which remind us of our childhoodpowerlessness. So it is no surprise that our childhood adap-tations are evoked in situations of polar extremes we see incurrent events. This goes along with the \" us versus them\"tone in the political arena. Because this view is an earlierdevelopmental adaptation we are somehow locked in moreprimitive reactions. We can grow past this and become more effectual in relationships ( and in society ) by keeping ideal goalsand relationship visions in sight. We must use inoculationtheory on ourselves and keep greater social good fiercely inmind. If, for instance, we don't believe in blaming a givengroup for our problems we must be ready to defend themwhen policies target or scapegoat that group. We are thefirst line advocates and must initiate a united front to pro-tect those who need protection. We are tasked with holdingmore firmly to our beliefs, and have responsibility to our-selves and others first an foremost, which, in the end, iswhat adulthood is all about. We will become stronger for it.Growth is empowering.

It wouldn't be taking a huge risk tosay over the past year our relation-ships with family and friends havebeen affected and punctuated bythe political climate. Although thereis a tendency to notice the noise ofnegative reactions including fearand anger, feeling threatened,ignored and hopeless, truly there isan equal amount of happiness and relief for those whose beliefs are supported and fearsallayed by the new political climate. As much as welike the security of categories and labels painting oneview as right and another view as wrong, this is howwe succumb, on either end, to simplistic and victim-ization style thinking. It's important to be carefulabout such concrete thinking because when we stopbeing discerning and analytical we replicate in ourbehavior exactly what we criticize and find abhorrentin another, except to the opposite extreme. This is notonly true in politics, but in human nature and rela-tionships. In 1961 social psychologist William J McGuire developed the concept of Inoculation Theory whichsought to explain how attitudes and beliefs changeand, more pressingly, how to keep our cherished corebeliefs from changing despite pressure and shifts insocietal thinking. The theory asserts that it is impor-tant to preserve one's core beliefs in times of masscounter-thinking and counter-arguments because theyencapsulate our intrinsic values about what is rightand what it means to be a solid citizen. When politicaland leadership shifts occur and the messages wereceive conflict with our beliefs, it is possible for us toslowly and inadvertently adjust our thinking becausewe are bombarded with messages that challenge thesebeliefs. Inoculation theory suggests that the way tocounteract persuasive swaying of core values is to peri-odically self-check, self-examine and prepare for thesechallenges. It is not a reactive and fearful approachbecause it prepares and strengthens ( inoculates ) usfor potential challenges to our beliefs. Liken it topreparing for a dissertation defense or courtroom crossexamination. If one is prepared for potential chal-lenges, one can have a ready response. I knew a recre-ational pilot, for example, who practiced many simu-lated contingencies and potential emergencies as partof his training so that a preconditioned response wasavailable to him in any of several scenarios. In this waya combination of instinct and preparedness offered adegree of inoculation and readiness. How does this help us in a very divided coun- try? Doesn't it sound like a more polarizing approachto disagreements? No, in actuality it does not. We areincreasingly a split and oppositional society becausethere is encouragement to uphold the \" us againstthem \" divisiveness. We are stuck in a reactive modebecause we receive many messages about not trusting\"them\", and few messages about working together,feeling empathy for those in need, and considering thecommonalities we share about what it means to pre-serve and defend a just society. Inoculation theory, ifused as a mindfulness approach to understanding oneanother, would help us avoid the need for an enemy.Most of us are interested in preserving the good of ourcountry and operate from a position of being the bestwe can be in our personal and public lives. This concept parallels our interpersonal rela- tionships. Often we respond to external situationssuch as work environments and political movementsbased on what gets triggered within us from our earlylives. Our responses to authority figures can mirror ourfeelings about a domineering and volatile parent or apassive and ineffectual one. If we had a domineeringone perhaps we learned to adapt by deferring to his or WHAT'S MISSING FROM THE HEALTH CARE DEBATE and 80s, the scapegoat was the greedy physician who charged too much and ordered too many services. Thesolutions were HMOs and physician networks that pro-vided a discounted fee for service. This was followed byfee schedules imposed by the insurer on hospitals andphysician networks in the 1990s. In 2000, the scapegoatshifted to the population of the U.S. that exercised too lit-tle, ate the wrong foods and made poor healthcare choic-es. The solution to that was government regulation of what we eat and what we drink. The current scapegoatis the cost of pharmaceuticals. To control that cost, theinsurers have created pharmacy benefit managers(PBMs). While the initial purpose of the PBMs was tonegotiate discounts on pharmaceuticals from the pharma-ceutical manufacturers and pass those savings on to theconsumer, the role of the PBMs has morphed into one inwhich they determine which drugs the consumer shouldbe allowed to use to maximize insurer profit. The choice of a scapegoat is not a substitute for analysis. All of these approaches chosen by the insurershave not worked to contain cost. It is time that we demandan analysis that the insurers will never undertake-ananalysis of their role in driving healthcare costs higher.Costs per person in 1980 were $1,180 per year. Costs perperson in 2016 have exceeded $10,000 per year. The oneconstant is the management of healthcare delivery. Weneed an accounting of what that management is actuallycosting us. Given the salaries of healthcare managers, it islikely that this cost exceeds the cost of our healthcare. Ifthis proves to be true, then it is time that we abandon themanagement of healthcare delivery, restore the doctor-patient relationship and allow our doctors to resume pro-viding care unfettered by insurer interference.

For more by Steve Trobiani MDFew topics generate more heated debate than healthcare.While there is agreement overthe universal need for health-care, opinions on how to pro-vide that are widely divided.Those who believe that health-care is a right argue for a \"single payer system\". Those who believe that healthcare isan individual obligation, oppose governmentinvolvement and argue that competition will controlcost. The only true consensus is that nothing we havetried has worked. What unites both sides of the healthcare debate is cost. There is universal agreement that costsneed to be contained. Yet there has been no analysisof what is driving those costs. Instead, supporters ofa \"single payer system\" assume it will be less costlythan the purchase of healthcare coverage from com-mercial insurers. In making this assumption, thosearguing for a \"single payer system\" turn a blind eyeto our current government-supplied healthcare pro-grams. The V A is the only current system in which the government directly provides healthcare. Costs inthe V A system are high and there is widespreadagreement that the system has largely failed to servethe needs of our veterans. Since 1996, the federal gov-ernment has outsourced the administration ofMedicare to the very insurers that the \"single payer\"proponents oppose. The state governments havedone the same with Medicaid. \"Medicare for all\"would consequently change nothing. Yes, we wouldno longer pay the insurers directly. I nstead, the federal and state governments collect paymentfrom us through taxes. The federal and state bureau-cracies pay themselves from those taxes. The remain-ing funds are then distributed to the very same insur-ers the \"single payer\" proponents oppose. Thesesame insurers will continue to pay their executiveshandsomely and will still determine what we as con-sumers are allowed by way of healthcare. These sameinsurers will continue to seek and receive increasedrevenue from the federal and state governments tocover rising healthcare costs. We as consumers willcontinue to pay more for our healthcare throughincreased out-of-pocket expenses such as higher co-pays and deductibles, fewer covered tests and proce-dures, and rising taxes to meet the demands of thehealth insurers. When I began my medical career in the 1970s, I was trained to take a careful history and per-form an exam in order to establish a diagnosis. I wasalso trained to then order what diagnostic tests Ineeded in order to confirm that diagnosis beforeembarking on any course of treatment. With theintroduction of the management of healthcare deliv-ery in the late 1970s and early 1980s, doctors wereencouraged to skip the diagnostic tests and gostraight to treatment in order to contain cost. It seemsthat now we are being encouraged to skip most of thehistory and all of the exam and jump directly to treat-ment. Anyone who has found his or her doctor visitlimited to the 5-6 minutes currently allowed can attestto this. What has occurred in the healthcare debate over the last 40 years is similar, and for good reason.The same insurers who have steered physicians awayfrom diagnostic evaluation toward algorithms for thetreatment of symptoms have also controlled thedirection of the healthcare debate. There has conse-quently been no analysis of why healthcare costs arespiraling out of control. Instead, we confine the dis-cussion to what form of treatment we should employto remedy our ailing healthcare system. This does not mean that the insurers have failed to provide convenient scapegoats.
