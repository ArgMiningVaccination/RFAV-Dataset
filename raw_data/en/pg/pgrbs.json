The previous editions were published in 2005, 2009 and 2013, respectively. The objective s of the guideline are: To inform about basic considerations to be taken in planning and construction of potable water systems offshore, without covering all technical details. To guide personnel in the operation, control and maintenance of offshore potable water systems to ensur e a safe potable water supply . The guideline gathers information for in dustry, authorities and specialists in relevant fields from the Norwegian Institute of Public Health (NIPH) . The authorities may, based on relevant regulations, give other requireme nts than those proposed in this guideline. The guideline is available on the NIPH offshore web pages: www.fhi.no/offshore , and will be upda ted regularly. C omments can be sent to folkehelseinstituttet@fhi.no Working with potable water brings you in contact with many specialist fields, such as environmental health protection, technical disciplines, law and medicine. Chapters 1 to 4 contain general infor mation a bout regulations, system management and water quality. The remain ing chap ters cover the design, operation, and maint enance of various components of the potable water system. This guideline has been revised by Eyvind Andersen. We emphasise the follow ing changes: The NIPH no longer works for the County Governor of Rogaland. Chapter 2 has been revised accordingly. Section 2.4 is revised, as the Norwegian Maritime Authority ( NMA) potable water regulations section 2.3 now refer s to the Norwegian Food Safe ty Authority ( FSA) list of approved additives for potable water. Chemicals previously found on the NIPH list of certified products are now included on the FSA list. Norwegian approval is no longer required for coatings used in potable water tanks, see sections 2.4, 9.1.4 and 9.2.6. I nstead , the NMA potable water regulations section 7.3 and 4 has much stricter requirements for documentation when choosing and applying such products. Section 3 emphasi ses that conducting a Haz - ard Analysis and defining Critical Con trol Points is a requirement both acc ording to the NMA potable water r egulations section 5 and the Law on Food. Section 4.4 contains recommendations to avoid the wrong design of test taps. In section 4.5 the consequences of the margin of error for the colour measuring equipment is discussed . The alkaline filter in the design example on figure s 5.1 has been moved. This to illustrate the need to avoid long distances between water production units and the alkaline filter. Such treatment is rarely needed for bunkered Norwegian water. The circulation inlet in the design example in figure 5.1 and 7.3 has been moved. This to illustrate that the best location of the inlet may be different when bunkering to an \"empty\" tank compared to circulation of a full tank. The same chlorine tank may be used if it is located near to both pipes. For units operating in warm climates, and for units that have problems with growth of biofilm, a system for continuous chlorination (or other water treatment) to reduce the risk for biofilm and Legionella is described in sections 5.1 and 9.2.11. Ref. new requirements in the NMA potable water r egula tions sections 7.1 and 11.2: For new mobile offshore units it is recommended to have clos eable seawater inlets for water production. T hese inlets should not be connected to the same sea chests that supply cooling water to machinery and other types of water consumption that may be present close to shore , see sections 5.1 and 6.1.2. I n section s 5.1 and 9.1.2 i t is also recommended to have void spaces or other rooms that do not pose any threat of pollution around potable water tanks. To ensure easy maintenance inside tanks, access platforms for every 4 metres of height are required , see section 9.1.2. Section 9.2.1 is supplemented with desi gn advice to avoid unnecessary maintenance and with more detailed information on piping Safe, Sufficient and Good Potable Water Offshore 4 dimensioning, including reference to NS -EN 806-3, se also NMA potable water regulati ons section 10. Section 9.2.4 contains information about expansio n vessels for hot water systems and information about balanc ing the system flow to ensure sufficient temperatures on all floors. Section 9.2.7 on L egionella prevention is supplement ed with advice about the risk assessment of systems according to the requirements in the environmental health protection regulations . Information on water treatment methods is also revised. The recommended testing pro gram me in ap - pendix 4 is revised. Chromium and nickel are recommended to be analysed on new offshore units. Chemical oxygen demand/ total organic carbon and UV transmission have been suggested removed from the programme. Appendices 12 and 13 have been supplemen - ted with information on alternative methods for cleaning and disinfection. The NIPH wants to express thanks for input to the guideline to: Frode Andersen, thanks to Catrine Ahl\u00e9n and Yvonne Putzig who made the draft of the chapter on pot able water systems on diving vessels; and to Sam Sutherland for valuable input to the English version. The guideline was translated by Rigmor Paulsen (NIPH), with 2 nd, 3rd and 4th edition chan ges by Eyvind And ersen . 4th edition has been proofread by Julie Whittle Johansen. If discrepan cies occur, the Nor wegian version takes pre cedence.

W hen good water sources are cho - sen, the waterworks treatment plant is worki ng optimally and the routines for operation, control and maintenance are the very best, the result is good potable water. If one level fails , safety is affected. The quality requirements apply t o all Nor wegian potable water sup plies , included on ships and on offshore units on the Norwegian continental shelf : Potable water is expected to be hygieni cal- ly safe, clear and without any speci fic smell, taste or col our. It shall not contain physic al, chemical nor bi ological components that can lead to any health hazard in common use. T he regulations require hygienic barriers against all physical, chemical and micro biologi cal pollution that could possibly affect the potable water supply. Multiple safety barri ers ensure that the potable water re mains safe, even i f one barrier fails, due to human or technical error. Groups with different skills co -operate to run po- table water systems offshore. To avoid prob lems and mis under stand ings, it is important that these groups \"talk the same language \" and have access to relevant information. Failure in an off shore potable water system is normally caused by human error or inadequate operation systems. Technical failure is rarely the cause of seri ous problems. Even the best systems can deliver poor water quality if operation systems are infer ior, while a technically weaker system can deliv er safe and good potable water when run by dedi - cated personnel . Internal control, including suff - icient routines for training personnel and opera - tion of the s ystem, is crucial to ensure that the system functions adequately over time . 1.2 How to use the guideline The guideline can be used as a complete referen - ce book, or to solve specific problems. 1.2.1 Guideline status Authorities are detailed in section 2.1. T he pot - able w ater r egulations , see 2.2, define the requi - rements that must be follow ed during the design and operation of potable water system s offshore. This guideline is prepared by the NIPH , and con - tains our best advice, based on the regulation requirements and on our experience from off - shore inspections, research and report s from the offshore industry . The guidelines to the Norwegian off shore health , safety and environmental r egula tions (on the Petro leum Safety Authority Norway web -page www.ptil.no ) refer to our guideline when it comes to building and op erating potable water systems offshore . Our advice will there fore be a key element in defi ning necessary s afety requi re- ments , based on regulation requi the HSE regulations and the potable water regula ti- ons. In the guideline we have tried to only state the regulations ' requirements. In addition we give advice on good practi ce, where the regulations allow for use of various solutions. If the guide - line states requirements that appear not to be defined in the r egulations, please let us know . Therefore, examples about solutions and attached checklist s must not be interpreted as absolute require ments. Each comp any must use its own judge ment when decidin g the need for equipment, opera tion routines and supervision in their specific activity. 1.2.2 Guideline application Before planning water supply systems on new offshore units , everyone involvedshould read the guideline to ens ure the best solu tion. In the long term, this will give the best results with regard to quality, operation and cost. Use of the design checklist in appendix 1, and the checklist for control systems in appendix 2, cannot compen- sate for a thorough study of the guideline, but is meant to be used after the planning process, to ensure that solutions chosen are adequate. The guideline may be used as a reference book, to be consulted in daily operations, when rele- vant information is not available in the unit's Safe, Sufficient and Good Potable Water Offshore 8 management system . The guideline may also be used in potable water education for offshore personnel. 1.3 Definitions Acknowledgement of Compliance (AoC) : A statement from the Petroleum Safety Authority Norway that a mobile offshore unit both technically and with regard t o organisation and the management system is deemed to be in accordance with relevant Norwegian offshore regulations. Hygienic barriers: Natural or manmade hindrance or other measures that reduce risks, remov e or inactivate pathogenic microbes or dilute, br eak down, destroy or remove chemical and physical components to a level where the substances no longer represent any health hazard. Hygienically safe potable water: Potable water that contains neither physical, chemical nor microbiological components , thus avoiding short or long -term health hazards. Letter of Compliance (LOC): A document issued by the NMA confirm ing that a foreign - registered offshore unit com plies with all technical requirements specified by the N MA and its affiliated supervisory authorities. Microbes: Microorganisms such as amoebas, bacteria, parasites, fung i and virus es. NMA: Norwegian Maritime Authority. Offshore unit: Installation s and equipment for petroleum activity, but not supply - and auxiliary vesse ls, or petroleum bulk carr iers. Potable water: All types of water, treated or untreated, designated for drinking, cooking or other household purposes, regardless of its origin or whether it is delivered through a distribution system, from supply vessels, from bottles or other pack aging. Potable water systems offshore (figure 1.1): The system normally consists of the following elements: water sources, seawater inlet, water producing systems, bunke ring stations, treatment units, water tanks, piping, taps, calorifiers and operation routines. Potable water tests : Analyses taken from the potable water as an in -house control measure, and in adjusting the operation of the potable water system, including analyses performed when bunkering potable water. Simple and extended routine contr ol: Routine control analyses of potable water should be sent to an accredited mainland laboratory and used to document that the operation of the potable water system has proven adequate and as an inst rument for making operational improvements.

Regulations and authorities (Revised as per 1st September 2016 ) Potabl e water in the Norwegian petroleum acti v- ities is governed by: Regulations of 12th February 2010 No. 158 on health , safety and the environment in the petroleum activities and at certain onshore facilities (Framework regulations with underlying regulations on management, activities and facilitie s, from now on referred to as the HSE regulations ) Regulations of 4th December 2001 No: 1372 on potable water (referred to as the potable water regulations , under revision) Regulations of 4th December 2015 No: 1406 on potable water and potable water systems on mobile offshore units (referred to as the NMA potable water regulations) . 2.1 Authorities The Petroleum Safety Authority Norway (PSA) , The Norwegian Environment Agency , The Nor - wegian Board of Health Supervision (BHS) and the Norwegian Food Safet y Authority (FSA) , or person/insti tution given supervisory authority by these orga nisations , will assess whether offshore industry ad heres to the health, safety and envi r- onment requirements . The P SA co-ordinates sup - ervisory activities on off shore units. The County Governor of Rogaland ( CGR ) is respons ible for the supervision of health and hygiene mat ters on behalf of the BHS . The FSA has authority accord ing for food legislation but has dele gated the offshore supervision work to the CG R. Some mobile offshore units have maritime certi- ficates from the NMA. The NIPH advi ses the NMA on matters related to potable water on mobile offshore units with a Norwegian flag . 2.2 Regulations For potable water issues, the HSE regulations refer to t he potable water regulations . Regulati - ons concer ning potable water systems and potable water supp ly on mobile offshore units, apply to units that have a Norwegian flag , but such units must also adhere to the HSE regulations when operating on the Norweg ian continental shelf . Foreign offshore units that follow section 3 in the HSE regulations may also follow technical requirements in the NMA potable water regulations, see the guidelines to section 3. Table 2.1 is a summary of existing regulations and sugg ested standards. 2.2.1 Potable Water Regulations The potable w ater r egulations are in accordance with the EU r egulations for potable water. The regulations apply to units operating on the Nor w- egian conti nental shelf . The NIPH has made an analys is progr amme for pot able wat er on offsho- re units, see 4.3. The programme has been desig - ned to accommo date the require ments of the potable w ater regulations. These regu lations are under revision, and the new regu lations expected in 2017 may have different requirements. 2.2.2 HS E Regulations For offshore units on the Norwegian continental shelf, t he HSE regulations apply. Practical water supply offshore differs somewhat from onshore systems, and the HSE regulations are used to de - tail the potable water regulations requirements. The HSE regulations give general require ments about function and contain no details about de- sign and operation. However , in the comments to the regulations, standards are spe cified. Accord - ing to the Framework Regula tions \u00a7 24 these stand ards must be followed, or the alterna tive soluti ons chosen must be proven to be at least as safe. The complete HSE regulations cover potable water but not all of it is equally relevant. The most important points are: The Framework Regulat ions are the basis for the health, safety and environment work. The object clause requires health, safety and environment lev els to be the very best and main tained by sys tematic work and constant improve ment. Chapter II gives the basic prin - ciples t o be as follows: All health, safety and environment matters should be adequately taken care of and hazards reduced to a mini - mum. Orga nisation and level of competence should be satisfactory and according to require ments. The Management Regulations pose important requi rements to the design process such as Safe, Sufficient and Good Potable Water Offshore 10 hazard reduction , barriers, planning and analyses. The Facilities Regulations pose general re- quirements to design and equipment, such as top-level security, ergonomics and uncom pli- cated and stu rdy design. \u00a7 61 states that the design should be in accordance with re quire- ments in the Activities Regulations and the potable w ater regulations . Specific de sign requi rements are not defined. Com ments to this pa ragraph refer to design solutions in the guideline issued by the NIPH. The Activities Regulations cover perform an- ce of activities on the unit. \u00a7 13 states that sufficient supply of good quality potable wat - er is required, and reference is made to the Potable Water Regu lation. Re ference is also made to the guideline pre pared by the NIPH. 2.2.3 NMA Potable Water Regulation s The NMA issues cer tificates for Norwegian mobile offshore units and Letter of Compliance for foreign units . The regula tions have detailed require ments that must be met in design and opera tion of potable water systems. For water quality, t hese regulations also refer to the potable water regulations' requirements. is the licen ce owner's resp onsibility to docu - ment that mobile offshore units on the Nor wegi- an Continental Shelf comply with the requi re- ments of the HSE regulations . A certificate from the NMA may be a practical way to assure this with respect to pota ble water, although this is not a formal solution. 2.2.4 The Law on Food The law on food pr oduction and food safety app - lies to potable water systems and potable water supply on land, ships and offshore units , see 2.1. 2.3 Norwegian Institute of Public Health - functions The NIPH advi ses the NMA on matters related to potable water and potable w ater systems on offshore units with a Norwegian flag . NIPH also provides general advice within this special ist field. T he institute is engaged in the following: 2.3.1 Evaluation of new offshore units for the NMA NIPH advi ses the NMA when evaluating pota ble water system on new builds (figure 2.1). To avoid unnecessary and costly mistakes during construction , the NIPH recommends that the project manager uses the checklist in appen dix 1, evaluate that the project is accord ing to standard, and also that the plans are presented to the NIPH at a design meeting prior to building the system. When the project is near completion, a final sur - vey is made of the unit at the yard. If stan dards are followed, the NIPH will normally ha ve few objections and the NMA can be notified that the NIPH can see no water -related ob jections to the start-up of the unit. Generally , a new inspection is made after one year of opera tion, to check that the system is functioning properly.

Relevant sys tem document ation is compared with the regula tions' requi rements. It is emphasised that internal control systems should find and solve problems to prevent similar problems in the future. 2.4 Product approval The following requirements apply to products f or potable water use: Paints, protective coatings and other materials The potable water regulations state that these products should not pollute the potable water . Norwegian approval is not necessary for such products , see 9.2.6. Potable water treatment chemicals According to the potable water regulations and the NMA potable water regulations section 2.3, water treatment products must be approved by the FSA . A product may only be used if both the product name and manufacturer / supplier is found on the list. Examples of products that need approval inclu de alka line filter material, corrosion - and scale inhibitor in heating circuits, disinfection products, antifreeze products etc. No app roval is necessary for stabilising sand in alkalising filters or activ e carbon filter material, as these prod ucts are not dissolved by water . The l ist of approved products is available on the FSA web site : http://www.mattilsyn et.no/mat_og_vann/vann/van nverk/vannbehandlingskjemikalier.1875 . If approved prod ucts are used as instructed , they are considered safe to use. UV units UV unit s are evaluated by the NIPH to ensure that the unit carries sufficient radiation capacity. Th e units are evaluated for maximum water supply, worst -case water quality and necess ary mainten - ance. If these requirements are not followed, the result is a sense of false security. UV unit require - ments are described under 8.3.2. Figure 2.1: Picture t aken at the shipyard of the Skarv unit (Photo: Eyvind Andersen )Safe, Sufficient and Good Potable Water Offshore 12 3. Management systems The Framework Regulations section 17 state s that \"The responsible party shall establish, follow up and further develop a management system design- ed to ensure compliance with requirements in the health, safety and environment legislation\". In the potable w ater regulations , internal co ntrol is a requirement, and must be tailored to each waterworks . Furthermore, it is a requirement to perform a risk analysis, and to establ ish routines to handle risks, both of which must be kept updated. The NMA has also given r equirements for mana - gement . Regulations of 5 th September 2014 no. 1191 for safety management sys tems apply for mobile offshore units with a Norwe gian flag , and in the NMA potable water regulati ons section 5 there are requirements for a r isk and vulnerability analysis , risk mitigating measures, contingency plans and critical control points (HACCP) . The quality of management of health, safety and environment should be reassessed frequent ly. The management system should be continuously impro ved as a natural consequence of experience, changes in the r egulati ons, system revisions etc. This will minimise the risk to the potable water supply. The management syst em is based on int er- nal control, with emergency prepar edness consid- erations being an integrat ed part of the system. The following main points must be included: 3.1 Potable water documentation The Framework Regulations \u00a7 23 states \"The re- sponsible party shall prepare and retain material and information necessary to ensure and docu m- ent that the activities are planned and carr ied out in a prudent manner \". For potable wat er sys tems it is common to prepare a manual that covers the main documentat ion requi rements men tioned here, but such manuals must be supple ment ed by drawings, periodic al mainten ance systems etc. Potable water manuals are often voluminous doc - uments containing most of the information need ed to run the system, but there are smaller manuals which refer to other doc uments, procedures and systems with more detailed information. The curr - ent trend is that more of the potable wat er docu - mentation is inte grated in company data systems and/or unit documentation systems . Both methods can function well. The important point is that the information is actually used and is easy to update when need ed, and that it is easy to find relevant information both in the daily operation and when problems arise. Even though the forma t of the documentation is not of the greatest importance, numerous con - ditions require documentation. Appendix 2 lists the type of information that ought to be in cluded as a minimum. This documentation must be organi sed in a manner that makes is easy t o find and compile. 3.2 Competence The Framework Regulations \u00a7 12 states \"T he re s- ponsible party shall ensure that everyone who carries out work on its behalf ...has the compe ten- ce necessary to carry out such work in a prudent manner \". Requirements for co mpetence and train - ing are also stated in the potable water regulations. The responsible party decides the degree of trai n- ing needed for personnel within the different dis - ciplines with regard to both technical systems and potable water hygiene. T raining should be carried out before per sonnel are assigned to the ir tasks. The responsible party must have routines to en su- re and document that the necess ary training has been given , including refresher routines . This doc - umentation could be a job descr iption and speci fi- cations for the various tasks, including potable water education program mes. Several insti tutions offer courses in offshore potable water treatment. The re sponsible party may also choose to provide the training, but must then document that this training is on a satisfactory professional level. 3.3 Maintenance system Many components in an offshore potable water system require regular maintenance to function well. The f requency and extent of the maintenance Safe, Sufficient and Good Potable Water Offshore 13 are in part based on re quirements made by the authorities, for example annual cleaning and disinfection of tanks and pipe systems (figure 3.1). Other requirements foll ow the general requirements in the Activity Regu lations chapter IX and the potable water regulations \u00a7 11. A planned maintenance programme must be pre - pared, describing the extent and frequency of the maintenance work on the potable water system, including evaporator, reverse osmosis unit, alka filter, bunkering unit , measuring instru- ments, non- return valves, active carbon filter, pressure setting systems and pipe system. The equipment supplier should docum ent the necessary maintenance but maintenance require - ments are also detailed in NS -EN806- 5. A job description must be provided for each ele - ment in the maintenance system , describing all necessary safety measures and how the work is to be carried out . 3.4 Collection, processing and use of data The potable water regulations require that a test programme is established to include regular testing of both untreated and treated water. The Management Regulations \u00a7 19 require that the responsible party collects and processes data information for: Surveillance and control of the state of technical, op erational and organi sational conditions Providing statistics and design data bases Implementing corrective and preventive measures For potable water systems, focus is often on the water analyses. C ollec ting data about critical operational parameters (see specifications for hygienic barriers under 5.2.4) and work carried out on the potable water system is also important. Exchange of such information is necess ary during shift changes , and helps to detectfaults at the earliest opportu nity, whereas water analyses will show the situa tion later . The responsible party chooses the type of data collection and routines for data use, provided that this also covers sufficient reporting to the autho ri- ties. Suggestions for logging the daily potable water analyses are described in appendix 3, with additionall ogging of bunkering, mainte nance and other operations. 3.5 Deviation handling The potable w ater r egulations demand that devi - ations are handled as soon as possible. Major deviations must be reported to the authority. The Management Regulations \u00a7 22 establishes that \"the responsible party shall register and follow up non-conformities \". Non-conformities to internal requirements that sig nifican t to fulfilling the requirements con tained in the HSE regul ations are also included. \"Non -conformities shall be corrected, the causes shall be identified, and remedial measures shall be implemented to prevent the non- conformity from recurring\" . Poor water quality and deficiency in water prod - uction must be handle d formally through channels for \"incident reporting\" . It is also necessary to establish criteria for when formal deviation handling is needed .

This must be handled as a non- conformity case.

Both the potable wat er regulations and the Management and Acti vities Regu lations state that a risk and vulnera bility assessment must form the basis for emergency planning. The assessment should include the following scenarios: Outbreaks of water -borne ep idemics Chemical pollution of the potable water render ing it to be unsuitable for use, for example as a consequence of poor bunkered water, leakage or faulty connections to various systems Lack of water due to leakage, technical failure, bad weather or oth er causes , see 5.2.3 Malfunction in the disinfection process or other circumstances causing hazards to t he quality of the potable water Based on the risk and vulnerability assessments, measures are taken to reduce the pro bability of failure, and an emerg ency prepared ness plan should be established for each unit to plan for the remaining risks . The emer gency preparedness strategy is meant to prevent hazardous situations from arising, and to establish action plans . 3.7 Internal audits The Framework Regul ations \u00a7 12 state s that \"The operator shall have an organi sation in Norway, which, on an independent basis, is capable of en-suring that petroleum activities are carried out according to rules and regulations\". T he organi sa- tion must be com petent to verify that t he following are satisfactory : Are critical cont rol points identified and plans for management of these satisfactory? Is the risk and vulnerabil ity analysis revised? Is the management documentation revised? Are the water quality trend s satisfactory? Are the maintenance trends satisfactory? Are the technical systems still satisfactory? Are the drawings correct? Internal audit s, including by personnel from the onshore organi sation, ar e important tools in this work. T he necessary procedur es, checklist s etc. should be established to manage critical control points in the water supply . The competence can be in-house or external, but the overall responsi bility for the work must be held by the operator /owner . Figure 3.2: Green water cause d concern on an offshore unit. Was this an emergency situation or was the pollution less serious?This colour was due to high copper content following leakage of citric acid when washing an UV unit , causing in- stant corrosion. The non- conformity was repor ted immedi ately. (Photo: Used anonymously with permission from the company ) Safe, Sufficient and Good Potable Water Offshore 15 4. Water quality Access to p otable water is necessary for drink - ing, cooking , personal hygiene and cleaning (fig - ure 4.1). It is therefore important to have suffi ci- ent quantiti es of satisfactory qualit y for all types of usage. Water treatment is described in chapter 8. Sufficient hygienic barriers should be installed to ens ure high quality potable water, see 5.2.4. 4.1 Potable water and health Water may also contain harmful elements that can be divided into two groups: 1. Microbes , such as bacteria, virus es, amoebas and para sites, can cause infectious disease or food poisoning. 2. Organic and non- organic substances such as acute poisons, carcinogens, allergens or substances that by accumulation in the human organism may cause health hazards. Indirect health hazards must also be considered. It may be difficult a dequately disinfect with chlorine or UV radiation if the water is discoloured or contains many particles, see 4.2.2. 4.1.1 Microbes Potable water sh ould not contain microbes that can lead to disease. If an outbreak of a conta gi- ous or other disease is suspected , locate the sour - ce and eliminate it quickly, thereby prevent ing its spread. An emergency preparedness plan should be introduced, see 3.6. Sufficient preven t- ive safety measures are achieved only by build - ing good potable water systems with sufficient internal control . Figure 4.1: Potable water must be treated for safe consumption (Photo: Lasse Farstad) All potabl e water for offshore consumption must be disinfected , still microbes can cause disease . This may be due to failure in the disinfecti on, or contamination after disin fection. Humans and animals have several means of de fence against infectious diseases . Illness depends on the gene- ral health of the individual , the infectivity of the microbe and the number of microbes ingested. WHO states that infectious diseases are the most serious threats to health from potable wat er supply. Faecal conta mination from humans and animals is often the source , and human fae ces are particu larly dan gerous. Historically, the fever and hepatitis A. Lately, foc us has been on bacteria like Yersi nia enterocolitica and Cam - pylobac ter jejuni, vir uses such as Norov irus (ear - lier called Norwalk virus), and protozoa like Giar dia and Cryptosporidium . These mic robes can cause illness with vomit, abdominal pain a nd diarrhoea. Recent ly, attention has been drawn to the dangers caused by Legionella , see 9.2.7. T he diffe rent types of epidem ics descr ibed in Norway are usually trigered by several unfor tunate cir - cumstances. The off shore units are as susceptib le to human and technical malfuncti ons as is the case onshore , and there are reasons to be alert . Since potable water is used for cooking, mic ro- bes in the water can also cause food -borne infec - tions. Some bacteria can grow in food products, and just a few bacteria can rapidly reproduce to high concen trations that make consumers ill. Some of the bac teria in food produce toxi ns that can cause poisoning even if the food is properly cooked and the bacte ria are killed. Analys ing potable water for ev ery type of infec - tious microbe is too demanding. Instead, analy s- es are done on indicator orga nisms, microbes prevalent in large amounts in faeces from hum - ans and animals, and that have similar life span s to the infectious substan ces (figure 4.2). The group \"coliform bac teria\" is used as an indicator for faecal conta mination and the bacteria E. coli indicates fresh faeces. When an indicator organ - ism is found in water, it is a sign that there might be disease- producin g organisms present . Safe, Sufficient and Good Potable Water Offshore 16 Figu re 4.2: Birds regularly rest on offshore plat - forms. Their droppings can spread pathogens via unsecu red air vents and Andersen) The\"Colony count 22o C\" parameter is used assess the level of biofilm in systems . Conse - quen tly, the \"Colony count\" may also indi cate growth in the pipe system of haz ardous orga n- isms that are not detected by other indicator pa - rameters. With a colony count below 100 per ml there is little risk of harmful exposure. In a well - maintained an d ope rated system it is often poss - ible to achieve colo ny counts below 10 per ml. 4.1.2 Hazardous c hemical substances Potable water sh ould not contain chemical sub - stances that are harmful . Exposure to potentially hazardous substances should be as low as possible. Offshore, such exposure may come from contaminated seawater supply or un wanted occurrences in the operation, for example back-suction through hose connec tions. It is important to minimis e the risk of poll ution from materials and addi tives that come in contact with the potable water during transportation, storage, treatment etc. See approval requirements in 2.4. Health problems from chemicals are seldom con - nected to acute poisoning by hazardous sub stan- ces but more often a result of pr olonged ex po- sure to small amounts that fin ally causes health problems. Most signi ficant are substances that accumulat e, caus ing cancer or triggering allergic reacti ons. When the human body is exposed to heavy metals over a period of time, the accum u- lation may reach a critical level, resulting in illness . Regulation l imit values for such sub stan- ces are set to a maxi mum acceptable daily in -take, with sufficient safe ty limits to avoid hazardous levels in the course of a lifetime. Some chemical substances are car cinogenic and many of these are genotoxic. T here is no thres h- old value for when da mage may occur. Since it is impossible to avoid traces of such substan ces in the water, Norway has gene rally set the upper limit value, based on an acc eptable lifetime risk, to be lower than 10 -6. This means that fewer than one out of a million people drinking two litres of water con taining a maximum acceptable amount of this substance every day for 70 years, will develop cancer. The risk of develop ing cancer will be signifi cantly lower, since limits are set with a high safety margin, and detected concen - trations of the substan ces are rarely close to the limit values. The danger is further reduced by a person seldom drinking water from t he same source during his or her entire lifetime. Disinfection is crucial to safeguard pot able wat - er, but some disinfection methods may cause hazardous by -products. The chlorine doses used in Norway do not cause any direct health hazards but the proces s may form chlorination by -prod- ucts like or sing health haz ards. F or trihalomethanes to be form - ed, the water must contain organic sub stances such as natural organic material, see 4.2.2. Pota - ble water produ ced offshore s eldom contains such material. Some units that evaporate water, where electrochlo rination is used to prevent marine growth in the sea chests, have found chlorination by -products in the produced water . If the potable water is bunkered onshore and has a low colour value (un der 20 mg Pt/l), and is chlor inated with the low chlorine levels used in Norway, it is gene rally safe to assu me that the level of trihalomethanes will be insig nificant . However, the level of by -products may increase if the supply vessel chlorinates excess ively or if the offshore unit bunkers water by topping up tanks that already contains a large volume of chlorinated water. 4.2 Other general requirements According to the potable water r egulations , , taste and colour, and non -corrosive. Safe, Sufficient and Good Potable Water Offshore 17 4.2.1 Odour and taste Potable water sh ould ha ve no specific odour or taste. An u npleasant odour and/or taste may be a sign of contamination, so an i nvestiga tion is need ed to find and correct the problem . Potable water with a n unpleasant odour and/or taste could encourage the crew to drin k other beverages than water. Unpleasant odour and taste can originate b oth in the unit and outside. P roblems increase when the water temperature is high . If tanks and pipes contain organic material result ing in growth of microbes , decom posing proces ses may g ive a \"rotten\" odour and taste. A high content of humic particles can give a \"mar shy taste\". Chemical reaction s between chlo rine and nitric components may form new che mical com - binations with a strong odour and taste. Various microbes can be found in large amounts in seawater , and can release odour and taste components that may pass an evaporator . Algae can also produce organic substan ces that do not smell, but form unpleasant smelling sub stances in contact with chlorine or UVradiation. The same might happen when the water contains other types of organic substances. Traces of chemicals like phenols, diesel and min - eral oils can cause unacceptable s mell and taste. A common reason for this in off shore pota ble water systems is incorrect use of protect ive coat - ings, see 9.1.4. High concen trations of chloride and sulphate from seawater pollution can give potable water a salty taste. Corrosi on pa rticles, like iron, zinc and copper, can also cause an unpleasant taste to the potable water. R emov ing the unpleasant odour and taste in potable water is cover ed in chapter 8. 4.2.2 Discoloured and turbid water Particles (turbidity) can contain mic robes that will not be killed by U V or chlorination. Such particles , and certain dissol ved substances (for example humic par ticles), can ab sorb UV light and reduce the effect of the UV treatment, see 8.3. A high content of organic ma terial will also lead to high chlorine con sumption that is unde si- rable as it will cause an un pleasant taste. Specific micro bes living in the pipe system ( biofilm) feed on or ganic sub stances. Some of these may pose a health hazard, such as Legionella pneumophi la that can cause Legionnaire's disease, see 9.2.7. Potable water produced offshore normally con - tains few particles, and t he turbidity limit of < 1.0 FNU is easy to maintain. In corroded pipe s, rust particles may loose n from the inside of the pipes and be flushed through the pipelines to the consumer (figure 4.3). Particle s may also occur if there is bacterial growth in the system that loosens due to pH changes or turbulent weather. Bunkered water may have a rather high content of particles or high colour number , depending on the quality of the onshore water source. There will often be seasonal variation. Water delivered by supply vessels or waterworks onshore with visible colour or turbidity should be re jected, see 4.3.2. Problems with turbidity can be prev ented by using particle filters, see 8.3.2. 4.2.3 Corrosive water Corrosive water means water that corrodes the pipeline system, fittings and other installations connected to the pipeline system. Untreated off - shore produced wat er corrodes most metal surfa - ces that are not stainless steel or titan ium. Some corrosion will always occur in a potable water system, but it is important to keep the level as low as poss ible, thereby avoiding inferior water quality, or premature replacement of the enti re system. Corrosion may also lead to heavy metals such as lead and cadmi um being released from the pipeline system and fittings, with unde sirable conse quences to health . By letting the water run for a short time before use, the heavy metal residue i s low ered. Corrosion also necessitates more frequ ent cleaning and flushing of pipe systems, with an increase in operation costs. Figure 4.3: Discoloured water due to corrosion (Photo: Eyvind Andersen) Safe, Sufficient and Good Potable Water Offshore 18 Figure 4.3: Corrosion clusters can result in poor water quality and clogging of pipes (Photo: Eyvind Andersen) Corrosion is due to a complex relation between pH value, carbon dioxide content, oxygen cont - ent, hardness, (standard mainly set by calcium and magnesium), alkalinity (acid -neutrali sing abilit y, most of the time as a result of hydrogen carbonate content) and temperature. High cont - ent of ions such as chloride and sulphate can also increase cor rosion. When the pH value is below 7, the water is considered to be acid ic and will corrode most metal s. High pH values (> 9.5) will also corrode certain metals. A pH of approxi mat- ely 8 is recom mended. High levels of iron or copper are water quality parameters that indicat e corrosion problems. Water from Norwegian waterworks is usually surface water an d is commonl y acid, with low levels of calcium and alkalinity. Such water will corrode most materials. Potable water pro duced offshore is even more acid ic, has lower levels of calcium, alkalinity and, if produced by the reverse osmosis method, can have a rela tively high salt level. Such potable water needs treatment, see 8.1. Pipe system s with speckled deposit s on the metal surface may experience pitt ing corrosion. Under this residue , the oxygen level will be lower due to the micro bes' oxygen consumption. The difference will make elec trons move from areas with residue to areas without residue . This process releases metal ions to the potable water under the speckled residue, creating a pit in the metal. It is mainly a problem in iron and copper pipes, and offshore units based on bun kered water are more susceptible to pitting. Corrosion by -products may reduce the water flow and make the water turbid, see 4.2.2. In potable wat er pipes of iron and steel, corrosion clusters may form , especially in older pipe systems. The clusters are formed by bacteria that convert dissolved iron to solid corrosion clusters. The corrosion clusters are hollow and can disintegrate when the force of the water flow and flow direction is changed, see figure 4. 4. Iron a nd copper can cause other problems too: High iron content can give turbid water which is red to brown. Fittings, sinks, bath- tubs and toilets become rust coloured. St ag- nant water may develop an unpleasant taste, and white clothes may develop brownish- red stains after washing due to iron deposits. High copper content can cause an unpleasant taste. Consumers may experience stomach probl ems if concentra tions are very high. High copper content may cause a green dis - colouration of sanitary equipment and hair . When good quality metal piping of is used, see 9.2.6, and the potable water treated to be as non-corrosive as possible, the main installation com - ponents in the system will last for the life span of the unit. Unfortunately, there have been cases where parts or entire distribution systems had to be replaced due to corrosion at great cost . Corrosion can cause leak ages, and as pipes often are concealed in the walls, the water damage can become extensive before discover y. Corrosion control is covered i n chapter 8.1. 4.2.4 Itching and skin irritation Some people working offshore complain of itching and other skin irritation. This is often seen in relation to showering, especially if there is doubt about the treatment methods of the pot - able water (chlor ination, alkalis ing, reverse os - mosis, etc). It is often difficult to find the cause for such symptoms. The problems may vary between people and places . Many components, Safe, Sufficient and Good Potable Water Offshore 19 water -related or not (like dry air etc.), may trigger the problems. If the problems a re only related to shower ing, here is a list of possible causes and remedies: One important explanation is frequent showering, using soap that removes the natural fatty protection of the skin. It is also possible that people shower mor e often offshore th an at home. It is advisable to shower less frequently or avoid using soap every time. Use of body lotion after showering may also help. Some people display symptoms in winter , even if they do not shower often. This is pro-bably a cold weather eczema caused by the skin's protective layer being washed away . Use of body lotion often reduce s problem s. People who experience itching and i rritat ed skin should try a mild er type of soap or shower oil. Some may also react to the soap used in the laundry . Even if the potable water is not the cause of these skin problems, some microbes existing in the pipe system s may produc e substances that sen sitive pe ople react to. Disinfection of the cold and hot water systems once a year can prevent growth of these microbes . Hard water will also affect how the skin feel s after showering. Tak ing showers in soft water makes the skin feel less dry but soapy, while showering in hard water makes the skin feel dry and coar se. Individuals who are used to hard water will react to th e soft water and vice versa. In Norway , most water is originally soft, but alkali sing/hardening makes the potable water harder, see 4.2.3. Treatment methods used offshore are not known to cause itching or other skin reactions under normal circumstances. 4.2.5 Water temperature Cold water temperatures above 20 oC and hot water temperatures below 60 oC increase the risk for microbial growth in the system, including Legionella , see 9.2.7. To document suf ficient tempe ratures everywhere in the syste m, establish a test progr amme, based on an analysis of where the risk of unwanted temperatures is high. Once sufficient temperatures are documented through - out the system, monthly testing (random loca ti- ons) should suffic e. Cold water tastes better than luke warm water, so water should be kept as cool as possible. By keeping fresh and cool water available, for example in water fountains connected to the potable water system, chances are that the platform crew will prefer water to the more expensive and less healthy alternatives. The hot water temperature must be kept high enough to avoid growth of unwanted microbes such as Legionella pneumophila, see 9.2.7. 4.3 Quality requirements Water tests are an important tool to show that the system is well- managed and will also help to improve the management. This section describes the analysis program me suggested by the NIPH , which is based on potable water regulation requirements. The authority may, based on the potable water regulations, give other requirements if necessary. It is a common misunderstanding that water analyses en sure good quality potable water but only high quality technical systems and adequate internal control can en sure this. Water analyses will only document whether th e water was of good quality or not afterwards . The potable w ater r egulations list several analysis par ameters, and give the minimum requirements for a nalyses, thereby documenting that the water quality meets the requirements. Some limit/action values are set because exceeding those values can cause short or long - term health hazards, or because exceeding the limit value may make the potable water quality unfit for consumption. Exceeding other limit/action values does not pose any immediate health hazard, but may indicat e that the potable water contains other components hazardous to health. Exceeding values may also reveal that the waterworks is ope rated incorrectly and consequently may not produce safe potable water. Offshore waterworks differ from waterworks onshor e, for example by producing potable water from seawater . Bunkered water comes from onshore waterworks with app roved control routines. Some pollutants are thereby absent in Safe, Sufficient and Good Potable Water Offshore 20 the offshore systems but special con ditions offshore make units sus ceptible to other types of pollution. M ore tests may be necessary to have sufficient control of the water, and ot her parameters must supplement t he program me when conta mination is suspect ed. Analysis frequency, l imit values and the conse - quences of exce eding such pa rameters are com - mented on below, whilst recommendations for sample points are detailed in 4.4. When the limits are exceeded, steps to find the causes must be taken and normal water quality resto red, see 3.5. The supervision authorities must be informed . In addition to the analys is programme required in the potable water regulations , water temperatures must be measur ed, see 4.2.5. 4.3.1 Daily analyses The potable water quality on board must be mea - sured and logged daily, see appendix 3. Results are used to evaluate the need for adjust ments of the potable water operations. The following par - ameters are included in the daily control: Odour : Should not be noticeable. Odour may be a sign of contamination by chlorine/ chlorination by-products, volati le substances pro duced by algae, miscellaneous chemicals, oil, hydrogen sulphide gases (rotten smell), metals, salts, humic substances, marsh etc. A slight smell of chlorine is normal followi ng the chlorination procedure, see 4.2.1. Taste : Should not be noticeable. Unpleasant taste may indicate several types of contami na- tion. See the above information regarding odour . Clarity : The water should be clear . This must be evaluated by using strong light and a white or black ba ckground, depending on particl e colour . Unclear water may indi cate contamina tion and may even reduce the effects of disinfect ion, see 4.2.2. pH value : Should be between 6.5 and 9.5. To avoid corrosion, the pH level should be kept stable between 8 and 8.5. Chlorination func tions best at a pH level below 8, requiring chlor ination before alkali sation. Minor deviations from the pH limit values do not caus e any health hazard but a pH value above 11 can cause cauteri sation damag e especially to eyes and skin, see 4.2.3. pH fluctuations increase copp er corrosion and may lead to loosening of biofilm, with high colony counts as a consequence. Conductivity, see 6.4: Abnormal conductivity levels should not be accepted on an offshore unit. Conductivity varies with type of water, dependin g on how the potable water is produced and where in the system the water is tested. In water production units, t he conduc tivity at the sample point of the production unit will indicate its functionality. The sample point from an eva - porator s hould not s how conduc tivity higher than 6 mS/m (= 60 S/cm) . Modern eva porators often produce water with conducti vity less than 1 mS/m. At the sample point from a reverse osmo - sis unit, a conductivity level up to 75 mS/m is acceptable, but modern osmosis units will prod- uce water with much lower l evels. Wat er with unusually high conductivity should be dumped. When water passes through an alkaline filter, the conductivity level will increase. How much de - pends on the type of alkali sation unit used, and it is important that conductivity levels have no abnormal variations. The cause of the abnor mal fluctuations must be found. High levels of conductivity offshore may imply seawater contamination . Free chlorine: C hlorination is no longer recom - mended as the only disinfection method in the potable water system. If the potable water is treated with UV radiation, free chlorine is not required and daily chlorine analyses are unnecessary. Free chlorine values should be between 0.05 and 0.5 milligram per litre (equals ppm, parts pe r million). The NIP H recommends that the value is kept above 0.1 mg/l, as lower levels may be dif f- icult to measure safely with normal off shore eq - uipment . If free chlorine is not detected , disin- fection ha s failed. It is then important to take imme diate measures to avoid infect ions and prevent future problems . The higher limit value of 0.5 mg/l is set to pre - vent the water from smelling and tasting of chlo - rine. It is not harmful to use water with a higher Safe, Sufficient and Good Potable Water Offshore 21 chlorine level. Some coun tries rec ommend higher lev els of chlorine, and t he World Health Orga nization permits up to 5 mg/l, but in such cases it is recommended to inform the crew that the Potable W ater R egulation requi rements are not fulfilled , see appen dix 12. Total chlorine : Should be kept below 5 mg/l . Water with high total levels will smell and taste strongly of chlorine. Adding as much as 5 mg/l should therefore be used only whi le disinfecting the pipelines, see 9.2.9, as the potable w ater regulations requirements for odour and taste are not fulfilled. During normal operation of the potable water system the total chlorine amount should not exceed 1.0 mg/l, unless it is necessary to reach adequate levels of free chlorine. 4.3.2 Analyses when bunkering Take w ater samples for quality testing from each of the tanks the bunkering vess el delivers water from A ppendix 5 contains a suggested bunker ing log. Before the water is accepted, measure the following parameters: Odour , taste, clarity and pH: See 4.3.1. Evaluate odour and taste indoor s, and use good lighting to test for clarity . Conductivity : Water deliver ed offshore should have similar conductivity to when it was in the onshore pipes . In the past Norwegian onshore waterworks had conductivity levels below 10 mS/m (=100 S/cm) . Several onshore water - works now treat the water with alkaline filters to obtain conduc tivity between 10 and 15 mS/m. This water can be accepted off shore. The most important issue here is that there is no significant increase in con ductivity during transport from the waterworks to the offshore unit , which may indicate seawater contamina tion. When entering into an agree ment on water delivery to an off - shore unit, identify the normal conduc tivity level for the onshore waterworks , see appendix 6. Colour value : Should be below 20 mg Pt/l , but subtract the measuring equipment margin of error from the limit value . A high er colour value is normally caused by a high content of natural organic mate rial (humic par ticles) in the water delivered by the onshore waterworks , see figure 4.5. High col our value reduc es the effect of disinfect ion and may also cause disinfect ion by - products to form . Free chlorine: Verify 30 minutes after bunkering /circulation ends , see 4.3.1. 4.3.3 Monthly routine control Monthly samples of water should be sent to an accredited laboratory. Suggestions for a test programme are detailed in 4.4, and procedures are des cribed in appendi ces 7 and 8. A form for use in fault -finding that cover s common deviatio ns in potable water quality is shown in appendix 9. The NIPH suggests a monthly water analysis programme with the following parameters: Colour: See 4.3.2. Odour and taste : See 4.3.1. Turbidity : Shall be below 1 FNU when the water passes the UV units . High turbidi ty makes the water unclear, normally due to a high content of small particles. The effect of disin fection is reduced, see 4.2.2, and the water appears less appetising. Clostridium perfringens : Should not be present in 100 ml water. If the li mit value is exceeded, investigate the entire water system to ensure that it is not contaminated by other disease -spreading substances with long survival abilities , such as Cryptosporidium or norovirus. Clostri dium perfringens can also cause food poisoning. Figure 4.5: Norwegian surface water often has a high content of natural organic material, requir - ing increased dose of chlorine when bunkering (Photo: Bj\u00f8rn L\u00f8fsgaard) Safe, Sufficient and Good Potable Water Offshore 22 Figure 4.6: What to do when E. coli or intestinal enterococci are found in potable water samples (Illustration: Karin Melsom) E. coli : Should not be present in 100 ml water and if discovered must be reported immediately to the authorities. E. coli has a similar life span in water as other common disease- produc ing intestinal bacteria, and is used as an indicator of such bacteria. Human faeces with high levels of E. coli is the most dangerous microbiological contamination of potable water. If E. coli is detected, take immediate measures to avoid disease, see figure 4.6, and to prevent similar incidents in the future. Immedi ate measures will normally be a systematic check of the entire water system to ensure that it func tions properly. Pay s pecial attention to disinfection. Are the chlorine level s sufficient and is the UV radiation unit functioning? Once all systems are functi oning proper ly, send new water samples for analysis by an onshore laboratory. If malfun ctions in the system are found, take immediate action to pre vent disease outbreaks. This includes announcement s via the PA system, boil ing of water, use of bottled water etc. The detec tion of E. coli must be followed by disinfection of contaminated tanks and pipe system. Intestinal enterococci : Should not be present in 100 ml of water. If intestinal enterococci are found, this indicate s faecal contamination which must be re ported immediately to the authorities . Intestinal enterococci can survive for longer in salt water than E.coli , and are used as an indi - cator of disease causing intestinal bacteria. T ake the same preventive measures as described for E.coli . Colony count 22 o C/72 hour s: A c olony count in tanks and pipe system should be below 100/ ml of water. Samples from the UV outlet should be below 10/ ml of water. In the colony count ana ly- sis, a wide range of microbes found naturally in water are detected . A colony count above 100 reveals a problem with micro bial growth (biofilm) in the system and must lead to invest i- gations to find the cause of the problems and necessary corrective measures . Extensive biofilm can cause corrosion and lead to unpleasant odour and taste, and redu ce the effect of disin fection. High colony counts are also a sign that the system may harbour microbes like Legionella, see 4. 2.5. Coliform bacteria : Should not be present in 100 ml of water. Finding coliform bacteria without finding E.coli normally indicates an older conta - mination without a great disease -producing potential. Even so, take the same preventive measures as described for E.coli . Iron : Limit value is 0.2 mg/l (milligram/ litre). Exceeding the limit value indicates corrosion in the potable water system. T his is not usually a health problem but may indicate potential for E. Coli or intestinal enterococci are found Has the water treatment mal func- tioned or is the water quality outside normal values? No No The water quali ty is safe No findings in two consecutive tests New tests Finding Use bottled or boiled water for drinking and cook ing. Tanks and piping to be disinfected, see appendices 12 and 13. The authorities must be notified immediately Yes New test to be taken immedi ately. Is the finding affirmed? Safe, Sufficient and Good Potable Water Offshore 23 other types of corrosion, like heavy metals . Keep the iron value s as low as possible because depo s- its of iron may reduce the disinfection effect. High iron content will discolour the water , as well as clothes and sanitary installations, and give the water an unpleasant taste. High iron content ma y indicate the possibility of other types of corrosion, i.e. of toxic heavy metals such as lead and cadmium. Conductivity : See 4.3.1. Copper : Limit value is 1.0 mg/l, m easured at the end of the piping . The copper values in hot wa ter can be much higher t han in cold wa ter. Con se- quently the copper value should be much low er when measured in the cold water fixture, after a short flushing. Copper values above 0.3 mg/l in- dicate that the alkali sing sys tem is not functioning properly. The copper level in the cold water sys tem should be maximum 0.3 mg/l (except when copper is used to combat biofilm, see 9.2.7) . If water has been stagnant in the pipe system for some time it is not unusual to have levels above 3 mg/l, which can give acute gas tro- intestinal dis orders. High copper con tent will give the water a bitter taste and cause dis colour- ing of sanitary equipment and sometimes give blonde individuals a greenish hair colour tinge , see figure 4. 7. Dissolved copper ions will also accelerate co rrosion on other metals. High copper content may indicate the possibility of other types of corro sion, i.e. of toxic heavy metals such as lead and cadmium. Figure 4.7: Corrosive water in copper pipes can result in excessive copper content in the potable water (Photo: Bj\u00f8rn L\u00f8fsgaard) pH (acid value) : See 4.3.1. Supplementary analyses: Calcium: If an alkali sing filter , see 8.1 , is used in the water treatment process, analyse calcium levels monthly . The calcium value should be between 15 and 25 mg Ca/l. Such analyses indi c- ate whet her the operation of the system is optim - al or not. High calcium content can lead to depo-sits in the UV operation system. 4.3.4 Extended annual routine control Unless the potable water regulations state otherwise, a n increa sed number of physical/chemical parameters should be analysed annually by an accredited laboratory. Appendix 8 describ es how to collect the samples but the labora tory should specify what type of bottles to use. The annual programme should take place simultaneously with the monthly analyses and at the same locations on the distribution system (living quarter s). The programme should include the following parameters: Benzene: Should be below 1 g/l. Benzene has been found offshore and is believed to be caused by contamination from protective coatings . Carcinogenic and also harmful in other respects . Benzo(a)pyrene: Should be below 0.010 g/l. The environment may be c ontaminated by poly - cyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and high content proves that the contam ination has reached the potable water. It is most likely carcinogenic. Bromat e: Should be below 5 g/l. B y-product that may be formed when electro chlorinated seawater has passed an evaporator. Also found offshore as a pollutant after using hy pochlor ite that is not approved for potable water use, see 2.4. May be carcinogenic. Cadmium: Should be below 5 g/l. Higher con - tent of c admium is normally a sign of corrosion on the pipelines and fixtures. Cadmium is toxic , accumulat ing in the human body and a ffecting many organs. May be carcinogenic. Hydrocarbons, mineral oils : Should be below 10 g/l. Found offshore after leaks or after conta - mination by coating s (paints) or sol vents , often accom panied by an unpleasant odour and taste. Safe, Sufficient and Good Potable Water Offshore 24 Lead : Should be belo w 10 g/l. High content of lead is normally caused by corrosion in pipelines and fittings. Lead is toxic , accumulat ing in the human body and affect ing many organs. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) : Should be below 0.10 g/l (includes the sum of benzo(b)fluoranthene, benzo(k)fluor anthene, benzo(ghi)perylene and indeno(1,2,3- cd)pyr ene). Found offshore, most likely from exhaust pollution via air vents for tanks. May be carcinogenic. Trihalomethanes : Should be below 50 g/l (in- cludes the sum of c bromochlor omethane and bromodi chlor ometh - ane). These substances have been found on offshore units following electro chlorination of the seawater inlets. The substances are volatile and c oncentrations can increase in the evapora tion pro cess. Increased levels have also been found as a result of platform chlorination, when the water from the onshore waterworks already contains high levels of trihalomethanes , especially when the water is chlorinated several times (bunkering to tanks that contain much water) . Chloroform and bromodi chlor omethane are most likely carcino genic. More research is needed before the other substances can be classified. Supplementary analys es: Boron: Should be below 1.0 mg/l. Only n eeds to be measured for reverse osmosis produced water . Boron is a seawater component, and boron may pass reverse osmosis membranes. May cause adverse repro ductive and develop mental effects . Glycols : Should be below 10 g/l. Only needs to be analysed if there is a risk of p ollution through leakages from evaporators etc. Chromium: Should be below 50 g/l. O nly needs to be analysed the first year on new offshore unit s to detect chromium pollution from valves and fittings . Nickel: Should be below 20 g/l. O nly needs to be analysed the first year on new offshore unit s to detect nickel pollution from valves and fittings . 4.3.5 Parameters that may be exempt In general , all parameters mentioned in the potable water regulations are to be analysed. Some para meters are unlikel y to be exceeded in offshore system s, and may be omitted t from the analysis progra mme. The regulations state how to do this . This applies to the following parameters: 1.2-dichlorethane: Not detected offshore . Acryl amide : Not applicable for Norwegian water. Aluminium : Not used in offshore water treat - ment and will consequently not be present in potable water produced offshore. The analysis requirements are met by analyses done by the onshore waterworks . Ammoni a: Not detected offshore . Antimony : Not applicable for Norwegian water. Arsenic: Not applicable for Norwegian water. Chemical oxygen demand (COD) (or TOC) : Not detected offshore . Chloride : Should be below 200 mg/l. Only to be measured if the conductivity is high . High cont - ent leads to corros ive water, unpleasant taste and indicates seawater conta mination. Con ductivity measured after evaporati on or reverse os mosis is mainly due to traces of sodi um chloride (NaCl), and a conductivity of 1 mS/m implies a chloride content somewhat less th an 3 mg/l Cl. Cyanide : Not applicable for Norwegian water. Epichlor ohydrine : Not applicable for Norwegian water. Fluoride : Only a problem in connection with ground water sources. No waterworks with fluoride problems deliver water to offshore units. The analysis requirements are met by analyses done by the onshore waterworks . Manganese : Only a problem with ground water sources, and no waterworks cont aining manga - nese deliver potable water to off shore units. The Safe, Sufficient and Good Potable Water Offshore 25 analysis requirements are met by analy ses done by the onshore waterworks . Mercury : Not applicable for Norwegian water. Nitrate and Nitrite: Not used offshore. The analysis requirements are met by analyses done by the onshore waterworks . Pesticides : Not used offshore. The analysis requirements are met by analyses done by the onshore waterworks . Selenium : Not applicable for Norwegian water. Sodium : Should be below 200 mg/l, ideally far below this level. Only to be meas ured if the val - ues for conductivity are unnormal. High lev els can be due to failure in the prod uction unit or contami nation from seawater . The sodi um con- tent offshore is no problem for people with good health, but raised levels can be problematic for people on a low salt diet. High sodium con tent increases blood pressure that may cause cardio - vascular disease. Conductivity measured after evaporation or reverse osmosis is mainly due to traces of sodium chloride (NaCl), and a conduc - tivity of 1 mS/m implies a sodium content some - what less than 2 mg/l Na. Sulphate : Analysis is not necessary offshore as seawater contamination is revealed when meas - uring conductivity. Offshore water treatment does not carry risks for sulphate contamination. Tetrachloroeth ene and trichloroethen e: Not detected offshore. Vinyl chlor ide: Not applicable for Norwegian water. 4.4 Sample points The potable w ater r egulations state that the water shall have potable water quality where it is available to the consumer. Normally this will via taps and applies to all taps on the unit. For testing purposes , a risk analysis is needed to find the most important taps and other testing points. If there are many points, it is normal to adopt a rotating test regime. Examples of important testing points: Seawater prior to water production Water treatm ent units Water tank outlet Kitchen taps Other potable water taps; especially taps near the end of distrib ution branches One of the sample points in the distribution sys - tem should be a fixed reference point. Recom - mended analysis parameters and analysis fre- quency is detailed in 4.3. 4.5 Drinking water in bottle s or other packaging Bottled d rinking water may supplement the water supply but there is no reason to compro mi- se on quality . As a thirst quencher, in addition to normal intake of juice, milk , tea and coffee, water is recommended and unrivalled. Drink ing water coolers placed at gathering points make it more tempting to drink water. Whether the water comes from a potable water system or is delivered in a bottle or water barrel has no significa nt health consequence. For those who are cost and environment conscious , it is important to note that bottled water is extremely expensive com pared to tap water. In addition,packaging and transport of the bottled water makes it an environmentally bad choi ce. Some bottled water is labelled as natural mineral water, and is covered by other rules and regula - tions. These products may have very high levels of sodium , fluoride or other substances (figure 4.9). Bottled water used for daily consumption should have a low sodium level (labelled Na+ or sodium). It does not make any difference to the health whether the bottled water contains carbonic acid or not. 4.6 Essential analysis equipment Chlorine : See 4.3.1. Free and total chlorine is measured in milligrams per litre (mg/l). Normal chlorine values during offshore operation are 0.05 to 1 mg/l but during disinfection of the sys t- em values as high as 10 mg/l should be mea sur- able. Certain measuring equipment claims to Safe, Sufficient and Good Potable Water Offshore 26 measure free chlorine values as low as 0. 01 mg/l. Such low measured values may not be reli able. The measuring requirement for free chlor ine is thus set to a minimum of 0.05 mg/l, and the minimum requirement value must be above the limit the equipment can meas ure. Using a colour comparator makes it difficult to prove the exact value of free chlorine below 0.1 mg/l, therefore 0.1 should be used as the minimum value for free chlorine level. The chlorine measuring equipment on the unit should be able to measure chlorine levels of 0.05 -10 mg/l, with precision requirements as follows: +/- 0.05 in Pt) by photometer or spectropho tometer. The measuring equipment must measure colour values within 2- 50 mg Pt/l. Subtract t he margin of error of the measuring equipment from the colour limit, and if the margin of error is +/ - 2 mg Pt/l, reject water with a higher colour than 18. Conductivity: See 4.3.1. M easured in milliSie - centimetres (S/cm) . 1 mS/m equals S/cm. The measuring must measure conduc - tivity within 0 -100 mS/m at 25oC, with a precis - ion requirement of +/- 5 %. PH value : See 4.3.1. The measuring equipment must measure pH values within 4-10, with a pre -cision r equirement of +/ - 0.1 pH -unit. Calibration of this equipment is critical. Extra equipment: For units operating on locations where no land-based laboratories are nearby , tests for col ony counts, E. coli and other bacteriological para - meters can be perfor med with simple tes tkits (they give results in 24 -48 hrs). These test kits can also be used by units that want quicker and more frequent measuring under normal ope ra- tions , i.e. when checking water to trace problems. Figure 4.9: Some natural mineral water has very high sodium content, as shown by the conductivity meter (Photo: Eyvind Andersen) Safe, Sufficient and Good Potable Water Offshore 27 5. General design requirements Potable water systems s hould be designed to give the crew sufficien t quantities of high quality water at all times. O ffshore potable water system s differ from onshore system s in several ways , and require special considerations. Failure in the potable water system is trouble - some as it is difficu lt to find other water sources . A water -borne epidemic can infect so many indi - viduals within a short time that it will be come difficult to main tain the operation of the unit. The HSE regulations emphasise that potable wat - er system s must be desig ned to min imise risks of failure as much as pos sible, b y duplicating essential elements in the pro cess, and choo sing systems that are easy to oper ate, with mini mal risk of technical malfunction When deciding if an offshore unit will have wa - ter production equipment , it should be noted that the produc ed water is usua lly of very high qua - lity and is the cheapest soluti on in the l ong term . Bunk ering of water involves a long c hain of ope - rations, each of which may fail, see chapter 7. Design suggestions for offshore potable water systems are found i n chapter 5.1. A number of general requirements to design are given in chapter 5.2. Special advice regarding details is given in chapters 6 to 10 in the guideline. 5.1 Design example Figure 5.1 shows how to design a potable water system. The numbers gi ven on the drawing refer to the following text: 1. Two seawater inlets supply the wat er. This makes it possible to use seawater from diff- erent locations and different depths , thereby avoiding local contamination . The inlets are closeable, and are not conne cted to the same sea chest that suppl ies cooling water for machinery or other types of seawater consumption that may occur close to shore . 2. Two water production units , each with 100 % production capacity (alternatively 3 at 50 %) , safeguard the w ater pro duction even if one production unit is out of order. The p roduced water is dumped automatically if the con duc- tivity is to o high, and the wat er production units have a common conduc tivity meter and dump valve for extra safety . 3. The alkaline filter makes the water less corr- osive . CO 2 added prior to the filter speeds up the process and stabili ses pH within the best values , see 4.2.3. 4. Bunkering hoses should be flushed and samp les taken before fill ing the tanks. Two bunkering stations increase th e possibi lity for bunkering in bad weather . Flush the hose and pipe with full bunkering speed (often around 250 m 3/h). T he flush water pipe size should match the cap acity of the bunkering pipe. The piping needs a low point drain to empty the bunkerin g pipes after bunkering. 5. Flowmeter -controlled chlorination equipment ensures correct chlorination of bunkered and circulated water . 6. Minimum two separate storage tanks , see table 9.1, en sures available water even if one tank must be drai ned due to pollution, main - tenance etc. The tanks have coffer dams/ clean areas on all sides except against adjac- ent potable water tanks. The tanks have drain valve s, and tank suction is placed a little higher to avoid tank sedi ment entering the pipe syst em. Stor age tanks and manholes are designed to make it easy for the mainten ance crew to inspect and clean the tanks while the unit is in operation, see 5.2.1. Stor age tanks, including air vents, are protected against con - tamin ation, see 9.1.2. The pipe s suppl ying water to the tank is located in a position that enhances water circulation in the tank. Auto - matic val ves make it impossible to bunker water to a tank that is also supplying the distribution network. 7. Two frequency -controlled wat er pumps each have 100% supply capa city. Pumping will normally be a better sol ution than using hydrophore tanks due to cleaning requirements and microbial growth potential .Safe, Sufficient and Good Potable Water Offshore 28 Figure 5.1: Outline of an offshore potable water system (Illustration: K arin Melsom) 8. Two or more UV units which, even with one unit out of action due to main tenance or technical failure , still have sufficient capaci ty to disin fect the maximum water supply at the lowest relevant UV transmiss ion, see 8.3.2. The UV unit s are equipped with solenoid valves that shut off the water flow if tech nical failure occurs. To avoid stops in the wat er supply, the units should be connected to emergency power supply. Par ticle filters are positioned in front of the UV unit s to prevent microbes from passing the UV unit in periods of turbid water . 9. Tank return line (alternatively a hydrophore tank) provides stabl e water pressure in the pipes. The return line is connected after the UV unit s to preve nt overheating of UV chambers through suf ficient minimum flow . This solution may also improve the general water quality by letting the water pass through particle filters and UV unit s several times. The tank return inlet is located to en hance tank circulation. The water is automa tically routed to the same tank that supplies the network. 10. Hot water circulates through a water heater with sufficient temperature (normally 65 -70 o C) to ensure that the water in the bottom of the heater frequently holds 60o C and that the temp erature in the entire ho t water system stays above 60o C, see 4.2.5. Insulation of piping is necessa ry to achieve this, see 9.2.8. A verifiable non -return valve prevents hot water from leaking into the cold water. Other connections to equipment where hot and cold water is mixed must be safeguarded as well. An expansion tank keeps the pressure stable. 11. Where other systems are connect ed to the potable water system , such connec tions are atmospheric or in other ways sepa rated to prevent back suction of dirty water , see 9.2.5. Avoid stagnant water and locate safety measures as close to the potable water branch - off as possible . 12. The system has a dedicated pump with a large enough capacity to quickly circulate and chlo - rinate water in one of the tanks (often 4- 6 9. Return to tanks 1.

The water is au - tomatic ally pumped back to the tank of origin . 13. For units operating in hot climates, and for units that have problems with growth of bio - film, continuous chlorination may be an ad- vantage (or other water treatment, like chlor - ine dioxide or silver/copper ioni sation) to pre - vent problems with biofilm, Legionella etc. As continuous chlorination will increase the amount of chlorination by -products, we rec - ommend the following des ign: Chlorine is added after the water production unit and may be topped up through circulation of the tanks. Prior to UV disinfection , chlorine and chlor - ination by -products are removed in an active carbon filter (location prior to UV is an advan - tage if bacteriological growth occurs in the carbon filter , can double as a particle filter ). Fresh chlorine for the cold water distribution network is then added after the calorifier branch off (chlor ine in the hot water system will increase corrosion) . We recom mend flow - meter controlled chlorination units. 5.2 Advice for design and construction Most considerations when designing offshore potable water system s should be obvi ous. Never - theless, it is easy to make mistakes, because some measures are forgotten or there are other technical, economical or prac tical factors . The NIPH suggests that individuals in charge of the project use the checklist in appendix 1 to evaluat e if the project meets regulatory requirements. A person with broad experience in operating such system should be given the role as system respon - sible in the design phase . This person shall ensure that the entire system is functional with re gard to technical solutions, operation and maintenance. Figure 5.2: During the construction process i t is important that pipe systems are not contaminated. The picture shows how pipe ends are secured by compress ion (Photo: Bj\u00f8rn L\u00f8fsgaard) Figure 5.3: This potable water tank is high and lacks internal platforms for easy cleaning. This has resulted in insufficient cleaning. The walls are clean up to 2 metres and very dirty above 4 metres (Photo: Eyvind Andersen) Below we have listed the most important aspects when design ing a potable water sys tem. S tudy closely all the differ ent aspects throughout the planning and construc tion process (figure 5.2). By involving personnel with experience in operation of offshore potable water systems, many mistakes can be avoided. 5.2.1 Ergonomic design According to t he Facilities Regulations \u00a7 20 .1 \"work areas and work equipment shall be design- ed and placed in such way that the employees are not subjected to adverse physical or mental strain as a result of manual handling, work position, repetitive movements or work intensity etc. that may cause injury or illness\". The requirement to ergonomics applies to the entire potable water system, operations as well as maintenance. Inadequate ergonomic design can result in necessary work operations not being undertaken in a proper manner. The NIPH has experienced inferior er gonomic design in the following situations: The bunkering station flush valve is placed so that the crew on the unit or the supply vessel crew is subject to heavy splas hes of water. Water tank height is too high or low , which obstruct s clean ing and maintenance (figure 5.3). Ladders and platforms can be built insi de the tank to make mainten ance easy, see 9.1.2 , but such equipment must also be cons tructed to facilitate cleaning and maintenance. Safe, Sufficient and Good Potable Water Offshore 30 Figure 5.4: This tank has a drain well, and the stiffen ers are placed vertically, with drain cavities against the tank floor. Consequently the tank is easy to drain (Photo: Eyvind Andersen) Existing p otable water tanks often have com - partments and braces on the inside, making cleaning and maintenance difficu lt. This should be avoided if poss ible, or be designed to make access easy, and to allow flush water drain away properly (figure 5.4). Potable water tanks lack an effective low point drain. The design of alkali sing filters often makes it awkward to fi ll or empty the filter as this fre - quently involves climbing and heavy lifting. Access to the filter for inside main tenance may also be difficult (figure 5.5) . Water heaters and hydrophore tanks often have limited access for internal maintenance. Manual valves are placed in awkward positions. Manholes for potable water tanks and hydro - phore tanks are difficult to reach, especially when heavy equipment is needed for repairs inside the tanks. Sections of the potable water system requiring regular attendan ce are often placed in areas with disturbing noise levels. 5.2.2 Safeguarding against mistakes According to the Facilities Regulations \u00a7 20.2 \"Work sites and equipment shall also be designed and placed in such a way that the risk of mistakes that can hav e an impact on safety is reduced \". Supply of sufficient, safe and good potable water is a prere quisite for the unit to be operated safely, and the unit must be designed to minimi se mistakes that could jeopardise the water supply. Figure 5.5: Alkalising filters, hydrophore tanks and calorifiers are often supplied with access openings of such a small size that the tanks are impossible to clean (Ph oto: Eyvind Andersen) The potable water system should be based on the use of simple and robust technical sol utions, see the Facilities Regulations \u00a7 5. Avoid t echnical solutions with many different and complicated details that may fail and choose simple solutions to eliminate the risk of failure and minimis e the risk for human error. Avoid the following solutions: Technical solutions where one mistake can cause important systems to malfunction, such as bypassing the disin fection units. Technical solutions requiring intensive super - vision to function properly. Technical solutions not functioning due to un- stable water quality, volume changes etc. Technical solutions where failure is difficult to detect , or where it is difficult to limit the dam- ages and do repairs. Technical solutions where it is stated: \" We know this might easily fail, but we have a procedur e that will prevent failure\". 5.2.3 Storage capacity requirements Offshore units must always have enough water aboard and experience shows that the daily consumption is often quite high. The minimum daily supply is 200 litres potable water per person for drinking, cook ing, personal hygiene, cleaning etc. Stor age capacity should be large enough to supply these needs even if water deliv ery is inter - rupted. The storage tanks should be of equal size , and requi rements for total storage capacity depend on number of tanks and water production capacity, see 9.1.1. Safe, Sufficient and Good Potable Water Offshore 31 Figure 5.6: The remains of a bird col lected from offshore potable water tanks. The bird entered via the bunkering hose, got stuck in a valve, and spread to all the water tanks as it gradually decom posed (Photo: Anonymous in agreement with the company) If the water is stored too long, an unpleasant taste and odour may develop. Keep t he storage tanks in operation to prevent this, and do not store wa ter for more than 20 days. Un der normal operation the tanks cannot be emptied at the same time, and the minimum stor age reserve is two days of maxi - mum water con sumption. If the reserve under operation comes under 2 days of consumption, take non- conformity action , see 3.5. The regula - tions do not state minimum requirements for storage of bottled water, this is decided as part of the company 's emergency preparedness planning. 5.2.4 Hygienic barriers - preventing contamination A fundamental principle in Norwegian water supply, is the requirement for inde pendent hygienic barriers against the various con taminants that could occur in a potable water sys tem, see the Potable Water Regulations \u00a7 14. The barriers ensure that even if one barrier fails the water quality will still be satisfac tory, since the s econd barrier should not fail for the same reasons as the first one. The following are examples of hygienic barriers in a potable water system: Something preventing contamination of sea- water used in potable water supply, see 6.1.1. Something diluting se awater contamination to a harmless concentration before the water reach es the seawater inlets, see 6.1.2. Figure 5.7: A marked and protected chlorine tank with easy access (Photo: Eyvind Andersen) A treatment process removes or makes microbes harmless , breaking down, removing or thinning chemical and physical substances. See 6.2 and 6.3 regarding evaporation and reverse osmosis, and chapter 8, about water treatment in general. Precautions taken in the distribution system to prevent already treated water from being recontaminated , see chapter 9. Numerous types of pollution can influence the potable water quality from the seawater inlets throughout to the distribution system (figure 5.6). Securing two hygienic barriers against all types of pollution t hroughout the entire process is a demanding task. Important actions could be: Seawater inlet safety require restrictions in the discharge of polluted water from the offshore unit. The remaining wastewat er should be diluted and the seawater inlet located in the most suit able place acc ording to water depth, polluted discharge water and com mon current directions, see 6.1. These safe ty measures provide at least one bar rier against most types of chemical poll ution, and furthermore this is a premise for safe water production. Combined with safe water inlets, w ater prod - uction through evaporat ion or rev erse osmosis is considered as a barrier against most types of pollution. S till, note possible evaporation pro - blems with volatile substan ces, see chapter 6 . The hose connections and routines for bun ker- ing water from the onshore supply source rep- resent a weak ness in the delivery chain, but transport safety routines and flushing and taking water samples at the bunkering station can pro vide two barriers against physical and chemical substances , see chapter 7 . Transport and bunkering routines are import - ant but are not considered to be a reliable hygienic microbial barrier. Chlorinating the Safe, Sufficient and Good Potable Water Offshore 32 water when bunkering is therefore necessary in order to secure one barrier against microbes , see 7.2. The other microbe barrier is normally UV rad- iation of the water passing from storage tanks to the distribution system , see 8.3. It is vital to prevent the potable water from contamination on i ts wa y to the consumers. Atmospheric connections or equivalent solu ti- ons, see 9.2.5, prevent contamination from a variety of technical devices using potable wat - er. Avoid c ontamination via leakage or pollu- tion through chemical dosing tanks or air vents by placing tanks in areas sepa rated from other contamination sources. Suction risk due to differences in pressure in parts of the system should be evaluated. 5.2.5 Placing, marking and protecting the equipment Detailed descriptions are given in chapters 6 -10. According to the HSE regulations , the following general design requirements apply : Important operation equipment , valves , tanks etc. shall be marked and easily accessible. Design of technical equipment and work areas shall make maintenance operations easy. Protect t he equipment against pollution from other process equipment. Potable water pipes shall be physically secur - ed, clearly marked and colour -coded to make the following easy in case of an emergency, and to prevent coupling with other fluid syste ms by mistake etc. Figure 5.8: Short and self -draining test tap with sufficiently small pipe diameter . The short dist - ance from main pipe to valve eliminates stagnant water. By placing the outtake on the upper half of the pipe, trapping of particles is avoided. A short - er sample point end would have eased sample point disinfection (Photo: Eyvind Andersen) Secure t anks for additives by using screw caps or equivalent and mark to avoid polluti on by accident s etc. (figure 5. 7). Sections of the potable wat er system placed outdoors should be of non- corrosive material. The entire potable water system must be of a non-corrosive material adjusted to the corrosivity of the potable water, see 9.2.6. 5.2.6 Location and design of sample points In case problems in the potable water system occur, it is important to be able to locate the exact position of the problem and know how far it extends. A sufficient number of strategically placed sample points along the entire system are necessary. Place t hese sample points on bunke ring stations, storage tanks, and subsequent to each main component in the system, such as production unit, disinfection unit, alkali sing filter and other treatment units. Placing, marking and protection of equipment are described in 5.2.5, but t he following should be observed: Piping from the main pipeline to the sample valve should be as short as possible to avoid stagnant water. Piping after the sample valve should be self -draining, as short as possible and shaped to enable easy disinfection by means of chlorine, alcohol or heat , as otherwise they will contain stagn ant water and will be difficult to disinfect (figure 5.8) . An e nd cap on the pipe is recommended . 5.2.7 Paints and protective coatings Paints and coatings used in storage tanks have often contaminated the potable water by im proper use, shortened hardening processes or illegal use of thinners . The owner must be able to document that such products were used according to the manufa cturer's instruct ions, see 9.1.4. 5.3 System a lterati ons When parts of a potable water system are altered, recon struc ted or taken out of operation, it is necessary to assess whether the entire system still fulfils the requirements to offshore potable water systems. Significant changes must be reported to the au thorities, see Management Regulations \u00a7 25. Safe, Sufficient and Good Potable Water Offshore 33 6.Potable water production Potable water on an offshore unit is produced either by reverse osmosis or evaporation. Such water must be treated to become non -corrosive to the pipes and fittings, see 8.1. It is impor tant to make sure that the seawater used in the production is not polluted. If polluted seawater is susp ected, water production must cease. T he water production capacity should be suff ici- ent to cover potable water consumption and tech-nical water consumption (if any), even at low seawater temperatures (5 oC). Furthermore the production capacity should be large enough to cover re- filling of emptied tanks (with 2 x 100% production capacity, one unit can be used during normal operations, whilst the other is used in addition when tanks need to be re- filled) . 6.1 Seawater inlets A seawater system normally has two seawater in- lets. The water is pumped through seawater pipes for the various types of use, for instance firefight-ing water or production unit for potable water. The seawater must be protected against pollution. 6.1.1 Possible pollution threats Seawater used in the potable water production may be polluted by discharge from own or adj- acent offshore units or from ships. Do not produce water when the water is polluted or near harbours etc., and routines for closing of seawater inlets must be established for units with this possibility. The following pollutants are the most common: S anitary waste: Sewage and wastewater from liv - ing quarters contain nutrients and mic robes. If such elements enter the potable water system they can lead to growth of biofilm in storage tanks and pipes, problems with odour and taste, and in worst case, disease. Was te containing oil: Production water dis- charge, deck flushing water and oil waste from own or adjacent units, are potential sources for oil pollution. Such pollution can give an unpleasant odour and taste to the water even in very small quantities and may also damage production units. F igure 6.1: Intense plankton blooms, here observed in the North Sea from NASA's Earth Observatory, may occur from spring to autumn, and can sometimes cause problems with odour and taste on units that produce water ( Photo: NASA/Jesse Allen) C hemical discharge: This might come from the same sources as the oil waste and create the same type of problems. Volatile chemicals can pass an evaporator and the concentration might increase. G rowth of microorganisms: Periodically some organisms have an intense growth in seawater (figure 6.1). Some will emit v olatile components into the seawater , causing problems with odour and taste in the produced water. This occurs mostly from spring to autumn. Vertically separated seawater inlets can make it possible to use water from less affect ed depths. E lectrochlorination of sea chests: This method of marine growth prevention increases the risk of exceeding the limits for bromate, trihalometh anes etc. when water is produced through evaporation (in comparison: copper ionisation poses no such threat) . To minimise such problems, the comp any must make sure that the electrochlorination is performed without overdosing chlorine in periods with low seawater consumption. The company must also establish a sufficient analysis program-me to document that the electrochlorination is conducted without health risks. 6. 1.2 Placing seawater inlets Placing seawater inlets require documentation that the discharges from the unit will not cause unacc-eptable levels of pollution. For existing units , shell analyses may be used to assess influence. In order Safe, Sufficient and Good Potable Water Offshore 34 to assess the pollution threat, it is necessary to analyse the dis persal area using a recogni sed model, see Man agement Regulations \u00a7 16. If several of the factors listed below are uncertain, the safety limits shou ld be high. The following measures will prevent or reduce pollution: Seawater inlet s should be located as far away from the discharge points as technically feasible. When waves hit platform legs the result is a strong shift in the water masses (figure 6. 2). Discharge beneath the platform into turbulent wat - er masses can cause spreading and thin ning of pollution both horizontally and verti cally. Seawat - er inlet and discharge points should be located on separate platform sides , prefer ably the seawater inlet on the outside of the leg and the discharge on the inside. By placing seawater inlets deep down, the influence from the surface is slight, temperatures are low and fewer microbes exist. Placing seawater inlet s favourable to currents Place t he seawater inlets upstream of the discharge point, considering the most common current direction (figure 6. 3). Discharges with equal physical characteristics should be gathered together. A discharge with a different density than its surroundings can move significantly in a vertical dir ection before being diluted. A high den sity dis charge is therefore expected to sink, and should consequently be placed below the seawater inlets. On the other hand, a low density dis charge should be placed higher up. Vertical sepa ration of seawater inlets and discharge is easier to achieve on offshore units placed on the sea floor . Figure 6.2: Normally there is turbulence in the water around the pl atform legs. Seawater inlets should be placed where the dange r of pollution is minimal (Photo: Eyvind Andersen) Figure 6.3: Seawater inlets must not be pl aced downstream from the discharge points, taking into account the prevailing current direction. Inlets should not be placed on the same side of the unit as the discharge. The inlets, as illustra ted above, should be moved to the outside of the pontoons. (Illustration from B3 /NIVA's engineering office ) Design and size of discharge pipes are key elements in the way discharge water is spread and diluted. A pipe ending in many small holes (diffuser) will greatly increase dilution com pared to an open pipe with the same diameter. The concentration of pollutants will be lower with an efficient dilution. Several seawater inlet s operating separately should be installed. The unit should have at least two seawater inlets with a good separation. When local curren ts change so that polluted discharge water is directed towards the operational seawater inlet, use the other seawater inlet. Other seawater connections must be placed in a way that do not lead to contamination of the seawater pipe system by back -flow or back - suction. The seawater inlet can be secured by being the first connection on the seawater system and securing other branc hes against back flow, see 9.2.5. The best solution is to have clos eable seawater inlets for production of potable water . The se inlets should not be connected to the same sea chest that suppl ies machinery cooling water or other types of water consumption that may occur close to shore. Sea chests that are used close to shore are susceptible to biofilm formation which may contain Pseud omonas or other harmful microbes , which may contaminate the potable Safe, Sufficient and Good Potable Water Offshore 35 water system when water production is re -started . Such separation is par ticularly impor tant for units that have diving syst ems, as these are more vulnerable to the effects of contamina tion. For newbuilds this design is a requireme nt according to NMA potable water regulations section 11.2. 6.2 Evaporation Evaporation is the most common method used in potable water production on the Norwegian Conti - nental Shelf. The evaporation proc ess means that seawater is heated until it evaporates and then the vapor is cooled, resulting in fresh water. There are different types of evaporation units, but only va - cuum disti llation will be described here, see figure 6.4, this being about the only ty pe of evaporation unit in use on the Norwegian Continental Shelf. When pressure is reduced, the evaporation tem pe- rature is lowered to between 30 and 60 o C. Seawater is pre -heated in a heat exchanger with hot distillate. The feed water is then led into the condenser where the water accumulates conden - sation energy from the steam. Heated feed water is led into an evaporator and heated with an external sourc e to start the vapori sation process (figure 6.5). Hot water, steam or electricity is used as a heating source. For units with plenty of hot cool - ing water, for example from diesel engines, this could be used in heating the water, and in such cases evaporation will be a less exp ensive prod- uction process than reverse osmosis. The low evaporation temper ature reduces problems with boiler scale and reduces the need for chemicals. Figure 6.4: Design principals for a vacuum distillation unit (Illustration from B3/NIVA's engineering office) Figure 6.5: Shows the inside of an e vaporator. The net prevents seawater drops from passing on to the distillate (Photo: Bj\u00f8rn L\u00f8fsgaard) If the seawater is polluted, substances more vola ti- le than water may pass the evaporator while ot her substances and micro bes only pass in case of uneven boiling, operation failure etc. As only some of the feed water evaporates, while it is assumed that all vola tile sub stances will evapo ra- te, this can result in con centration of such com po- nents in the produced water. When the seawater is electroch lorinated prior to evaporation, see 6.1.1, problems with chlor ine and bromine comp ounds like bromate and trihalomethanes may occ ur see 4.3.4. Such problems may be minimised through better operation of the electro chlorina tion, and by reducing the effe ct of the evapo rator, thus producing clean er water. V olatile sub stances can be removed , see 8.4. 6.3 Reverse osmosis Reverse osmosis is a process where seawater is forced under high pressure against a membrane with microscopic openings. The water m olecules will pass the membrane but most of the salt and other contaminants will be held back. Potable water produced by reverse osmosis will often have a higher salt concentration than water produced by evaporation. Production costs for an evaporation process are normally higher than for reverse osmosis. The higher the salt concentration is, the more corrosive water, and it is therefore important to use high quality pipe s in the system, see 8.1 . Safe, Sufficient and Good Potable Water Offshore 36 Figure 6.6: P rocess principles for osmosis and reverse os mosis (Illustration from B3/NIVA's engineering office) The principles for osmosis and reverse osmosis are shown in figure 6.6. When two solutions with different salt concentrations are separated by a se - mi-permeable membrane, the water with the lower salt concentration will flow towards the water with the stronger salt concentration. This process is called osmosis. The water level remains higher on the side with the high concentration of salt. The difference between water levels is called an osmotic pressure. In reverse osmosis the pres sure applied on the salt concentration is higher than the osmotic pressure. Fresh water will consequent ly flow from the high salt concentra tion into the lower salt concentration. Because the seawater salt content increases during the process, the concen - trate must be drained into the waste water system and new seawater supplied. Except for boron, see supplementary analyses in 4.3.4, r everse osmosis is safer than evapo ration in eliminating contamination but if the membr anes are damaged microbes and other substan ces can slip through. Membranes vary in design, see figure 6.7. To avoid damage to the mem branes by pollutants in the seawater , the wat er requires treat - ment. C hlorine is often added in the seawater inlets t o reduce algae/bac terial growth in the syst- em. C hlorine residues can dam age the membranes , but this can be avoided with an active carbon filter or by using sodium bisulphite . The feed water m ay contain particles too small to be stopped in the seawater inlet filter, but large enough to clog the fibre membranes. Partic les down to 5 micrometers must be removedby using different filter types . To reduce the manual maintenance work, the flushing and cleaning process should be automat ed. Some membranes will break if pressurised in the wrong direction and must be protected against this. Figure 6.7: Reverse osmosis unit . The membranes lay coiled within the white tubes on the right (Photo: Eyvind Andersen ) 6.4 Conductivity control To ensure that water produc ed by evaporation or reverse osmosis is safe enough, conductivity is measured at the production unit outlet. Seawater has a high conductivity level, and a possible malfunction in the production process can be detected by a rise in the conductivity (figure 6.8). The conductivity meter, also called a salinometer, is placed at the production unit outlet. Conductivity determines the quantity of salt in the water. The limits are 6 mS/m for the evaporation process and 75 mS/m for reverse osmosis. If the limits a re exceeded, the water dis tribution to the tanks should be stopped and the alarm activated, as this indicate s that the system is not operating as it should. Conductivity is described under chapter 4.3.1. Figure 6.8: A conductivity meter automatically measures salt content in produced water and dumps it if the 6 mS/m limit is exceeded (Photo: Eyvind Andersen) Safe, Sufficient and Good Potable Water Offshore 37 Figure 6.9: Evaporator with two independently controlled (blue colour) dumping valves (Photo: Eyvind Andersen) There have been several inciden ts where mal func- tions in conductivity meters or dump valves have resulted in saltwater contamina tion of the potable water . This is a hygienic problem and requires much work to reestablish good potable water quality. The NMA potable water regulations section 6.6 now require s that water prod uction units are equipped with two stages of con ductivity metering and dumping (figure 6.9) . The conductivity meter shows the conductivity in mS/m, S/cm or as ppm sea salt = S/cm = 4.6 mg/l NaCl) . The con ductivity meter should be a type where the setting can be adjusted and controlled. 6.5 Use of chemicals All substances used in the potable water process should be certified, see 2.4. Filling pipes used for adding chemicals should have close -fitting caps to avoid contamination. Evaporator operation requires the use of chemi - cals. The chemical can either be added contin-uous ly, for example scale inhibitor added to the feed water to prevent boiler scale on hot surfaces, or intermittently, such as in the cleaning process. Chemicals are also used indirectly as the heating medium for the evaporator often contains hot water or steam, to which the chemicals are added to prevent boiler scale, c orrosion and possible freezing. Except for anti -scalants, chemicals are seldom continuously add ed in an osmotic process. Periodically , chemicals a re used to clean the membranes and for pre servation as membranes can easily be damaged when not in use. Safe, Sufficient and Good Potable Water Offshore 38 7 Bunkering potable water When bunkering water from supply vess els, it is difficult to have full control of the water quality . The water may be contaminated when delivered to the supply vessel (figure 7. 1) or contami nated during trans port to the offshore unit. Conta mina - tion can happ en both on board the supply vessel and in the bunkering process through for example dirty hoses. Tests at the bunkering station have occasionally revealed pol lution by seawater , hydrocarbons etc. All water delivered by supply vessels is of uncer - tain quality , regardless of prec autions taken by the supplier and recipient. The biggest uncertainty is connected to microbiological contamination, as it is not practically possible to take such samples when bunker ing. Consequently , it is important that all potable water is disinfected during bunkering . Frequently , the colony count increases in the entire potable water system after bunkering. Check the disinfection units and control routines, as each disinfection unit should be able to deactivate the majority of microbes in the water independently . The risk of bunkering inferior quality water is reduced if the owner require s that supply bases (figure 7.2) and supply vessels have good routines in drawing and transporting the potable water, in addition to satisfactory cleaning and mainte nance of the storage tanks, see appendix 6. Figure 7.1: Bunk ering station on onshore supply base. Water may be polluted prior to entering the supply base, and if supply base routines are weak, both hose connections and hoses may be contami - nated (Photo: Eyvind Andersen) Figure 7.2: This supply base has a water tank that fills up slowly, whilst still providing rapid filling for supply vessels. This way a flushing effect for the water mains is avoided, resulting in cleaner water ( Photo: Eyvind Andersen) 7.1 Design of bunkering system, including water circulation Figure 7. 3 shows a bunkering system with the possi bility for circulating water from one storage tank, through to the chlorination unit and back to the same storage tank without feeding the water into the distribution system. The numbers in the text below refer to details in the figure. Interlocks or other measures ensure that wa ter is bunkered and circulated into other tanks than the one that suppl ies accommodation . An offshore unit should have t wo bunkering sta ti- ons to facilitate maintenance , preferably placed on each side of the unit, t o increas e the possibility to bunker during bad weather conditions. Design the bunkering pipe system to ensure complete drain age after bunkering. Mark b oth bunke ring stations and hoses to avoid confusion with hose s for other liquids , and keep the bunkering stations for potable water separate from bunkering stations for other types of fresh water. Bunkering hoses (1) are either coiled up on a drum, or hang down the sides of the unit. The couplings are suscepti ble to pollution from seawater , various processes on board and pollution from birds. Dead birds have been found in potable water pipes so it is important to cover the hose ends (figure 7.4) . It is also impo rtant that the hoses are equipped with a floating device to prevent them from contact with the supply vessel propellers. Hose connections for potable water should be of a distinct design to prevent contamination by conn ecting the wrong hoses. Safe, Sufficient and Good Potable Water Offshore 39 Figure 7.3: B unkering system with recirculation pipe (Illustration: Karin Melsom) 7.4 hose with safely secured end-cap (Photo: Eyvind Andersen) Bunkering hoses are normally made of rubber, and may act as \"food\" for m icrobes. Dark col - oured hoses with mois ture inside warm up quickly in sunlight, resulting in excellent growing condi ti- ons for mic robes. Flush hoses thoroughly before each bunkering , and after bunker ing they should be drain ed before they are hang ed and stored (figure 7. 5). Hoses are difficult to clean and should there fore be regularly replaced . At the connec tion point for the bunkering hose a flush pipe (2) should be installed as well as a shut - off valve downstream on the feed pipe (3). Sudden increase in water flow results in contami nants be - ing dis lodged from the walls of pipes and hoses. To prevent an increase in water flow after flush - ing, the flush water pipe must have at least the same dimension as the bunker ing pipe . Design bunkeri ng stations to prevent ope rating per sonnel or the supply vessel crew from being sprayed with water during flush ing. The test tap (4) is placed in front of the shut -off val ve on the flush water pipe. It may be lo cated on the feed pipe and should be easily access ible for sam pling. Dis charge old pot - able water from storage tanks (5) befor e bunker - ing. This will wash out the sedi ment and make chlorination more effective , see 7.2, reduc ing the amount of chlor ination by -products, since the water is chlorinated only once , see 4.1.2. A chlorine -dosing pump (6) is connec ted to the bunkering pipe system , see 8.2.4. The best mixing ratios are achieved if the chlorine pump is con trol- led by a flow -meter. Bunkering pipe s should be designed in a way that enhan ces water circulation in the tank (7), for ex ample by separating the inlet and outlet, and by pointing the inlet in a direction that enhance circ ulation of the total tank volume. This will result in more efficient chlorination of the wat er as the chlor ine also reach es any \"old\" water in the stor age tank, and will help with recirculation .

Both hoses in the pic ture have floating devices to prevent entangling in the supply vessel propellers (Photo: Eyvind Andersen) Test taps (8) make it possible to samp le the chlo r- inated water in the tanks without simultaneously feeding it to the consum ers. Test taps should be easily accessible. Operati on, maintenance, design and other requirements for storage tanks are described in detail in chapter 9. A large ca pacity circulation pump (9) can provide fast circu lation of water from one storage tank, via the chlor ination unit and back to the same tank, without having to distribute it . Sim ultaneous ly, water will have to be dis tributed to the net work from another tank. This makes it easy to dose extra chlorine to bunkered water that have recei - ved too litt le chlorine during bunkering . With out this option, bunkered water with no resi dual chlorine after bunkering will have to be dumped and tanks refilled , increas ing the risk of run ning out of water. C irculation is en hanced by sepa ra- ting the tank inlet and outlet. Low point drains on the bunkering and circulation pipes (10) make it possible to avoid stagnant water after bunkering. 1. 2. Figure 7.6: Pouring chlorine directly into storage tanks may result in lack of chlorination in parts of the tank and overdosing in other parts (Illustrati - on: Bj\u00f8rn L\u00f8fsgaard). Figure 7.7: The flow meter display is visible to the right , and the chlorine hose and dosing point to the left ( Photo: Eyvind Andersen) 7.2 Disinfection requirements Disinfection of potable water is done by adding chlorine. Chlorination is described in detail in chap ter 8.2. To achieve sufficient disinfection, the chlorine must be well mixed with the water. It should be evenly distributed in the water flow during the entire bunkering proc ess. T he shape of offshore potable water tanks may result in inadequately disinfected water, because of insuf - ficient mixing when chlorine is poured directly into storage tanks before bunkering (figure 7.6). To achieve the best possible chlorine -water mix - ture in the entire tank, it is best to start the filling process with tanks being as empty as possible. This will also contribute to reducing the levels of chlorination by -products, see 4.1.2. 7.2.1 Flow meter -regulated dosing A flow meter on the bunkering pipe adjust s the chlorine pump speed (figure 7.7) . The pump doses a calcu lated amount of chlor ine per cubic met re water . To chlor inate bunkered water adequately, adjust the con centration of the solution. If bunkering is always into an empty tank, the same chlorine concentra tion can be used ea ch time. When bunker ing to a tank with residual wat er (avoid if possible), the chlorine concen tration should either be increased to chlorinate the resi du- al water as well, or the volume of chlorine that th e flow meter is set to give must be adjusted. 7.2.2 Manually -regulated pump dosing This method offers greater flexibility in choosing the concentration of chlorine. If the chlorine solu-tion is concentrated, the pump speed is slow, and if the chlorine s olution is diluted the speed is in- creased. Use a diluted chlorine solution, since this will result in a better mixing of the chlorine in the bunkering water stream, due to higher speed and volume of the injected chlorine water. When using Safe, Sufficient and Good Potable Water Offshore 41 a manu ally-regulated pump it is necessary to know how long the bunkering will take, and adjust the chlorinat ion pump speed to deliver the necessary chlo rine dose for the entire time span. If bunkering to a tank with residual water (avoid if possi ble), enough chlor ine should be added to chlorinate the residual water as well. This can be achieved by increasing the chlorine pump speed or by increasing the concentration of chlorine solution. 7.3 Bunkering procedures Appendix 10 gives advice for bunkering. These issue s are further discussed below . 7.3.1 Prior to bunkering Before bunkering starts, an adequate amount of chlorine solution with the correct concentration should be prepared, see calculation examples in appendix 11. Adjust t he dosing acc ording to exper ience from previous bunkering to achiev e a sufficient chlorine residue relevant to the water quality being bunkered, see 7.4. The chlorine amount is adjusted by changing chlorine concen-tration or through modification of the volume of chlorine solution being added. If the pump is not flow meter -regulated, calculate the dosing speed, see appendix 11, as the dosing shall be uniform during all the bunkering time. Figure 7.8: Dumping of potable water from tank. Dump \"old\" water prior to bunkering. This applies to both supply vessels and offshore units (Photo: Eyvind Andersen) Figure 7.9: When flush valve and the bunkering hose have corresponding diameters the system can be flushed with maximum pressure. (Photo: Eyvind Andersen) Make sure that all valves are in correct positions , see 3 -6 in appendix 10. Bunke ring should always be done to tanks as empty as possible (figure 7. 8). This is particularly important when bun kered water has a high content of orga nic mat erial. If it is possible to dump the residual water in the tanks prior to bunkering, it will make the chlor ination procedure easier and reduce problems with colony counts , chlorination by -products and other pollution of tanks and pipe system. 7.3.2 Bunkering Bunkerin g starts by flushing the hose and piping a few minutes under maximum press ure (figure 7.9). After flushing , take a sample to deter mine colour, odour , taste, clarity , conductivity and pH of the water , see require ments in chapter 4.3.2. As odour , taste and clarity are subjective , let two in - dividuals share this responsibility. Water that does not fulfil the requirements sh ould be rejected (fig- ure 7.10) . If a supply vessel delivers water from more than one tank, take sampl es from each tank . If the water is acceptable, the bunkering can start. Safe, Sufficient and Good Potable Water Offshore 42 7.3.3 After bunkering Isolate t he storage tanks for 30 minutes after bunkering, then test a sample should for the free chlorine. The results should be bet ween 0.1 and 0.5 mg/l , see 4.3.1. The free chlor ine evapor ates some time. It is impor tant to take sampl es within a reasonably short time, otherwise it might be im possible to document that the water is disinfected. If no free chlorine is found after 30 minutes, the water must either be dumped or more ch lorine added by circulating the tank content via the chlo-rination system, if the unit design permits this, see 7.1. T he water should cir culate until the chlorine is mixed properly, and another sam ple taken 30 minutes later. Repeat until free residual chlorine can be mea sured. This prac tice is not ideal, since it might be difficult to mix the chlor ine in the water. Set the chlorine dosage higher than the minimum requirements to avoid such unfor tunate situations. A im for a free chlorine level o f 0.3 mg/l after 30 minutes. If the concentration of free chlorine is too high, dilute the water with water from other storage tanks. The water can also be stored before consumption. The chlorine concentra tion will then decrease. There is no health haza rd involved by using water with a chlor ine concen tration up to 5.0 mg/l, but the water will not be according to the potable water regulations as it will smell and taste of chlor ine, and this should be avoided if poss ible. If the water must be used, t he crew should be infor med of the situation beforehand, see appendi x 12 about disinfection of pipe systems. There have been several incidents where supply vessels deliberately or accidentally have delivered water of good quality water for testing before switch ing to a tank with sub- standard water with -out informing the offshore unit. Some quick and simple tests after bunkering may detect this and prevent further piping contamination. The water is evaluated visually (clear, without noticeable col - our) an d tested for odour , taste and conductivity . 7.4 Logging Keep a log of the various details in the bunkering procedure , which allows adjust ments ahead of the next bunkering. Experience shows that many water quality problems are con nected to bunkering, eit her due to poor water quality from the water source, or because the bunkering process is inadequate. The bunkering log is an important tool in solving such problems. Appendix 5 shows an example of such a log. Figure 7.10: Determination of odour , taste and clarity must take place indoors and under strong light to have any value (Photo: Eyvind Andersen) Safe, Sufficient and Good Potable Water Offshore 43 8. Water treatment Both bunkered water and water produced from seawater must be treated to meet the qua lity requirements in the r egulations . In thi s chapter the most frequently used methods are described. All additives to the potable water, such as chlorine, filter material, etc. have to be certified, see 2. 4. Potable water produced from seawater must be treated to make it less corrosive, see 8.1. A ll off - shore potable water must be disinfected through chlorination and UV radiation, see 8.2 and 8.3. Bunkered potable water is disinfected by adding chlorine during bunkering. In addition, both bunk-ered and produced water should be disinfected as it is being distributed to the consumers. The NIPH no longer recommends disinfection only by use of chlorine, as UV treatment has been proven to be more effective against some microbes, see 8.3. Chlorine has advantages, both when disinfecting pipes and tanks, and its effect is easily verified by measuring chlorine residue. 8.1 Corrosion control Corrosion in a potable water system means that the water attacks metal in the piping system, treat - ment units and fittings . Corro sion causes, their chemistry and heal th consequences are described in chapter 4.2.3. Corro sion-reducing water treatments are described below. The most common method in offshore corros ion control is to let the water pass through a dolomite mass or limestone filter. Sodium silicate has a lso been used with good results to prevent corrosion, and does not require any filter. 8.1.1 Alkaline filter Alkaline filters are known by different names, for example palatability filter, limestone filter and re - hardening filter. The filters may be designed in several ways and using a range of filter materials. Units with CO 2-dosing ahead of the alkaline filter will increase the calcium/hydrogen carbonate content (HCO 3-), and stabili se the pH within the most favourable limits. Units without CO 2-dosing will have more fluctuation in the pH level both in production and in the pipe system. Figure 8.1: Design t he filter with easy access for cleaning, changing of filter mass and maintenance (Illustration : Karin Melsom) Design Figure 8 .1 shows a filter with the inlet at the top and the outlet at the bottom. This type of filter must always be designed for return flushing. The flush water is led from the distribution net in to the bottom filter, lifting the masses, and is then discharged via the flush drain. High pressure is necessary when flushing. Using the same pump that feeds the water through the filter during nor - mal operation does not always result in adequate pressure. The flush water has to be of potable wat - er quality. The filter must be designed wit h a fill- ing hatch and a drain hatch, and these must have large enough openings to give easy access for fill - ing and emptying the filter and for internal main - tenance. Dolomite filter (half -burnt dolomite) Filters with half -burnt dol omite are the most compact and are therefore often used offshore. The water passes through the half -burnt dolomite, Ca(CO 3)MgO, and part of the mass dissolves in the water. By dosing CO 2-gas to the water prior to the filter, a higher hardness and alkali sation are achieved, simultaneously stabili sing the pH level around 8. Without the CO 2-gas, this filter mass can result in extremely high pH levels (pH 11 -12), and is therefore not advisable. The effects of the Filling hatch Inlet valve From water production unit By-pass valve Outlet valve To po table water tanks Test tap Shut off valve Drain valve Drain hatch From potable water pump Flush/Vent valve Drain Safe, Sufficient and Good Potable Water Offshore 44 filter mass decrease after a while. To begin wit h, a rapid release of MgO results in high pH values, while aged masses mainly contain CaCO 3, which is less soluble in water and thereby less effective. Limestone filter/marble filter Crushed limestone (CaCO 3, marble) is used in the same way as dolomite, but being less soluble and due to its chemical composition, the pH level will not reach as high levels as the dolomite. New fil - ter mass will bring the pH value up to around 8.5 without adding CO 2, and with CO 2 pH it stabilis es around 8. To obtain a suffi cient solution of lime - stone, it is important to have a large contact sur f- ace. A particle size of 1 -3 mm and a filter depth of at least 1 m are common. It is also important that the strain on the filter is not too intense, resul ting in an insufficient c ontact period. Marble filters are easy to operate, and have the advantage, compared to other methods, of keeping the pH below the maximum limit. Marble must be reple nished regularly to maintain an even mass grading. Operation and maintenance Maintain the filter to ensure suffici ent water quality , according to the vendor's instructions . Most filter s must be back flushed to prevent clogging and to remove dirt , and refilled to ensure that they always are at least 75% full. Some sub- stances in the mass do not dissolve, and conse - quently accu mulate in the filter . Some will be flushed out during return flushing , but after a while the tanks have to be emptied of these sub - stances before refilling with new filter mass. Due to poor mainte nance, microbes might settle in the filter mass, causing high colony counts in the potable water tank s. Empty, clean and disinfect the filter at least once a year, like other parts of the potable water system. 8.1.2 Sodium s ilicate Adding sodium silicate reduces corrosion. Experi - ence with sodium silicate is mixed, but it can give similar corrosion protection as alkali sation. The effect depends on the water qua lity and material in the pipe system. Using sodium silicate is especially useful in a pipe system of acid -proof stainless steel , where the feeding pipes to drain taps are made of copper. If sodium sili cate is used in systems with galvanis ed iron, the corrosion compounds are washed away into the water before the water quality stabilises . Sodium silicate functions best in acid and soft water. Necessary sodium silicate dosage escalates with increased concentration of salts and increas - ing hardness and temperature in the water. The precise mechanism in this process is not well known. Silicate ions can prevent metal i on deposits like trivalent iron, thereby reducing rust cluster s in iron and steel pipes. Sodium silicate can also grow a film of precipitated silicic acid and metal silicates on the pipe surfaces, and eventually prevent corrosion. Sodium silicate is supp lied dissolved in water, and must be certified, see 2.4. Dosing is normal ly done with a f lowmeter -regulated pump. This syst - em is easier to use than alkalising filters, and the risk of microbiological growth is avoided. Place the dosing point after UV uni ts. 8.2 Disinfection by chlorination Chlorine is still the most commonly used disinfectant of potable water worldwide, and chlorination of potable water offshore does not pose any health risks , see 4.1.2. Off shore, cal sodi um hypo chlorite (NaOCl) are used. The two form the same active chlorine combinations in water, hypo chlor ous acid (HOCI) and hypochlorite ion (OCI). These two active chlorine compounds in water are called \"free chlorine\". Free chlorine is unstable, and reacts wit h organic material or is reduced to chloride. The amount of organic material is higher in bunkered water, consequently requi ring more chlorine to disinfect the water. Chlorine may also react with ammonia -form ing chloramines, so called \"combine d chlorine\", which has a slow disinfecting effect and may cause \"swimming pool odour\" . Figure 8.2: Water discoloured by humic material needs more chlorine than clear water to achieve a proper disinfection (Photo: Bj\u00f8rn L\u00f8fsgaard) Safe, Sufficient and Good Potable Water Offshore 45 The effect of chlorine is a function of concentrati - on x time, and the higher the concentration, the shorter time is needed for disinfection. Chlorine inactivates bacteria by attacking the cell wall, penetrating the cell and destroying the en zyme systems. Viru ses are inactivated by attack ing the protein mantle, disrupting its ability to attack and destroying the genetic material. As chlorine needs a certain time for these proces ses, the pota ble water r egulations require a free chlorine lev el of at least 0.05 mg/l after 30 minutes of contact. This is sufficient, even with the low concentration that is recommended for disinfection in Norway. Experience show s that it may be difficult to ver ify concentrations below 0.1 mg/l with normal off - shore equi pment . To achieve a best poss ible effect of the chlorine, it should be added as early as pos - sible in the bunkering process. If free chlor ine content above 0.05 mg/l after 30 min utes cannot be confirmed, the water is not satisfactorily disin - fected. Re ject t he water unless th e potable water system is equip ped to mix in extra chlorine, see 7.3.3. C alculat ion of chlorine amounts and mixing of chlor ine solutions etc., are described in appendix 11. 8.2.1 The significance of water quality The colour of the water reveals a lot about the content of chlorine consuming organic materials (humic substances), though iron may also cause colour (figure 8.2). The chlorine dose needed to kill mic robes must be increased in water with high content of organic material , in order to maintain the required chlorine level after 30 minutes of contact time. Generally it is sufficient to add 1 gram chlor ine per ton (= 1 m 3), equivalent to 1 mg chlorine per litre. Predict ing the amount of chlorine needed is often a greater p roblem for waterworks onshor e than offshore, as water quality onshore fluctuates more than it does of fshore. Offshore -produced water needs less chlorine treatment, because the colour is checked already at the bunkering point and the water is refused if the colour is unaccept able. Unlike many other countries, Norway has a trad - ition of not accepting water tasting of chlor ine. The free residual chlorine in the water sh ould not exceed 0.5 mg/l after treatment, with the excep ti- on of disinfection of the pi pe system, see 9.2.9. Generally, unpleasant smell of chlorine will inten - sify with increased amount of organic mate rial in the water, as some o rganic /nitric chlor ine com p- ounds have a pungent smell and taste. Tests show that chlorine is 50 times more effect - tive in fighting bacteria in acid than in alka line water. With a pH<7, the main part of the chlorine content is chlorous acid (HOCl), while the less active hypochlorite ion (OCl -) dominates at a level of pH>8. Consequently, disinfection preferably should be done before the water is alkalised . 8.2.2 Sodium hypochlorite Sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) is sold in liqu id form and is therefore easy to use. Sodium hypo - chlorite has a limited shelf life, especially if ex po- sed to light and/or heat, causing the active chlor - ine compound to break down and weaken its effect. If free chlorine is not found in the water after 30 minutes of treatment, the cause is often that the sodium hypochlorite solution is too old. In a newly mixed solution the concentrati on is usually 160- 170 gram/litre, and is called 15 % solution. Because it breaks down during storage, it is safer to assume it is 10 % instead of 15 %. 15% sodium hypochlorite should not be stored longer than 3 months after production date, but when refrigerated it may be good for 6 months. Some vendors supply chlor ine of lower concentration that may be stored longer. The chlorine solution can be added to the water without premixing, but if the chlorine pump has sufficient capa city, dosing a larger volume give s better control of the process. Sodium hypochlorite is a strong alkaline solution (pH 10- 11), and pre - cauti ons must be taken. It is particu larly important to protect eyes and skin. Bottles with eye rins ing water should be kept within reach. Clothes are also easily ruined by chlorine. Follow i nstructions carefully read and use face protection, rubber apron, rubber gloves and other protective items as suggest ed in the instruction data sheet. Accidents in ope ration of swimming pools have be en repor t- ed, where sodium hypo chlor ite has been mixed with acid to form chlor ine gas, which is extremely poisonous. Such acci dents are not known to have happened in connec tion with potable water, but it is advisable to be aware of the potential dan ger when storing and using such chemicals. Safe, Sufficient and Good Potable Water Offshore 46 Figure 8.3: Flow meter -controlled chlorination unit (Photo: Eyvind Andersen ) hypochlorite can by sodium chloride electrolysis (NaCl), so called electrochlorination . Several offshore units use electrochlorination on the seawater inlet to stop marine growth. It is important to be aware of the fact that chlorous acid evaporates at a lower temperature than water, and will result in higher concentration in water produced in an evaporator. This can cause problems with taste, odour and unwanted by -products, see 6.2. 8.2.3 Calcium hypochlorite Dry c alcium hypochlorite (Ca(OCl) 2) has an al - most unlimited shelf life . Dissolved in water, the chlorine will break down in about the same man n- er as sodium hypochlorite. For work e nviron- ment s, the same precautions as for sodium hyp o- chlorite should be taken, see 8.2.2, but it should also be noted that the chemical must be stored safely as it may cause explosions and fires if mixed with some other chemicals . Normally the chemical contains 6 0-65 % chlorine but is often labelled with a content of 70 %. It contains 2 - 10 % insol uble components , and causes sedi men- tation in storage tanks . Separate these components before dosi ng to prevent clogging of nozzles. Alternatively , lift the suction hos es to the chlorine -dosing pump high enough to pre vent suction of the bottom deposits. 8.2.4 Design The biggest challenge in chlorination is to ensure uniform mixing of chlorine in a ll the water. T he NMA po table water r egulations section 6.3 require that the chlorine -dosing unit is perma- nently connected to the bunkering system, and it is favourable to have the dosing point located as near the begin ning of the bunkering system as possible, in order t o achieve best possible mixing. If chlorine is used for dis infecting produced pot - able water as well, add the chlorine before the water reaches the alkaline filter, since chlorine is most effective in acid ic water. It must be possible to add mix in more chlorine after finish ing bunkering, and this is normally done through a circulation system. The unit should have short pipelines and hoses with small dimension from chlorine tank to bun-kering pipeline. Chlorine pumps and tanks must have a capacity that corresponds with the chlorine solution volume to be used, and the dosing unit must correspond with the water quan tities deliv er- ed by the supply vessel with the max imum pump capacity. The chlorine tank must be marked and leak-proof, it s water supplied from the potable water system, and have an easy to reach drain valve with a closed drainage system. If cal cium hypochlorite is used, the tanks should be equipped with a stirring device to dissolve the powder. The best chlorine mixing is achieved if the speed of the chlorination pump is control led by a flow meter, recording the speed of the water transferred to the storage tanks (figure 8.3). Experience with such controlled dosing is good, because it is easy to dose the correct chlorine amount into the entire water mass being bunkered. Chances for mistakes are reduced , as the chlorine -dosing stops if the bunker ing is interrupted. With a manually -con- trolled pump there is no such con trol of the chlo - rine-dosing following the water bun kering flow. New units, and rehabilitation of existing units, should be designed with flow meter -controlled dosing, see the Facilities Regulations \u00a7 10. 8.2.5 Operation and maintenance One advantage of chlorine disinfection is the sim- plicity of the equ ipment. But even simple equip- ment may fail. This may be due to the corro sive effects of chlorine, or due to squeezing or block- ing of the hoses feed ing the chlor ine. The entire chlorination unit should be checked and cleaned regularly. The NIPH recommends that this is done at least every three months. If calcium hypo chlor - ite is being used, sediment will form in the tank, requiring more frequent inspection and cleaning. Safe, Sufficient and Good Potable Water Offshore 47 It is important to make sure that the pump suction is satisfactory, and that the chlorine does actually reach the water. It may happen that a pump only sucks in air and not the chlorine. Essential spare parts should always be available. Chlorine pumps are cheap compared to the consequences of inferior chlorination, and an extra chlorine pump should always in stock. The following describes common causes when free residual chlorine is not present 30 minute s after bunkering is completed: Defect pump/chlorine hose squeezed/air in dosing pipe Too little chlorine added The sodium hypochlorit e is too old Insufficient chlorine mixing Organic material content in the water too high Some offshore potable water tests have shown free chlorine concentration way above the level of total chlorine. Such test res ults are in correct. 8.3 Disinfection by UV radiation Ultraviolet rays are part of the sun light spectr um and are divided into UV A, -B and -C radiation. UV light is harmful to skin and eyes. Hum ans are exposed to UV from the sun and from man- made UV sources like welding flames and solariums. UV C is the most harmful type of radiation. Fortunately, the atmosphere filters away UV C and the greater part of the UV B radiation. To inactivate microbes, a high dose UV C radiati on is needed. The UV dose is a function of radi ation intensity and t ime of exposure. Most offshore units use both chlorine and UV in their water treatment. One advantage of UV disinfection , compared to chlorination, is that UV is more effective against some microbes like Giar - dia and Cryptosporidium parasites. 8.3.1 The importance of water quality Coloured and particle -containing water can cause problems with UV disinfection , see 4.2.2, becau se the intensity in the cham ber drops , thereby red u- cing the UV dose. However, col oured water can be disinfected by exten ding the radiation time and thus increasing the UV dose . Figure 8.4: During bunkering or in unstable weath er, particles and sediments in the potable water tanks can be stirred up and sucked into the distribution system, reducing the effect of the UV radiation. (Photo: Bj\u00f8rn L\u00f8fsgaard) Partic les in the water may \"con ceal\" micro bes. This is particularly problem atic if tank sediments are sucked into the potable water inlet (figure 8.4). During bunkering or unstable weat her con ditions tank sediment s may be stirre d up. Avoid e xceed - ing the particle limit (tur bidity above 1 FNU) by installing partic le filter s prior to UV unit s. Chemical parameters such as iron and manganese may cause deposits on the quartz glass es reducing the UV radiation intensity. The same may happen with calcium from the alkalising filter. Regular cleaning is therefore important. There have been some examples of problems with smell after UV disinfection because an odourless compound has been oxidized into something that smells. This has been reported due to unlawful thinner use when painting water tanks, where toluene has been oxidised into benzaldehyde. Figure 8.5: This UV unit has two radiation chamb ers, each with a control panel (white) and an U V sensor (on the front). The black valve closes if the radiation falls below the alarm level.

The figure is based on wate r quality data from a large number of Norwegian water sources (Illustration: Karin Melsom) 8.3.2 Design, dimension ing and NIPH- evaluation The UV unit (figure 8.5) is the last treatment before the water is distributed , and must be suff- iciently designed an d dim ensioned for maxi mum water supply and for the worst poss ible water quality regarding colour and turbidity. The NIPH evaluates UV unit s, see 2.4. Only use biodosimetrically tested UV unit s When building new offshore units, and when repl- acing old UV unit s, only install biodosimetrically tested UV unit s that give an UV dose of 40 mWs/ cm 2. Offshore , use the best available technology available, and these UV unit s have better systems for operation and control than units approved accor ding to old me thods . They also create a barr - ier against bacterial spores (alternatively a spore barrier may be ach ieved by filtration through mem branes with nominal pore op enings less than 100 nanomet res). The units app roved with an effect of 30 mWs/cm2 should grad ually be phased out on older offshore units. Lists of app roved UV units are available on www.fhi.no/offshore . Redundancy is necessary To ensure the availability of disinfected water, the UV unit must have at least two radiation chamb ers in par allel, each able to disinfect 100% of the supplied water. With three chambers , each must cover at least 50% of the water. This allows for safe disinfect ion, even when one chamber is out of use due to t echnical errors or main tenance. If a cham ber has less than 100% capacity, the flow must be physi cally limited to the maxi mum ca pa- city, and this must be documented through flow metering ; having two 50% chamber s in parallel operation is unsafe unless the water is divided evenly . Design for peak daily consumption Maximum supply is normally much higher than the average water consumption, as the cons ump- tion varie s, and the UV unit must be designed for peak flow. However, excess capacity in addition to this will lead to UV unit s that are large and costly. If pumps and piping systems can supply more water than the disinfection capacity of the UV unit , flow -restricting devices should be fitted. Prevent turbid water The turbidity of water that is to be tr eated with UV must be less than 1 FNU. If higher turbidity values occur, install a particle filter. Turbidity problems may occur due to bunker ing, change of tanks or corrosion. M ost off shore units will need a particle filter in the potable water system (maximum pore size 50 micrometers) . Design for coloured bunkered water All offshore units may have to bunker water . Acc- eptable water from Norwegian waterworks may have colour up to 20 mg Pt/l. The UV transmiss - ion (remaining UV radiation after having passed through the wat er) of this water may be be low 30 %/5 cm , see fig ure 8.6. When installing an UV unit, make sure that is has suff icient capa city even when the UV transmiss ion is 30%/5 cm. In the list of ap proved biodosi metrically teste d UV unit s, column 2 contains infor mation of which capacity each unit has at the low est UV transmission it is tested for. Unfortu nately, only some of the UV units on this list have been tested at the low transmission valu es that may occur when bunker ing Norwegian water. Figure 8.6 shows average values for Norwegian water. The real UV transmission of bunkered water of acceptable colour may be lower than 30%/5 cm . To compensate for this, it is possible to use all chamber s in parallel or change to new UV lamp s when measurements of bunkered water show values near the colour limit. Safe, Sufficient and Good Potable Water Offshore 49 Figure 8.7: UV unit with test taps before and after disinfection (Photo: Eyvind Andersen) Prevent excess heating By dimensioning the UV unit for the poorest qua - lity of bunkered water, one will need much bigger UV unit s than would be required only for prod- uced water. T his may also result in an unwan ted increase in water temperature, but can be avoid ed through several measures . UV effect control which limits the UV dose is common for medium pressure UV units and is also increasingly comm on for low pressure units. To avoid overheating and shutting of UV unit s, the suppliers recommended minimum water flow must be met at all times. One recommended solution is to design th e potable water system with continuous pumping of water, with a return line to the tanks connected after the UV unit s. If consumption is low, a pressure valve opens, and the water is automatically returned to the same tank it was supplied from , see figur e 5.1. Differences between low - and medium pressure UV lamp s Both types of lamps are used offshore. Low press - ure lamps emit most of their radiation in the part of the UVspectrum that is most effective against microbes, whilst medium pressure lamps emit radiation over a much broader spectrum. Medium pressure lamps have a higher effect than low pressure lamps and are physically smaller (due to smaller/fewer lamps within each UV unit ), and they are not temperature dependent for operation (will not lose effect if they are located in hot or cold areas; low pressure units may lose effect in temperatures below 9 oC or above 45oC). Medium pressure lamps will also reach full disinfection effect quicker after being turned on (typically after 60-90 seconds in cold water , where low pressure lamps may need more than 5 minutes to warm up). The disadvantages with medium pressure lamps are that they will have to be replaced more often, and in UV chambers where the UV dose is high (> 100-200 mJ/cm 2), bromate may be formed as a by -product. Bromate formation can be avoided if the UV unit is equipped with a control device that limits the UV dose (to save power and prevent excess UV dosage at low consumption or when used for disinfecting crystal clear offshore produced water) . Necessary equipment for control and operation Each UV chamber must have a sensor for inten si- ty moni toring and an alarm in case of low intensi - ty or radiation tube or power supp ly failure . Each radiation tube shall have an alarm light showing that it is functioning. A timer show s for how long the radiatio n tubes have been in operation. The alarm should go to a manned control room. Each UV unit should have a solenoid valve that closes the water distrib ution in case of electrical malfunction, failure in one of the radiation tubes , or if the sensor indicates radiation intensity is too low. To ensure that enough disinfected water is avail able at all times, connect the UV unit to a stable emergency power supply. Air inside the UV chambers will reduce the e ffect. Avoid g as traps by having high -point vent possibility for each chamber , and the chamber outlet should be placed on a high point if possible . Test tap s fitted just before and after the UV unit can be used to verify that the disinfection is func - tioning (figure 8. 7). 8.3.3 Operation and maintenance Never expose eyes (or skin) to UV light . Symp- toms usually appear after a few hours , and s uch injuries have hap pened on off shore units. Blurred sight and the feeling of gritty eyes are minor reactions, but temporary or permanent blindness, may be the consequence. UV unit s should be supervised dai ly. If the alarm is connect ed to a manned control room, physical supervision can be reduced. Log e very control and information , desc ribing corrective action s taken. Safe, Sufficient and Good Potable Water Offshore 50 Figure 8.8: Here, t he UV sensor is placed on top of the UV chamber ( Photo: Eyvind Andersen) Written instru ctions in Norwegian should describe main tenance routines such as sensor calibration, cleaning instructions and chang ing of UV tubes. Follow m aintenance procedures giv en by the supplier. Mini mum maintenance fre quen cy for vital functions should be as follows: Intensity meter If the unit is not equipped with an automa tic alarm system, read the UV intensity meter dai ly. The inten sity meter and alarm set -point should only be adjusted by the supp lier or (in agreement with the supplier ) by spe cially-trained calibration personnel . Calibration is normal ly done once a year. For the biodosi metrically tested UV unit s calibratio n is easy, as the type approval demands that such units use standardised UV sensors that may be replaced by reference sensors (figure 8.8) . If low UV intensity is detected , the cause must be found and corrected without delay. If it is due to sedimentation on the tubes or sens or eye, the entire interior should be cleaned. Check other elements in the system too . If the intensity o f the radiation tubes is too low, replace t he tubes. Low intensity can also be caused by inferior water quality. This may happ en after bunkering or in connection with switching of storage tanks. Signal lamps , radiation tubes and hour counter Hour counter and s ignal lamps for UV radiation tubes should be checked weekly . Replace t he UV lamp s before the radi ation effect is reduced by 20-40 %, when maxi mum ope ration time has been reached, and according to the supp lier's recommendations. Nor mal ope ration time for low pressure tubes is 7000- 15000 hours and 1500- 3000 hours for medium pressure tubes. If the UV unit has several radiation tubes in each chamber , they should all be replaced at the same time, to main tain control of the chamber in tensity (figure 8.8). The ex ception to this rule is a radi ation tube that malfunc tions shortly after replac ement . At the next t ime of replacement all radia tion tubes should be replaced, including th e new est one . Note: The type approval of UV unit s is only valid when using radiat ion tubes of at least the same effect as the ones that were a part of the type appro val appli cation. If type of radiation tube is changed, the effect must be sufficiently documented. Quart z glass must be similar to the glass used for the type approval. Cleaning Clean t he radiation chamber (such as quartz pipes, sensor eyes, reflectors) regularly, dep ending on water quality - minimum once eve ry three months. If the system is equipped t with auto matic mechanisms for cleaning (brushes, rubber rings or equivalent) the eff iciency must be check ed and the equipment cleaned at least every six months. I f the water contains iron or manga nese, this m ay scorch the quartz glass. The scorch ing is normally removed by acid washing, but in some cases it is necessary to scrub by hand. Spare parts The unit should have the necessary spare parts for continuous operation, ref. approval document, in - cluding radiation tubes (a complete set), quartz glass , gaskets , radiation tube relays, fus es, ignition charge and light bulbs for the indicator lamp. Spare parts for the UV intensiometer and the alarm s ystem should a lso be available. Figure 8.9: Control panel for UV unit with eight UV lamp s. As both tube 6 and the signal lap for tube 1 is defect, the UV unit is unsafe. The UV intensity is still quite high. This may be due to clear water or long distance between UV sensor and the defect UV lamp (Photo: Eyvind Andersen) Safe, Sufficient and Good Potable Water Offshore 51 8.4 Active carbon filters Carbon filters solve certain water quality prob l- ems by efficiently removing pollutants in the wat - er. Such substances often cause unpleas ant odour and taste, and may be haz ardous to the health, see 4.2.1. Filters must be changed or re generated before they become saturated . As satu ration time will depend on type of pollution, extra water tests are necessary to ensure safe operation . Neverthe - less, the need for carbon fil ters may point to wards sub-standard operation or unfortunate tech nical soluti ons, and such problems should be solved through other means . Carb on filters are efficient in treatment of unpleasant taste and other problems caused by for example: Chlorine Chlorine by -products for instance trihalomethanes Waste product from algae Soluble products from protective coatings in the potable water storage tanks Continuous maintenance of the filter s is vital for their effect , but also because bacteria might develo p in the filter due to good growth conditi - ons. Today, most filters are delivered with filter material in a cart ridge. Since the filter binds chlorine, it must be removed during the annual pipeline disinfection and be replaced according to recommendations made by the supplier. With the probability for bacterial growth, the filter should always be plac ed in front of the UV unit . Safe, Sufficient and Good Potable Water Offshore 52 9. Storage tanks and distribution system Bunkered or produced potable water will be stored in water tanks and from there pas sed on to the consumers through a distribution system. 9.1 Potable water tanks Offshore units are required to have a sufficient amount of potable water aboard, and the tanks must be operated separately to avoid simultaneous pollution of all tanks . The necessary num ber of storage tanks and total storage capacity depends on production capacity and demand. Storage tanks with an unsuitable design may increase maintenance work and costs and may also result in inferior water quality. Calo rifiers, hydrophor e tanks and day tanks are also common types of potable water tanks offshore . 9.1.1 Storage capacity The owner s hould be able to document that a suffici ent supply of hygienicall y safe potable water can always be guarante ed. The mini mum requirement is 200 litres per day per person, with technical water consumption com ing in addition. The amount of pot able water to be stored in the tanks depends on how vulner able the water system is. A potable water system that exclusively depend s on bunkered water is vulnerable because bad weather conditions may make bunkering impossible , and t he quality of bunkered water is also often unpredictable . Consequently a larger storage capaci ty is required . Units that, in addition to bunker ing, produce water are less vulner able, and two or more prod uction units will strengthen the safety. Minimum storage capacity is lower ed for such units, and may be further reduced if several storage tanks are used. Offshore units without potable water production on board should have a least three storage tanks. A unit with only two storage tanks cannot bunker water according to the requirements if one tank is out of operation. T he storage tank being bunkered to should be isolated until free residual chlorine is documented 30 minutes af ter bunkering is finished. Consequently, with only two tanks aboard, there is no tank from which water can be distributed when one tank is out of operation. Problems with insufficient storage capacity usu - ally arise when one tank is being cleaned, and this risk increases if coating is necessary . This means that one storage tank will be out of operation for several days while requiring large amounts of water for the maintenance process. Occasionally , storage tanks are out of operation for several weeks fol lowing mainten ance work because the hardening process has resulted in problems with odour and taste. Acute contamination of a potable water tank may also leave the tank out of operation. In table 9.1 a minimum storage capacity is recommended for the vario us unit types. Under normal circumstances the potable water unit should be operated so that water is not stored in the tanks for more than 20 days. This will prevent problems with odour or taste caused by the tank coating or decomposi tion of organic mater ial. Table 9.1: Guide to minimum total storage capacity specified in number of consumption days. Each tank is presumed to have equal storage capacity. Recommended total storage capacity for: Number of storage tanks 2 3 or more Unit based on bunke ring only Not recommended! 20 days capacity Unit with one production unit with 100 % capacity plus bunkering 20 days capacity 15 days capacity Unit with two production units with 50 % capacity each plus bunkering 15 days capacity 10 days capacity Unit with three production units with 50% capacity or two units with 100 % capacity each plus bunkering 8 days capacity 5 days capacity Safe, Sufficient and Good Potable Water Offshore 53 Figure 9.1: Approximately 4 met res high potable water tank in stainless steel with no obstructing internal structures. Such tanks are easy to clean, with no problems with applying and maintenance of coating ( Photo: Bj\u00f8rn L\u00f8fsgaard) 9.1.2 Design and location The Facilities R egulations \u00a7\u00a7 5, 10 and 20 give general requirements for system design, and the following advice is based on these requirements. Choice of materials If the tanks are made of stainless steel or other corrosion proof material see figure 9.1 , problems related to use of coatings will be avoided, see 9.1.4. Internal tank design The inside of a potable water tank should be as smooth as possible, without nooks and corners that may harbour microbes. Avoid f rames and other con structions breaking up the interior since this may form pockets of stagnant wat er that can - not be reached by disinfectants, cre ating oppor - tunities for growth of microbes. Large in terior surface s, compared to volume, have created problems with odour and taste after protective coatings have been applied, see 9.1.4. Tank height should be at least 2 metres to allow for m aintenan- ce wor k to be carried out comfortably . Tank height should also be less than 4 met res, to avoid having to build permanent access plat forms etc. for easy maintenance, see fig ure 9.2. Avoid scaffolding for maintenance as this takes much time, increases the risk of pollution and may damage the tank coating. For newbuilds the NMA potable water regulations section 7.1 require permanent access platforms for maintenance, minimum for every 4 metre s of height. Figure 9.2: Access platforms aid maintenance in tanks ove r 4 metres high. Internal structures in tanks should be minimised to enhance circulation and minimise maintenance . Circulation is achiev - ed by pla cing the inlet in one upper corner of the tank, whilst the outlet is placed in the opposite lower corner (Pho to: Eyvind Andersen). Prevent tank contamination Potable water tanks sh ould not have joint walls with tanks contain ing petroleum prod ucts, liquid chemicals etc. Newbuilds should be designed with coffer dams or other rooms that do not pose any threat o f pollution on all sides except against adjacent potable water tanks, ref. NMA potable water regulations section 7.1. Pip es transporting other products than potable water are not acc epted in a potable water tank, but if this is necess ary, these pipes sh all be carried through open ducts. If overflow from potable water tanks is distributed to other tanks (service water etc.), safeguard the overflow line against pollution, see 9.2.5. Figure 9.3: Protect a ir vents for potable water tanks. The picture show s vents safeguarded with floating ball and fine mesh corrosion material. The picture is taken on a newbuild prior to marking (Photo: Eyvind Andersen) Safe, Sufficient and Good Potable Water Offshore 54 Figure 9.4: Tank suction (left) is elevated a few centimetres from the tank floor, whilst a drain suctio n pipe in the pump well in the middle makes it easy to empty the tank (Photo: Eyvind Andersen) To avoid contamina tion of all potable water on board, separate the sto rage tanks from each other to prevent possible con tamination of one tank from spreadin g to the other tanks. 3- way valves, interlocks or other technical solutions should secure that water is not produced, bunk ered or circulated into all tanks simultaneously. Potable water inlet and outlet Locate t he inlet s for both bunkered water and return wat er from the distribution network away from the outlet to enhan ce water cir culation in the tank. Use t he high pressure of bunkered water by point ing the inlet in an angle that increases the cir - culation of the full tank volume (figure 5.1). T his will prevent pockets of stagnant water and impro- ve the mixing of chlorine in the tank. Place t he potable water outlet above the bottom level of the tank to prevent sediment entering the water distribu tion system. Sediment may carry bacteria through the UV unit and may also cause operational probl ems with the UV unit , pipeline system and filters. Air vents Potable water tanks sh ould be vented to the open air or a non- polluted area. Normally it is sufficient to have one air vent connected to each st orage tank but, if the tank has separate, closed sections, each section must have an air vent. Protect th e opening against seawater , birds and other sub- stances that might contaminate the water (fig ure 9.3). The opening should be covered by a fine meshed net of a non -corrosive material. Figure 9.5: The picture shows a storage tank with an accessible manhole (Photo: Eyvind Andersen) Drainage The storage tanks should have efficient drainage . Cross braces should have ope nings near the tank bottom to enable complete drainage. The tank bottom should be slop ed or supplied with a pump well leading the water towards the drainage point (figure 9.4) . The drain valve should be placed at the lowest point. If such \"natur al\" drainage is not possible , install a perma nent pump. Unfortuna tely storage tanks are often built with a flat bottom and without a pump well. Therefore, the storage tanks are frequently drained by using the potable water pumps, which is unfor tunate if a tank is drained because of contam ination. Access possibilities A storage tank has to be equipped with a manhole to facilitate inspection, cleaning and maintenance. It is normally sensible to have two manholes to improve access and ventilation possibilities. To avoid contamination of the tanks , the manholes should have close -fitting covers. The manhole must have a size and location that provides easy access to the tank for both workers and equipment (figure 9. 5). Some storage tanks have tank roofs as part of the deck. Man holes on deck should have a rim minimum 5 cm high, and be located in a \"clean\" area. Water temperature Potable water storage tanks should be placed where they are frost -free and will not be heat ed by the surr oundings, by sun or other heat source. Keep the w ater t empe rature below 20 o C, even during the summer season (may not be possible in warmer climates, see 9.2.11) . Safe, Sufficient and Good Potable Water Offshore 55 Figure 9.6: Also smaller tanks in the potable water system, like hydrophore tanks, calorifiers and alkalising filte rs must have sufficient access for inside maintenance. The pictured tank is made of stainless steel and has sufficient manholes (Photo: Eyvind Andersen) Water for flushing Potable water tanks are often cleaned by high pressure water, and this water should be of potable water quality. Test tap A test tap should be fitted to facilitate testing of chlorinated water in the tank without having to lead the water into the distribution net. Install a drain to handle flush water. Water gauge The water gauge system should be automatic. Wa - ter quantity in the storage tanks is constantly monitored from the control room, acti vating an alarm if the water level is low. Visual control is still used on some older offshore units , but use of a dipstick is not hygienicall y acc eptable (such tank openings should be welded closed) . Design of other water tanks Small water tanks like calorifiers, hydrophore tanks , small pressure vessels and small day tanks etc. must also have suff icient access for interior cleaning and main tenance (figure 9. 6). It must also be possible to take such tanks out of use without having to cut off the water supply on the offshore unit. The design must also ensure that stagnant water is avoided. 9.1.3 Operation and maintenance During operation, organic material, rust particles etc., will settle on the tank bottom, becoming an ideal growth environment for microbes . A film of organic material will form on the tank walls, in which microbes will settle . The storage tanks have to be cleaned and disinfect ed at least once a year. Experience with potable water tanks receiving bunkered water only, indicates that cleaning at least twice a year is necessary, while once a year often is sufficient if the potable water is produced on board. If water storage tanks are not cleaned often enough, it will be difficult to remove the growth. Following any type of maintenance wor k, tanks must be disin fected. Calorifiers, hydrophore tanks and day tanks all require the same cleaning and disinfection procedures. One exampl e of such procedures is described in appendix 13. During maintenance it is not unusual that a tank is out of service for several days , even more if a new surface coating is needed . Cleaning and disinfect i- on must be well plan ned. The full s torage capa city of the other tanks must be utilis ed. Water bud get, manpower, water produc tion etc. should be considered in planning the work. Mainten ance, such as renew ing the coating, is best done during the summer months, when the weather is good and hardenin g time shortened. During tank inspection consider the cleaning int - ervals. If the bottom sediments are negligible and the colony count steady and low, cleaning inter - vals are satisfactory. The storage tanks must not have any substantial corro sion damage . Inspect he water gauge, air -vent net and float . Log a ll results . 9.1.4 Application of protective coatings Protective coatings have to be applied correctly to avoid problems. Negligence will often result in the coating having to be removed prior to recoating the tank. The following recommendations should be observed: Choice of product It must be documented that coating systems are suitable for potable water use, see 9.2.6. Choose a product for potable water tanks recomm ended by Safe, Sufficient and Good Potable Water Offshore 56 the supplier . Several p roducts are unsuitable for offshore use , as it will be impossible to achieve the necessary curing conditions due to low temp- eratures, cold steel and short deadlines . Even if a product is suitable for potable water in general, it must be used within its li mitations (figure 9.7) . Documentation of correct appliance Satisfactory working conditions for the painters must be documented. Both when choosing the product and after application it must be document - ed that the supplier 's recommendations for pre - treatme nt, application, c uring and washing have been adhered to , see NMA potable water regulations section 7 .3 and 4 . After coating new tanks , and after full renewal of old tank coating, th e work should be app roved by a certified paint inspector (FROSIO level III- or NACE level 2 -certified ). Before the tank is put into use, verify that the coating does not pollute the water . After water has been stored for a normal storage period, h ydrocarbons should be analysed ( limit 10 mi crogram mes/litre ). This analysis must be specified for the different components (includ ing BTEX) , to ensure that only paint contamina tion and not other components are being measured. Figure 9.7: \u00abWhite rust\u00bb in a potable water tank, is deposits of zinc carbonate. The tank is coate d with a product that contains zinc, and that can be used in the pH interval 5.5 to 10. At higher pH, problems with deposits and high zinc levels in the water can occur. In this case poor pH mana ge- ment is the source of the problems, as the measur - ed pH around 11 was far beyond the max limit of 9.5 in the potable w ater r egulations . washing of salts in weld - ing seam before painting has resulted in corrosion (Photo: Bj\u00f8rn L\u00f8fsgaard) Pre-treatment Pre-treatment of the surface is necessa ry to ensure sufficient coating adhesion and to avoid corrosion. Blasting with sand or metal is an effective method for surface treatment that will normally facilitate good adhesion. Rough edges and welding seams must be gr inded. All traces of rust, salt (including welding smoke), fat, oil and dirt must be washed away or removed (figure 9. 8). Application Spray painting is effective and give good results . A round paint brush is applied where spraying is impossible. Avoid t he use of a roller which will give too thick layers and only poorly saturates the surface (gives pores) . The supplier will state pre - treatment requirements, coating thickness and number of layers for the coat ing system. Thinners may only be used if specifi cally approved for the product. Spray painting results in a thin coating film on edges, corn ers, welding seams, stiffeners and cavities, and such places should be stripe coated with a brush. A different (also approved) colour is recommended when stripe co ating , to keep track of the work progress . Curing Curing problems may occur after illegal use of thinners or when neglecting the supplier's recom - mendations for curing time, aeration, air humidity and temperature. Tank loca tion may also cause proble ms. The inner surface of a tank which is exposed to the weather and/or poorly insulated, may be cold even if the tempe rature inside the tank is high enough for curing, and the coating nearest the steel will not cure and vola tile sub - stances may continue to leak from the coating . When the coating is suffic iently cured, the surface must be washed to remove any traces of pollution. Safe, Sufficient and Good Potable Water Offshore 57 Figure 9.9: Cross section 1 shows correct patch coating, where the edge between old and new coating has been grinded. Cros s section 2 illu - strates starting corrosion where \"sharp edges\" makes it impossible to coat the wall sufficiently, even if a brush is used (Ill. Eyvind Andersen) Patch coating and renewal of tank coating During the annual tank maintenance, corroded ar - eas should be patch coated , and the coating should be evaluated for hardness, smoothness and ease of cleaning . Start patch coating by removing all trac - es of rust, and grind the edges of the re maining coating, before the whole area is cleaned (figure 9.9). The use of a steel brush grinder with a fibre disc will remove rust and give good adhe sion. Patch coating must only cover the affected area (the coating should not be applied to the surround - ing area). A round paint brush should be used to make the coating stick. Do not use a roller to apply the coating, as this method of application is not suitable for patch coating (figure 9. 10). The coating must be cured and washed according to the supplier's instructions. Where several spots of corrosion are locat ed near each other, the whole area should be grinded, washed and painted. If the corrosion is extensive (more than 3% of the tank is corroded, and the corrosion is not confined to a few spots ), all coat ing should be renewed. Re - newal should also be don e if the coating is no longer sufficiently hard and smooth for cleaning purposes (such coating may lead to biofilm form a- tion or problems with odour and taste). Even when the coat ing is applied correctly, a renewal should be expect ed every 15 years. If the coating , after 15 years , is inspected and found to be in good condi - tion, a limited life extension is accept able. Figure 9.10: Incorrect coati ng. A roller has been used instead of a round brush, and the coating has been used on too large areas and in a far too thick layer (Pho to: Bj\u00f8rn L\u00f8fsgaard) Problems with odour and taste after coating application Unpleasant odour and taste, following protective coating inside a storage tank, is unfortunately a common problem on offshore installations (figure 9.11) . Some substances that give the water smell and taste may, in high concentrations, be hazardous to the health. W ater with odour and taste should not be used for human consumption, see 4.2.1 and 4.3. The se problems are often caused by incorrect coating application, curing and washing or illegal use of thinners . Poor tank design, see 9.1.2, will increase the risk of such problems occ urring .Active carbon filter s are effective in removing these substances, see 8.4. Figure 9.11: Picture from a tank w here incorrect coating has resulted in corr osion and need for touch ups. Coating applied wrongly and too thick on cold steel increases the ris k for microbial growth, and may cause unpleasant odour and taste from tank coating (Photo: Eyvind Andersen) Safe, Sufficient and Good Potable Water Offshore 58 9.2 Wa ter distribution system The water distribution system supplies water to living quarters, galley etc., and may consist of pipes, pumps , calorifier , valves, and other equip- ment. Inf erior potable water quality may be a con - sequence of wrong system design, poor material quality, cross contamination or insufficient operation procedures. Detailed design advice is given in NS -EN 806. 9.2.1 General design advice General advice to maintain good hygienic water quality through out the distribution system Choose good quality materials When planning or rebuilding a unit, the quality of materials should be carefully assessed, see 9.2.6. Keep the cold water cold and the warm water warm To avoid growth of microbes like Le gionella and Pseudomonas , cold water should al ways be below 20 o C and hot water above 60o C (after one minute flushing) . If it is not possi ble to keep the cold wat - er below 20o C, addi tional water treatment and flush ing will be required, see 9.2.11. As cold wat- er tastes bett er, it is recomme nded that the tempe - rature is kept even lower. To achieve sufficient temperatures, both hot and cold water pipes must be insulated, see 9.2.8. Avoid installing warm water pipes under cold water pipes. Due to the radiation from the heat of the warm water pipes, the cold water temperature will increase. Where possible, avoid installing cold water pipes in the same duct as hot water pipes and other heating sources. Avoid stagnation Keep the water flowing through the mains by hav- ing frequently used connect ions as the last con su- mers on each branch. All taps , pipes and treatment units must be document ed to be used or flushed on a weekly basis . The need for flushing can be eliminated through system de sign that maintains water circulation until mixers, toilets etc., leaving only a negligible amount of stagnant water (figure 4.8). A flow distributor that harnesses the venturi effect is one technical solution for maintaining circulation in all pipes ( figure 9.12). Figure 9.12: The narrow passage forces some of the water in the main pipe to circulate via the smaller pipe, before returning to the main pipe. This provides constant flow to connections with infrequent use (Ill. Karin Melsom) . Avoid blind pipes and pipes with stagnant water since th e water will main tain room temperature (figure 9.1 3). Bacteria grow ing in blind pipes will not be reached by disinfectants during the annual disin fection, resulting in mic robes re -spreading through out the distribution syst em. Pipe ends that are longer than 10 times the pipe diameter are considered \"blind\", and should be re moved (figure 9.14) . Long pipe s supply ing small unit s like coffee mak ers and water coolers etc., should be avoided due to possible corrosion contamination. Figure 9.13: This shower is not in use, and is used for storage. Water in such pipes will be at room temperature, and there is a growth potential for Legionella and other microbes. This water may then contaminate the rest of the piping. Piping that is not in use should be eliminated, alternati-vely flushed weekly (Photo: Eyvind Andersen) Safe, Sufficient and Good Potable Water Offshore 59 Figure 9.14: This test tap is not designed correct - ly, as it is too long and too big. In addition the outtake below the main pipe will increase the risk of biofilm formation, as dirt and particles will settle in the test pipe, and the water tests may not be representative (Photo: Eyvind Andersen) Avoid cross contamination The best solution is to totally separate the potable water system from all other sys tems like technical water, drill water, fi re water etc. All remaining connections, including hoses etc., that may conta - minate the water during episodes of back flow/ back suction, must be protected according to NS - EN 1717, see 9.2.5. Use as small piping as possible If the pipe size is too big, water will mostly flow in the middle o f the pipe (laminar flow). T his will increase the potential for biofilm formation on the pipe walls. Pipes of smaller size will have higher water speed and turbulent water flow, greatly reducing the potential for biofi lm (figure 9.15) . High water speed may also cause some problems. Noise is one issue. F or copper piping , water speed close to 1 m/s in circulation pipes and above 2.5 m/s in other pipes may cause corrosion. To balance the concerns for biofim, corrosion and noise, the NMA potable water regulations section 10.2 and 3 for newbuilds require s a max imalflow in circulation pipes of 0.7 m/s, and for piping without circulation, dimen sioning according to NS-EN 806- 3 is required . Prevent biofilm problems Biofilm formation can be minimised through the following measures: Maintaining sufficient flow until all taps. Continuous dosing of chemicals Frequent disinfection of distribution system (yearly as a minimum even in systems with low colony counts and good quality piping). Figure 9.15: Due to slower (and laminar) flow in the large pipe than in the small pipe supplying an eye-wash station, biofilm will grow more easily in the bigger pipe (Photo: Eyvind Andersen) Tagging, marking and colour coding Tagging and marking equipment and valves, and marking and colour coding of piping, will help to prevent mistakes and contamination. Having a properly marked water distribution system also makes it easier to follow the pipelines in critical situations, when it is important to be able to quickly locate a malfunction. Provide sufficient access for maintenance All water treatment units must have access for maintenance. Sufficient size manholes must be provided for tanks like calorifiers, hydrophore tanks and rehardening filters . All valves that are frequently used or which will need to be verified on a regular basis must be easily accessible. Drains are provided where necessary. Avoid unnecessa ry maintenance Use as few barriers against cross -contamination as possible, as such barriers must be function tested, see 9.2.5. The same barrier can cover several downstream connections . Minimis e the need for weekly flushing of pipes with stagnant water. Avoid designing tapping points that are not strictly necessary. Pipes that only supply tapping points that do not spread aerosols will not need flushing if they are connected downstream of a BA -valve, see 9.2.7. 9.2.2 Pressurising systems The pressure is normally kept through continuous pumping or by using hydrophore tanks. Often the maximum static pressure in the distribution piping is 5 bar (ref. N S-EN806- 3), and often taps and other equipment are designed with 5 bar as maximum pressure. As there will always be Safe, Sufficient and Good Potable Water Offshore 60 pressure changes in the system, a small membrane pressure vessel may be usef ul. Pressuri sing with pumps Often a system will have two pumps, one in operation and the other on stand -by. Pumps should be switched weekly, and prefer ably be operated from a control room . A recir culation pipeline going back to the distribution tank should always be installed. This pipeline feeds a small return stream in order to prevent the pump from overheating during periods of low con sumption. Connect t his line after the UV unit , as this will provide sufficient minimum flow through the UV units and extra water disin fection. The pumps should not have too large capa city since excess heat can increase the potable water temperature, see 4.2.5. Pump energy consumption can be minimised through automatically reducing the water output when the consumption is low , and this will also reduce heating effect from pumps . Pressuri sing with hydrophore units or day tanks A hydrophore unit consists of a pressure pump and an air pressured hydrophore tank. The pump is controlled by the water pressure. For new off - shore units pumping is considered to be a better soluti on than hydrophore systems, as hydrophore tanks are often difficult to clean and are known to have caused problems with microbial growth. The press urised air can also contain oil traces, and must be filtered if there is any risk of such sub- stances. A mem brane tank can be an alternative solution. Some systems have small , elevated day tanks to make dis tribution by gravity possible. The same design and operation requirements apply as for other typ es of storage tanks. With only one day tank use, design a by -pass possi bility to allow for regular cleaning and main tenance without stopping water distri bution. Hydrophore tanks and day tanks save energy as pumps run only when tanks are being filled. These tanks are constantly being filled with water containing new nutrients, and as they have a rather small volume compared to bigger tanks, they may need more frequent cleaning compared to larger tanks. 9.2.3 Cold water We recommend that the system is d esigned to maximise the flow through all pipes by having (see also 9.2.1): As small piping dimensions as pos sible. The necessary pipe size for each branch must be calculated (e.g. the shower, sink and toi let in a cabin will not be used at the same time ). Frequently used taps as end points f or each branch (galley, washery etc.). Alternatively , an automatic flushing valve may be installed. Minimising branch lengths from supply line to tap points (stagnant when not in use) For offshore units operating in cold clima tes (seawater below 20 o C), it will normally be possible to achieve cold water tempe ratures below 20o C (after one minute flushing) without installing a circulation system with chilling. Tap points that contain stagnant water should be flushe d on a week ly basis (manually or automati - cally). For pipes where the cold water tempe rature is above 25 o C, daily flushing is recommended by Dutch authorities. Out door piping should be insulated against frost and heat and should not be exposed to dir ect sunlight. Specific advice for vessels operating in warm climates is given in section 9.2.11. 9.2.4 Hot water The hot water must also be of potable water quality, and must be connected downstream of the UV unit . The connection must be secured against back -flow of hot water to the cold water system, see 9.2.5. Insulate the hot water pipes and place them in a way that prevents warming of the cold water during trans port through the pipe system. Choos ing correct piping size throughout the system (see 9.2.3) is economically sensible and will give the best water quality. To maintain correct temperatures at the taps, a cir - culation system is recommended. For balan cing the complete circulation system, each section (floor) in the circulation system needs to be regulated by regulating valves. These valves must be installed ( after the last user in a section) before the connection to the colle ctive return line. The temperature must be minimum 60 degrees in the complete circulation system ( measured at heater out let, circulation return just before the Safe, Sufficient and Good Potable Water Offshore 61 heater and e ach section in the syste m, preferably between 30 and 50 cm before connection to col l- ective return line ). At peak moments, the tempera - ture may drop below 60 degrees to come back above 60 degrees, as s oon as the taps are closed. The temperature at the taps and all other parts which are not continuously circulated must be minimum 60 degrees after one minute of flushing. Since water expands as it is being heated, the syst - em must be supplied with an expa nsion vessel to avoid piping damage or release of the calorifier pressure relief valve when much water is heated and the consumption is low . The expansion vessel has a membrane and s hall empty completely when hot water is consumed (no stagnant wate r in the vessel). Recommended volume is 5 .6% of calorifier volume. Water is normally heated by electricity, but some units use surplus heat from cooling water or steam in a heat exchanger. Chemi cals added to such wa - ter or steam shall be approved, see 2.4. Metals will always corrode quick er in a hot water system, and consequently hot water should not be used as an ingredient when making food or hot beverages . The hot water distri bution syst em must also be protected against pollution, see 9.2.5. Figure 9.16: Full air gap of type \u00abAA\u00bb is the best way of eliminating contamination from other systems supplied with potable water . Here water is supplied to a food grinder via pipe above the sink to the right (Photo: Eyvind Andersen) Some bacter ia grow in hot water syst ems with too low temperature. Legionella in parti cular can cause problems . If the hot water in the dis tribution system is at least 60 o C (after one minute flush - ing), the risk for in fection is minim ised, see 9.2.7. With suffi cient in sulation, this may be possible to achieve wit h an outgoing tem perature of 65o C, thus reducing energy con sumption, scalding risk and mineral deposits due to hardness . 9.2.5 Protection against pollution The potable water system must be safeguarded against pol lution via backflow from connected systems . Different methods are described in the \"EN 1717\" standard . The distribution network must be evaluated with regard to risk and vulnera - bility for different sources of contamina tion, and protective te chnical meas ures must be app lied, see table 9.2. M ovement caused by the sea in creas es the risk for back flow on offshore units . Use the same branch -off from the potable water supply line to supply seve ral potential sources of contamination. A single barrier may then be used for all the down stream connections, reducing the number of barriers that need to be maintained. If such a com mon barrier is to be used, it must be on a suffici ent level for all downstream connections. The best way to protect t he potable water system is to separate it from potential sources of con tami- nation. This is achi eved by using a separa te syst - em for process water, or by separating con necti - ons through a com plete air -gap, a so- called \"brok - en connection\" (figure 9.16) . The air gap must be at least 20 millimetres and at least 2 times the pipe diameter (me asured be tween the bottom of the water tap and the highest possible water level in the con nected equipment). Such a conn ection is according to level \"AA\" in the standard, and is accept able for all types of contamination , including microbes. Sometimes \" air gap\" is impractical to use . In such cases other technical solutions may be evalu ated. When such barriers are applied, the equipment regularly mus t be opened and cleaned before the effect is verified . The recommended interval for this work is yearly. The choice of barrier depend s on the risk each connec tion poses, and the greater the probability and/or consequen ces are, the stricter the safety requirements . Safe, Sufficient and Good Potable Water Offshore 62 Table 9.2: Relevant technical barriers to protect potable water sys tems against pollution (EN1717) Protection module* Protection against AA - Complete air gap Harmful microbes and all other types of contamination BA - Verifiable backflow protection device Toxic, radioactive, muta - genic or carcino genic substances EA - Verifiable non-return valve Water that does not pose any health risks, but may have different taste, smell, colour or temperature. * The table contains modules that are par ticularly relevant for offshore use. EN1717 also contains other protection modules that may be applied. Ordinary non- return valves may only be used in private homes. The second best level of technical safety is achi - eved by fitting a verifiable backflow prevention device (level \"BA\" in the standard, also known as reduced pressure zone valve). A backflow pre ven- ter consists of two non- return valves sep arated by drain module (figure 9.1 7). This device will suck air during back suction conditions and the drain will open if back pressure from technical connections occurs. Stop valves must be fitted before and after the BA valve, to facilitate testing, and a strainer before this valve is also necessary. Verifiable non -return valves (level \"EA\" in the standard) give the lowest level of safety that should be applied offshore (figure 9.18 ). Level \"EA\" give protection against water that does not contain harmful substances, but where the water quality may have changed with regard to taste, odour , colour or tem perature. A stop valve must be fitted before the EA valve, to facilitate testing. After a thorough eva luation , such valves may also be fitted on hose connecti ons in acc ommodation and pipes supply ing washing mach ines etc. (such connections must also be protected by loca ting the connection above the fluid level). Showers can be safeguarded in the same way if the hose could reach the toilet. In galleys and other plac es where a hose is connected to a mixing batt ery, both the hot and cold water supply must have an EA valve, as the cold and hot water will be directly connect - ed when the mixing battery is in open position and the hose is closed (figure 9.19) . Figure 9.17: If other liquid carrying systems must be supplied with pressurised potable water, a BA type back flow prevention de vice gives the best level of protec tion. Note the 3 test points on top of valve. This valve need s to be fitted with a strainer and stop valves before and after for testing, and location over a drain is recomm ended, as it may open automatically (Photo: Eyvind Andersen) 9.2.6 Materials For b oth newbuilds and repairs it is important that the pipeline mate rial chosen withstands the parti - cular type of water quality with rega rd to temperature, pressure, corrosiveness and chlorine content (figure 9. 20). This may seem obvious, but on some offshore units choos ing the wrong type of pipe material have caused in stant corrosion problems and large extra costs to replace major parts of the potable water system. Materials that come into contact with potable wat - er sh ould not corrode or release substances to the water in such quantities as to make it hazardous to health or unsuitable as drinking water. T he owner is responsible to ensure that the mate rials have sufficient qualit y, but m aterials with European potable water approval like DVGW, KIWA, WRAS, etc. will normally have sufficient quality. Figure 9.18: Verifiable non- return valve with integrated stop valve. The test port is between the white non- return valve and the sc rew down stop valve (Photo: Eyvind Andersen) Safe, Sufficient and Good Potable Water Offshore 63 Figure 9.19: A hose station where water is leaking between the hot and the cold water when the mix - er is left in open position and the hose is not in use. A sign to close the mixer is not a bar rier against such leaks ( Photo: Eyvind Andersen) The most common pipe materials used in water distribution systems offshore are copper in the living quarters and stainless steel in the rest of the unit, but different types of plastic piping are also becoming more common. Metal pipes may be susceptible to corro sion, but are generally easy to work with and resis tant to pressure damage. Tita - nium and acid -resistant stainless steel are eminent corro sion resistant pipe materials, and are there- fore used in pipes that ar e particularly exposed to corrosion such as seawater pipes and pipes between water production unit and alkalising filter. Plastic does not corrode, but questions of leakage of unwanted su bstances, mech anical strength and bacterial growth in the distribut ion system should be assessed. For all materials check manufacturer manuals and r espect the need of expansion loops, maximum temperatures, maxi - mum chlorine content , maximum pressure (will diffe r between floors), maximum water speed etc. 9.2.7 Legionella prevention Legionella growth normally occurs in potable water systems with temperatures between 20 and 50 o C, where routines for operation and disinfect - ion are lacking, see 9.2.9. Inhaling aerosols (mic - ro-sized water drops) emitted from for exam ple air-conditioning units or showers can result in two types of disease. Legionnaire's disease is a very serious type of pneumonia with high mortality whilst Pontiac fever resembles influenza. Figure 9.20: Hot water pipe damaged because of lacking expansion t ank and too high pressure and temperature in the hot water system ( Photo: Johan Ljungqvist) Requirements for preventing the spread of Legio - nella via aerosols are detailed in section 3a in the Norwegian regulations for environmental health protection. Off shore there are several potential sources for such aerosols, including showers and high pressure washers. When risk assessing syst ems, see section 3, the NIPH recommend s that the technical risk assess - ment is supplemented with cultivation tests for Legionella. Such tests should be done monthly for at least a year , and on a sufficient number of locations to get a complete picture of the assessed systems. If Legionella is detected in more than 30% of the samples, the system must be decon-taminated complete ly. If Legionella is detected to a lesser extent, the find ings must be used in the risk assessment, and may be followed up through technical and treatment improvements to get a system where Legionella is only detected on rare occasions. During the risk a ssessment, the need for Legionella tests as a part of the or dinary opera - tional monitoring also should be considered. For more information on Legion ella, including the latest about Legionella prev ention, please see the NIPH guideline (only in Norwegian l anguage) . Legionella advice from the EU is detailed in the SHIPSAN Act: www.shipsan.eu (content may differ somewhat from Norwegian advice). The following measures will reduce the risk of Legionella growth in the potable water system: Safe, Sufficient and Good Potable Water Offshore 64 Figure 9.21: Legionella can be prevented by keeping the cold water cold and the hot water hot (Photo: Eyvind Andersen) The cold water temperature should be below 20o C, see 9.2.3. T he hot water sy stem should be above 60o C (figure 9. 21), see 9.2.4. Water temperatures in the distribution network are documented in a monthly test programme. Remove b lind pipes from the potable water system, see 9.2.1 (figure 9.22) . Equip t ap points that are rarely used and that do not spread aerosols with back flow protect - tion type \"BA\", see 9.2.5. Alternatively , they must be flushed at full speed for stagnant water on a weekly basis. When flushing safety showers and other devices that will lead to much aerosol forma tion, prevent the spread or inhal ation of aerosols (use of respiratory filter type P3 is recommended) . Flushing may be done manually or by using automated valves (where manual operations will be limited to control and maintenance). All piping and water treatment uni ts (stand -by units etc.) must be used or flushed weekly. The potable water distribution system is cleaned and disinfected regularly, see 9.2.9. Showe r hoses and heads are diffi cult to keep clean and will always contain tepid water. E v- ery 3 months , such fixtures should be disass - embled, cleaned if necessary with soap or mild acid and disinfected by heat, drying or use of disinfectant, see appendix 12. After a period without use of the showers, such disinfection is even more important (figure 9. 23). pH is kept around 8 ( Legionella prefer pH < 7) Figure 9.22: A sink has been removed whilst pipes and fittings remain, leaving dead ends where Legionella may have good growing conditions and later infect the rest of the potable water system (Photo: Eyvind Andersen) In systems infected with Legionella, where preventive measures are not sufficient, water treatment with silver/copper ionisation or dosing of chlorine dioxide may be effective. Neither of these methods are \"cure all\" solutions that have instant ef fect everywhere, but are still the treatment methods that until now have been documented to be the most effective. Other treatment chemicals may be used intermittently or continuously (as required), if approved by the FSA for this purpose. For detailed inf ormation on Legionella and water treatment, please see the NIPH Legionella guideline (only in Norwegian). With silver/copper ionisation, a low dose of silver and copper is added to the water (maximum 0.1 and 1 mg/l respectively). The typical dosage is 0.02- 0.04 mg/l for silver and 0.2- 0.4 mg/l for copper, but their effect has been documented for as low dosage as 0.01 mg/l silver. For chlorine dioxide, the necessary dosage is 0.1- 0.4 mg/l. Experience shows that it often takes \u00bd -2 years for chlorine dioxide to reach its full effect in a system infected with Legionella (in addition it will be effective against amoebas and biofilm). Chlorine dioxide treatment will also result in formation of chlorite and chlorate as by -products, and such formation must be limited to a total of 0.7 mg/l. Safe, Sufficient and Good Potable Water Offshore 65 Figure 9.23: Shower hoses and heads are problem spots for Legionella growth due to low tem peratu- res after mixers combined with stagnant water when not in use. Here growth is prevented thro-ugh drying of the equipment (Photo: Arild Tolo) Figure 9.24: Such biofilm is a consequence of insufficient cleaning. M icrobes have ample possibility for growth (Photo: Eyvind Andersen) 9.2.8 Insulation Cold water should be insulated with foam , which should be applied (glued) with no ga ps. Besides keep ing the water cooler it prevents conden sation. We also recom mend that hot water piping is isolated with mineral wool of 0,035 W/mK. For both hot and cold water , use isolation thickness of 100% of outer pipe diameter. 9.2.9 Operation and maintenance The main problem with biofilm (bacteria and other microbes) in the potable water distribution system is that it can suddenly give the water an unpleasant odour and taste, see 4.2.1. Some of the bacteria may also be pathogenic, and pitting may begin underneath a biofilm, see 4.2.3. Frequent and good quality maintenance is a pre - requisite to prevent water quality changes in the distribution network. Chemicals may be needed for this work (figure 9.24) . One possible procedure is de tailed in appendix 12. It is more difficult to suc ceed with disinfec tion if a biofilm is already present, and the disin fection process might hav e to be repeated to remove bacteria. The potable water regulation require s internal control routines. In addition, s ection 15 in the regula tions for mobile offshore units state that \"Tanks, pipes and pipe systems for drinking water should be kept clean on the inside. The potable water system sh ould be cleaned and disinfected before the unit leaves the yard, thereafter at least once a year and after repairs of the potable water system \". It is important to notice that the regulations say at least once a year, and that it has to be clean ed and disinfected more often if necessary. Clean ing of the distribution system may b e done in connection with disinfection of one or more storage tanks, see 9.1.3). Increased colony counts indicate a need for clean - ing an d disinfection regardless of planned main te- nance intervals. Colony counts above 100 (at 22 o C/72 hours) in two conse cutive tests indica te the presence of biofilm in the distri bution sys tem (a single test may not be representative, and should be followed up quickly by a second test). Flush ing the sys tem can be the first remedy to try . If the colony count does not decrease or soon increases again, flush and disinfect the entire distribution system once more. E nsuring sufficient chlorination of the entire distribu tion system is a major under taking and is often delegated to exter - nal consultants. If high colony counts re -occur frequently, the source must be identified, see 9.2.1. Shower heads and shower hoses often contain a great deal of biofilm, and should be dis - mantled, cleaned and disinfected regularly, see 9.2.7. High water temperature may lead to quicker de - composition of chlorine when disinfecting the hot water system with chlor ine. Alternatively , disinfect the hot water system by increasing the temperature in the dis tribution system to 70 o C for at least 5 minutes (pipe wall temperature) . It is also pos sible to use hot water to disinfect the cold water system. This is acceptable if the piping is designed with this in mind and that the risk of scalding is minimised. If chlorine dioxide or silver and copper ionisation are used to prevent Safe, Sufficient and Good Potable Water Offshore 66 Legionella, see 9. 2.7, these methods may also pre - vent the formation of biofilm. If the potable water distribution system is connect - ed to other systems, back -flow protec tion device s must be tested , see 9.2.5. Maintain p umps and other equip ment in acc ordance with recommendations made by the manufacturer , and disinfect them along with the rest of the potable water syst em. 9.2.10 Pressure /leakage testing The potable water system sh ould be made with press ure tested and approved components acc ord- ing to regulations (PED CE marked). Parts that must be pressure -tested on site should be tested with water u p to the required pressure. The comp - lete potable water system must also be tested for leakages before being put into opera tion. Leakage testing with water can be done according to the following procedure: 1. Fill the s ystem with clean potable water. 2. Flush the system with potable water to get rid of contamination from construction. The outlets (taps) need to be fully opened and unobstructed (strainer /aerator etc. rem oved). 3. Connect the pressure source and the required sensors. Refit strainers etc. 4. Close all outlets . 5. Increase the pressure until maximum operation pressure and close the pressure source. 6. Verif y that the pressure is stable. 7. Inspect the system for leaks . 8. Relieve the test pressure. 9. If normal operation of the system is delayed , drain the system by gravity and use compressed , oil-free air to dry the pipes. 9.2.11 Special considerations for units operating in warm waters Offshore units operating in warm climate s (seawater above 20o C), will not achi eve cold water temperatures below 20o C (after one minute flush ing) without installing a circulation system with chilling. Avoid pollution from the cooling medium through double walls, clean water - cooling systems o r similar solutions. As a minimum, the chiller must keep the cold potable water average temperature below 25 o C. During peak moments (when many peop le take a shower etc.) the temperature is allow ed to increase but after this period the chiller has to reduce the temperature. The UV unit must be in t his circulation loop. Flush t ap points that are not in use on a weekly basis (manually or automatically). If the cold water tempera ture is above 25o C, flush daily. When it is not possible to keep the aver age temperature below 25o C, it is recom mended to use chemicals , see 9.2.7, or continuously to dose chlorine, see 5.1 item 13 for design suggestions. For continuous c hlorination, remove chlorine and chlorination by -products in an active carbon filter prior to UV disinfection . Fresh chlorine is then added only to the cold water distribution system to achieve a chlorine residual above 0.1 mg/l throughout the distribution system. To achieve this one will often need to have a chlorine residual between 0.3 and 0.5 in the galley.Safe, Sufficient and Good Potable Water Offshore 67 10. Water supply on diving vessels - special requirements Diving vessels are equipped with units for deep- diving operations. These vessels are often in operation close to other units where div ers do construction and maintenance work. The work periods will last up to 3 weeks and include com - pression, actual operation time and decom pressi- on. During this time , the divers live in compr ess- ion cham bers on board when they are not work- ing from diving bells in deep water. The comp-ression chambers are closed systems where contamination may accumulate and where tradi - tional medical treat ment can be difficult , making it par ticularly important to ensure safe operations (figure 10.1). The NORSOK U100 guide des - cribes the special requi rements for potable water distribution systems on diving vessels. This chapter covers challenges that are particular for diving vessels. The g eneral requirements for potable water described in chapters 1 -9 will in some instances not be relevant becaus e diving vessels have different requirements than other offshore units. For instance , the requirements for training of personnel will have to include the special con siderations that are necessary on diving vessels. Divers also need hot water to keep the ir diving suits warm in the cold seawater . Heated seawater is used, but is not discussed in this guide. Living quarters and work environment for divers were studied in a medical research program me carried out by Statoil, Norsk Hydro, Saga Petro - leum, Norske Esso and the Norwegian Petroleum Direc torate. Div ers often have skin infections, and Pseudomonas aerugi nosa is usually the cause. The bacteria are common in both salt water and fresh water. The main reservoir for such bacteria in the diving system is the potable water, where infection may spread through show ers and other use of the water. A few geno- types of P. aerugi nosa are predominant in the infections, and those genotypes repeatedly app-ear in disease outbreaks. Regardless of which type of P. aerugi nosa is present, curative actions should be taken. 10.1 Water analyses The potable w ater r egulations apply to ships as well. The recommended analyses in chapter 4, made by the NIPH , also apply to diving vessels. Take a ddition al operation analyses for P. aeru- ginosa of the diving system on the vessel, before operation starts and then at least monthly during operation periods. In both the ordinary potable water system and the diving system 500 ml tests of the cold water (cw) plus the hot wa ter (hw) should be taken at the following test points: Mess: cw (only when the diving system and the rest of the vessel share the water distri - bution system) Diver's kitchen: cw and hw Room for rinsing diving suits: cw and hw Showers in the diving syste m chambers: cw and hw from each chamber Cold water and hot water tanks supplying the diving system Even though monthly analyses normally will be sufficient according to the experience of the di v- ing companies, the frequency will have to be increased if P. aeruginosa is found. For units that repeatedly experience infec tions among divers, consider increased analysis frequency . Operational analyses are also recommended for Legionella. Take 1000 ml samples from showers , high-pressure units and room s for ri nsing diving suits before using the diving system . 10.2 Water production It is recommended that the water supply in the diving unit is based primarily on production aboard and not by bunkering water delivered from ashore. This is preferable because: P. aer uginosa cannot pass through either an evaporator or a reverse osmosis unit, as long as these are operated correctly. Bunkered water may contain P. aeruginosa. P. aeruginosa grows faster when pH is around 8. Produced water that is not alkalised holds a pH below 6. Feeding the diving system with this type of water will also limit growth of P. aeruginosa. Bunkered water Safe, Sufficient and Good Potable Water Offshore 68 and alkalised water normally hold a pH between 7 and 9. Legionella is not found in seawater (may occur in brackish water). 10.3 Design Conside r the following criteria in the design and construction of a diving system: Separate clos eable seawater inlets, see 6.1.2. Suitable pipe material Non- alkalised water produced aboard is very corrosive, and a suitable quality material must be used. Titani um is the best material and is highly recommended. Hard plastic is sometimes sugg - ested because of its resistance to corrosion, but should be avoided because P. aeru ginosa is a bacteria that easily forms biofilm on several types of plastic material s and m ay \"eat\" PVC. Dedicated tanks Recommendations for non- alkalised water being produced on board require separate potable water storage tanks for the diving system. The water is fed directly from the production unit to these tanks, and consequently, does not pass through the ordinary potable water tanks. This solution has the advantage that water from the regular potable water tanks, potentially contaminated by P. aeruginosa and Legionella from bunkered water, is not fed into the diving water system. Diving vessels often operate close to other units, making it difficult to produce water. To avoid using bunkered water in the diving sys tems, it is preferable to have storage tanks with enough capacity to ensure an adequate water supply. Disinfection units The diving system should have a system for stor - age tank chlorination, and possibility to increase the chlorine concentration by circula tion. Install two parallel UV unit s with particle filter s in front as close as possible to the pressure chamber. Replaceable shower heads with filters Use shower heads with filters (pore size up to 200 nanometres) to remove P. aeruginosa and Legionella. 10.4 Maintenance When the diving system is not in use, drain the water storage tanks and the pipe system. Before the storage tanks are re filled, they should be cleaned and disinfected, see appendix 13. If the diving system is use d often, it may be sufficient to disinfect the storage tanks twice a year. Before the pipelines from the tanks are ready for use, they should be disin fected with chlorine dioxide. This method is effect ive and inexpensive, and does not influence the rest of the potable water system on the unit. If the water analyses show growth of P. aerugi - nosa, clean and disinfect the infected parts of the system. If the growth is located within the diving system, use the same procedures as described above. If the growth includes the entire potable water system, proce dures described in appendices 12 and 13 apply. Suggested procedures for water production on board the units to dedicated storage tanks, and routines for disinfection of the storage tanks and pipelines, are given to prevent growth of P. aeru - ginosa, but also safeguard against Legio nella pneumophila.

Preface This checklist is meant as a tool for the planning and construction of potable water systems on offshore units, and should be included in the documentation submitted to the authorities when potable water systems are being built. The checklist should also be used in the planning of major changes of existing potable water systems. The checklist is general, and there will always be items not covered by this list, but nonetheless should be consider ed during the planning and construction. The owner/operator is responsible for building and operating the potable water system and delivering sufficient and satisfactory potable water according to the regulations. 2. Rules and guidelines The individuals responsible for planning and construction of the potable water system should be familiar with the contents in the following r egulations and guidelines: Regulations of 12th February 2010 No . 158, relating to health, environment and safety in the petroleum activities and on certain onshore facilities (consisting of the HSE Framework Regulation s with underlying regulations on management, activities and facilities ) Regulations of 4th December 2015, N o. 1406 concerning potable water and potable water s ystems on mobile offshore units Regulations of 4th December 2001 No . 1372, concerning potable water The NIPH guideline \" Sufficient, safe and good potable water offshore\" 3. Important decisions during early conceptual phase The person who has the overall system responsibility for the potable water system in the design phase should be designated. This person is experienced in operating such systems, and will ensure that the different p arts of the potable water system is designed in a way that is functional, both in isolation and as an entire system , with regards to operation, maintenance and technical solutions When building a potable water system, many important decisions are taken in the early planning stages. Our experience is that the best offshore water systems consist of the following units: Two seawater inlets located at a safe distance from the unit's discharge points, ref. item 5 The inlets are clos eable and are not connected to the same sea chests that supply cooling water for machinery or other types of water consumption that may occur close to shore , ref. item 5 At least two water production units (evaporators or rever se osmosis units), ref. item 8 Alkalising filter, ref. item 7 Two bunkering stations placed on opposite sides of the offshore unit, ref. item 8 Permanently installed chlorination unit (s), connected to the filling and recirculation pipes for the potable water tanks , ref. item 9 Safe, Sufficient and Good Potable Water Offshore 70 A sufficient number of potable water storage tanks with enough capacity, designed to facilitate maintenance and placed to avoid warming of the stored water, ref. it em 10 The potable water tanks have coffer dams or other rooms that do not pose any threat of pollution on all sides except against adjacent potable water tanks At least two UV unit s, ref. item 11 In addition to choosing type of units to be installed, the following must be clarified during the early design stage: Maximum amount of potable water required ( at least 200 litres/person/day) m3/day:____________ Maximum need for water supplied from the potable water system for purposes other than domestic (i.e. technical connections to the potable water system) :________________ A potable water system completely separated from the technical water supply system Experienced personnel have used 3D -verification of drawings to ensure that a ll components in the potable water system requiring regular maintenance or service are easily accessible and ergonomically designed, including: Bunkering station Chlorination unit Potable water tanks UV unit s Water maker Alkalising filter CO 2-unit Other water treatment units Manually operated valves 4. The potable water system in general The potable water system has been evaluated and measures taken to safeguard against human errors An analysis of the risk/vulnerability has been conduct ed for the potable water system It is documented that pipes, treatment units, fittings and other equipment (see 9.2.6): have sufficient quality with regard to corrosion will withstand the relevant water pressure will withstand the relevant water temperature will withstand the relevant chlorine content are suitable for potable water use All chemicals added to the potable water, or chemicals that may contaminate the system through leakage, maintenance work, b ack-suction etc., are certified , see 2.4 All drawings are easy to understand and include the entire potable water system, as well as other systems connected to the potable water system An internal control system is established, certifying that the potable water system is built according to drawings and specifications 5. Seawater inlet and seawater system There are two separate se awater inlets that may be operated separately The seawater inlets are well separated from each other b oth horizontally and vertically Inlets are clos eable and are not connected to the same sea chests that supply machinery cooling water , or other types of water consumption that may occur close to shore The spreading pattern of discharges from the unit has been calculated in relation to positioning the seawater inlets to secure a minimum of risks of poll ution via the seawat er inlet s If electrochlorination is used to prevent marine growth from blocking the seawater inlet, this system will at all times be operated without any risk of unacceptable levels of chlorine and bromine compounds after an evaporator Safe, Sufficient and Good Potable Water Offshore 71 6. Water production system The water production system has at least 2 production units, each producing at least 100 % of the water needed, or 3 units, each producing at least 50 % of the water needed . \"Water needed\" is equal to the sum of potable water (200 l/p/d) plus produced water that is used for other purposes (technical water etc.) With all production units in use, the production capacity is sufficient to cover both refilling of tanks that have been emptied (e.g. durin g maintenance) and to cover the normal water consumption in addition The production capacity is sufficient also at low seawater temperature (5oC) Each production unit has a conductivity meter activating an alarm in the control room when the salt content of the produced water is too high, and the produced water is automatically dumped For additional safety, there is an extra stage of conductivity measuring and dumping before the water is conducted to the potable water tanks For evaporators: The heating medium does not contain any harmful components that may pollute the potable water system if a leakage occurs . For reverse osmosis units: Pre -filters have sufficient capacity to cover maximum water production with all production units in use, and filters are easy to fill, empty and clean internally All additives are approved Excess potable water from potable water tanks can be led to othe r tanks via an overflow pipe, provided that the overflow is safeguarded against pollution, see 9.2.5. 7. Alkalising filter Pipes between water production units and alkalising filter can withstand corrosive water Alkalising filter (s) is placed ahead of the potable water tanks Alkalising filter (s) ha s/have sufficient capacity to cover maximum water production with all production units in use It is possible to add CO 2-gas to the water ahead of the filter There is sufficient water pressure to enable back flushing of the filter with potable water The filter is easy to fill, empty and clean internally 8. Bunkering station There are at least two bunkering stations, pl aced on either side of the unit The bunkering hoses are protected with a cap/plug The bunkering hoses can be flushed without any flush water e ntering the potable water tanks The f lush water pipes and valves have the same (or larger) dimension and capacity as the feeding pipes to the storage tanks The flush pipe is constructed to prevent flush water from causing inconvenience to the bunkering station attendants, th e supply vessel crew and other personnel Each bunkering station has a test tap plac ed up- stream of the shut -off valve The bunkering pipes have a low point drain to facilitate complete draining of the pipes after bunkering The bunkering station is clearly marked \" Drikkevann / Potable water\" in blue colour 9. Chlorine -dosing unit (s) A chlorine -dosing unit is permanently installed and connected to the fill ing pipes for the storage tanks A chlorine -dosing unit is permanently installed and connected to the recirculation pipes for the storage tanks The chlorine -dosing unit(s) ha ve sufficient capacity to disinfect all water at maximum supply speed . If a common chlorination unit is to be used for bunkering and recirculation, it must be suitable for both The chlorine -dosing is regulated by a flow meter The water from the bunkering station cannot be fed to the storage tanks without passing the chlorine - dosing unit The pipe length between the chlorine -dosing unit and the dosing point is minimised Safe, Sufficient and Good Potable Water Offshore 72 The chlorine -dosing unit is clearly marked and i s safeguarded against pollution The chlorine -dosing unit, including the flow meter regulation, has been verified to function 10. Storage tanks for potable water The potable water tanks are designed to make cleaning and maintenance easy: without inside frames , horizontal stiffeners etc. Tanks have a height of 2 to 4 met res. Tanks with greater height must be designed with permanent access platforms to ensure easy maintenance (minimum for every 4 met res of height ) The unit has a sufficient number of storage tanks with adequate storage capacity, ref. table 9.1. The table shows minimum total storage capacity for the different types of potable water systems. The values given state the total number of days all the tanks combined can supply water whe n the unit is fully manned, both potable and technical water consumption (if any). The tanks must be approximately the same size. The tank inlet and outlet a re placed far away f rom each other to facilitate circulation of all water in the tank during bunkering and normal operation, this to enhance mixing of chlorine and to pr event pockets of stagnant water . Bunkered and recirculated water is pumped into the tank in an angle that enhances circulation of the full water volume in the tank, an d return inlet , if any, from the distribution network is located as far apart from the tank outlet as possible Automatic valves or other physical measures ensure that water cannot be produced, bunkered or recirculated into a tank that at the same time is supplying the distribution network, and that return inlet from distribution network, if any, is routed into the same tank this water was supplied from The tanks are placed well -protected against heat from the surroundings . Avoid w ater temperatures above 20o C The storage tanks are equipped with test taps to enable water tests to be taken directly from the tanks without feeding the water thro ugh to the distribution system The tanks have a circulation system feeding the water from one tank via a chlorine -dosing unit and back to the same tank, without going through the distribution system. The pump and piping that is used for this recirculation have sufficient capacity to circulate the tank quickly (often 4 -6 hours ). The distribution system can simultaneously be supplied from another storage tank The tanks are accessible for necessary maintenance during operation. If manholes are located on deck, they must be in a \"clean\" area and be equipped with a rim at least 5 cm above deck level Other small water tanks, like calorifiers, hydrophore tanks and day tanks etc., are designed with sufficient access for inside cleaning and maintenance, and equipped with by -pass possibility if this is needed for uninterrupted water supply. These tanks do not contain stagnant water The tanks are equip ped with sufficient ventilation in a clean and exhaust -free area The ventilation system is pro tected against pollution and the openings are covered with a fine n et of corrosion proof material The potable water tanks have drain valves that provide complete and easy drainage (no remaining \"pockets\" with water) without having to use the potable water pumps Potable water is supplied for high pressure cleaning of tanks The potable water tanks are equipped with an automatic level meter connected to a manned con trol room The potable wa ter tanks have no joint walls with other tanks carrying petroleum products, liquid chemicals etc. Newbuilds should have potable water tanks with coffer dams or other rooms that do not pose any threat of pollution on all sides except against adjacent potabl e water tanks Pipes carrying other products than potable water are not carried through the potable water tanks. If this has not been possible, these pipes ar e carried through open ducts It is documented that the coating has been applied according to vendor's specifications with regard to method of application, thickness, washing and hardening of such coating , see section 9.1.4. After filling the tank, odour , taste and hydrocarbon content of the water has been verified When deciding upon protective coating, choose the alternative that is easiest to apply correctly and which is most suitable for potable water use Safe, Sufficient and Good Potable Water Offshore 73 11. UV unit s UV unit s are evaluated by the NIPH, and will be used according to specifications The UV unit s are biodosimetrically tested and give an UV dose of 40 mWs/cm2, see 8.3.2 The UV unit s have been dimensioned to handle water with UV transmission of 30 %/5 cm , see 8.3.2 At le ast two UV unit s have been installed. With just two units, each must be capable of disinfecting all potable water at maximum supply rate (peak values). With three units installed, each of these must be able to disinfect 50 % of the water When two or more UV unit s are used in parallel, it must be ensured that the water is evenly distributed between the units The UV treatment does not lead to excessive heating of the water, and the unit is, if necessary, equipped with effec t control that limits the UV dose when the water consumption is low The UV treatment is the final stage in the potable water treatme nt system prior to distribution Each UV unit has a sensor, measuring radiation intensity . If the intensity falls below accepted levels, or if the power or any UV bulbs fail, the water sup ply is automatically shut down Each UV unit has a timer and an alarm lamp for each of the UV lamp s There is a cartridge f ilter conn ected upstream of each UV unit (maximum pore size 50 micrometers) Test sampling of the water is made possible jus t before and after the UV unit 12. Water distribution system Potable water pipes outside living quar ter areas are marked \"Drikkevann\" and/or \"Potable water\" in blue colour Pumping capacity corresponds with water consumption, automatically adjusted pump flow is recommended Potable water pipes are not carried through tanks carrying other products than potable water. If this is not possible, those pipes are carried in open ducts. External pipes are p rotected against frost and heat Piping for hot and cold water is sufficiently isolated a nd located to maintain correct temperatures, see 9.2.1 The need for weekly flushing of pipes with s tagnant water has been minimised , see 9.2.7. The system is designed with as few such connections as possible. Piping that supply only consumers that do not spread aerosols will not need flushing if connected downstream a BA -valve (see NS -EN 1717) In case of contamination it is possible to drain the entire potable water system Connections to other liquid car rying systems are sufficiently safeguarded and broken/atmospheric connections chosen where this has been feasible. All other connections are safeguarded by verifiable technical barriers according to EN 1717, see 9.2.5. By connecting several such connections downstream the same protection module costs can be saved and the need for maintenance minimised. NOTE: A BA- type valve needs to be installed with a pre -filter and stop valves before and after, and such valve s will open automatically, so drainage for rele ased water should be provided Normal h oses connected to the potable water system in accommodation are equipped wit h at least one verifiable non- return valve (EA, see NS-EN 1717) . This also applies to showers where the hose may fall in a t oilet. In technical areas , hose connections are equipped with verifiable backflow protection devices (BA, see NS-EN 1717) If galleys etc. are equipped with hoses connected to mixing batteries (that may be in open position when the hose sw itch is closed), both cold and hot water supply to mixing battery must be equipped with at least one verifiable non -return valve (EA, see NS -EN 1717) . The water consumption in the different branches of the distribution system has been ana lysed, and the piping diameter is reduced to a minimum. Piping without circulation is dimensioned according to NS- EN 806- 3 For copper piping with circulating water the maximum flow should be below 0.7 m/s to prevent corrosion. Other types of piping will tolerate higher flow, but rapid flow may cause noise A sufficient amount of test taps gives the possibility to trace potable water quality changes throughout the system Safe, Sufficient and Good Potable Water Offshore 74 The test taps are short and self -draining, see 4.4 Hot water tanks deliver enough hot water to maintain a temperature of at least 60\u00b0 C at the coldest point in the system (measured after flu shing for one minute) , and hot enough to ensure that also the water in the bottom o f the hot water tank will frequently reach 60\u00b0 C The hot water system is provided with a membrane expansion vessel with a capacity of 5 .6% of the total calorifier volume, and the vessel drains regularly when hot water is consumed Safe, Sufficient and Good Potable Water Offshore 75 Appendi x 2 - Checklist for operational documentation of a potable water system (Potable water manual) The requirements are described in chapter 3. The operational documentation can be organised in various ways . Traditionally, offshore units have had voluminous potable water manuals but it has become more common to integrate the main part of the documentation in the general operational system for the unit. In this way , the manual simply becomes a key document, describing how the actual operational documentation is organised. This checklist is based on the normal content of traditional potable water manuals, but may also be used to check if it is easy to find similar documentation when these documents are integrated in the general operational system: General info rmation: 1.

Is the water acceptable (Y/N)? Signature by person responsible for bunkering: _______________________________________ * In general , supply vessel s do not need to chlorinate the water , as disinfection is ensured by both chlorine and UV treatment on the offshore unit . Further chlorination increase s the risk of exceeding the limit value for trihalomethanes and should only be done if the supply vessel can document good chlorination systems and routines. However, as this is in o ne extra step of chlorination, the offshore unit should increase the monitoring frequenc y for chlorination by -products . ** Preferably tested by two people , as these values are subjective and may be difficult. *** Strong light and white background is best t o detect dark particles, bl ack background for light ones . **** Previously values higher than 10 mS/m (equals 100 S/cm, see 4.6) were rare for Norwegian waterworks . Several Norwegian waterworks have introduced water treatment that is increasing the conductivity level to be between 10 and 15 mS/m. H igher values can be accepted if it is documented that the values are n ormal at the onshore waterworks where the supply vessel bunkers the water. ***** Perform some simple tests before distribution to check if the supply vessel deliberately or by mistake has deliver ed sub-standard water from a tank that was not sampled when bunkering .. Safe, Sufficient and Good Potable Water Offshore 82 Appendix 6 - Recommended requirements to supply base s and vessels The water quality should not deteriorate substantially during transport. B oth the supply base and the supply vessel must be able to document satisfactory routines for control and handling of the potable water. Below is a list of potential requirements when signing a contract for delivery of potable water. The list is meant as an example on procedures to ensur e a safe and well -documented potable water quality. Requirements to supply bases: 1. Only use supply bases receiving potable water from approved waterworks with good quality water . 2. The supply base should document the normal water quality from the supplying waterworks . The waterworks must have updated information on the potable w ater quality available to the recipient of the water. An annual report on the water quality should be available, and it is especially important to list the intervals within which the conductivity will vary, see item 9. Such normal conductivity values shoul d be reported to the supply vessel crew. 3. The supply base should have an agreement with the waterworks on the maximum pump speed applied when pumping to the supply vessel, and should make sure that this pump speed is not exceed ed. A pump speed that is too high can result in back- suction of contaminated water from the pipe system. 4. If the supply base is storing potable water on tanks from which water is bunkered (recommended solution) , these tanks have to be cleaned and disinfected frequently, see procedures in appendix 13. 5. The bunkering stat ion must have a suitable design, see section 7.1. 6. Before bunkering takes place, flush bunkering hoses and pipes for a few minutes with the same pump speed as when filling the supply vessel tanks. 7. The supply base must ha ve a quality system ensuring safe operation and maintenance, including water sampling for analyses. Supply vessel requirements: 8. Dump any remaining water in tank before bunkering from onshore. 9. After flushing the hoses and pipes on the supply base, the supply vessel crew sh ould take samples to document the quality of the received water before bunkering starts. The tests should include colour, odour , taste, clarity and conductivity. Only accept t he water if the requirements stated in chapter 4.3. 2 are fully m et, and when conductivity is within the limits stated by the waterworks , see item 2. Log t he results as they be used as documentation if the water is contaminated after the supply vessel received the water from the supply base. 10. The m aximum bunkering speed is determined by the supply base . Flushing should be done at max im- um 100% speed, and bunkering at a slower speed (to avoid disturbing organic material in land pipes). 11. Due to increased risk for formation of disinfection by -products, t he supply vessel nor mally should not chlorinate ( or ozonate ) the water. Chlorination may only be done under strictly controlled conditions. 12. Clean t he storage tanks and disinfect at least every 3 months , see appendix 13. Water tests will show if this frequency is sufficient. 13. The supply vessel crew should regularly test the water quality in the storage tanks, see appendix 4. Tests should be done just before and just after cleaning, see item 11, and under normal operation. This will also confirm that the cleaning frequency is ad equate, see also annual procedure in item 1 5. 14. Protective coating in the storage tanks must be suitable for potable water and should be applied in accordance with recommendations in section 9.1.4. 15. The supply vessel must have a quality system that ensures training, safe operation and maintenance. Annual quality test of the entire supply chain: 16. Once a year, check how the potable water quality varies throughout the supply chain. T ake sampl es from the supply base, the storage tanks on the supply vessel, the bunkering station and finally from the storage tanks after the water has been chlorinated. These samples should be analysed at an accredited laboratory, and should include parameters suggested in 4.3.3. A comparison of how the quality of the same water var ies through the supply chain will indicate improvement possibilities. Safe, Sufficient and Good Potable Water Offshore 83 Appendix 7 - Instructions for bacteriological testing of potable water Methods Methods for analyses are defined by the potable water r egulations, and the analysing laboratory must be accredited for these methods. Sample bottles The laboratory gives instructions on what type of sample bottles to use and how to handle them . Sampling from tap 1. Remove any strainers from the tap. 2. Sterilise the tap spout with a spirit flame (a match will su ffice). If open flame s are not allowed, disinfect the sample point thus : empty the tap spout of water. Fill a water glass with 70 % alcohol or a concentrated chlorine solution. Submerge the tap spout into the solution for 30 seconds. 3. Let the water flush fo r at least 3 minute s before taking the sample. 4. Remove the cap carefully from the sample bottle without touching the rim of the bottle opening. 5. Fill the bottle with water. 6. Close the sample bottle carefully without touching the cap or the bottle rim. 7. After t he test sampling, measure the water temperature at the sample point. Packing and shipment 1. Clearly mark t he bottles with sender, sample point, date, time, and water temperature. Use waterproof ink. 2. Send the bottles as soon as possible in a clean container (for instance a thermo s box). The samples should preferably reach the laboratory within 4 hours after sampling. If the transportation time exceeds this, chill the samples to between 2 and 10 o C during transportation and put in a refrigerator (about 4o C) upon arrival at the laboratory if the analysis cannot take place immediately. The time between sampling and analysi s shall not exceed 24 hours. 3. Send t est samples are to be sent as soon as possible to the relevant laboratory. 4. Test samples that are not packed and sent according to directions may not be analysed. 5. Arrange analysis with the laboratory before s ending the sa mples. Safe, Sufficient and Good Potable Water Offshore 84 Appendix 8 - Instructions for physiochemical sampling, including annual analyses Monthly physiochemical sampling The laboratory g ives instructions on type of sample bottles to use and how to handle the bottles. The laboratory must be accredited for the different test methods. Annual physiochemical potable water analysis Several annual analyses require use of special bottles that a re available from the laboratory performing the analyses . Test the water in the piping at the test point. Fi rst, fill the bottles for heavy metal analyses , then the special bottles for the different organic parameters, and finally fill a one litre bottle, all from the same sample point. If the values of heavy metals such as lead or cadmium are exceeded, take an extended sample from the very same sample point to establish how much is caused by leakage from materials in the piping. By comparing tests from the start and end points in the piping, changes in water quality will be documented. Extended sample Request s pecial bottles for heavy metal analyses from the analysing laboratory. Do not clean t hese bottles before use. 1. The sample point must not have been in use for the 10 hours before the sampling takes place. 2. Take a sample of the first cold water being tapped. 3. Take a new sample after one minute continuous flushing with the tap fully opened. 4. Analyse t he water samples for relevant parameter s, if necess ary also for lead, cadmium, chrome, mercury and nickel .

Before bunkering: 1. Bunkering to empty potable water tanks is recommended. If possible , dump any remaining water in the tank via the drain valve. 2. Check that a sufficient amount of hypochlorite with the correct concentration is prepared. The solution must not be too old. Adjust t he hypochlorite amount according to experience s from earlier bunkering s. If the pump is not operated by a flow meter, calculate the dosing speed. 3. Check that the valves on the chlorine -dosing system are open. Start the pump to ensure that it is operating properly. 4. Check that water is not exiting the tank being bunkered to. 5. Check that the shut -off valve on the bunkering station is closed. 6. Check that the flush valve is open. 7. Check the number of tanks tha t the supply vessel is going to deliver water from. During bunkering: 8. The bunkering hoses are connected to the supply vessel and flushed by way of the drain valve. 9. After the flushing is completed, take a water sample. If water is bunkered from more than o ne tank on the supply vessel, take a water sample from each of the supply tanks. Colour should be measured and odour , taste and cl arity should be logged (preferably by two people to ensure the quality of these judgements) . Reject w ater that does not meet t he requirements for potable water. The measured conductivity should not deviate from the values logged from previous bunkerings. This is to ensure that the conductivity measured on the bunkering station is approximately the same as conductivity measured at the supplying waterworks onshore, and normal onshore values should be obtained from this waterworks . To avoid long discussions with the supply vessel captain, get a second opinion before rejecting water due to odour , taste and clarity . 10. If the water is accepted, the bunkering can begin . Close t he drain valve, start the chlorine -dosing pump and pump the water to the storage tanks on the offshore unit. 11. Stop t he chlorine -dosing pump when the necessary calculated amount of chlorine has been added. After bunke ring 12. Isolate the storage tank for 30 minutes. 13. Analyse a water sample from the storage tank for free residual chlorine. The content should be within 0.1-0.5 mg/l. If too little chlorine has been added during bunkering, either dump the water or add more chlo rine to the water by recirculating the tank content through the chlorination unit back to the tank to achieve a sufficient mix of new chlorine in the water . Repeat points 12 and 13. 14. A quick visual evaluation , combined with c ontrol of odour , taste and conductivity , may detect if the supply vessel deliberately or by mistake has delivered sub- standard water from a tank that has not been tested. This will prevent further contamination of the water distribution system. 15. Log the m easured results, see appendix 5. A djust t he dosing to the same level at the next bunkering. Safe, Sufficient and Good Potable Water Offshore 90 Appendix 11 - Calculations in connection with chlorination Stored chlorine in dissolved form loses its strength after a while. Content of the various substances in different types of potable wa ter require different chlorine doses to achieve sufficient free residual chlorine after the 30 minutes of contact time. Regard t he following calculations as examples only, and adjust to the water quality being treated. When experience builds up regarding dosage, bunkering time and so forth, calculations may be unnecessary, as the bunkering log , see appendix 5, will give the necessary information on chlorine volume, necessary pump speed, mixing ratio, etc. 1. What is the required chlorine level? Regardles s of the method used, such as f lowmeter -regulated chlorination or manually -regulated pump, the chlorine amount must be calculated. When calculating the correct grams of chlorine to be used, it is important to remember that calcium hypochlorite holds 65 % free chlorine, while sodium hypochlorite holds only 15 % free chlorine, see 8.2.2 and 8.2.3. If the storage tank being bunkered to already contains substantial amounts of water, extra chlorine must be added to obtain the correct chlorine solution. If the water quality does not fluctuate, this means tha the same amount of chlorine is always required when filling a tank. The chlorine solution strength and/or the pump speed may vary if the tank is partly full . It is preferable to avoid bunkering to storage ta nks already containing substantial amounts of water, since this may make it difficult to blend in the chlorine properly. 2. How to make a chlorine solution of a specific concentration? The amount of disinfectant needed to make 1 litre of solution of a spe cific concentration is as follows: For sodium hypochlorite: Desired concentration (%) x 1000 ml Chlorine % in the chlorine container - The answer gives ml solution to be mixed with the water, and the amount of water plus the amount of solution together is one litre. For calcium hypochlorite: Desired strength (%) x 1000 g Chlorine % as powder or pills - The answer will give number of grams to be dissolved in one litre of water. 3. Calculation example for a flow regulated pump Let us say we have a potab le water tank holding 130 m3. We are going to fill it up completely and experience from previous bunkering shows that we need 1.0 gram chlorine per m3. Necessary chlorine amount: Total need is 130 m 3 x 1.0 g/ m3 = 130 grams of chlorine to disinfect the e ntire amount of water in this tank Bunkering time: Dosing speed for chlorine the pump is 20 litres per hour, and 200 m 3 per hour is going to be bunkered ) h/(m 200m 130 time Bunkering33 = = (If we, for instance, already had 30 m3 water in the tank when the bunkering started, the bunkering time for the remaining 100 m3 would have been 0.5 hour). Safe, Sufficient and Good Potable Water Offshore 91 Necessary chlorine concentration in the solution: Number of grams (g) chlorine to be added to the entire bunkering volume Bunkering speed (l/hour) x bunkering x grams 130ion concentrat chlorine Necessary = = 10 g/l equals 1 % chlorine solution. If the tank is emptied before bunkering, it is not necessary to calculate every time the required amount of chlorine concentration, provided that the quality of the water being bunkered is fairly stable. Had the tank already contained 30 m3 of water when the bunkering started, the bunkering time would have been 0.5 hour for the remaining 100 m3, and we would have had to increase the chlorine concentration in the solution to 1.3 % to obtain a sufficient disinfection of the entire water content. The calculation example is for mixing 13 litres of 1 % sodium hypochlorite solution. The sodium hypochlorite we have holds 15 % strength, and is approximately 2 months old. It weakens between 1 and 2 % per month, and to be safe we estimate the strength to be 10 %, see 8.2.2: ml 100% 10ml 1000 % 1=x We need 100 ml of 10 % solution to get 1 litre 1 % solution. To make 13 litres of such a solution we need 100 ml x 13 = 1300 ml (= 1.3 litr e). The easiest way to make this solution is to add the chlorine to the dosing tank, and then add water to a total volume of 13 litres. Please read the product data sheets and remember to wear protective gear! 4. Calculation example for a manually operate d pump We are going to bunker 130 m3 to an empty tank and bunkering speed is 200 m3 per hour . We need 1 gram chlorine per m3 and bunkering time is 0.65 hours, see calculations explained above. Dosing speed calculation: We can use a variety of chlorine s olution strength since the chlorine -dosing speed can be adjusted. In this example, we have a 5 % solution, and here too we need 130 gram of chlorine to disinfect the tank (this chlorine amount would be the same even if we had for example 30 m 3 in the tank to start with). As experience has shown, the necessary chlorine dose is 1 g/ m3, (but it would have increased to 1.3 g/ m3 if the tank already held 30 m3 of water). The dosing time (litre/hour) for the pump speed is calculated as follows: (g/l) 1000 x (%) strength Solution % 100) (g/m dose chlorine x hour)/ (m speed Bunkeringhour)l/ (in speed Dosing3 3x= The bunkering speed is 200 m3/hour, and the chlorine solution strength is 5 %, and we want the potable water to hold a chlorine dose of 1 g/m3 (equals 1 mg chlorine per litre). The 4g/l 0001% /hour x m 200 speed Dosing3 3 = =xx Consequently the chlorine -dosing pump should be set at 4 l/hour. Necessary amount of chlorine solution (l) = dosing speed (l/hour) x bunkering time (hour) Necessary amount of chlorine solution = 4 (l/hour) x 0.65 (hour) = 2.6 litres If we had 30 m3 of water in the tank, the chlorine -dosing speed would have to be increased to 5.2 l/hour in order to pump the same 2.6 litres of chlorine solution in half an hour. Safe, Sufficient and Good Potable Water Offshore 92 Appendix 12 - Cleaning and disinfection of a distribution system Disinfection can be done in different ways, for example by heat treatment (increasing the water tempera - ture to above 70o C for at least 5 minutes ) or by chlorination. Below is a description of a chlorination method where the water may be used as pot able water even during the disinfection process (a reasonably clean system is needed for the chlorination to be effective) . Lower doses of chlorine than those described below are not recommended as this often will not result in satisfactory distribution system disinfection. If more concentrated chlor ine doses are used , the water is not acceptable as potable water in this period . The chlorine effect is a function of dose x time. 1. Preparations: One person is assigned the responsibility for completing the work. Personnel must be informed of the following: - The distribution s ystem will be cleaned and disinfected with chlorine. - The high chlorine concentration may give the water an unpleasant odour and taste, especially if there is much biofilm in the system. Use b ottled water for cooking and drinking. - The water can be used for cleaning and personal hygiene (showering), as the values are according to WHO standards for potable water. Coloured clothes washed in this water may become bleached. 2. Adding chlorinated water Fill a potable water tank with water holding a concentration of close to 5 mg/l free chlorine (but not above this level if the water is still in normal use) . Open all taps on the distribution system and let the water run. It should run for a while after the smell of chlorine is obvious. Let the taps drip slowly, thereb y allowing new, chlorinated water to be added during the entire disinfect ion period. To avoid bacterial growth ,properly chlorinate places in the distribution system whe re there may be stagnant water. 3. Measuring chlorine content Measure the free chlorine content on a few water taps, choosing different locations, including the tap farthest away on the distribution system. The free chlorine concentration should be between 4 and 5 mg/l. If the chlorine content is significantly lower in some samples, the water has not been flushed long enough. After further flushing of all taps in the area, take new chlorine samples . The water can be used during the disinfection. After 12 hours, take samples from different locations in the distribution system (including one samp le at farthest location), to document enough remaining free chlorin e. 4. Repeat ing the procedure If, after 12 hours, the free chlorine content has decreased more than 1 mg/l in most of the sample spots, repeat the procedure without delay. If unpleasant odour and taste still linger a fter the procedure is finish - ed, this is a sign that the chlorine disinfection has not been effective enough and should be repeated. Before repeat ing the procedures, it is important to flush the distribution system. This will remove the substances dissolved by chlorine and new chlorine rich water can easily remove the remaining biofilm . 5. Emptying tanks and distribution system of chlorine rich water Empty the chlorinated potable water tank, and flush the distribution system with w ater from another tank, by opening all taps. C hlorine content should now be below 0.5 mg/l . Flushing will also remove organic matter (dead biofilm etc.), and reduce the risk for rapid growth of new biofilm. 6. Special treatment of shower heads and shower hos es Plastic shower heads and shower hoses are often difficult to chlorinate, as they may contain a lot of bio- film. Every three months , disassemble and clean these fixtures (using soap or acid as nece ssary) before they are disinfected. Disinfection may be done by chlorination ( soaking in 50 mg/l free chlorine for an hour, dilut e a 5% chlorine solution 1:1000) , rapid boiling (5 minutes) , or hanging ( until they are completely dry internally ). If the procedures described above do not give low colony counts , the cause must be found. Possible solutions may be use of chemicals that clean and disinfect , or piping renewal. Safe, Sufficient and Good Potable Water Offshore 93 Appendix 13 - Cleaning and disinfection of potable water tanks Below is one possible method for cleaning and disinfect ing potable water tanks. Alternative methods may also be used, for example by using other disinfectants or by spraying all surfaces within the tank with sufficiently concentrated chlorine (the product of concentration'time shall at least be equal to 5ppm over 12 hours, and the work must be risk assessed). 1. Preparation Only use clean equipment and protective gear. Use t he storage capacity in all other potable water tanks. If re-coating of the tank is required, it will take up to one week before the tank may be ready for use, provided that the hardening process does not cause any prob lems. If problems arise, the tank may be out of operation for a long time. The amount of water needed, hardening requirements, manpower, potable water production possibilities etc. should be considered and included in planning the maintenance work, to ensure enough water during the maintenance period. 2. Drainage Drain the tank completely , if necessary with a mobile drain pump. 3. Inspection/supervision Assess t he frequency of cleaning/disinfection during tank inspection/supervision. With a small amount of slime and sediment in the tank and with low and stable colony counts, the cleaning intervals are satisfactory. Log t he inspection results. 4. Cleaning Only use water of potable water quality for cleaning . The surfaces in the tank should be flushed under high pre ssure , and better results may be achieved with cleaning agents. If necessary, scrub t he surface with stiff brushes. After scrubbing and flushing, drain the tanks completely. 5. Inspection/supervision After draining , inspect the tank to evaluate the cleanin g. Check the protective coating and completely or partly renew if necessary . The air -vent opening, including float ball and corrosion proof net, should be checked and repaired if necessary. Log t he inspection results. 6. Appliance of protective coating The protective coating has to be certified and it must be documented that it has been correctly applied (also for patch coating), see 9.1.4. Incorrect appliance of coating has caused major problems for several offshore units. 7. Disinfection Water that , in addit ion to tank disinfection, is intended to disinfect the distribution system, must hold a chlorine content of approximately 5 mg /l chlorine (5ppm). If the water is not intended for this purpose , a chlorine content of at least 10 mg/l (ppm) is recommended. A suggested calculation method for the chlorine solution can be found in appendix 11. When the storage tank has been completely filled up, the water sh ould have a free chlorine content of at least 4 mg/l (ppm). Do not use t he water fo r at least 12 hours, but preferably let it circulate in the tank. 8. Control After 12 hours , take a sample to document that the water still contains enough free chlorine; the chlorine reduction should be less than 1 mg/l . Normally the tank water is dumped, as it does not satisfy the potable water requirements regarding odour and taste. T he water may also be used to disinfect the distribution system, provided that the free chlorine content is approximately 5 mg per litre , see appendix 12. www.fhi.no Norwegian Insititute of Public 2016 P .O.
