We applaud and celebrate your academic achievements \u2014 among your other accomplishments \u2014 and look forward to seeing you at some of our many alumni events. Our cover story in this issue tackles the fundamental and signi cant changes that Commencement Season has gone through, as well as the many offerings available to support alumni post-graduation. As you begin your career and professional lives, amid the Great Resignation that has impacted workplaces worldwide, I believe many of you will nd useful takeaways from this feature article. Elsewhere in this issue, we invite alumni and students from different backgrounds to discuss the increasingly digitalised world we nd ourselves living in. As 63% of the global population \u2014 or 5 billion of us \u2014 use digital tools and interact with one another online, we are now faced with reimagining every aspect of life in this current era. This was also strongly refl ected at the recent NUS Alumni Leaders Forum 2022 , held on 9 April, that carried the theme of Reimagining Leadership in the New Normal . Alumni leaders came together to share and brainstorm new ideas and best practices, discussing the needs of NUS alumni, digital transformation during and beyond COVID-19, and lifelong learning goals. 2022 heralds a fresh start as things begin to open up, and my colleagues and I are boldly conceptualising refreshing ways to double down on lessons learnt across the pandemic. As we welcome more of you back in person, our upcoming signature events, Bukit Timah Homecoming and Kent Ridge Alumni Family Day , will refl ect these lessons learnt - with hybridity and agility. I look forward to the opportunities to meet and connect with many of you in-person. Please continue to stay vigilant, keep well, and stay safe and healthy, all while we #stayconnected as #OneNUS!

The Council \u2014 chaired by NUS President and composed of faculty and staff from different specialisations \u2014 guides and shapes policies and programmes on how the University equips graduates with future-ready skills, generates new knowledge and develops a climate-resilient campus. INNOVATION-INSPIRED RESEARCH EXCELLENCE Acknowledging the complexity of climate science and sustainability, NUS researchers conduct high-quality inter-disciplinary research to create new knowledge and develop sustainability solutions optimised for tropical, urban and Asian settings to meet the needs of increasingly urgent, yet multifaceted global challenges. The University has identied the following priority research domains: Green Energy Technologies : solar, waste-to- energy, energy efciency, energy storage, green hydrogen fuel production, carbon capture, storage and utilisation Urban Heat Resilience : smart cooling, climate-sensitive design of the urban environment, heat stress and associated strategies Coastal Engineering and Flood Prevention : tracking sea level rise, modelling of coastal flooding, flood prevention and coastal protection Nature-based Climate Solutions : protecting and better managing natural ecosystems, informing climate policies and strategiesAs a leading global university based in Asia and Singapore's flagship university, NUS is committed to advancing sustainable development and contributing to the ght against climate change.

The Campus Sustainability Roadmap 2030 comprises three key programmes:INNOVATION AND CHINA'S GLOBAL EMERGENCE \"Bringing together seasoned experts on Chinese science and technology, the book offers exceptionally lucid discussions of issues affecting China's future as a world leader in innovation.\" Richard P. Suttmeier, University of Oregon Available at NUS Press and other local leading bookstores.Edited by Professor Erik Baark, Visiting Research Professor at NUS East Asian Institute; Professor Bert Hofman, Director of NUS East Asian Institute and Professor of Practice at Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy; and Dr Qian Jiwei (Arts and Social Sciences '11), Senior Research Fellow, NUS East Asian Institute. China is working hard to shift to an economy driven by innovation and productivity growth. The global implications of this transition will be signicant, given the size of China's economy and the degree of its integration into world trade and global value chains. The degree of scrutiny on the manner and means of transition will likewise be intense, particularly given the rise of techno-nationalism and a changing strategic calculus around the world. China is attempting to balance the reliance on overseas sources of technology that has served it so well, with efforts to strengthen purely domestic innovation capabilities, not least as a hedge against the risks of a US-led \"decoupling\". In these circumstances, a better understanding of the many different forces of change within China \u2014 and the way it responds to outside changes \u2014 is essential. The evolution of China's innovation economy will be one of the key economic stories of the early 21 st century, and the world will need China as a source of innovation in the decades ahead. The aim of this book is to help build a better framework for policymakers overseas and in China to nd a new equilibrium in negotiating the terms of this engagement.

His family of four had only his mother as the sole breadwinner, and she unfortunately passed away in his third year of studies. Besides having to cope with this loss, he also experienced a radical change in his responsibilities as the eldest able-bodied individual in his family.

When I started my NUS journey, I aimed to improve student life at the university, which I accomplished in my time as a faculty student union leader. The bursary I received helped ease the weight of tuition fees, and I could take part in campus activities instead of having to work part-time to maintain nances. The nancial aid had helped to stabilise my family's nancial situation, allowing me to stay in school and weather through this troubled time.

I am realistic that philanthropy cannot stamp out every inequality that exists in our system. H owever, for all students who receive nancial aid thanks to the support of donors, philanthropy provides a transformative opportunity for them, and their lives, to beat the system where their circumstances may have failed them. A gift that arrives at the right time, means the world for those who receive it. Let me recount the story of an old man, a young girl and a shore of starshes: To all NUS donors, thank you for enabling students like me to continue pursuing our studies, and part in enriching campus activities. Many of us do not lack in ability; we are merely held back by our circumstances. Gifts like yours truly help to lev el the playing eld for us, and uplift not only us, but also the people who are counting on us to transform our life trajectory.At the break of dawn, an old man walks along a beach, tides washing in and out. Along the way, he sees a girl picking up something and throwing it into the water. He gets closer and sees the starshes that had washed up on the shore. One by one, the girl tosses them into the sea, only for the waves to carry more back onto the sand. The old man asks, \"What does it matter? Y ou can't save a whole beach of starshes.\" The girl stops to consider his words, then picks up another starsh to lob back into the sea. Pointing to the ripple where the starsh landed, she said , \"It mattered for TANNo one knows what the future holds, except that there is a vast and technology-dr iven world out there. NUS has done its best to prepare students for a d igital, post-pandem ic soc iety \u2014 and done it well \u2014 through the introduct ion of game-chang ing tech tools and major reforms focus ing on technology subjects. participation and engagement. For instance, students can tune in to multiple Commencement sessions live on YouTube and post congratulatory messages to friends from other courses, while relatives living abroad can also watch the e-ceremonies. No matter the situation, one cannot refute that technology is seeping into almost every aspect of our lives. At NUS, this is evident not only in the shift to an interdisciplinary curriculum \u2014 where all undergraduates are taught concepts like data literacy and computational thinking \u2014 but also in the increasing use of educational technology (edtech) to promote blended learning and give students greater control over their own learning journeys. These changes lay the groundwork for students to develop digital know-how and adaptability, which will be invaluable once they graduate into the real world. GOING ALL IN ON EDTECH From the lockdown during the circuit-breaker period to the pendulum swings between easing and tightening of SMMs, and now to a, hopefully permanent, lifting of COVID-19 restrictions, the Classes of 2020, 2021 and 2022 have endured all the upheavals wrought by the pandemic over the last two-and-a-half years. They had to quickly adjust to home-based learning, accessing Zoom 'live' classes and pre-recorded lectures, and sitting for online proctored exams. As the economy gradually reopened, NUS likewise took a phased approach to resuming campus operations. Students as well as staff had to initially stay within designated zones to prevent cross-infection, and FOCUS WHAT AWAITS THE GRADUATING CLASS OF 2022 AS THEY ENTER THE WORKFORCE? The recent easing of COVID-19 safe management measures (SMMs) and reopening of borders suggest that, on some level, a sense of normalcy is being restored. Employees used to working from home are now reacquainting themselves with ofce life. While some companies are mandating a full return to the ofce, others are opting for a hybrid work model that leverages video conferencing software and online collaboration tools to allow employees to work remotely part of the time. This year's NUS Commencement in July \u2014 which will be held in person with SMMs such as mask-wearing indoors and verication of vaccination statuses for all graduands and guests \u2014 similarly comprises a mix of old and new. Back for the rst time since the pandemic began are Held last October, the in-person Commencement 2021 ceremonies were livestreamed on YouTube. 14 . THE ALUM NUS JUL\u2014SEP 2022 . 15 ceremonial traditions such as the full academic procession, balloon drop and taking of class photos. \"Commencement is one of the most signicant milestones for students as it marks the completion of their studies,\" says Mr R. Rajaram (Afliate Alumnus '20), NUS Registrar. \"A virtual ceremony cannot offer the same experience as a physical ceremony \u2014 from wearing the graduation gown and receiving the degree scroll on stage to celebrating the occasion with fellow classmates and loved ones.\" That said, the University is also taking a leaf from last year, when it held two Commencement ceremonies \u2014 a rst-ever virtual one, followed by a pared-down physical event a few months later \u2014 for both the Classes of 2020 and 2021. Some online features will be retained, such as YouTube livestreaming of ceremonies and augmented-reality Instagram lters, to enable wider and deeper INTO THE GREAT UNKNOWN FOCUS hybrid teaching meant that in-person classes were capped at 50 students with the rest joining virtually from home. Only lately have group size limits \u2014 including for co-curricular activities (CCAs) \u2014 been removed, and unvaccinated individuals are now allowed on campus if their self-swab antigen rapid test (ART) result is negative. Although these changes were unprecedented, NUS had to some extent already prepared itself for such a crisis. \"After the 2003 SARS epidemic, we instituted an e-Learning Week in 2008 to test our readiness in the event of another outbreak,\" says Professor Bernard Tan (Science '89), Senior Vice Provost (Undergraduate Education). Beginning with certain schools and faculties, all classes and assessments were conducted online for one week, with NUS Information Technology (NUS IT) and the Centre for Instructional Technology (CIT) providing the necessary IT infrastructure. The initiative was subsequently extended to the entire University in later years. As such, when COVID-19 struck in 2020, the impact on teaching and learning activities was manageable. Electronic conferencing and meeting systems as well as video management platforms were already in place. Most faculty members were utilising the campus-wide learning management system LumiNUS for their modules, be it to conduct online quizzes, post class timetables or upload web lectures. Many students were also reliant on LumiNUS to keep track of their assignments and 16 . THE ALUM NUSdeadlines. What the pandemic did was accelerate the adoption of these technologies among the NUS community. NUS' e-learning needs have since stretched way beyond one week, and CIT's work has concomitantly grown manifold. While university campuses around the world stayed closed, CIT partnered Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) Ms Sharlyn Ng (Nursing + Arts and Social Sciences '21) and Mr Vincent Cai (Public Health '21) certainly had an eventful period while studying at NUS. Despite the disruptions, these young alumni made the most of the opportunity in their own ways. Top: Lightboards allow presenters to write notes while facing viewers. Above: Earthquake simulation with virtual reality.Edtech is an important supplement to enhance traditional teaching and learning pr ocesse s. It provides students with easy-to-access information, accelerated learning, and fun opportunities to practise what they learn. It also deepens their understanding of the subject matter being taught. Mr Ong Chin Hwa, Director, Centre for Instructional Technology, NUS BRING IT ON! JUL\u2014SEP 2022 . 17 providers such as Coursera and edX to give NUS students free access to MOOCs and encourage remote learning. Then, in anticipation of students' phased return to campus, CIT had to quickly scale the retrotting and conversion of existing classrooms into hybrid-ready mode. The Centre procured webcams, speaker phones, visualisers and writing tablets for loan to teaching staff. It also set up self-recording studios and a lightboard room, equipped with digital and audio-visual technologies, for the recording of lectures. With CIT's assistance, faculty members became bolder in jazzing up presentation slides with 360\u00b0 videos, animations, voice-overs and other elements to make their lectures more interesting and engaging. Other projects spearheaded by CIT include Blended Learning 2.0 and geNiUSworld, both of which were introduced to improve student learning outcomes. Under the former, opportunities to design (or redesign) modules and courses through the flexible and meaningful integration of face-to-face and online instruction are being explored. For example, large lectures involving the one-way dissemination of knowledge (from lecturer to students) could possibly migrate online, while tutorials and labs \u2014 where small-group discussions and hands-on learning happen \u2014 would remain face-to-face. geNiUSworld is an online repository of multimedia-enhanced e-books and educational videos created by \u2014 and shared with \u2014 NUS staff and students, thus promoting professional development and peer learning. Indeed, the University is not merely dabbling in tech-enhanced learning as a temporary solution to COVID-related challenges; it has a more ambitious goal in mind. \"COVID-19 has established the fact that the hybrid model is here to stay,\" says Mr Ong Chin Hwa (Computing '91), Director of CIT. \"Edtech is an important supplement to enhance traditional teaching and learning processes. It provides students with easy-to-access information, accelerated learning, and fun opportunities to practise what they learn. It also deepens their understanding of the subject matter being taught.\" Out of all the buzzy new edtech tools being piloted at NUS, extended reality might just have the most transformative potential. The Department of Geography recently began using virtual reality (VR) headsets together with a vibrating platform to simulate earthquake scenarios and let students experience what an earthquake feels like. At the Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine (NUS Medicine), those unable to complete clinical postings in 2020 due to COVID-19 restrictions were able to still immerse themselves in an operating theatre scenario through a VR game that taught patient safety and effective communication with Ms Sharlyn Ng, 24, a registered nurse at NUH\"I was in the third year of my Nursing degree when COVID-19 hit in early 2020. At the time, I had been preparing to minor in Economics and was taking one Economics module that semester while attached to the National University Hospital (NUH). It was very tiring to have to constantly travel between NUS for my Economics classes and NUH for my afternoon shifts, so the move from physical to online classes made things easier for me, especially once my attachment resumed halfway through the semester. In my nal year, I decided to switch my Economics minor to a major, as I could squeeze in more classes now that everything was online. Aside from learning to cope with Zoom fatigue and getting used to studying alone at home, I didn't have much difculty adjusting to online classes. I appreciated the fact that I could catch up on Zoom lectures and rewatch recorded tutorials at twice the speed to facilitate my learning, at each phase. For me, it was an eye-opening experience to witness the emergence of a new pathogen and how the world mobilised to respond to this threat. It made me realise the importance of leadership and clear objectives in balancing multiple goals in an environment that is constantly evolving. Now back in my original job scope, I have expanded into a few other diseases and still assist occasionally with COVID-related matters. NUS exposes students to a broad worldview and encourages innovation to address future needs. I would advise new graduates to be brave, step out of your comfort zone and take on challenges that stretch your capabilities. You would be surprised by how much we often underestimate our own ability to adapt and grow.\"sometimes while on my way to NUH or during breaks when on shift. I attended both the online and physical Commencement ceremonies in 2021. The latter was more meaningful, as I had not seen many of my fellow batchmates and friends in person since physical classes stopped the year before. Most of us had already started working as well. It was a rare chance for us all to be together in one place, given the restrictions on social gatherings then.\" Mr Vincent Cai, 32, a Public Health Ofcer at MOH \"I started working at the Ministry of Health's (MOH) Communicable Diseases Division in late 2019, while pursuing my part-time Master of Public Health degree. My primary job scope was the surveillance, epidemiology and response for droplet-borne diseases such as measles and rubella. But shortly after that, I was redeployed to MOH's COVID-19 Contact Tracing Task Group (now called the Contact Tracing and Epidemiology Centre). The pandemic went through numerous phases and changes; it felt like we were dealing with a new virus FOCUS deploying energy-efcient cooling technologies. In addition, moving further into the extended-reality space and offering more virtual or immersive lessons would lead to less dependence on physical space and resources like paper. \"So, when our students graduate, their experience at NUS will help them bring that same S3 awareness into society,\" says Ms Tan. NUS' digital transformation is picking up steam in other areas too. A major player on the scene is the Centre for Future-ready Graduates (CFG), whose suite of tech tools and resources is designed to help students as well as alumni achieve career success. With its 24/7 virtual career assistant VMock \u2014 which utilises AI, machine learning and a sophisticated analytics engine \u2014 they can get instant and personalised feedback to improve their resumes and video interview skills. There is also NUS career+, a mobile app that builds a personalised skills prole for users and provides matching job openings. Other newer digital platforms by CFG include Internship-As-A-Service (IAAS) and conNectUS, both launched in January 2022 to prepare students for the working world. An exclusive professional networking platform for the NUS community, conNectUS brings together healthcare professionals. NUS Medicine is now going one step further with a new mixed-reality technology that merges the real and virtual worlds. Using actual tools, medical and nursing students get to practise inserting urinary catheters and intravenous tubes in patients, while being guided by 3D holograms projected from their headsets. ACROSS THE uNivUS The growing applications of VR, alongside other edtech tools, in NUS' curricula are a clear indication that the University is well on its way to becoming a 'Smart, Safe and Sustainable' (S3) campus. \"With the pandemic, there has been a greater slant on the safety aspect,\" says Ms Tan Shui-Min (Computing '91 + Business '02), Chief Information Technology Ofcer at NUS. \"We have introduced many solutions to promote safety and also ensure a good user experience.\" Chief among these is uNivUS \u2014 a one-stop mobile app unveiled in April 2020 that connects users to key NUS services and resources, including adherence to SMMs on campus. Short for 'Uniting NUS Individuals', uNivUS was conceived in 2019 to integrate all the disparate NUS apps into a single platform for better convenience and efciency. As the pandemic unfolded, NUS IT \u2014 in collaboration with the Organisational Excellence Transformation Unit (OETU), within the Ofce of the President \u2014 pivoted quickly and developed new features to support SMMs ahead of the app's launch. The rst version of uNivUS was used primarily for daily temperature declaration and access to campus facilities. Subsequent features included (1) overseas battery life of their smartphones, or scroll through an Inbox Feed to keep up with campus happenings and bookmark their favourite news. Ms Tan notes that plans are underway to extend the app to NUS alumni as well. \"Beyond the pandemic, we envision uNivUS as a smart personal digital assistant that will serve as the single point of entry to all NUS digital services for everybody related to NUS: students, staff and alumni,\" she explains. \"It will morph and evolve according to each individual's journey with the University. For example, it could nudge students who have omitted a video that their lecturer has asked them to watch, or recommend to alumni lifelong learning opportunities relevant to their careers.\" READY FOR THE FUTURE Notwithstanding its current focus on safety, NUS has not been lying idle in the other S3 dimensions either. The intended customisation of uNivUS to users' individual proles is one example of smart, user-friendly technologies that the University aims to develop. In more groundbreaking news, NUS embarked on a partnership with StarHub early this year to provide outdoor WiFi on campus using 5G as the backhaul, which complements NUS' existing indoor campus wireless network. The beauty of this solution is twofold, Ms Tan explains. Using 5G (instead of bre optic cables) as a conduit removes the need for excavation work and laying of underground pipes, which in turn shaves years off the implementation and lowers construction costs. It is also Singapore's rst 100% solar-powered campus WiFi, thus delivering on the sustainability agenda to boot. With the increased wireless capacity and high- speed connectivity accorded by 5G, the stage is set for NUS to test all kinds of Internet of Things (IoT) applications. Various smart innovations are being tested to see whether they can improve campus facilities management. For instance, security robots and drones are patrolling the campus to detect suspicious objects or activities. Sanitary sensors have also been installed in toilets to monitor variables such as ammonia and occupancy levels, as well as water and soap consumption, to enable a quicker response for cleaning and maintenance work. At present, 5G network coverage and IoT devices are being deployed within NUS University Town (UTown) as part of a two-year trial. The next step is to roll these out campus-wide, which will hopefully enhance productivity, efciency and safety. On a related note, NUS' smart campus initiatives are also closely linked to sustainability. Ms Tan shares that work is ongoing to keep the NUS Data Centre a green one, for example, by travel declaration, (2) visitor registration, (3) uploading a picture of ART results, with an articial intelligence (AI) engine that suggests the test result, (4) NUSafe, which notied users if they had crossed zones on campus (until zoning restrictions were lifted in December 2020) and alerts those who have been in close proximity with infected individuals, (5) NextBus Widget, which monitors the arrival times of buses on campus, (6) Crowd Insight, which provides visibility to crowd levels at NUS canteens and libraries, (7) a calendar to keep track of upcoming classes and exams, as well as (8) links to frequently-used NUS services and informational resources. \"Timing offered uNivUS the perfect opportunity to become the de facto mobile platform for the University,\" says OETU's Director, Mr Roy Tan (Business '15). Another factor behind its successful roll-out is the emphasis on student engagement, he adds. \"We want a successful app for students, by students. It's best to collaborate with students to design an app that is both well-received and functional. We do so through channels such as the Telegram student community, engaging student designers and consulting with interns at NUS IT.\" Right from the outset, student volunteers were invited to join the project team, where they contributed ideas and gave feedback on early prototypes of uNivUS. Its new-look user interface, refreshed last year, was based largely on their design inputs. Their suggestions were also incorporated into the latest version of uNivUS, released in April 2022. Users can now choose a Dark Mode option to reduce glare and extend the Timing offered uNivUS the perfect opportunity to become the de facto mobile platform for the University. Mr Roy Tan, Director, Organisational Excellence Transformation Unit, NUS When our students graduate, their experience at NUS will help them bring that same S3 awareness into society.

THE ALUM NUSFOCUS 20 . THE ALUM NUSalumni and students through features such as a people directory, live feeds and forums, an event calendar and job listings. Alumni get to expand their professional networks and enhance their job search or recruitment activities, while students can plug into the wide and diverse alumni pool for mentorship. One early adopter is Mr Charles Lee (Engineering '21), now an Associate Product Manager at local ntech start-up YouTrip. Not long after signing up with conNectUS, he was contacted by nal-year Geography major Mr Joel Ng (Arts and Social Sciences '22), who wanted to break into product management and sought out Mr Lee for career advice. \"Given that I had only been in the industry for a year, I saw Joel as more of a peer than a mentee. Both of us had interesting insights to learn from one another. I told him about my experience at my rst job as well as my considerations when it came to selecting it, while conNectUS is a safe and convenient avenue to exchange ideas, thoughts and advice. Through the platform, alumni like me can easily stay connected to our alma mater and pay it forward to juniors. I've also reached out to other NUS alumni on the forums for advice on my own career decisions. Mr Charles Lee, Associate Product Manager, YouTrip We deliberately show how problems can be more thoroughly understood when viewed from multiple disciplinary lenses, and how effective solutions can be conceived by combining knowledge from various disciplines. Professor Bernard Tan, Senior Vice Provost (Undergraduate Education), NUShe shared with me the interview questions that tech recruiters had asked him. It was a mutually benecial relationship where we both wanted to help the other grow,\" says Mr Lee, 26. \"conNectUS is a safe and convenient avenue to exchange ideas, thoughts and advice. Through the platform, alumni like me can easily stay connected to our alma mater and pay it forward to juniors. I've also reached out to other NUS alumni on the forums for advice on my own career decisions.\" Similarly, IAAS is a gig marketplace that provides NUS students with the chance to land gigs and internships with a diverse range of companies \u2014 local or foreign, large or small, within or outside their degree specialisation. Students thus have a wealth of opportunities to gain hands-on work experience, unbounded by the academic calendar, while employers on their part can tap on this talent pool for skilled services. For Mr Chen Yao (Engineering '22), who joined IAAS' pilot phase prior to its ofcial launch, the flexibility offered by the platform was the best part. \"I had previously interned JUL\u2014SEP 2022 . 21at engineering and tech companies, but using IAAS allowed me to explore other industries,\" says Mr Chen, 25. \"What caught my interest was the opportunity to take on bite-sized projects during semester time, with flexible arrangements, while concurrently working on my nal-year project.\" The Mechanical Engineering major secured a three-month internship at a family business in the nance industry, where he assisted colleagues in analysing and identifying ntech projects with growth potential and then generating an investor report. \"Through the experience, I interacted with people from different backgrounds and broadened my spectrum,\" he shares. \"It allowed me to develop interdisciplinary knowledge and skills, and become more adaptable in various situations and environments. This is very important in today's world.\" THE CALL FOR INTERDISCIPLINARITY Much has been said and written lately about NUS' shift to interdisciplinary education. The University made a big splash in December 2020 with its formation of the College of Humanities and Sciences (CHS), an enhanced undergraduate experience that encourages students from the Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences and the Faculty of Science to break out of their respective silos. This was followed by the College of Design and Engineering (CDE), which merged the Faculty of Engineering and the School of Design and Environment. The newest entrant, NUS College (NUSC), incorporates best practices from Yale-NUS College and the University Scholars Programme. Open to students applying for almost all undergraduate programmes at NUS, NUSC will admit its rst intake in Academic Year 2022/23. During a radio interview with CNA938 earlier this year, NUS' Senior Vice Provost (Undergraduate Education) Professor Bernard Tan spoke about the value of these educational reforms. \"In an increasingly complex and fast-changing world, our graduates working in many industries will be confronted with problems that cannot be thoroughly understood when viewed from any one discipline,\" he argued. An interdisciplinary education is therefore vital to prepare them for the working world. This, he stressed, means not just letting students take courses from multiple disciplines, but also emphasising the interface and interplay between them. \"We deliberately show how problems can be more thoroughly understood when viewed from multiple disciplinary lenses, and how effective solutions can be conceived by combining knowledge from various disciplines,\" said Prof Tan. Careful thought went into designing the curriculum structure and content of CHS, CDE and NUSC. While students are free to pursue intellectual breadth or depth based on their interests, all three colleges ensure a rm >11,000 users (alumni and students) are on conNectUS IAAS has attracted >1,500 students and >140 companies who have posted >600 gigs and flexible internships *Latest statistics from CFG as of 29 April 2022. 1.

GREEN ECONOMY Workers familiar with green process design, carbon footprint management, and environmental frameworks and policies will be needed to combat climate change and achieve sustainability. DID YOU KNOW? SkillsFuture Singapore has identied three key growth pillars with exciting career opportunities. As luck would have it, these three areas loosely mirror NUS' S3 campus strategy: 3. CARE ECONOMY Driven largely by our ageing population, care professionals who demonstrate ethical conduct, effective stakeholder management and inclusive practices will be in high demand. Y ng, W? ed ing ld * JUL\u2014SEP 23A digital native, Chen Pinzhang (Engineering '21) found his feet in technopreneurship while studying at NUS, thanks to its novel Design-Your-Own-Module (DYOM) initiative. The 26-year-old is also the founding Chairperson of NUS Alumni Ventures (NAV), the rst alumni-led angel investment network in Southeast Asia. \"In 2019 \u2014 when I was serving as the President of NUS Entrepreneurship Society (NES) \u2014 we designed and launched NES Startathon under the DYOM framework. NES Startathon is a year-long module that guides aspiring student-entrepreneurs to create their own start-ups, from ideation and validation to early-stage commercialisation. As part of the module's pilot batch, I formed a team with two other students and fellow gamers, and that was how our hardware gaming start-up WRAEK came about. It was also during my tenure as NES President that I noticed how difcult it was for student-entrepreneurs to gain access to angel investors. So, together with other like-minded students and alumni, we set up NAV in 2020. We now have about 80 NUS alumni angel investors on board our network. Three start-ups have successfully obtained funding so far, and we've also matched more than 30 start-ups with mentors. CHART YOUR OWN PATH Recently, with the relaxation of SMMs, NAV held its rst-ever physical Demo Day & Networking Dinner, after ve online runs over the past two years. It was great for students to nally be able to meet, and pitch their start-ups to, potential angel investors in person. What I've learned from these experiences is that being a self-motivated, independent learner will help greatly in the workplace. COVID-19 has, in a way, accelerated this pace. Due to remote learning, students were forced to be responsible for their own learning and self-study using online tools. In my case, I've taken two Coursera courses since leaving NUS \u2014 one on protecting business innovations via patents, and the other on programming IoT devices. I'm also interested in accounting and currently juggling my work at WRAEK with an online master's degree programme in accountancy.\" THE 5G ACADEMY: QUICK FACTS As of October 2021, more than 5,500 people had received training in 5G and related technologies More than 700 5G-related short courses and academic programmes are currently on offer by various institutions across Singapore IMDA plans to roll out 5G coverage nationwide by 2025 other powerful global forces, is making our work and social environment more volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous (VUCA), shortening the half-life of knowledge. Alumni who want to thrive in the future economy need to be adaptable and agile, and embrace interdisciplinary and lifelong learning.\" At NUS, the demand for \u2014 and provision of \u2014 digital and tech courses has increased over the last three years. Existing short and modular courses such as those in Robotic Process Automation and Software Development, as well as master's programmes in Business Analytics and Industry 4.0, now offer more places. New degree programmes and courses have been rolled out for topics like Biomedical Informatics, Maritime Technology and Management, Green FinTech, and Natural Language Processing. Outside of these efforts, NUS (through SCALE) is also co-managing the Singapore 5G & Telecoms Academy (5G Academy) with Singapore Polytechnic. Established under the auspices of the Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA) in November 2020, the 5G Academy aims to develop 5G-ready talent and encourage upskilling in preparation for the coming 5G wave. Take 36-year-old Ms Naweera Binte Sidik (Design and '10), an architect-turned-user experience (UX) designer. In March 2021, she went back to school to pursue the NUS SGUnited Skills Programme in International Financial Technology for non-Technical Executives , a nine-month programme offered by NUS and conducted online. \"Through the course, I picked up hard tech skills that allow me to communicate better with web and app developers, and design user flows that link to back-end processes more efciently. I'm also using what we learnt about Agile and Iterative Design in the work I do for clients,\" says Ms Naweera. \"On a personal note, the module on Algo-trading helped me understand the importance of investing and how to do it in a safe and balanced way.\" Even though the concept of lifelong learning had yet to take off when she was an undergraduate student, Ms Naweera is now rmly in that camp. \"NUS' efforts to encourage lifelong learning among its alumni community are motivating. I had a great time as a student, and it's good to know we can always go back to extend our learning and broaden our perspectives,\" she says. In that sense, technology can be considered grounding in 21 st-century competencies through foundational or common modules. Technology is obviously a key theme within this foundational layer, with modules centred on data literacy, digital literacy, AI and computational problem-solving, among others. \"In the coming decades, every industry will be continuously transformed by advances in technology which will allow work to be carried out in new ways,\" Prof Tan added in his radio interview. Reforming the curriculum along these lines will enable graduates to adapt to these changes and become what he termed \"drivers of industry transformation\". LEARNING NEVER ENDS So, back to the central question: What awaits the graduating Class of 2022 as they enter the workforce? There is a lot of uncertainty, but one thing's for sure \u2014 graduates must possess the skills to live and operate in a technology-led world. Becoming comfortable with technology is a key takeaway from their NUS education \u2014 whether that translates into online prociency to facilitate remote work and improve productivity, the ability to analyse and interpret data to support decisions and objectives, or a knack for synthesising tech-related and other knowledge to invent radical new ideas. However, no matter how much learning is packed into one's undergraduate years, it is impossible to impart everything that a person would need to know over the course of their lifetime. Professor Susanna Leong (Law '89), Vice Provost (Masters' Programmes & Lifelong Education) and Dean of the School of Continuing and Lifelong Education (SCALE), elaborates: \"Singapore's transformation into a Smart Nation will bring greater convenience and accessibility of modern services, but we will also face more complex societal challenges. The rapid advancement in digitalisation, in combination with Even the hostel experience is being reimagined as part of NUS' holistic, interdisciplinary approach to learning \u2014 starting this August, the University is expanding its student housing options. Apart from the six Halls of Residence (built on rich heritage and strong CCA involvement) and four Residential Colleges (with thematic academic programmes): LIVE IT UP! The rapid advancement in digitalisation, in combination with other powerful global forces, is making our work and social environment more volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous (VUCA), shortening the half-life of knowledge. Alumni who want to thrive in the future economy need to be adaptable and agile, and embrace interdisciplinary and lifelong learning. Professor Susanna Leong, Vice Provost (Masters' Programmes & Lifelong Education), Dean (School of Continuing and Lifelong Education), NUS both cause and effect. On the one hand, advancements in tech are precisely why so many workers need to upskill and reskill themselves. On the other hand, the rise of remote learning and short online courses makes it easier than ever to grab these lifelong learning opportunities. Within this space, digital natives who grew up in the information age and started using digital devices since childhood \u2014 including the Class of 2022 \u2014 hold a distinct advantage compared to mid-career or mature professionals. As Prof Bernard Tan tells The Alum NUS, \"Today's graduates will face disruption not once but several times throughout their careers. They will need to upskill themselves to avoid becoming unemployed or underemployed. Having been exposed to tech-enhanced education as students, especially in COVID times, they will be more accustomed to this mode of learning in the longer term and will therefore have less obstacles hindering them from engaging in lifelong learning.\" \"Regardless of which housing model students choose, each type provides an enriching residential experience that extends the platform for holistic education,\" says Associate Professor Ho Han Kiat (Science '00), NUS' Dean of Students. \"Specically, residential living widens students' appreciation of the community, helping them grow into responsible and constructive members of society, global citizens, and leaders of change for tomorrow.\" Two new Houses , Pioneer House and LightHouse, will open. With reduced CCA requirements and no meal plan, this concept instead emphasises peer mentoring, small-group engagement and collaborative leadership. The two existing Student Residences , which offer no-frills accommodation, will see the introduction of Masters and Residential Fellows. Students will thus benet from enhanced on-site pastoral care and wellness support. I had a great time as a student, and it's good to know we can always go back to extend our learning and broaden our perspectives.

THE ALUM NUS IF as they embrace remote or hybrid work models. This shift in how work is viewed and conducted also translates into new openings for start-up solutions - from no-code/low-code technologies that replace the need for specialised hires and collaboration platforms for decentralised workforces, to corporate wellness solutions that offer better support to employees. As one example, NOC alumni start-up MindFi pivoted during the pandemic from a consumer-facing mindfulness app to a mental wellbeing platform for the modern workplace, operating with the vision to promote positive minds and productive workplaces. 4THE NEED TO THINK GLOBALLY One of the harder lessons of the past two years is how a lack of global cooperation has prolonged the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly in the area of vaccine distribution and observed \"vaccine nationalism\". Last September, United Nations Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres noted, \"The pandemic is a clear test of international cooperation \u2014 a test we have essentially failed.\" And while cooperation at the level of international institutions and between governments is vital, the importance of collaboration and global ties holds true at a smaller level as well. For researchers and businesses tackling other global panorama Professor Freddy Boey is the Deputy President for Innovation & Enterprise at NUS. He oversees the University's initiatives and activities for innovation, as well as entrepreneurship and research translation. An academic and inventor, Prof Boey has pioneered the use of functional biomaterials for medical devices in Singapore, developed 127 patents, founded several companies, and been published in 347 top journals with 23,555 citations. An alumnus of NUS, Prof Boey previously served as the Deputy President and Provost of Nanyang Technological University (NTU) from 2011-2017.and increased investor activity. And as these companies mature, we also expect to see more acquisitions and public listings. Companies to keep an eye on? NOC alumni start-ups PatSnap, Carousell, Circles.Life and SWAT Mobility have all been reported to be considering an Initial Public Offering (IPO) in the future. 2 DIFFERENTIATION THROUGH DEEP TECH The fact that multiple COVID-19 vaccines have been developed to date is nothing short of astounding. Other innovations, including NUS-developed saliva tests, nasal swabs and protective devices, have an important part to play in meeting testing needs and minimising virus exposure. They also speak to the importance of investment in basic and applied research, as well as the transformative nature and outsized impact deep tech can have in addressing complex problems facing the world. From climate tech and cybersecurity, to biotech and blockchain, deep tech start-ups will continue to gain traction in 2022, in line with increased investor interest and government support. Typically based on years of scientic research and backed by patented technologies, these start-ups will also have a competitive edge due to their focus on high-impact issues and ability to create new markets. For its part, NUS is playing a key role in generating Singapore's deep tech deal flow. Our Graduate Research Innovation Programme (GRIP) has furthered more than 100 deep tech projects since 2018. Graduates of the programme have gone on to raise more than $17 million in external grants and funding. Continuing this momentum, this year we will be launching the Technology Access Programme (TAP), specically designed to help entrepreneurs and corporate innovators discover cutting-edge innovations and opportunities for their application. Backed by our experience in venture creation and technology commercialisation, the executive programme will guide participants on taking intellectual property from lab to market, while providing them with access to NUS technologies, resources and networks. 3A RE-BALANCING ACT AT WORK Headlines surrounding the Great Resignation ring true in countries around the world. For employees caught between balancing remote work, home-based learning and childcare, the pandemic has forced a reassessment of priorities and a redrawing of lines between work and home life. As a result, many job holders are opting to switch employers, become professional freelancers or entrepreneurs, or even defect from the working world entirely. Faced with increased competition to attract and retain talent, companies are called upon to provide greater flexibility, be more empathetic, and invest in a sustainable work culture. As a result, employers may increase retraining of existing staff, while broadening their search for new tech talents internationally 2021 WAS THE YEAR WE CAME TO THE REALISATION THAT COVID-19 WAS LIKELY TO BE ENDEMIC, 2022 has seen us continuing to make strides towards COVID-resilience and better adjust to this \"New Normal\". The prolonged pandemic has taught governments, organisations and individuals to function more like a start-up: to be adaptable, flexible and resilient in the face of uncertainty and constant change. For start-ups and entrepreneurs, themselves, the \"New Normal\" offers new opportunities. Here are just a few trends to be aware of: 1 EXPECT MORE UNICORNS Despite fears for the economy, the growth of many start-ups has actually been fuelled by the pandemic and the attendant increase in digitalisation across numerous industries. 2021 was particularly signicant for NUS Enterprise: two decades after our founding, nine start-ups from our BLOCK71 community, including NUS Overseas Colleges (NOC) alumni companies PatSnap and Carousell, became unicorns when their valuations topped US$1 billion, a reflection not only of Southeast Asia's growth as a start-up hub, but NUS' centrality in this ecosystem. We also observed several of our successful entrepreneurs hire our students, form new start-ups, and/or invest in others, helping contribute to a virtuous cycle of talent and capital growth. As we move into 2022, we can expect more unicorns to emerge from the region, aided by the rising middle class, a young population open to new technology adoption, Tech rm PatSnap is also reportedly considering a public listing.

It is our aspiration that these initiatives deepen NUS' and Singapore's connectivity to the world, while helping to produce start-ups and entrepreneurs that think globally. challenges, such as climate change or food security, a willingness to work with others \u2014 even competitors \u2014 can be key in paving the way for fundamental change. This is particularly true in an interconnected world where complex issues transcend borders. NUS' orientation has always been global in nature, and one of the rationales for our NOC and BLOCK71 programmes is the opportunity they provide for our students and start-ups to gain exposure to and forge connections in overseas markets. In addition to considering new locations for these programmes, the NUS Guangzhou Research Translation and Innovation Institute (NUSGRTII) will open this year to promote technological innovation and talent development between Singapore and China. It is our aspiration that these initiatives deepen NUS' and Singapore's connectivity to the world, while helping to produce start-ups and entrepreneurs that think globally. NEW RULES FOR THE NEW NORMAL NUS Deputy Pres ident for Innovat ion & Enterpr ise Professor Freddy Boey (Engineering '87) looks at key trends in the start-up scene in the post-COVID-19 era.

This is worrying, as the users of platforms such as TikTok tend to be very young and impressionable. MR BENEDICT LOO You don't have to be a savvy investor in cryptocurrency and metaverse real estate to be a digital citizen. You are one, as long as you use digital tools and interact with others online \u2014 a fact that is true of some 5 billion people, or 63% of the global population. What are the perks and dangers of this new world, how do we navigate it safely, and what are our roles and responsibilities? AS A META OF FACT JUL\u2014SEP 2022 JOHANN ANNUAR (ENGINEERING '02), FOUNDER OF A TECH SOCIAL ENTERPRISE MS LIM SWEE KIM (COMPUTING '88), FINANCE AND ADMINISTRATION FOR A SPORTS FEDERATION; CHAIRPERSON OF RAFFLES HALL ASSOCIATION MS POLLY LIM PEI CHING (SYSTEMS SCIENCES '11), TECH COMPANY MANAGER; FOUNDER OF A TECH SOCIAL ENTERPRISE MR BENEDICT LOO YEAR 2 UNDERGRADUATE, COLLEGE OF HUMANITIES AND SCIENCES he COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated digital transformation in almost all aspects of our lives. While it has brought many conveniences, it has also resulted in many dangers \u2014 from online scams to falling prey to fake news. What do you think are the biggest pitfalls? SWEE KIM: I have been working in technology since the 1980s. Even in the early days, we encountered people who would abuse it for dishonest deeds \u2014 such as using expensive ofce equipment and facilities to access unsavoury content online. This is even more widespread in the present, given that the Internet is such a big part of our lives. This was especially evident during Tworth of items that I traded on a gaming platform. That happened was when I was in my teens. Two or three of my friends also fell victim to phishing scams. Thankfully, I don't see people of my age falling prey to such scams anymore. But back then, as children who enjoyed playing games online, we were taught the skills to use various digital tools by either our parents or schools \u2014 but not about Internet hygiene and how to use it safely. POLLY: Since 2015, I have been running a social enterprise that teaches seniors how to use smartphones \u2014 and I do nd that they have become a lot savvier. In our initial classes, maybe only two out of 20 attendees would be using WhatsApp; now, every participant uses WhatsApp and Facebook. However, it isn't just the users who have become savvier \u2014 the crooks have also upped their game and always seem a step ahead, be it in proliferating fake news or luring people with scams. Beyond teaching (seniors) how to use the technology, we also need to educate them to not be too trusting when interacting with others online, especially when they are buying things. BENEDICT: I recently helped to draft a response to The Straits Times with regards to the spread of misinformation on TikTok. There is a lot of concern about political powers weaponising social media, and I do see political propaganda being fed to me through these platforms. This is worrying, as the users of platforms such as TikTok tend to be very young and impressionable. JOHANN: I have been running a social enterprise that provides laptops to underprivileged school-going kids. While we have done a lot of work in this area \u2014 and garnered a lot of support to give vulnerable families the infrastructure and equipment to access the Internet \u2014 there is still much to be done. One of our top priorities is to talk to these children about the risks of the Internet. As a nation, we can consider ourselves 'lucky' to have this problem, because it suggests that most people here possess some level of understanding of the online space. This is not universally true for people in other countries. The fact remains that a lot of people still don't understand what computer literacy, or even phone literacy, is. There are whole communities out there with no access to the digital world, and the problem they face is a very different one: that of a digital divide. To me, it would be a bigger problem if we allow the divide between the 'Haves' and the 'Have-Nots' to widen. Digitalisation has become such an important part of society \u2014 from how we perform daily tasks to the kind of jobs available \u2014 that it is neither reasonable nor responsible for us as members of society to allow anybody to fall through the cracks and be cut off from it. So building a better digital world is not just about how we conduct ourselves online, but offline as well? BENEDICT: I nd it appalling that individuals are pouring billions into the metaverse when there are people starving in real life. It shows how we, as a society, have become desensitised. As technology develops, it is our responsibility to dene who we are as people and members of a community. SWEE KIM: As members of society, we should recognise our privilege \u2014 from being able to leverage digital transformation to our personal advantage, to being able to have a university education. Our position of privilege makes it our responsibility to make the world a better place. Don't just be a spectator - get involved! While the percentage of Singaporeans who need help with access to the Internet today is probably less than 5%, there is still the issue of guidance, especially for children. There are parents who are unable to spend time navigating the digital world with their children, and one way to address this issue is through community support. For example, we are now redening our libraries as community spaces for people to socialise and bring up the young, and these vulnerable children might be able to get guidance when they THE GOOD, THE BAD AND THE UGLYLIVING IN A DIGITAL WORLD: Does it always pay to be plugged- in, logged-on and v irtual-ready, or is our ongo ing tryst w ith technology a double-edged sword? Wh ich aspects of d igital adopt ion work well and wh ich need to be relooked? Our contr ibutors we igh in. the height of the pandemic last year, when many were stuck at home and turned to the computer and other digital devices for work, entertainment and socialising. This access to a vast amount of information and a wider spectrum of people increases the individual's exposure in many ways. And given that evil is always lurking around \u2014 both in real life and in the virtual space \u2014 it is necessary for people to be able to identify those with nefarious intentions. BENEDICT: The proliferation of technology and the Internet has grown at an exponential rate. This also means that the exposure to risk of users adopting these different tools and platforms has increased. It's not about how comfortable and tech-savvy you are. Although my generation grew up with tech, I too fell prey to a phishing scam and lost about US$500 Scam victims in Singapore lost a total of $633.3 MILLION in 2021 Source: The Straits Times 30 .

JUL\u2014SEP 2022 . 31access the Internet through these public facilities. There is also the matter of balance: every individual needs to have several communities supporting and informing him or her. These can span from family members and relatives to colleagues and schoolmates, and extend to friends from interest groups. BENEDICT: This is a very good point, especially since one big concern about the content one gets through various digital platforms is the strength of the algorithm. Everybody has their own conrmation biases, and you end up seeing more of what you want to see. That can be very dangerous, especially if one is at the receiving end of fake news. Finding communities within the digital world to have meaningful conversations with and hear other viewpoints is very important. We also need to assess how much of our interpersonal relationships are built online, versus in real life. Anecdotally, I hear about young parents who are concerned about their children's social development and behaviour because they spend so much time online rather than interacting with their peers in real life. POLLY: That balance is a challenge not just for young users. While some remain sceptical and hesitant to go online, certain seniors are completely glued to their handphones. While being able to stay connected with friends and family online has been a big advantage \u2014 especially at the height of the pandemic when many restrictions on gatherings were in place \u2014 being active online could also lead to physical inactivity. We've noticed many seniors who have lost some degree of mobility over the course of the last two years. My 83-year-old mum stayed home for much of that time for fear of contracting COVID-19. While she has become adept at interacting with friends and family online, we now encourage her to go out for fresh air or meet friends through special interest groups. Is balance possible to achieve, given that technology is now part and parcel of almost every aspect of our daily lives? Do you go on a digital detox? SWEE KIM: I make sure my digital devices are three metres away from me when I go to bed. I don't want signals frying my brain! JOHANN: Digital detoxing to me is about taking a break away from your device rather than not allowing your brain to be fried. But it can be challenging: these days, you can leave your house without your wallet, but not without your phone! BENEDICT: A lot of people my age clock double digits of screen hours every day, and they nd it difcult to be away from their phone or devices. Technology is there from the moment we wake up; we use it for work, and when we rest, we watch a show on Netflix or scroll through social media. I conscientiously go offline for an hour before sleep each day, just to detach myself from the onslaught of information from online sources, and to allow time for reflection and introspection. Studies have shown that this promotes better sleep too. However, to live life completely offline would be impossible!SWEE KIM: While so much of our lives are conducted online, there is the possibility that we could be stripped of technology one day, in times of unrest and strife. So we still need the ability to be able to do things without being totally dependent on technology. JOHANN: There is a stigma about how tech threatens to take over our lives and how we need to guard against it. But technology is nothing but a tool \u2014 one that's no different from pens and pencils, or even clothes that protect our modesty and say who we are! When we started Engineering Good in 2014, it was to leverage technology to provide those with disabilities with a more inclusive life, such as through speech-to-text applications, or something as simple as Google Maps to nd their way around. It is up to us to decide how to use these tools \u2014 and I think all of us should spend some time disconnected from technology to ponder that question. It's not just our phones, but also step-trackers, TraceTogether tokens, smartwatches... devices that store and share a lot of information about who you are, what you do, which KTV you like the best ( Laughs )... More people should have full awareness of what each piece of gadgetry does before running out to get it! What to you are the biggest benefits of widespread digital transformation? POLLY: Convenience \u2014 from buying groceries online to working from home, even for those in high-security industries such as banking. While so much of our lives are conducted online, there is the possibility that we could be stripped of technology one day, in times of unrest and strife. So we still need the ability to be able to do things without being totally dependent on technology. MS LIM SWEE KIM [Technology] can certainly bring the world closer, but if we over-indulge in it, it could tear us apart. It goes back, once again, to the point about balance \u2014 so that our digital life does not take over everything. MS POLLY LIM PEI CHING BENEDICT: Access to information. I can now go onto an online learning platform like Coursera and explore a topic totally unrelated to my studies. It has fundamentally given us access to whatever information we want at whichever point in time. Technology can also transcend physical boundaries: for example, I continued to conduct tuition classes for my students during the circuit-breaker, thanks to video conferencing technology.SWEE KIM: I also work with the Global Esports Federation and we have meetings with people from America, Australia, the Middle East and Europe. Despite the time difference and physical distance between us, we are able to meet and align goals. In that respect, technology has brought about invaluable benets. Technology has also created many new career opportunities for a younger generation. JOHANN: The Web allows us all to participate as global citizens, to care about the things that are happening around the world rather than just minding our own backyard. And communications technology also allows you to be part of a lot of conversations while fullling other responsibilities. To illustrate: I'm doing this forum discussion in my car, while driving to pick up my daughter from fencing, collecting a cake for a birthday celebration, and now sending my wife somewhere else! There are many things in life that you want to be present for, and technology allows us to do more with our time and with our lives. POLLY: It can certainly bring the world closer, but if we over-indulge in it, it could tear us apart. It goes back, once again, to the point about balance \u2014 so that our digital life does not take over everything.

As a result, I have gained so much freedom.\" In the next ve to ten years, Ms Ong hopes to learn more about herself \u2014 \"the good, the bad and the ugly\" \u2014 and continue giving more of herself to society. She hopes Hush TeaBar, WorkWell Leaders and A Good Space will expand in quality and quantity as communities, to achieve far-reaching, positive impact. Having just completed an upcoming book project about NMPs, she can see herself writing more books \"to make better use of the ideas that keep getting downloaded into my head\". She also aspires to move to the regional and global stage for the work on mental health because \"it's time to share how mental health is in the national consciousness in Singapore, and also increase awareness of mental health issues in other parts of the world\". Also on the horizon: lobbying for a permanent Mental Health and Sustainable Development Ofce under the Prime Minister's Ofce, which she shared in a recent Rice Media article following the announcement of Budget 2022. \"In view of the intersectionality and social determinants of mental health, this is the only way to truly address this existential threat as a whole-of-government and society priority,\" she emphasises. More people can embrace the meaningful pursuit of community work, she adds, by starting simply. Ms Ong suggests picking an activity you can consistently carry out, so that the benets to you and those you support are sustainable. \"The only way to know your sense of place in this world is to know you have been useful and have made a difference to someone's life, no matter how small that difference might be,\" she ruminates. \"I think the purpose of the rst half of my life was to learn about my gifts and strengths through an illustrious professional career and quality relationships, w hile that of the second half is to give these gifts away.\" Her goal, as such, is to make the world \u2014 especially Singapore \u2014 a better place by the time she leaves it. \"We are here on earth to do two things: achieve self-realisation, and serve humanity,\" she explains. \"I possess this deep strength because I emerged better as a human after my soul-breaking experiences. These gave me wisdom to tell the difference when I need to have courage, to change what I can and must change, and the grace to accept what cannot be changed.\" TEXT BY TINA WANG WHO SHE IS Ms Ong adds that her time at NUS has played a role in shaping her to be the person she is today. She elaborates: \"It was most instrumental in preparing me for the world. My dad lost his construction business as a casualty of the 'Black Monday' stock market crash of 1987. Throughout my schooling years, I gave tuition to lighten his burden. He took on odd jobs to make ends meet, including sewing factory gloves and tting the plastic strings on plastic coffee bags \u2014 teaching me that no job is beneath us,\" she says. \"I think my time at NUS also shaped my relationship with work \u2014 I always show up completely and have loads of fun with it too. I can fully relate to Kahlil Gibran's Work is Love Made Visible . I've always been like that \u2014 whether in the corporate sector and/or community work.\" WRITING A NEW CHAPTER For Ms Ong, a typical week involves hosting and facilitating the Circle of Bliss community meditation group every Monday evening at her three-room HDB flat, (almost) daily yoga and meditation practice, beach runs and long walks, and Sundays with her parents - whom she credits as her rst teachers about the power of giving. \"Looking back, it amazes me how wise my parents were, and how this wisdom included compassion. They showed me from a young age that the way they are is the way they treat others.\" This, in her view, was true role-modelling. \"Mum would look after the neighbours' kids, cook and distribute food to them, and sew clothes as gifts. Dad would look EPRESSION, BULLYING, AN ACRIMONIOUS DIVORCE - Ms Anthea Ong has weathered all these storms. But the former corporate high-flier-turned-social entrepreneur has not only risen a bove these setbacks, she has also been empowered by them. Ms Ong is no stranger to adversity. An otherwise happy childhood spent climbing trees and catching grasshoppers with her brother and cousins was marred by an eye defect that caused her to squint. She developed a deep insecurity after the condition led her to be called sampat (\"slow\" in Hokkien dialect). The subject of much taunting and teasing from other kids, she was not as ked out on many dates as a teenager. However, she aced her studies, read Business at the National University of Singapore, and later excelled in the fast-paced world of corporate banking and e-learning. She went on to chart several career highs as a leader with multinational organisations including the New York Institute of Finance and Pearson/Financial Times Group, before things went downhill from 2006. Ms Ong dealt with a series of events: a venture that fell apart, marriage troubles, an educational consultancy business that became collateral damage in a bitter divorce, and a series of legal suits led by her ex-husband. As she hit rock-bottom, she realised the only way was up. Pure grit, along with the healing benets of ashtanga yoga and meditation, turned her life around. \"My colossal collapse made me realise that even at my most broken, I still had so much,\" she recalls. \"Offering myself to vulnerable communities, where I could be useful, also helped me feel less broken.\" PICKING UP THE PIECES Newly inspired, Ms Ong embarked on a journey to rediscover herself, volunteering actively at organisations such as Very Special Arts, Women's Initiative for Ageing Successfully (WINGS) and Unifem (now UN Women).

Her acts of volunteerism have empowered others and her learnings are expressions of gratitude for having been lifted by others when she needed help at her most vulnerable. She also conceived several community-driven initiatives, such as Hush TeaBar, WorkWell Leaders, SG Mental Health Matters and A Good Space, to nurture the next generation of civic leaders. These endeavours, she adds, leveraged her C-suite and entrepreneurial experience, earmarking and approaching young leaders passionate for the cause to be part of the leadership. She ensured the right systems and structures were put in place, so she would not play an executive role. Her book, 50 Shades of Love: Unearthing Who We Are , was written as an ode to \"ve decades of an ordinary life made extraordinary by people, pain and passion\". It shifted 2,000 copies without any promotional or marketing efforts \u2014 not bad for what she calls \"an audacious creative project that was part memoir, part self-help, and partly about trees and the environment\". Its net proceeds have since supported several projects for children in Singapore, and Rohingya r efugees in Malaysia and Bangladesh. It also spun off a weekly podcast on Spotify featuring guests such as playwright Mr Alan Sa'at and Executive Director of the Association of Women for Action and Research (AWARE) Ms C orinna Lim (Law '87).

Billed as Singapore's rst online-to-offline surplus grocery outlet, it showcases a range of treatsure's existing surplus groceries, which us ers continue to purchase. \"The store is one way we can expose our community to other aspe cts of sustainability,\" explains Mr Wong. \"So we showcase eco-friendly alternatives to everyday products like furniture, getting people to rethink the extent of sustainability.\" An example he cites is a bowl that has been upcycled from coconut. \"Even though it's not a food product, we still stock it and share it with our community,\" he says. \"It's all about advocating for sustainability in everything that we do.\" That principle has led to treatsure's research and development efforts. \"When we started, converting food waste into more useful products like fertiliser and fuel were the standard. But tech had not really caught on in the food waste story \u2014 we were part of the digital wave and we want to be frontrunners of the next wave \u2014 the data wave.\" He hopes to ride on this to study food waste and consumption patterns to nip the perennial problem in the bud. Given his success in just ve years, we expect Mr Wong to be at the front and centre of these efforts. INGAPOREANS CANNOT TURN DOWN A GOOD DEAL \u2014 AND FOR THE FOODIES AMONG US, NOTHING BEATS A CHANCE TO SCORE FOOD FROM A HOTEL BUFFET FOR LESS. That's precisely what the 30,000 users of treatsure enjoy every day. The app, developed by Mr Preston Wong together with Mr Kenneth Ham (Computing '17), allows users to take food home from hotel buffet restaurants up to an hour before closing time \u2014 food that would otherwise go straight to the waste bins. treatsure lls a growing need to tackle food waste in Singapore, which, according to Mr Wong, is on the rise again after a noted decline in 2020 (over 2019) because of COVID-19-related restrictions.

I think a social enterprise is a wonderful thing: it allows you to give back to society while creating value at the same time.The total amount of food waste generated in 2021 was 817 ,000 tonnes , 23% more than the 665,000 tonnes generated in 2020. Source: National Environment Agency RECIPE FOR SUCCESS The spark for treatsure was ignited at home in 2016, when Mr Wong noticed older family members regularly clearing out the fridge. \"Granted, the food they were throwing was usually expired but it got me thinking whether there could have been a way to salvage these items by redistributing them within the community,\" recalls the 33-year-old. Mr Wong was able to test this idea during 1-on-1 conversations with alumni from the F&B industry with the help of the NUS Business School Global Alumni Network Ofce (GANO), where he learnt that the problem did not just plague households, but the entire F&B industry. \"At these engagements, major F&B players accepted there was an issue of Mr Wong (right) with treatsure co-founder Mr Kenneth Ham.food waste, but because the solutions were quite limited at the time, they seemed rather apathetic.\" He recalls one of them using the memorable phrase \"a tall order\" to describe any potential x. These conversations stoked Mr Wong's passion to nd a solution to the problem, which he realised was a perennial one. Where did this passion for problem-solving come from? He points to the afternoons and evenings spent at NUS Enterprise, the entrepreneurial arm of the University, where he attended workshops, pitches and reside chats with founders and investors on entrepreneurship and problem-solving. Here, he would listen to other entrepreneurs who had come before him, some of them seniors from his time in school. \"Start-ups like ShopBack and Carousell had just taken off and their success was a real inspiration for juniors like us.\" But all the while, Mr Wong was determined to start an enterprise for a social good. Pressed to explain this conviction, he says, \"I think a social enterprise is a wonderful thing: it allows you to give back to society while creating value at the same time.\" Guided by this ethos, he decided to focus his efforts on food sustainability, an area which had just begun to capture the public's attention at that point. \"There was a gap in the market for a business that was founded on sustainability... and as they teach all entrepreneurs, where there is a gap, you try to ll it.\" But he knew it wasn't a gap he could ll alone. \"So I spoke to Kenneth, who was the closest Computer Science person that I knew. I roped him in and started picking his brains about how we could tap on tech to cut food waste,\" he says. \"I really knew very little about tech at that point, so his experience and inputs were invaluable. Together, we were still in school when we created a minimum viable product (MVP).\" FROM MVP TO THE MASSES That early iteration of treatsure caught the attention of investors and the industry. The app, which uses e-commerce technology to match buyers and sellers, has attracted more than 50 partners including hotels, restaurants and grocery stores to its network.

Checkpoint Theatre's Joint Artistic Director Mr Huzir Sulaiman has also been a driving force since they met in 2016, when he taught an interdisciplinary performance class during Mr Tay's freshman year. Mr Huzir, whom he now counts as a colleague and friend, encouraged him to take on the challenge of putting on the assistant director's hat for Checkpoint Theatre's production of Lucas Ho's FRAGO . Soon after, Mr Tay auditioned to perform in Checkpoint's production of Eat Duck and was subsequently invited to be a full-time executive. Currently based in the United States, where he is completing his Master's in Fine Arts in Writing at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago (SAIC), Mr Tay says his Yale-NUS College days have helped shape his artistic journey. \"I can't overstate how essential [the school] was to my development as an artist and as a person. The facilities and resources allowed me to experiment with my artistic practice as a writer and director, which, in the early years, led to a lot of failures,\" he says. \"These helped me learn how to improve on past mistakes \u2014 and importantly, understand that art is more than just its end product. It's about the process, the people you meet and the connections that deepen.\" He adds that the Yale-NUS College community was pivotal in helping him connect with not just splendid and talented artists but generous and kind people. It was there, he says, that he experienced a robust creative writing programme that both encouraged PROVOCATIVE, TRAILBLAZING ROMP ABOUT HOMOSEXUAL CULTURE IN SINGAPORE, AND A BOLLYWOOD-ESQUE COMING-OF-AGE TALE OF A YOUNG BOY GROWING UP IN INDIA. These productions proved to be metaphorical forks in the road for Mr Myle Yan Tay, showing him that an involvement in the arts was on the cards. The rst, W!LD RICE's 2013 production of Alan Sa'at's Dreamplay: Asian Boys Vol. 1 , was, in his words, \"eye-opening\". \"[It] made me realise how diverse Singapore's artistic landscape could be, and how its theatre scene was not bound by the same rules as those of Singaporean society.\" The second, Checkpoint Theatre's 2015 production of Shiv Tandan's The Good, the Bad and the Sholay , helped him understand the work he wanted to make. \"Art that is funny, poignant, energetic and culturally specic.\" These formative experiences have placed the 28-year-old actor, writer, director and Associate Artist at local theatre company, Checkpoint Theatre, rmly on track as one of Singapore's rising creatives. OPENING DOORS In search of a broad liberal arts education and an understanding of the world before pinning down a career path, Mr Tay had enrolled at Yale-NUS College to major in Global Affairs. By the time he graduated in 2019, he had already begun telling original stories and building an impressive body of work. He wrote and directed Overtime: An Original Musical , about a man who works at the Ministry of Competency, and I don't think it's about reconstructing the arts to make people view it as essential. It's about making it such that Singapor eans see art as enjoyable. Storyteller, stage actor and scr ibe - Mr Myle Yan Tay (Yale-NUS '19) is the local arts scene's pract itioner to watch.On the Write Trackhim to keep writing and to constantly seek improvement. His lecturers, Professor Robin Hemley and Ms Pramodini Parayitam, also led him to consider writing as a possible career path. But it wasn't just the creative classes he took that made the biggest impact. \"I've always been interested in political science, but Yale-NUS College helped me realise that I could merge my intellectual curiosity with my artistic passions,\" he says. \"Most of my work remains about politics in some way.\" He is thankful for those opportunities, which he doubts he would have had elsewhere. \"More than anything, I learnt at Yale-NUS College that if trying and failing is the worst thing that can happen, then it's worth a shot anyway,\" he adds. \"I know for a fact I wouldn't have pursued this path without Yale-NUS College, and I wish that other young people could have that same experience.\" AN EYE ON THE FUTURE One of the biggest challenges he sees facing Singapore artists today is how Singaporean society views the arts. \"I don't think it's about reconstructing the arts to make people view it as essential. It's about making it such that Singaporeans see art as enjoyable,\" he explains. \"That's what I've been thinking about \u2014 how to make work that is challenging but also rewarding to experience.\" He cites time management as another challenge: \"So many Singaporean artists have to work in two industries at once to maintain their creative practice. And when that happens, it becomes harder and harder to prioritise their artistic drive.\" He does not think Singaporean artists can change the country's nancial landscape and make it possible to live off an artist's wage. Yet they can be \"aware of which segments of the population have more difculty with accessing the arts and make sure the gates stay open for all\". While deepening his skills and \"learning how to write for new audiences and in new mediums\" at SAIC, Mr Tay is collaborating with writer-activist Mr Kristian-Marc James Paul (Yale-NUS '19) and former journalist Ms Mysara Aljaru on an upcoming anthology with Ethos Books about minority race experiences in Singapore. He is also developing multiple works for Checkpoint Theatre, including a graphic novel and an upcoming play that looks at the experience of minority males in Singapore, which Checkpoint hopes to stage in 2023. Mr Tay remains unsure of his plans after he completes his master's degree. The pandemic has made him reconsider what long-term planning should look like because he knows how easily the world can change and how important it is to be flexible. \"Regardless of where I am, I hope to be writing and teaching in the media and genres of plays, prose, comic books, science ction, horror, thriller and political drama,\" he shares. \"I can't imagine doing anything else.\" 36 . THE ALUM NUShis best friend, Alex, a playwright who can't write plays; and also wrote and directed Master Race , a full-length play that imagines a future Singapore where people can undergo a scientic procedure to change their race. He also wrote several short plays - Growing Up Green , Post-Human and The Bank Job - which were performed at Yale-NUS College. To date, Mr Tay's creative mind has also birthed reviews on online arts, culture and politics journal F Newsmagazine ; and comic books Putu Piring and Through the Longkang , both published by Checkpoint Theatre. The former is about a man who returns to his childhood haunt with his favourite snack; the latter is a three-part horror adventure series about a teenager who unwittingly nds himself in an otherworld after climbing into a drain to retrieve his football. Both publications, created in collaboration with illustrator Shuxian Lee, have been well-received. Notably, Putu Piring 's rst print run of 250 copies sold out quickly, leading to a second run of 500. His reviews are also hosted on his own site, myleyantay.com.

ITH CLEAN WATER AVAILABLE TO US AT JUST A TURN OF THE TAP, it might not be apparent to most Singaporeans that a water crisis looms over the globe. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), half of the planet's population will live in areas with permanent water scarcity by 2025. With 72% of Earth's nite fresh water supplies being used for agriculture, nding ways to improve the efciency of water usage is critical to solving this issue of scarcity. This is especially so, considering how a substantial amount of irrigated water for agricultural use is lost through evaporation, leaching or percolation into soil layers too deep for plants to absorb. While irrigation technologies, such as sprinklers and drip systems, have been developed to optimise how water is dispensed, an NUS team has approached the issue from a different angle \u2014 and it is tackling the problem from the ground up, literally. GELLING WITH THE ZERO-WASTE NARRATIVE Enter InnoGro \u2014 a patented super-absorbent hydrogel derived from soy, developed by Dr Tan Wee Kee and Dr Zhu Jingling from the NUS Environmental Research Institute (NERI). With the ability to swell to over 150 times its size, InnoGro can absorb water hundreds of times its dry weight. This allows it to act almost like mini-reservoirs, keeping moisture within the soil, and within reach of plants for longer periods of time. Adding InnoGro to soil as a supplement has been found to reduce water wastage by up to 75%. The positive environmental impact it makes goes beyond water usage. With better water retention in the plant's growing medium, watering frequencies can be cut down by 70%, translating to much more energy-efcient farming practices. By holding water, InnoGro also helps to retain nutrients. Studies have shown that up to 90% of phosphorus, 70% of potassium and 70% of nitrogen from fertilisers are lost to the environment, which can translate to environmental pollution. By just adding a 5% hydrogel supplement to the growing frontiers SOY-ING \"YES\" TO SUSTAINABILITY W JUL\u2014SEP 2022 . 39Dr Tan Wee Kee is currently a Senior Research Fellow with the NUS Environmental Research Institute (NERI) and the co-founder/CEO of NuSoil - a deep-tech start-up supported by the NUS Graduate Research Innovation Programme (GRIP), and incorporated in 2019. Dr Tan previously worked on aquaporins (membrane channels in organisms) for water treatment. More recently, she has turned her attention to the use of soy waste for agriculture.TEXT BY KOH YUEN LIN . MAIN PHOTO BY KELVIN CHIA Dr Tan Wee Kee (Sc ience '99) from the NUS Env ironmental Research Inst shares the deta ils beh ind a patented innovat ion that can change how \u2014 and where \u2014 plants can be grown. An Idea that Holds Waterin considerable quantities given the amount of soy food items that are produced \u2014 is generally considered food waste; and some 10,000 tonnes of of it are produced in Singapore each year. \" Okara has been a pain for the food manufacturing industry,\" shares Dr Tan. \"But once it undergoes a conversion step into a hydrogel, its water-capturing properties will be impressive. Recognising this, Professor Ong Choon Nam (Science '72), the former Director of NERI, started discussions with Professor Li Jun (Afliate Alumnus '19), from the Department of Biomedical Engineering, who was working on hydrogels for biomedical elds.\" This was in 2016. By 2019, the team had developed a patented synthesis technology with 100% conversion of the whole waste into hydrogel \u2014 with zero residue. This process involves purging a homogenised aqueous suspension of okara by nitrogen gas, and heating it at a sustained temperature and constant pressure while initiating a radical polymerisation reaction. The resultant product is then dried and milled into powder. Patents for this technology to produce InnoGro have also been led at the national level, and countries led include Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, China, Japan and the United States. POWERING PLANT GROWTH Apart from its unique proposition as a sustainable waste-to-resource product, InnoGro also stands out as the only hydrogel soil supplement with studies that back up its effect on the growth of leafy vegetables from seedling to harvest stage. \"My role has been in demonstrating and dening how this okara -derived hydrogel can enhance the growth of plants, and be applied in various agricultural set-ups,\" says Dr Tan. The difference is especially marked for plants growing in water-scarce environments: the addition of InnoGro has been shown to result in a 113% increase in shoot weight at harvest, 57% i ncrease in total leaf area, and 50% increase in relative growth rate in water-limited conditions. With water decit as the factor leading to more than 40% of crop losses Below: Dr Tan (right) and co-founder Dr Zhu Jingling (left) at the NuSoil booth at Suzhou Innovfest 2019, showcasing the InnoGro product, in a photo with event VIP Prof Ng How Yong (centre). 38 . THE ALUM NUS 38 . THE ALUM NUS substrate, leaching can be cut down by about 30%. Yet InnoGro is a game-changer in even more ways. \"Hydrogels are not new,\" highlights Dr Tan. \"However, while most are petroleum-based, ours is developed from plant waste, making it a bio-based and sustainable product.\" While there are other hydrogels derived from other 'virgin materials', such as cellulose, InnoGro is one of the few products on the market to boast waste-to-resource credentials. The humble base ingredient of InnoGro is okara , the Japanese term for soy pulp: the insoluble parts of a soybean that are left behind in the production of soy milk and beancurd. While one might nd them incorporated into some traditional Japanese dishes, okara \u2014 which is generated reported worldwide, InnoGro stands to be the agricultural industry's ally in combating the food security threat that droughts bring. At present, Dr Tan's team is taking InnoGro out to the world. \"We were awarded a grant from Enterprise Singapore to do more eld trials to obtain Proof of Concept. And apart from gathering data, the next stage is to send more samples for people around the world to try InnoGro. Recently, we sent samples to the Middle East,\" she shares, adding that the product can be used in the agriculture and horticulture sectors, as well as in landscaping. \"For example, we've explored the possibilities of using InnoGro for maintaining landscaping displays, especially in situations where it is not possible to integrate an irrigation system. We are still looking for the sweet spot in the market for the hydrogel.\" In anticipation of demand, the NuSoil team is also utilising a reactor to shorten the synthesis process from 24 hours to just ve hours, and upscaling the output from 200g in two weeks in a lab setting to ten kilograms per week. While the market potential of this product could be enormous, Dr Tan is focused not just on InnoGro, but other innovations and their benets to mankind. \"I am ultimately a plant lover, always. I am always looking at ways to improve yields and how to grow food production under conditions of limited natural resources,\" she enthuses, adding that she is also exploring on innovations that could benet people living in places where food crops could not be grown previously. \"And if you think about hydrogels as an alternative medium for plants to grow in, perhaps one day we might be able to bring this technology to outer space \u2014 and our astronauts might even be able to harvest food. It would probably be a very costly exercise, but one can always dream!\" A FASCINATION WITH FLORA Dr Tan's journey into scientic research started with a love for plants. She remembers her formative childhood years in a kampung , taking walks and counting the blooms on the morning glory vines planted by her father. Entering NUS to study Botany, she had planned to join the workforce upon graduation to supplement her family's income and support her younger sister's education. However, fascinated by the research on in-vitro flowering of orchids in the Department of Biological Sciences, she chanced upon an opportunity and started her journey on plant research. \"It draws back to my childhood love for flowers, \" she professes. Dr Tan went on to participate in other research projects, including urban farming, which led her to develop InnoGro as a solution for the agricultural and horticultural sectors. special feature 40 .

Tell us about your eld of work. As Singapore's largest defence research and development organisation, DSO has been developing game-changing technological solutions to sharpen the cutting edge of Singapore's national security for the last ve decades. These would not be possible without our people. My role at the DSO College is to ensure that our staff receive all the training and development needs to succeed in their current roles and prepare for their future career aspirations. How does DSO help its people to upskill? People are DSO's greatest asset. To develop them to their fullest potential, we set up a college right within the organisation to offer them curated in-house courses that are relevant to their work. Beyond DSO, staff are also encouraged further their education with a second Master's or even embark on PhD programmes with sponsorships readily available to support their career aspirations. We also tap on NUS courses to learn about emerging topics and encourage learning anywhere and at any time, by subscribing to LEARN.gov.sg, a one-stop digital learning platform for public servants, which includes courses from the Civil Service College, Udemy and Harvard. From other knowledge-sharing and mentoring initiatives to comprehensive HR policies to encourage self-learning, DSO is on the path towards the vision of Nurturing a Learning Organisation. What steps do you take to broaden your professional qualications? My educational background is in mechanical engineering and my previous role was mostly technical in nature. To better equip me for my job at DSO College, DSO supported my reskilling with an Advanced Certicate in Training and Assessment (ACTA), a train-the-trainer programme that gave me the competencies to function as a facilitator and a solutionist who can support the learning and development needs of the organisation. The training enables me to contextualise what I learn with my prior technical experiences so I can MS CHELVIN LOH Director, SkillsFuture Singapore Ms Loh tells us how she endeavours to create a lasting impact on the future of work and skills by making Singapore a skills-competitive economy. Why is it important for university graduates to reskill? The work environment, the nature of jobs and technology are constantly and rapidly changing. Therefore, it is important for graduates to layer on skills that their job function may require. This is especially so for mid-career professionals whose last formal education was some time ago. Fresh graduates may not have to reskill, but they should pick up behavioural and soft skills related to learning agility, teamwork and inclusivity. What is the government doing to encourage graduates to upskill? The SkillsFuture series is a curated list of short training programmes focusing on emerging skills in eight job sectors. Its aim is to encourage citizens to take ownership of their own skills development journey.

He frequently shares his insights on topics like the future of work and employee engagement at executive conferences and webinars. What changes have you seen in the workplace in the last ve to 10 years? The workplace is becoming more digitalised, so employees need to be digitally-savvy too. Furthermore, employers now go beyond paper qualications to look at skills, especially digital skills, and many are spending a lot of resources to develop and prepare employees for their company's digital transformation. Employees are focusing more on wellness and flexibility at work, especially after the last two years of COVID-19. They realise the importance of work-life balance and mental wellness. Hence, organisations that provide good TAKING THE NEXT STEP FORWARD Three experts in the eld of work, jobs and sk ills share the ir ins ights on the value of non-stop learn ing and upsk illing. year, which gives fresh graduates insights on trends across sectors so they know the value of their skills and can make informed decisions about their career trajectory. We are also proling learners to nd out what skills individuals typically look to attain at different stages in their career, to provide them with solutions in a more timely and intuitive manner. How does the government identify emerging skills required by the market? We have a national jobs-skills repository that is dynamically updated with labour market intel. We mine this data to identify priority skills that are transferable across many job roles and sectors, and that can help graduates to prioritise their career options. We also look at job postings to see which skills are trending up or down. At the same time, we analyse the jobs and skills proles of frontier rms, including leading rms in the Green Economy, Digital Economy, Care Economy and Industry 4.0, for new emerging jobs and skills. What key skills are in demand? Last year's SDFE Report highlighted priority skills in the care, digital and green economies that can be applied across sectors. Care skills, for instance, involve inclusive and collaborative practices. Green skills deal with the environment, sustainability or compliance and reporting, while digital skills such as data analytics and technology application are important in many job roles. In SDFE 2022, we'll be introducing a new pillar which is Industry 4.0, that comprises skills in areas like automation and robotics. What would you say to graduates who feel no impetus to upskill? First, employers are looking for these skills. If you do not invest in yourself by learning them, you lose out to peers who took the rst step to do so. It is also good for individual development, because the future of work is changing and so are the needs of your next employer. So, upskilling yourself ahead of time might help you land your next dream job.ANY OF HISTORY'S GREAT VISIONARIES HAD THE SAME FUNDAMENTAL IDEA ABOUT LEARNING \u2014 THAT IT SHOULD NEVER STOP. Michelangelo is widely thought to have said that he was still learning at the grand old age of 87. Einstein was of the view that learning should start at birth and cease only in death. And Steve Jobs believed there's always \"one more thing\" to learn. As the nature of work and the workplace evolve at an ever-quicker pace, the key to thriving in such a dynamic job environment is through constant self-betterment and learning. Whichever stage of their career they may be at, graduates need to continue to upgrade and expand their skillset by acquiring new knowledge. This will not only enable them to do their job well but will also open doors to new and perhaps surprising prospects. Here, two speakers and one participant at the upcoming inaugural NUS Lifelong Learning Festival provide their perspectives on the current and future demands of the workplace, and what it will take to succeed. 4 THINGS TO KNOW ABOUT THE NUS LIFELONG LEARNING FESTIVAL 2022 support in these areas are better able to attract and retain talent. Which skills are in demand in Singapore and across Asia? There are three. The rst are professional skills, like those of a doctor, lawyer or engineer. These need to be deepened over time. The second are digital skills, which we all have to learn in order to do our job well, operate technology, and work with others across the world. And the third are soft skills like critical thinking, leadership, communication, collaboration and creativity. These are can be carried over to different jobs. How do we future-proof our careers? Develop a sense of curiosity. Constantly look out for new ways to do things or improve on them so that when it comes to a bigger learning requirement, you'll naturally be eager to take it up. Develop a growth mindset and know that we can always be better if we acquire new skills and take on new responsibilities. This combination of curiosity and a growth mindset will allow us to pick up different types of learning along the way, some of which are deep learning that will enable us to take on different roles or go into different industries. When this happens, our career can be future-proof. Here is what to expect from the inaugural event, which will revolve around the theme \"FutureWork: Thrive in the Future Workplace\".

In 2020, a group of Australian researchers led by Samantha Stanley identied and studied three broad emotion responses to climate change - anger (angry, frustrated), anxiety (anxious, afraid) and depression (depressed, miserable). They found that the Angry are most likely to take both individual (e.g. recycling) and collective climate action (e.g. protesting). The Anxious are most likely to engage in neither, and the Depressed will only take collective action. Interestingly and ironically, anger was correlated to improved mental health - that is, the angrier they were, the fewer instances of symptoms of depression, anxiety and stress they had. Meanwhile, those feeling anxious or depressed are likely to have poorer mental health. The more anxious or depressed they were, the more instances of depression, anxiety and stress they had. Though more research is needed to determine if angry people feel better because they tend to act, researchers concluded that the anger is a healthier coping mechanism than the \"debilitating\" effect of anxiousness and depression. JULY, SOME OF YOU READERS WILL BECOME NUS ALUMNI. COMMENCEMENT IS A SIGNIFICANT RITE OF PASSAGE: it marks the crossing of a threshold into the wider world. You might say that your university years were meant to prepare you to go into the wider world, to prosper in it, to make your mark on it, and to nd and full your purpose in it. But what happens if that world you are poised to enter seems like it is, both guratively and literally, burning up? What if the world, instead of brimming with promise, feels as like a wasteland, desolate and devoid of promise? According to a 2021 joint report by the World Meteorological Organization and the United Nations (UN) Ofce for Disaster Risk Reduction, weather-related disasters increased ve-fold in the last fty years. The impact on the economy will be profound. Based on research by insurance giant, Swiss Re Institute, even if the world meets its Paris Agreement target of limiting the rise in the global temperature to under two degrees Celsius, the global GDP loss by 2050 will be 4%; 4.2% in ASEAN. If no mitigating actions are taken, the loss will be 18% globally, and 37.4% in ASEAN. If such issues have been worrying you, it is likely you are not alone. You are joined by many young people around the world who have indicated negative emotional responses to the ecological crises. In a 2021 study by researchers from the University of Bath in the United Kingdom, an alarming three-quarters of 10,000 young people surveyed across ten countries said the future is \"frightening\". Half of those surveyed said that their daily lives and functioning are affected by their climate anxiety and distress. About 40% said they hesitate to have children because of it. In a separate study on the risk perceptions of NUS students conducted by the Institute for the Public Understanding of Risk (IPUR), \"climate change\" and \"environmental degradation\" were placed second and fourth on a list of 36 issues, beating out personal-level worries such as exams, jobs and health. Indeed, a similar story is unfolding in local news stories. In interview reports by CNA and Rice Media, young people who do not want kids explain why: they do not want to contribute to a dying Earth and are put off by the uncertainty of a world affected by climate change. Researchers and health professionals are trying to understand these trends. Terms like 'eco-anxiety' and 'environmental distress' have been coined to capture the anxiety, depression, or sense of loss people feel towards climate change. A February 2022 New York Times article, \"Climate change enters the therapy room\", described climate psychology as a growing eld in response to patient numbers; child psychiatrists with the Royal College of Psychiatrists in England said in 2020 that half of their patients had environmental distress. Professional associations are responding too. The Australian Psychological Society developed a handbook to educate people on how to support those experiencing eco-anxiety; the Climate Psychology Alliance North America created an online directory for climate-aware therapists.The suggestion that the Anxious and Depressed are reluctant to take action is alarming - what becomes of a world if its young people do not take action, despite feeling for a cause? Worse, is it really the case that anger is the only way to go? I personally hope not. As it turns out, anger isn't the only \"mobilising\" emotion. There is also hope - the hope that acting is not useless. As a group of German and Australian researchers led by Philipp Jugert found, the perception of agency encourages pro-environmental intentions such as protesting and signing of petitions. For many of us who are not on the frontlines of the climate ght - and it is becoming unclear where the frontlines are, or if such a notion makes sense for an existential and universal issue - our role may be in providing the structural support for voices to be heard and constructive climate action to happen. We can give hope, we can nurture it, and at a minimum, we can try to not kill what nascent hope there is. The Bath researchers concluded that protecting against climate anxiety would come in the form of validating one's feelings and views, particularly by those in power. They have the power to create space for interest/advocacy groups, so those with purpose will not have it stamped out from lack of agency. An example of agency provided to youths is the Phoenix Sustainability Initiative (PSI), a student organisation at the University of Chicago. Sustainability efforts, such as collecting food scraps from residences to compost or organising thrift shop pop-ups, are centralised in PSI. The university gave PSI a grant, and maintained the partnership through many channels such as its sustainability ofce and housing and student life. So let me end on a hopeful note. And this hope must proceed from an acknowledgement of this emerging reality. The anger that moves us to act must be a constructive one, lest we act in a manner that adds to the world's malaise. But we should be careful when it comes to anger: even a righteous anger will eventually consume you. I prefer to look at hope, and how it manifests in actual on-the-ground initiatives as well as in changing mindsets and worldviews. How can we advocate for hope, for the planet, and ultimately for our collective survival? How can we nd space and time for advocacy, to grow and to sustain it? And specic to you who are graduating soon: what have we learned in our university years - the knowledge we amassed, the skills we acquired, the sensibilities we developed - that can be applied to this burgeoning ecological and psycho-social crisis? And for those troubled by climate change, take comfort in Caroline Hickman's suggestion: to reframe climate anxiety as eco-caring or eco-empathy. A sign that people still care enough about the planet and its species. As the poet and environmental activist, Gary Snyder, puts it, \"Guilt and anger and fear are part of the problem. If you want to save the world, save it because you love it!\" Dr Adrian W J Kuah is Director of NUS Futures Ofce; and Ms Christalle Tay is an Analyst in the same department. 42 . THE ALUM NUSWhile Singapore has little quantitative evidence of climate- induced mental issues, there have been anecdotes. One senior counsellor told The Straits Times in an October 2021 article, \"Climate anxiety is becoming a big mental health issue\", that she has around ve clients with climate anxiety, all aged 20 to 40. Young people interviewed for the article spoke of feelings of depression (\"there was nothing I could do\"), nihilism (\"what is the point of doing anything?\"), and guilt for not doing more (feeling like a \"bad eco-warrior\"). But these feelings are a natural response to climate change. An American therapist and author of the book, Emotional Resiliency in the Era of Climate Change: a Clinician's Guide , Leslie Davenport, said in an interview with The Guardian newspaper: \"Eco-anxiety is a natural response to a threat. And this is a very real threat.\" Psychotherapist Caroline Hickman, one of the authors of the University of Bath report and a member of the Climate Psychology Alliance, wrote an research article titled \"We need to (nd a way to) talk about... Eco-anxiety\". She said that while the climate crisis itself is worrying enough, attempts to denigrate and dismiss such fears, and to silence young people speaking up, may be more frightening and confusing. Her interviewees spoke about feeling belittled, judged or criticised for their worries. She raised the example of former Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison, who said Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg had given Australian children \"needless anxieties\" following her speech to the UN in 2019. This article rst appeared in Issue 8 of FUTURITY , published by NUS Futures Ofce .The anger that moves us to act must be a constructive one, lest we act in a manner that adds to the world's malaise. Is there room for optimism on a planet that is confronting a seemingly insurmountable climate crisis? Ms Christalle Tay (Arts and Social Sciences '20) and Dr Adrian W J Kuah from NUS Futures Ofce believe it's not time to give in to 'eco-anxiety' just yet.WHAT TO DO WHEN IT FEELS LIKE THE END OF THE WORLD?parting shots ALUMNI HAPPENINGS EVENTS 44 . THE ALUM 2022 23 by LKYSPP Alumni Chapter (Singapore) Dinner at Yarra Botanica 19 March 2022 8 April 2022Spring Equinox Dinner Attendees of the dinner were treated to mouth- watering delights such as ngoh hiang , sh tofu cabbage soup, deep-fried sh , steamed cha cha . As the scrumptious dishes lled the tables, attendees engaged in hearty conversation. Some amusingly wondered if it would be possible to nish all the food before the restaurant closed - needless to say, the challenge was dealt with decisively. Alumni who attended the dinner were ecstatic to meet up again after the Chapter's last gathering in November 2021. As the COVID-19 situation improves, the Chapter hopes to bring back at least three events per year, with a potluck picnic in the pipeline for 2022. The Chapter will also be trying to organise a networking event, echoing the goodwill of alumni who expressed interest in mentoring and networking. Overall, the dinner was a wonderful evening lled with good food and good company. NUS College of Design and Engineering (CDE) held its rst Alumni Chat with the Dean on 8 April. About 60 alumni took time off from their busy schedules to join the panel discussion via Zoom, discussing how CDE, as a new college, could better engage with alumni. The Dean shared the aspirations of CDE: to build a new community, to unite diverse minds and talents, to foster an interdisciplinary spirit, and to innovate design and engineering - aims that resonated with attendees gathered that evening. Beyond generic one-time engagement, alumni also raised that more opportunities should be created and made known for them to connect with their alma Negotiation happens in every aspect of our lives - from the workplace, between businesses and even among friends and family. Often, the outcome of a negotiation can affect the relationships between people. Identifying this need from alumni to upgrade their negotiation skills, the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy (LKYSPP) Alumni Chapter (Singapore) organised a Masterclass titled In line with the lifting of all COVID-19 restrictions in the Australian state of Victoria, NUS Alumni Melbourne Chapter organised a cosy meet-up with Mr Bernard Toh (Architecture '84), Director of NUS Alumni Relations (OAR) at the Yarra Botanica, located in the heart of Southbank. Chapter Chairperson Dr Edna Yeo (Science '93) introduced Mr Toh, welcoming him to the city after more than two years of restricted international travel. Some 18 alumni attended the meet-up, and each shared personal stories of what could be considered the hardest lockdown in Melbourne. Mr Toh engaged in thought-provoking conversations with both new and long-standing Chapter members.

They were joined online by Dr Swati Jain (Engineering '10). He highlighted the importance of engagement, recounting his experiences in the Rep ublic of Singapore Air Force where he rst met Mr Richard Seet (Engineering '86) and Dr Edna Yeo (Science '93). He also emphasised the import ance of education and literacy to engage people in active debates. Alumni like Mr Philip Chan (Computing '94) and Ms Leanne Lim (Arts and Social Sciences '13), who are also part of the Singapore Global Network, chimed in with their wishes to see positive changes in future generations. Attendees also shared the impact of COVID-19 in the workplace and on families juggling with working from home, while home-schooling their children. Ms Pit Li Chew (Design and Engineering '89) highlighted her struggle of being unable to commute back regularly to Singapore for work due to border closures. With travel restrictions eased, many looked forward to visiting their loved ones. As dusk fell upon the beautiful setting of the Yarra River, the conversations transited into feasting on cheese platters, wood-red pizzas, buffalo wings and hot chips with beverages from the bar. The long-awaited gathering drew many smiles, cheers and laughter from attendees. On behalf of the Chapter, Dr Yeo presented a token of appreciation to Mr Toh and OAR for the continued support given in sponsoring this event. Lastly, Dr Yeo distributed LiNUS face masks from OAR to members, before the evening's proceedings concluded.Negotiating Towards Success , which was held at the Bukit Timah Campus on 9 April.

Alumni Chat with the DeanCollege of Design and Engineering -On 19 March, over 30 alumni and their spouses met at the Lion City Restaurant in Mississauga, Ontario, a suburb of Toronto, Canada. With the gradual easing of pandemic-related restrictions, members of the NUS Alumni Toronto Chapter decided to gather on the weekend of the Spring Equinox. Lion City Restaurant is a unique place in the Greater Toronto Area that serves amazing Singaporean food. The restaurant also held wonderful memories for the Chapter pre-pandemic, as they had held their last major event - the Chinese New Year lunch in early 2020 - at the same location. mater in more meaningful ways. They urged the College to consider more structured forms of engagement that can bring value to alumni, via collaborations or channels to support alumni businesses, or assist in their professional development. This could be done through student-alumni joint projects where alumni tap on CDE's research talents, or even in unique ways such as sharing \"passion projects\". CDE hopes to continue working closely with key alumni partners, as the alumni base is an integral part of the extended CDE community.

Placing treats for her charges in their exhibit.Above: Ms Tay checking on Le Le, then 78 days old, on 30 Oct 2021. Left: Outside the panda exhibit with Kai Kai in the background.Being so close to Jia Jia and Kai Kai means that Ms Tay can easily identify the traits of each that have passed on to their cub Le Le, who was born to much fanfare last year. \"He is fast in guring things out and remembering how to climb up and down certain structures, like Jia Jia who is quite smart. But he is also calm like his dad, Kai Kai.\" She adds with pride, \"Le Le is growing well and getting much better at climbing in the exhibit with Jia Jia. Like all cubs, he is playful and curious, and loves exploring his environment. He seems to take after his mum a little more.\" Her eyes brighten as she describes the giant panda family, revealing just how zealous she is about her job. It makes sense: after all, this been a lifelong passion for Ms Tay, who started volunteering at the Singapore Zoo as a keeper at the age of 15. \"I would volunteer once a week with different animals,\" she says. She enjoyed it so much that she considered quitting junior college at one point. \"But my mother talked me out of it and I decided to take up Life Sciences at NUS.\" A WALK ON THE WILD SIDE Upon graduation and after a short stint overseas, Ms Tay worked at a desk job but found herself uninspired. \"I was unsure what to pursue next and took a while to gure this out before coming back to volunteering at the zoo \u2014 and eventually joined the animal care team,\" she says. In some ways, she started a second career when her peers were already established in the paths they had taken early on. Yet Ms Tay has no regrets. \"This was something I wanted to pursue when I was younger, so it made sense for me to start off here again as I had the relevant volunteer experience and educational qualications.\" But she admits that it is not always butterflies and rainbows. \"Every career, (even one that you're passionate about), has good and bad parts, ups and downs, and it will never be smooth sailing all the way,\" she shares. \"During stressful periods, you might wonder if this is really for you \u2014 but if you don't nd yourself dreading to go to work each morning and still nd joy in your job, then keep pursuing your passion. Sometimes, the rainbow comes just after the rain!\" GRACEIT WITH WHAT IT TAKES Five traits that people working with animals need, according to Ms Tay: A keen sense of observation Patience to train the animals A can-do attitude to take on new challenges Being adaptable Remaining calm in various situations BEAR-ING PHOTOS OF MS TRISHA TAY AT WORK: MANDAI WILDLIFE GROUP 48 . THE ALUM NUSYOUNG PARENTS LEARN A LOT ABOUT CARING FOR THEIR KIDS FROM THEIR LOVED ONES AND FELLOW PARENTS. But Ms Trisha Tay picked up parenting tips from a unique source: Jia Jia and Kai Kai, the two giant pandas she has been looking after since 2012. Tasks like feeding the animals multiple times a day and settling them in for naps were like a preview of parenthood, says Ms Tay, 38. That \"glimpse into the future\" came in handy when she had children of her own. \"I see similarities between parenting young children and training animals,\" explains the mother of two children aged eight and ve. \"Things don't always go your way, and you always need to factor in whether the children or animals ate properly, are being moody or did not sleep well.\" Join us at connectus.nus.edu.sg!%5,1*,1*862*(7+(5 con NectUS is a new, exclusive professional networking platform for theNUS community to connect with one another.
