[[1]](#cite_note-ahsci-1) [[2]](#cite_note-drugs.com:_Drug_Definition-2) Drugs are typically distinguished from [food](/wiki/Food) and substances that provide nutritional support. Consumption of drugs can be via [inhalation](/wiki/Insufflation_(medicine)), [injection](/wiki/Drug_injection), [smoking](/wiki/Smoking), [ingestion](/wiki/Ingestion), [absorption](/wiki/Absorption_(skin)) via a or [dissolution under the tongue](/wiki/Sublingual_administration). In [pharmacology](/wiki/Pharmacology), a drug is a chemical substance, typically of known structure, which, when administered to a living organism, produces a biological effect. [[3]](#cite_note-3) A [pharmaceutical drug](/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug), also called a medication or medicine, is a chemical substance used to [treat](/wiki/Pharmacotherapy), [cure](/wiki/Cure), [prevent](/wiki/Preventive_healthcare), or [diagnose](/wiki/Medical_diagnosis) a [disease](/wiki/Disease) or to promote [well-being](/wiki/Well-being). [[1]](#cite_note-ahsci-1) Traditionally drugs were obtained through extraction from [medicinal plants](/wiki/Medicinal_plants), but more recently also by [organic synthesis](/wiki/Organic_synthesis). [[4]](#cite_note-4) Pharmaceutical drugs may be used for a limited duration, or on a regular basis for [chronic disorders](/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)). [[1]](#cite_note-ahsci-1) Pharmaceutical drugs are often classified into [drug classes](/wiki/Drug_class)\u2014groups of related drugs that have similar [chemical structures](/wiki/Chemical_structure), the same [mechanism of action](/wiki/Mechanism_of_action) (binding to the same [biological target](/wiki/Biological_target)), a related [mode of action](/wiki/Mode_of_action), and that are used to treat the same disease. [[5]](#cite_note-ReferenceA-5) [[6]](#cite_note-auto-6) The [Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical Classification System](/wiki/Anatomical_Therapeutic_Chemical_Classification_System) (ATC), the most widely used drug classification system, assigns drugs a unique [ATC code](/wiki/ATC_code), which is an alphanumeric code that assigns it to specific drug classes within the ATC system. Another major classification system is the [Biopharmaceutics Classification System](/wiki/Biopharmaceutics_Classification_System). This classifies drugs according to permeability or [absorption](/wiki/Absorption_(pharmacokinetics)) properties. [[7]](#cite_note-ReferenceB-7) [Psychoactive drugs](/wiki/Psychoactive_drug) are substances that affect the function of [central nervous system](/wiki/Central_nervous_system), altering [perception](/wiki/Perception), [mood](/wiki/Mood_(psychology)) or [consciousness](/wiki/Consciousness). [[8]](#cite_note-bushbook-8) [antidepressants](/wiki/Antidepressant), [anxiolytics](/wiki/Anxiolytic), [antipsychotics](/wiki/Antipsychotic), and [hallucinogens](/wiki/Hallucinogen). These psychoactive drugs have been proven useful in treating wide range of [medical conditions](/wiki/Medical_conditions) including [mental disorders](/wiki/Mental_disorder) around the world. The most widely used drugs in the world include [caffeine](/wiki/Caffeine), [nicotine](/wiki/Nicotine) and [alcohol](/wiki/Alcohol_(drug)), [[9]](#cite_note-9) which are also considered [recreational drugs](/wiki/Recreational_drug_use), since they are used for pleasure rather than medicinal purposes. [[10]](#cite_note-10) All drugs can have potential [side effects](/wiki/Side_effect). [[11]](#cite_note-MHRA_Side_Effects_of_Medicines-11) Abuse of several psychoactive drugs can and/or [physical dependence](/wiki/Substance_dependence). [[12]](#cite_note-12) Excessive use of stimulants can promote [stimulant psychosis](/wiki/Stimulant_psychosis). Many recreational drugs are [illicit](/wiki/Illegal_drug_trade) and international treaties such as the [Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs](/wiki/Single_Convention_on_Narcotic_Drugs) exist for the purpose of their [prohibition](/wiki/Prohibition_of_drugs). Etymology In English, the noun \"drug\" is thought to originate from Old French \"drogue\", possibly deriving from \"droge (vate)\" from Middle Dutch meaning \"dry (barrels)\", referring to medicinal plants preserved as dry matter in barrels. [[13]](#cite_note-etymonline-drug-13) [[14]](#cite_note-14) In the 1990s however, Spanish [lexicographer](/wiki/Lexicographer) [Federico Corriente C\u00f3rdoba](/wiki/Federico_Corriente) documented the possible origin of the word in {r} [[15]](#cite_note-15) an early romanized form of [Al-Andalus](/wiki/Al-Andalus) language from Northwestern part of the [Iberian peninsula](/wiki/Iberian_Peninsula). [[16]](#cite_note-16) The term could approximately be transcribed as or hatruka. [[17]](#cite_note-17) Medication A medication or medicine is a [drug](/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug) taken to cure or ameliorate any symptoms of an [illness](/wiki/Illness) or medical condition. The use may also be as [preventive medicine](/wiki/Preventive_medicine) that has future benefits but does not treat any existing or pre-existing diseases or symptoms. Dispensing of medication is often regulated by [governments](/wiki/Government) into three categories\u2014 [over-the-counter](/wiki/Over-the-counter_drug) medications, which are available in [pharmacies](/wiki/Pharmacy) and supermarkets without special restrictions; [behind-the-counter](/wiki/Behind-the-counter) medicines, which are dispensed by a [pharmacist](/wiki/Pharmacist) without needing a doctor's prescription, and [prescription only medicines](/wiki/Prescription_medication), which must be prescribed by a licensed [medical professional](/wiki/Medical_professional), usually a [physician](/wiki/Physician). [[18]](#cite_note-HPC-18) In the United Kingdom, behind-the-counter medicines are called [pharmacy medicines](/wiki/Pharmacy_medicine) which can only be sold in registered pharmacies, by or under the supervision of a pharmacist. These medications are designated by the letter P on the label. [[19]](#cite_note-19) The range of medicines available without a prescription varies from country to country. Medications are typically produced by [pharmaceutical companies](/wiki/Pharmaceutical_industry) and are often [patented](/wiki/Patent) to give the developer exclusive rights to produce them. Those that are not patented (or with expired patents) are called [generic drugs](/wiki/Generic_drug) since they can be produced by other companies without restrictions or licenses from the patent holder. [[20]](#cite_note-20) Pharmaceutical drugs are usually categorised into [drug classes](/wiki/Drug_class). A group of drugs will share a similar [chemical structure](/wiki/Chemical_structure), or have the same [mechanism of action](/wiki/Mechanism_of_action), the same related [mode of action](/wiki/Mode_of_action) or target the same illness or related illnesses. [[5]](#cite_note-ReferenceA-5) [[6]](#cite_note-auto-6) The [Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical Classification System](/wiki/Anatomical_Therapeutic_Chemical_Classification_System) (ATC), the most widely used drug classification system, assigns drugs a unique [ATC code](/wiki/ATC_code), which is an alphanumeric code that assigns it to specific drug classes within the ATC system. Another major classification system is the [Biopharmaceutics Classification System](/wiki/Biopharmaceutics_Classification_System). This groups drugs according to their solubility and permeability or [absorption](/wiki/Absorption_(pharmacokinetics)) properties. [[7]](#cite_note-ReferenceB-7) Spiritual and religious use Some religions, particularly [ethnic religions](/wiki/Ethnic_religion), are based completely on the use of certain drugs, known as [entheogens](/wiki/Entheogens), which are mostly [hallucinogens](/wiki/Hallucinogen),\u2014 [psychedelics](/wiki/Psychedelic_drug), [dissociatives](/wiki/Dissociative), or [deliriants](/wiki/Deliriant). Some drugs used as entheogens include [kava](/wiki/Kava) which can act as a [stimulant](/wiki/Stimulant), a [sedative](/wiki/Sedative), a [euphoriant](/wiki/Euphoriant) and an [anesthetic](/wiki/Anesthetic). The roots of the kava plant are used to produce a drink which is consumed throughout the cultures of the Pacific Ocean. Some [shamans](/wiki/Shamanism) from different cultures use entheogens, defined as \"generating the divine within\" hallucinogenic brew for this purpose. [Mazatec shamans](/wiki/Mazatec_shamans) have a long and continuous tradition of religious use of [Salvia divinorum](/wiki/Salvia_divinorum) a [psychoactive](/wiki/Psychoactive) plant. Its use is to facilitate [visionary states of consciousness](/wiki/Altered_state_of_consciousness) during spiritual healing sessions. [[22]](#cite_note-Vald\u00e9s1983p287-22) [Silene undulata](/wiki/Silene_undulata) is regarded by the [Xhosa people](/wiki/Xhosa_people) as a sacred plant and used as an entheogen. Its roots are traditionally used to induce vivid (and according to the Xhosa, prophetic) [lucid dreams](/wiki/Lucid_dreaming) during the initiation process of [shamans](/wiki/Shamans), classifying it a naturally occurring [oneirogen](/wiki/Oneirogen) similar to the more well-known dream herb [Calea ternifolia](/wiki/Calea_ternifolia). [[23]](#cite_note-23) [Peyote](/wiki/Peyote), a small spineless [cactus](/wiki/Cactus), has been a major source of psychedelic [mescaline](/wiki/Mescaline) and has probably been used by [Native Americans](/wiki/Indigenous_peoples_of_the_Americas) for at least five thousand years. [[24]](#cite_note-prehistoric-24) [[25]](#cite_note-25) Most mescaline is now obtained from a few species of columnar cacti in particular from [San Pedro](/wiki/Echinopsis_pachanoi) and not from the vulnerable peyote. [[26]](#cite_note-26) The [entheogenic use of cannabis](/wiki/Entheogenic_use_of_cannabis) has also [[27]](#cite_note-27) centuries. [[28]](#cite_note-28) [psilocybin mushrooms](/wiki/Psilocybin_mushroom)), commonly called magic mushrooms or shrooms have also long been used as entheogens. Smart drugs and designer drugs [Nootropics](/wiki/Nootropic), also commonly referred to as \"smart drugs\", are drugs that are claimed to improve human [cognitive abilities](/wiki/Cognition). Nootropics are used to improve memory, concentration, thought, mood, and learning. An increasingly used nootropic among students, also known as a study drug, is [methylphenidate](/wiki/Methylphenidate) branded commonly as Ritalin and used for the treatment of [attention deficit hyperactivity (ADHD) and addictive](/wiki/Methylphenidate#Biomolecular_mechanisms). [[30]](#cite_note-Smith-30) Serious addiction can lead to [psychosis](/wiki/Psychosis), [anxiety](/wiki/Anxiety) and heart problems, and the use of this drug is related to a rise in suicides, and overdoses. Evidence for use outside of student settings is limited but suggests that it is commonplace. [[29]](#cite_note-Abelman-29) [[30]](#cite_note-Smith-30) Intravenous use of methylphenidate can lead to [emphysematous](/wiki/Pneumatosis#Pulmonary_emphysema) damage to the lungs, known as [Ritalin lung](/wiki/Ritalin_lung). [[31]](#cite_note-31) Other drugs known as [designer drugs](/wiki/Designer_drug) are produced. An early example of what today would be labelled a 'designer drug' was [LSD](/wiki/Lysergic_acid_diethylamide), which was synthesised include analogs of [performance-enhancing drugs](/wiki/Performance-enhancing_drugs) such as designer [steroids](/wiki/Steroids) taken to improve physical capabilities and these are sometimes used (legally or not) for this purpose, often by professional athletes. [[33]](#cite_note-pmid22191595-33) Other designer drugs mimic the effects of psychoactive drugs. Since the late 1990s there has been the identification of many of these synthesised drugs. In Japan and the United Kingdom this has spurred the addition of many designer drugs into a newer class of controlled substances known as a [temporary class drug](/wiki/Temporary_class_drug). [Synthetic cannabinoids](/wiki/Synthetic_cannabinoid) have been produced for a longer period of time and are used in the designer drug [synthetic cannabis](/wiki/Synthetic_cannabis). Recreational drug use [Recreational drug use](/wiki/Recreational_drug_use) is the use of a drug (legal, controlled, or illegal) with the primary intention of [altering the state of consciousness](/wiki/Altered_state_of_consciousness) through alteration of the central nervous system in order to create positive emotions and feelings. The hallucinogen [LSD](/wiki/LSD) is a psychoactive drug commonly used as a recreational drug. [[35]](#cite_note-35) [Ketamine](/wiki/Ketamine) is a drug used for [anesthesia](/wiki/Anesthesia), and is also used as a recreational drug, both in powder and liquid form, for its hallucinogenic and [dissociative effects](/wiki/Dissociation_(psychology)). [[36]](#cite_note-Morgan-36) [Some national laws](/wiki/Drug_laws) prohibit the use of different recreational drugs; and medicinal drugs that have the potential for recreational use are often heavily regulated. However, there are many recreational drugs that are [legal in many jurisdictions](/wiki/Drug_liberalization#Policies_by_country) and widely culturally accepted. [Cannabis](/wiki/Cannabis_(drug)) is the most commonly consumed controlled recreational drug in the world (as of 2012). [[37]](#cite_note-WDR_2012-37) Its use in many countries is illegal but is [legally used](/wiki/Legality_of_cannabis) in several countries usually with the proviso that it can only be used for personal use. It can be used in the leaf form of [marijuana](/wiki/Marijuana) (grass), or in the resin form of [hashish](/wiki/Hashish). Marijuana is a more mild form of cannabis than hashish. There may be an age restriction on the consumption and purchase of legal recreational drugs. Some recreational drugs that are legal and accepted in many places include [alcohol](/wiki/Alcoholic_beverage), [tobacco](/wiki/Tobacco), [betel nut](/wiki/Betel_nut), and [caffeine](/wiki/Caffeine) products, and in some areas of the world the legal use of drugs such as [khat](/wiki/Khat) is common. [[38]](#cite_note-Kciy-38) There are a number of legal intoxicants commonly called legal highs that are used recreationally. The most widely used of these is alcohol. Administration of drugs All drugs, can be [administered](/wiki/Drug_delivery) via a number of [routes](/wiki/Route_of_administration), and many can be administered by more than one. [Bolus](/wiki/Bolus_(medicine))is the administration of a medication, drug or other compound that is given to raise its concentration in blood to an effective level. The administration can be given intravenously, by parenteral,by indovenous, by intramuscular, intrathecal or subcutaneous the lungs), as an [aerosol](/wiki/Aerosol), [inhaler](/wiki/Inhaler), [vape](/wiki/Vape)or dry powder (this includes smoking into the nose. [Orally](/wiki/Oral_administration), as a liquid or solid, that is absorbed through the [intestines](/wiki/Intestine). [Rectally](/wiki/Rectum)as a [suppository](/wiki/Suppository), that is absorbed by the rectum or colon. [Sublingually](/wiki/Sublingual_administration), diffusing into the blood through tissues under the tongue. [Topically](/wiki/Topical), usually as a [cream](/wiki/Cream)or [ointment](/wiki/Ointment). A drug administered in this manner may be given to act locally or systemically. [[39]](#cite_note-39) [Vaginally](/wiki/Vagina)as a [pessary](/wiki/Pessary#Pharmaceutical_pessaries), primarily to treat vaginal infections. Control of drugs Numerous governmental offices in many countries deal with the control and supervision of drug manufacture and use, and the implementation of various drug laws. The [Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs](/wiki/Single_Convention_on_Narcotic_Drugs) is an international [treaty](/wiki/Treaty) brought about in 1961 to prohibit the use of narcotics save for those used in [medical research](/wiki/Medical_research) and treatment. In 1971, a second treaty the [Convention on Psychotropic Substances](/wiki/Convention_on_Psychotropic_Substances) had to be introduced to deal with newer recreational psychoactive and psychedelic drugs. The [legal status of Salvia divinorum](/wiki/Legal_status_of_Salvia_divinorum) varies in many countries and even in [states within the United States](/wiki/Legal_status_of_Salvia_divinorum_in_the_United_States). Where it is legislated against the degree of prohibition also varies. The [Food and Drug Administration](/wiki/Food_and_Drug_Administration) (FDA) in the United States is a [federal agency](/wiki/List_of_United_States_federal_agencies) responsible for protecting and promoting [public health](/wiki/Public_health) federal law [Ministry of Home of India](/wiki/Government_of_India) is tasked with combating [drug trafficking](/wiki/Drug_trafficking) and assisting international use of illegal substances under the provisions of [Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act](/wiki/Narcotic_Drugs_and_Psychotropic_Substances_Act_(India)).
