Children who have attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, or ADHD, can have a hard time staying focused and often lack self-control. As a result, children who have ADHD may perform poorly in school, have a hard time getting along with peers, and have difficulties at home. There are several treatment options available for children who have ADHD. Some are more effective than others. It all depends on the child. Some parents are reluctant to put their children on medication, because of the potential for side effects. Although many children do benefit from taking medication, natural remedies for ADHD can also help children stay calm and focused. Diet as a Natural ADHD Remedy Children who have ADHD should have a lot of protein in their diet. Research indicates that protein is one of the most effective ADHD natural treatments. A study conducted at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology suggests that protein helps the brain produce dopamine and norephrine. Dopamine and norephrine are natural chemicals that allow a person to concentrate and stay focused. In order to get the maximum benefits, children need 30 grams of protein a day. Foods that contain protein include eggs, poultry, soy milk, and dairy products. Fish can also improve a child's ability to stay focused. The omega-3 fatty acids in fish help the brain function properly. Nuts and flaxseed oil are other sources of omega-3 fatty acids. Eliminate Food Allergy Triggers Food allergies can worsen the behavioral problems in children who have ADHD. Foods that are found to trigger inappropriate behavior should be removed from a child's diet. Parents can determine if their child has food allergies by removing foods from their child's diet that they suspect may be the source of the problem. They should then observe the child's behavior for about two weeks and see if there are any changes. The process of eliminating certain foods and watching for behavioral changes should be repeated until the parents are satisfied that they have checked all foods that may be affecting their child's behavior. According to the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, foods that are most likely to trigger an allergic reaction in children include peanuts, eggs, and milk. Ease Symptoms with Meditation Numerous studies indicate that transcendental meditation is one of the most powerful natural remedies for ADHD. This form of meditation can help children cope better with stress, remain calm and think more clearly. The great thing about meditation is that a person can do it anywhere. According to researchers, if children meditate twice a day for 10 minutes, changes will occur in their brain that will lessen the symptoms of ADHD. The Institute for Community Enrichment and Abramson Family provided the funding for a study on the effects of transcendental meditation on children with ADHD. Researchers found that children with ADHD who did transcendental meditation daily for six months, had the same ability to concentrate as their peers who did not have this condition. "}
