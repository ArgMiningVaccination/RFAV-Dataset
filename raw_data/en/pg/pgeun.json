The CAPER reports performance for the f ollowing federal housing and community development block grants: Community Development Block Grant (CDBG), HOME Investment Partnerships Program (HOME), National Housing Trust Fund (NHTF), Emergency Solutions Grant (ESG), Housing Opportunities for Person s with HIV/AIDS (HOPWA). The CAPER is typically filed in September of each year, due 60 -days after the end of block grant program years . The CAPER is made available for public review for 15 days prior to HUD submittal. This CAPER covers the program year 2020 (PY20), which runs from July 1, 20 20 through June 30, 202 1. The Action Plan for the PY20 was amended during the program year to direct funding to continued COVID -19 responses and address a formula error. The CAPER follows a template prescribed by HUD . Content and structure include: An introduction that compares the amount of funds allocated by block grant and program activity to the funds expended during the program year; A HUD matrix that track s progress toward 5 -year and annual goals; A discussion of how well the state fulfilled its goals , including program changes made to meet the needs that emerged during the year ; Demographic characteristics of program beneficiaries as available ; Leveragin g of block grant funds; Other actions the state took during the program year to address needs; and Monitoring procedures to ensure fund compliance. Appendices to the CAPER include the public notice for draft review and supplement reports detailing block grant expenditures. CR-05 - Goals and Outcomes Progress the jurisdiction has made in carrying out its strategic plan and its action plan. 91.520(a) The planned allocation, commitment, and disbursements of funds during PY 20 is summarized below and in the goals and outcomes matrix : CAPER 2 OMB $2,732,830 disbursed ; Stormwater improvements \u2014$1,756,851 million allocated with $ 766,915 disburse d.

OCRA's CDBG distribution during PY20 was much different than in a traditional year, with far more funding allocated to direct service activities to help residents and businesses manage the economic consequences of the COVID -19 pa ndemic . Of the total amount disbursed, 50% was allocated to public facilities and improvements and 38% was allocated to direct business assistance. OCRA also allocated funds for public services, mostly health care services, which it typically does not fund. The activities funded and amounts disbursed during the program year are detailed below. OCRA does not typically report outcomes by persons served due to the nature of the activities funded in a typical program year. As such, the outcomes matrix above measures facilities or projects funded (v. persons or households benefitting from those improvements). During PY20, funding allocations are estimated result in the following: Preservation of jobs for 1,570 workers; Rehabilitation of business facilities to benefit another 1,574 workers; Public facility improvements to benefit 630,000 residents; and Public services to benefit 197,300 residents. CR-10 - Racial and Ethnic composition of families assisted Describe the families assisted (including the racial and ethnic status of families assisted). 91.520(a) CDBG HOME HOPWA ESG and ESG-CV HTF White 41,568 110 367 7,287 11 Black or African American 579 10 301 2,827 0 Asian 443 0 12 66 0 American Indian or American Native 206 0 0 55 0 Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander 37 0 0 46 0 Total 42,833 120 680 10,281 11 Hispanic 5,539 0 39 666 0 Not Hispanic 44,632 120 764 10,180 11 Table 2 - Table of assistance to racial and ethnic populations by source of funds Narrative The CDBG beneficiary data are from the IDIS CDBG Summary of Accomplishments report for PY20 are CAPER 11 OMB Control No: 2506 -0117 (exp. 06/30/2018) limited. The table above excludes multi -racial households, which totaled 122 households. Efforts to collect more data on the ethnic and the racial composition of beneficiaries were delayed by the COVID -19 pandemic. While these data fields have not yet been added to OCRA's new grants management system (GMS), in PY2020, OCRA actively sought ways to incentivize applications that included a focus on supporting Minor ity-, Women -, or Veteran -Owned Businesses for its COVID -19 Response Program. Additional points for these applications were awarded by the OCRA Scoring Committee when evaluating these projects to facilitate and advance equitable policies that support long- term economic growth for businesses and populations disproportionally impacted by the pandemic. HOME beneficiaries include new rental construction and TBRA ; program beneficiaries were mostly White (110 of 120 , or 92% ) and, secondarily, African American (10 of 120 , or 8% ). Of these beneficiaries, all had incomes of 60 % AMI and less with most, 95 or 79 %, at the 30 % AMI and less level. The table excludes 81 multi -racial households who were assisted with HOPWA. The NHTF allocation subsidizes new construction and rehabilitation of affordable housing. During PY20 , funds were deployed for new construction and those projects will be completed in future program years. As such, the racial and ethnic composition of families assisted by the NHTF in the current program year is unknown. The information in the table reflects the race and ethnicity of a project completed in PY20 but funded in PY19 to provide a likely dis tribution. For ESG, five outreach programs were funded. In the regions in which these programs operate, a concerted and consistent effort is made to reach the most vulnerable and underserved persons experiencing homelessness. Also, IHCDA continues to work with the state- wide PATH projects for additional street outreach to reach those underserved and hardest to serve.

Draws for TBRA IHCDA's PY20 HOME Rental Round was opened in March of 20 21 with applications due in Ma y of 202 1. IHCDA's Board of Directors approved those projects in August of 2021. Funded projects then undergo the Environmental Review (ERR); once that has been completed and the project has Release of Funds (ROF), IHCDA executes the HOME contracts, and commits funds in IDIS. IHCDA is in the process of finalizing the FY 2020 ERR and will con tinue to commit funds once projects have ROF. Through this round, IHCDA funded 1 1 projects ( 6 CHDO and 5 non-CHDO projects), culminating in an anticipated 135 units across ten counties. IHCDA has continued to accept applications to the HOME Homebuyer program on a rolling basis; contracts also follow the same approval process. IHCDA awarded two recipients funds under this program - one CHDO and two non -CHDO projects, culminating in an anticipated 5 homebuyer units. CAPER 13 OMB Control No: 2506 -0117 (exp. 06/30/2018) In addition, IHCDA used HOME as supplement al funding in conjunction with its LIHTC program; applications were due in September of 2020 , with funding approved by IHCDA Board of Directors in February of 20 21. IHCDA funded 2 NHTF project through this round. Each was still undergoing ERR and Section 106 review at the end of PY20 . IHCDA also released a competitive Request for Proposal in January of 2019 as part of the HOME Innovative round, open to non -profit developers to app ly for HOME funding to support development of HOME - assisted units for HOME -ownership. Three non -profits were selected for this initiative , and underwent a five month training on HOME regulations and best practices in affordable housing development. As of t he publication of this CAPER, each team is working on their final concept . The first project was awarded funds to support homeownership development and should be starting construction in PY2021. IHCDA anticipates the remaining construction application requ ests in FY202 1. IHCDA also opened a HOME -TBRA program, with a focus in FY2019 to help income qualified households pay for housing costs including rent, security deposits, and utility deposits. IHCDA focuses its TBRA program on providing rental assistance f or formerly incarcerated individuals, defined as 1) individuals exiting the corrections system within six months who are at risk of homelessness due to a lack of stable housing, 2) individuals currently experiencing homelessness who were formerly incarcerated, and 3) individuals who were formerly incarcerated and are currently experiencing a housing crisis where enrollment in the HOME -TBRA Program would prevent an eviction. According to the HTF Activity Status Report (PR100), IHCDA committed NHTF funding to 7 projects during the program year, totalling $ 6,490,560. Of that, $ 820,823 was drawn. Through the Indiana Permanent Supportive Housing Institute , 6 teams successfully graduated during FY20 and will be eligible to apply for a set -aside of HOME and NHTF . On April 10, 2020, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) released a memo providing guidance on statutory suspensions and regulat ory waivers meant to enable participating jurisdictions affected by the COVID -19 pandemic to use HOME funds to address immediate housing needs and to help prevent spread of the virus. This guidance increased the amount of CHDO Operating a Participating Jurisdiction may set aside from 5% to 10% of its annual allocation, and waived the $50,000 CHDO Operating Supplement funding limit and the requirement that CHDO Operating Supplement funds be awarded in conjunction with a HOME project under the 2019 Annual Act ion Plan. These funds were approved in September 2020. Eleven CHDO were awarded supplemental funds at this time. Identify the geographic distribution and location of investments Target Area Planned Percentage of Allocation Actual Percentage of Allocation Narrative Description N/A N/A N/A N/A Table 4 - Identify the geographic distribution and location of investments Narrative CAPER 14 OMB Control No: 2506 -0117 (exp. 06/30/2018) The State of Indiana does not prioritize the allocation of CDBG, HOME or ESG geographically. Instead, the state identifies the greatest needs for the s tate and nonentitlement areas overall and this information is used to guide the funding priorities for each program year. For local needs, the s tate relies on the information presented in block grant program funding applications. OCRA CDBG scoring criteria consider community distress factors . The factors used in the Community Distress factor calculation inclu de: Percentage of Households with Income under Poverty Level Median Household Income Percent of Housing Units that are Vacant Median Home Value Unemployment Rate Labor Force Participation IHCDA includes a preference for application s that attempt to reach low- and very low -income levels of area median income. IHCDA's competitive HOME Rental Round and rolling HOME B uyer Round are open for projects located within non -participating jurisdictions . NHTF may be used throughout the state; HO ME requested with NHTF to development supportive housing and associated with the PSH Institute may be used in Participating Jurisdictions . ESG allocates emergency shelter and rapid re -housing activities statewide; homeless prevention and outreach activiti es are more targeted geographically. IHCDA has created caps for each of these categories to focus funding on housing individuals. ESG sub -recipients are selected through a Request for Proposals process each year. Submitted applicants are scored based on ca pacity, compliance, and proposed activities. These are then reviewed by IHCDA staff and the CoC BoS board for recommendations to the IHCDA board for final approval. The HOPWA grant does rely on a geographic allocation. Within the State of Indiana there are 12 HIV Care Coordination Regions as established by the Indiana State Department of Health (ISDH) . IHCDA currently provides funding to 7 organization who have consistently applied for funding each year. The application is open to all organization establis hed as a Care Coordination Site. Each HOPWA sponsor is selected by a Request for Qualifications process that solicited applications from the Indiana Department of Health care coordination sites. HOPWA awards were then determined by meeting required thresh olds and then based on their proposed budget needs, proposed activities, current housing needs and the ISDH -published HIV/AIDS epidemiology reports from the previous year. These are then reviewed by IHCDA staff and recommendations are made to the IHCDA boa rd for final approval. CAPER 15 OMB Control No: 2506 -0117 (exp. 06/30/2018) Leveraging Explain how federal funds leveraged additional resources (private, state and local funds), including a description of how matching requirements were satisfied, as well as how any publicly owned land or property located within the jurisdiction that were used to address the needs identified in the plan. HUD reduced HOME match requirements during 2020 by 100% for the State of Indiana due to the impact of the COVID -19 pandemic. HOPWA leverage totaled $ 3.8 million. Primary leverage sources included: Ryan White Housing Assistance funds of $174,161 , Ryan White Other funds of $ 2,144,265 , Continuum of Care funds of $ 44,928, Emergency Solutions Grant funds of $21,000, Other public subsidies of $ 1,029,997, Private funds of $ 362,730, Grantee/Project Sponsor agency cash of $ 11,291, and Resident rent payments by client to private landlords of $ 20,888. HOME requires a match of 25% of the total match received less environmental review costs. IHCDA only counts match however on project which have been closed out in the given PY. Public land was not used to address needs, except for HOME. Land donated consisted of the following match for award HML -016-006: Property 1: Valley House - HML -015-001 451 Progress Street, Brookville, IN Appraised Value: $35,000.00 Fiscal Year Summary - HOME Match 1.

The COVID -19 pandemic continued to complicate deployment of block grant funds. The state's priorities shifted to emergency assistance for residents and businesses affected by the pandemic. On the housing development side, construction activity slowed due to challenges with the supply chain, and increases in construction costs, which led to revised budgets and additional funding requests. On the administrative side, converting staff to a work -from -home environment delayed training and complicated compliance and monitoring of projects, many of which are required to be done onsite. Finally, the limited capacity of CHDOs , particularly in rural areas, delayed deployment of funds as existing CHDOs had little capacity to take on new projects to address growing affordable housing needs. CAPER 21 OMB Control No: 2506 -0117 (exp. 06/30/2018) Discuss how these outcomes will impact future annual action plans. As state staff have focused on responding to needs arising from the pandemic, deployment of regular block grant funding rounds ha s been delayed. Due to the prioritization of CARES Act/CV funds , the limited capacity of providers, and delays in construction, non -CV funds will take longer to deploy and will carry forward into future program years . IHCDA recognizes that additional funds are needed to support CHDO operations and has raised the amount CHDOs can receive for HOME projects to $1.5 million . IHCDA is also evaluating the longer- term impacts of increased costs of construction and growing need s for affordable housing as the economic impacts of COVID -19 become more significant.

CAPER OMB Control No: 2506 IHCDA Board approved projects PY2020 were targeted toward assisting low income households: 25.4% percent are expected to serve households below 30 percent AMI once complete; 37.3% percent, 31-51% AMI households; and the remaining 37.3%, 51 -60% AMI households. These developments will provide housing for 60 senior households; 9 households with special needs residents; and 66 family households. According to the HTF Activity Status Report ( PR100) , IHCDA committed NHTF funding to 7 projects during the program year, totalling $ 6,490,560. Of that, $ 820,823 was drawn. Since program inception , IHCDA has awarded 1 7 NHTF projects, committing $ 12,927,620 in HTF (not including funds set -aside for administ ration). Of that commitment, $ 5,534,000 has been drawn , for an expenditure rate of 40 %\u2014up significantly from 27% in PY19 . HOPWA dollars benefitted 307 extremely low income households, 132 very low income households, and 46 moderate income households. Efforts to address worst case housing needs Worst case needs during PY20 included: 1) Risks of eviction and foreclosure and homelessness from job losses related to the pandemic, 2) Risks of business closures and job losses related to the pandemic, and 3) Declining health, both physical and mental, of residents. The state prioritized use of CARES/CV funds to address these needs. CDBG dollars shifted from economic development activities to business assistance and public services. More than $20 million dollars was committed to business assistance and $1.7 million to public services. ESG-CV funds provided a considerable impact on homeless prevention, with nearly $10 million dollars available for rental assistance. CAPER 23 No: 2506 -0117 (exp. 91.320(d, e); 91.520(c) Evaluate the jurisdiction's progress in meeting its specific objectives for reducing and ending homelessness through: Reaching out to homeless persons (especially unsheltered persons) and assessing their individual needs The state relies on its partners to conduct outreach to persons who are homeless, assess their needs and communicate these needs to the state. To that end, during the program year, the s tate: Required all HUD McKinney Vento Funded programs to utilize HMIS for all shelter or transitional housing or permanent supportive housing programs serving homeless individuals and families. Required all HUD McKinney Vento Funded programs to participate in the annual, statewi de homeless Point -in-Time Count in late January and timely submission of this data to IHCDA. Required all HUD McKinney Vento Funded programs subrecipients actively participate in their Regional Planning Council on the Homeless meetings regularly (minimum 7 5% attendance). Required all HUD McKinney Vento Funded programs to participate in the Coordinated Access in their Region as it is implemented in their area. These requirements will continue into current and future program years. Addressing the emergency s helter and transitional housing needs of homeless persons The state relies on data and its partners to address the emergency shelter needs. In PY20 , there were 5 street outreach programs funded with ESG; 5 2 emergency shelter programs funded; and 1 3 rapid rehousing projects funded. No transitional housing projects were funded. IHCDA was also awarded over $30 million in ESG- CV funds starting in January 2020. These funds addressed the need for homeless shelters to be improved or updated to meet the high need. These organizations were all required to participate in the P oint In Time (PIT) count and H ousing Inventory Chart (HIC) process. The HIC in particular helped the state understand the need for sheltering homeless persons. The involvement in this data colle ction ensures the needs of individuals served by these funds are counted. IHCDA then uses the results of the PIT and HIC to consider strategy on future funding opportunities. In addition to the allocation of ESG funds, homeless, emergency shelter , and transitional housing needs were addressed through the ESG funded organization's participation in their local Regional Planning Council on Homeless in their Region. This communication allows for on the ground information to be shared in real time and f or organizations who address these needs to work together. In addition, the CoC Board committees have been updated and ESG is part of the work of each committee in some way or another. IHCDA partners closely with the CoC board around their ESG funds and s ub-recipient results. CAPER 24 OMB Control No: 2506 -0117 (exp. 06/30/2018) strategies of that board help inform IHCDA's work with ESG funding. The strategic objectives of the CoC Board are: Decrease shelter stays by increasing rapid rehousing to stable housing. Reduce recidivism of households experiencin g homelessness. Decrease the number of Veterans experiencing homelessness. Decrease the number of persons experiencing Chronic Homelessness. Create new permanent supportive housing beds for chronically homeless persons. Increase the percentage of participa nts remaining in CoC funded permanent housing projects for at least six months to 86 % or more. Decrease the number of homeless households with children. Increase the number of rental assistance programs and services. Increase the percentage of participants in ESG -funded rental assistance programs that move into permanent housing to 82 % or more. Increase the percentage of participants in all CoC funded transitional housing that move into permanent housing to 70 percent or more. Increase the% age of participan ts in CoC funded projects that are employed at exit to 38 % or higher. Increase persons experiencing homelessness access to mainstream resources. Collaborate with local education agencies to assist in the identification of homeless families and inform them of their eligibility for McKinney -Vento education services. Improve homeless outreach and coordinated access to housing and services. Improve HMIS data quality and coverage, and use data to develop strategies and policies to end homelessness. Develop effec tive discharge plans and programs for individuals leaving State Operated Facilities at risk of homelessness. These actions and strategies will continue into the future. Moreover, the CoC has DV Bonus Funds that allow for domestic violence survivors to be prioritized with housing. A portion of these funds were TH - RRH funds to assist with DV suvivor transitional h ousing. These funds will continue to be allocated across the balance of state. The CoC Board and IHCDA staff are currently working on updating their strategic plan. This plan will be finalized through a retreat and planning process in October 2021. This process was pushed back due to the pandemic. A report should be finalized in the winter of 2021 with the plan beginning in January 2022.. This update will create clear metrics and goals to communicate how the State will further focus and address the needs of individuals and families currently and potentially experiencing homelessness. The most recent overview of initiatives can be found here: https://www.in.gov/ihcda/indiana and families avoid becoming homeless, especially OMB Control No: 2506 -0117 (exp. 06/30/2018) low-income individuals and families and those who are: likely to become homeless after being discharged from publicly funded institutions and systems of care (such as health care facilities, mental health facilities, foster care and other youth facilities, and corrections programs and institutions); and, receiving assistance from public or private agencies that address housing, health, social services, employment, education, or youth needs The state has worked to assist extremely low income individuals and families avoid homelessness. Outreach and partnerships across the state continue to be a method for coordinating care. This is primarily done through the IHCDA staff connections as well as the CoC Board of Directors and network. Over the past year, the Community Services team at IHCDA created a program to assist those on the verage of homelessness and bolstered their relationships with other statewide entities to impact low income families and those who are likely to become homeless. The new rental assistance program was created to assist in homeless prevention for low income families and individuals affected by COVID -19. These funds were funnelled through the ESG -CV award where IHCDA use d homeless prevention dollars to offer rental assistance to those on the verge of eviction. Through recruitment of new CoC BoS board members, IHCDA has a variety of new connections that have helped with this. There are now representatives from the state F amily and Social Service Agency (FSSA) and their division of Mental Health and Addiction, Foster Success (an organization for those aging out of foster care), the Institute for Working Families, the Corporation for Supportive Housing (CSH), and with the Pu rdue University Military Family Research Institute. Through the BoS CoC committees, IHCDA now has partnerships with Foster USA (an Evansville based foster care organization), the Indiana Department of Veterans Affairs, and with the South Bend Youth Servic e Board. Other outreach efforts have been made to expand additional resources and benefits. State partnerships continue to grow with the Indiana Department of Workforce Development, Family Social Services Authority, Indiana Commission for Higher Educatio n, the Department of Corrections (DoC), and the Indiana State Department of Health. The Director of Community Services continues to coordinate with that agency to plan for those transitioning out of incarceration. During the shut down, she instructed DOC s taff on how to assist individuals who were positives with COVID -19 and in need of shelter after leaving incarceration. She also introduced them to the HIC to help them understand the type of beds and where they are available. IHCDA also strengthened a relationship with FSSA to offer isolation shelter to individuals/families experiencing homelessness who needed a place to quarantine after a positive COVID -19 test. Lastly, they created a relationship with ISDH to educate that agency on the needs of individual s experiencing homelessness during a pandemic. ISDH also helped educate regional chairs and funded organizations on best practices to keep their clients safe and housed. IHCDA continue this education to other external partners on their efforts through out the pandemic and around the homelessness arena. This included the Primary Care Association of Indiana which educates and coordinates local health care organizations including Federally Qualified Health Clinics (FQHCs). Looking ahead, IHCDA is shifting the Community Services division to align more fully under the new Deputy Executive of Programs. This means coordination with CSBG and LIHEAP funding which will help meet the CAPER 26 OMB Control No: 2506 -0117 (exp. 06/30/2018) needs of additional low income individuals and families. Helping homeless persons (es pecially chronically homeless individuals and families, families with children, veterans and their families, and unaccompanied youth) make the transition to permanent housing and independent living, including shortening the period of time that individuals and families experience homelessness, facilitating access for homeless individuals and families to affordable housing units, and preventing individuals and families who were recently homeless from becoming homeless again The state has several avenues to address helping homeless persons make the transition to permanent house including shortening the time families and individuals experience homelessness. They do so through funding and partnership opportunities to assist those ser ving the homeless population on the ground. These were strengthened in the last year and will continue to grow in the future through the revamped strategic plan. To decrease the amount of time individuals and families experience homelessness, the s tate has several funding sources to assist in that area. The state provides TANF block grant dollars as well as ESG funds to rapidly rehouse individuals and families with the TANF funds specifically targeting families. Rapid re - housing activities include housing r elocation and stabilization services and financial assistance with rent, utilities, arrears, and deposits. The function of these funds is to provide short -term assistance to individuals and families. The state offers shelters a version of RRH that did not include rental assistance, and instead covers one time assistance to support a direct connection from shelter to permanent housing including housing relocation and stabilization services, utilities, arrears, and deposits. IHCDA continued to improve knowled ge of sub -recipients in implementing Rapid Re -housing and Prevention services in their communities through an all- day training symposium on RRH and HMIS training about the new data elements to collect and analyze. To move individuals towards more permanent housing and independent living, the state has funding and resources to provide to organizations. The state offers a permanent support housing institute that builds PSH units across the state. Through the Housing Choice Voucher program, IHCDA has a set asi de of \"Moving On\" section 8 vouchers for those currently in supportive housing who can move on to a more traditional housing choice voucher. Additionally, through the Emergency Housing Voucher (EHV) program, IHCDA coordinated the required use of Coordinated Entry (CE) for referrals to public housing authorities (PHA). They are also working through a partnership to support individuals with the vouchers at Community Mental Health Centers (CMHCs). IHCDA is also are the collaborative applicant for the CoC P SH funds that are awarded to organizations across the balance of state. The state works across its division and in conjunction with the CoC board to create strategy for moving individuals and families out of homelessness. In addition, resources have been b uilt and will continue to be built to provide individuals and families the resources they need to move on from homelessness. A persistent barrier to the transition to permanent housing is lack of employment. This remains especially difficult in rural areas . Lack of affordable housing availability CAPER 27 OMB Control No: 2506 -0117 (exp. 06/30/2018) continues to be a key factor in extended lengths of stay in shelter while the housing search is in process. Another issue in housing stock is the ability to match individuals off the Coordinated Entry list. IHCDA has improved relationship with the Department of Workforce development, the Indiana Commission for Higher Education, and with the HOME team at IHCDA to combat these issues. For the challenges of Coordinated Entry, IHCDA has hired a CE Manager who is working to overhaul the system including the assessment tool. These and other challenges should also be addressed through the 2022 strategic plan with the CoC BoS board that should be made available in late 2021. CAPER 28 OMB Control Public Housing 91.220(h); 91.320(j) Actions taken to address the needs of public housing IHCDA is a Section 8 public housing authority (PHA) and serves Housing Choice Voucher holders in many of the state's rural areas. IHCDA is a high performing PHA. IHCDA does not maintain public housing devel opments and, as such, its public housing needs are unlike a PHA that maintains an inventory of housing units. Per 24 CFR 92.214 (a)(4), HOME funds may not be invested in public housing projects. HOME dollars can be used by nonprofits that partner with PHAs , and rental tax credits can be awarded to PHAs. However, IHCDA does not currently give PHAs preferences in rental tax credit awards. IHCDA has provided capital funding through bond issuances and the 4% RHTC program for Public Housing properties around the state that underwent a RAD conversion and required capital investment to preserve the asset. IHCDA's mission includes maintaining affordability for Hoosiers and IHCDA will continue to support Public Housing that is scheduled for RAD conversion and require s capital investment. Actions taken to encourage public housing residents to become more involved in management and participate in homeownership N/A; the state does not own or operate public housing developments, nor does IHCDA have a practice of providing assistance to troubled PHAs. Per 24 CFR 92.214 (a)(4), HOME funds may not be invested in public housing projects. HOME dollars can be used by nonprofits that partner with PHAs, and rental tax credits can be awarded to PHAs. However, IHCDA does not currently give PHAs preferences in rental tax credit awards. Within the HCV program IHCDA partners with local community action programs around the state to offer services to HCV participants that help build skills and assets to promote self- sufficiency. Actions taken to provide assistance to troubled PHAs (j) Actions taken to remove or ameliorate the negative effects of public policies that serve as barriers to affordable housing such a s land use controls, tax policies affecting land, zoning ordinances, building codes, fees and charges, growth limitations, and policies affecting the return on residential investment. 91.220 (j); 91.320 (i) The state consistently evaluates barriers to affo rdable housing development \u2014including public policies, land use and zoning regulations, and program delivery. OCRA routintely conducts stakeholder outreach about how its programs can best respond to the most pressing needs of nonentitlement communities. Before the pandemic , and to inform funding and programs for its new five -year Consolidated Plan, OCRA held two webinars and three focus groups with stakeholders to discuss: 1) Modifying the Main Street program to maximize impact through density and organizational capacity; 2) Merging the Wastewater Drinking Water Program and Stormwater Improvement Programs and modifying the point system for awards; and 3) Creating a new Needs Response fund. Following that round of input, and as the effects of the COV ID-19 pandemic became clear, OCRA modified its proposed allocation to address business and economic recovery needs. These discussions raised few concerns about public policies and land use or zoning regulations. Barriers that have been identified by stakeholders concern private practices such as tenant screening requirements (which adversely affect persons with disabilities, voucher holders, residents with criminal histories or substance abuse challenges , and people of color); lack of fair housing knowledg e among small landlords ; and predatory lending products that are disproportionately targeted to persons of color. The State is updating its Analysis of Impediments in PY21 and will evaluate negative effects of public policies including land use controls, tax policies affecting land use, state -prescribed zoning codes, building codes, and other state regulations. Actions taken to address obstacles to meeting underserved needs. 91.220(k); 91.320(j) The state has primarily addressed underserved needs by focusing on getting money into local communities faster. The pandemic has elevated the importance of this strategy. OCRA has streamlined the grant application process to move CDBG more quickly into communities and make the grants more impactful. These changes include: Changing the information OCRA requests when a community applies for funding, helping to define the scope of a proposed project and the technical assistance needed, which allows communities to make adjustments and increas e their application's competitiveness; Implementing a new GMS to better assess data and process applications; Quickly pivoting with the pandemic to meet the needs related to the response; and Reallocating funds to ensure obligation and expenditure rates. CAPER 30 OMB Control No: 2506 -0117 (exp. 06/30/2018) To address limited capacity to respond to affordable housing needs in nonentitlement areas \u2014which is made more severe in the pandemic \u2014IHCDA has recently implemented several efforts to support local affordable housing development. IHCDA has also continued to allow for HOME awards of up to $1 million for non -CHDO projects and has increased the subsidy/unit limits to allow for more applications that would not be financially feasible other wise. For non -profit partners certifying as CHDOs, IHCDA has changed th e policy to allow for those entities to do a \"pre- qualification .\" If the entity meets the CHDO requirement, they may apply for up to $1.5 million of HOME. IHCDA has been able to award more CHDO projects through this effort. Per the HUD memo on statutory suspensions and regulatory waivers , IHCDA increased the amount of CHDO operating funding from 5 % to 10 %. Non -profits and CHDOs interviewed in August 2020 as part of the Rural Road to Recovery Plan discussed the need for additional administration funding to assist with changes in how their services were conducted due to COVID -19. IHCDA amended the 2019 Annual Action Plan HOME Method of Distribution to increase the amount of set -aside funding for CHDO Operating Supplement , and carried this forward in the 2020 Consolidated Plan . On June 29, 2020, IHCDA began accepting supplemental funding applications for eligible CHDOs to request up to $50,000 in CHDO Operating Supplement. Before the pandemic, IHCDA ha d established the CHDO Working Group \u2014a group of eight CHDO across the State of Indiana to discuss successes and challenges with the HOME Program, and to provide peer - to-peer support on non -profit capacity building. IHCDA temporarily suspended the in -persons meetings of the CHDO Working G roup in March of 2020; in lieu of these meetings, IHCDA held bi- weekly listening sessions for all HOME Administrators and CHDOs to better understand and discuss the needs of partners through COVID. IHCDA has also continued its relationship with CSH to pro vide its 11th iteration of the Supportive Housing Institute. For ESG, six outreach programs were funded. In the regions in which these programs operate, a concerted and consistent effort is made to reach the most vulnerable and underserved persons experiencing homelessness. Also, IHCDA continues to work with the state- wide PATH projects for additional street outreach to reach those underserved and hardest to serve. For HOPWA, each of the seven subrecipients provides Housing information to reach those who might not know about HOPWA funding. CAPER 31 OMB Control No: 2506 -0117 (exp. to reduce lead- based paint hazards. 91.220(k); 91.320(j) Actions taken to reduce exposure to lead -based paint have been led by IHCDA and have taken the form of increasing capacity to identify and mitigate lead paint hazards and providing funding for abatement activities. IHCDA has used HOME funds for 8-hour RRP EPA lead training in collaboration with the Indiana Builders Association . Attendees successfully passed the course exam and h ands -on training to become certified as a renovator by the U.S. EPA to supervise and perform renovation, repair, and painting activities in target housing and child -occupied facilities. IHCDA created a contractor reimbursement policy designed to increase the number of licensed lead abatement professionals throughout the state who can perform lead abatement activities and participate in its LHRD program and other lead abatement programs. IHCDA will reimburse eligible firms or organizations for eligible training costs related to lead abatement courses for which their employee(s) register, complete, pass (from an approved Indiana State Health Department (ISDH) -accredited training facility) , and receive a license. IHCDA, in conjunction with the Indiana State He alth Department, created the Lead Protection Program (LPP). The Lead Protection Program 's mission is to collaborate and effectively administer state efforts of three lead programs operating simultaneously throughout the State of Indiana. Other members incl ude the Indiana Community Action Association and the Environmental Management Institute. IHCDA staff joined the Healthy Homes Alliance and Lead Advisory Council to discuss lead programs and offer guidance to these working groups seeking to make a positive impact on elimination of lead -based paint poisoning. IHCDA conducted two technical assistance webinars for CDBG award administrators. IHCDA also developed a webpage dedicated to providing information on three lead programs operating throughout the State of Indiana. IHCDA partnered with the Indiana Community Action Association (INCAA) to administer the Lead Community Action Program. Using CDBG -D funds, this program is specific to rural communities throughout Indiana and pre -1978 owner occupied housing wi th lead -based paint hazards. Eligible households must have an income at or below 80 % AMI; the home must be constructed prior to January 1, 1978; or a child under the age of six that must reside or frequently visits the home. Households with a child under the age of six with a confirmed elevated blood lead level is the highest priority. INCAA has contracted with five sub -recipients who administer the program in 18 counties throughout the State of Indiana. IHCDA continued the a dministration through four subrecipients and sought other local -units 32 OMB No: 2506 -0117 (exp. 06/30/2018) government or non -profits within the State of Indiana as part of the Lead Hazard Reduction Demonstration Grant (LHRD). Actions taken to reduce the number of poverty -level families. 9 1.220(k); 91.320(j) During PY20 , the state continued to focus on distribution of funds to address immediate needs related to the COVID pandemic. Funds were distributed in three phases. Phase 1 allocated funds to small businesses to keep LMI workers employed; to create Wi -Fi hotspots to facilitate e -learning, submit unemployment applications, and submit job applications, and distribute essential supplies. Phase 2 was entirely dedicated to grants and loans to retain LMI jobs with eligible activities of working capital, continuing operations , and supporting remote work. On August 27, 2020 OCRA awarded an additional 42 rural Hoosier communities more than $10.09 million in federal grant during Phase 2. In total, OCRA awarded 112 grants to 62 communities, totalin g more than $20.9 million through the COVID -19 Response Program (Phase 1 & 2). On Dec. 7, 2020, OCRA announced a third phase of COVID -19 Response Program was open for applications. For this round, eligible applicants included non -entitlement and entitlement local units of government who could apply for up to $250,000 in grant funding. The eligible activities included: mental health services childcare services, public WiFi locations, food pantry or bank services, or grants or loans to businesses to retain low -to-moderate (LMI) jobs. On April 18, 2021, OCRA awarded $18.6 million in federal grant funding through OCRA's COVID -19 Response Grant Program to 80 communities. ESG funds shifted to emphasize housing stability through tenant based rental programs. IHCDA continued to include several program adjustments to more directly target funds to benefit poverty -level families: IHCDA has added an Opportunity Index to incentive the construction of HOME projects in areas with public transit, low unemployment, high job growth, low poverty rate, and higher household income. IHCDA utilized a scoring category on Health and Quality of Life Factors to incentive HOME developments near primary care physicians, fresh produce, and proximity to positive land uses. IHCDA has eliminated the lien requirement for the CDBG program, to allow more persons to be interested in the program. IHCDA has also eliminated the CDBG OOR match requirements so CAPER 33 OMB Control No: 2506 -0117 (exp. 06/30/2018) communities who may not have the match resources can still apply for the program. As part of the allowed COVID waivers through HUD, IHCDA has also waived match requirements for HOME projects. The state also continued to utilize the Section 3 requirement which applies to employment opportunities generated (jo bs created) as a result of projects receiving CDBG or HOME funding through ORCA or IHCD --whether those opportunities are generated by the award recipient, a subrecipient, and/or a contractor. The requirements of Section 3 apply to all projects or activitie s associated with CDBG or HOME funding, regardless of whether the Section 3 project is fully or partially funded with CDBG/HOME. A detailed description of Section 3 requirements is included in OCRA/IHCDA's award manual. A notice of Section 3 requirements i s included in bid solicitations and is covered during the award trainings. Actions taken to develop institutional structure. 91.220(k); 91.320(j) IHCDA held and sponsored a wide variety of in -person and online trainings through PY20 , including: HOME Rental Compliance (3 sessions in mid -May, 2021). This three -day training provided an in - depth review of HOME compliance topics. The training was free for individuals who work with properties that have IHCDA HOME funding and just $25 for others. Fair Housing for Professionals Rental Housing Tax Credit (RHTC) Property Management \u2014held monthly throughout the program year; both basic and advanced training was offered Rental Housing Tax Credit (RHTC) special topics. CHDO Executive Track in partnership with TDA Consul ting (HUD's HOME TA provider); this track is an intensive 17 week in -person and online course to provide non -profit partners with HOME training and best practices for non -profits. IHCDA used its weekly RED notices to announce training and grant opportuniti es. IHCDA held a specialized training for participants selected for the HOME Innovative Round; due to COVID, the latter half of the training was moved to an online format. . IHCDA has also continued to partner with the National Development Council to provide affordable housing development training, with scholarships available to IHCDA partners. The trainings have shifted to an online format. IHCDA continued to bolster training and technical assistance of potential and current subrecipients through its support of the Indiana Permanent Supportive Housing Institute through its longstanding partnership with CSH.. Teams receive over 80 hours of training, including individualized technical assistance and resources to assist in completing their projects. Industry experts provided insight on property management, financing , and building design. CAPER (exp. continued to be required to create MOUs with all shelter providers, housing agencies, supportive service , and health care providers , and to provide a coordinated access point for housing and service deliv ery. Actions taken to enhance coordination between public and private housing and social service agencies. 91.220(k); 91.320(j) During PY19, OCRA shifted its outreach to public and private partners to a virtual format In May of 2021, as COVID -19 vaccines became more widely available and the CDC's guidance for in person interactions was updated, OCRA staff began to strategically meet with communities again in person. These regional workshops and interactions are a vital part of OCRA's ability to enhance coordination with key stakeholder groups and to provide technical assistance on CDBG funded programs. They will continue virtually and in person throughout this program year and in future program years. The format for IMS Community Exchanges was revised in PY 2020 to continue engaging Main Street communities on the topics indicated. In fall 2020, OCRA began hosting bi- monthly regional calls. Every other month, each region convenes on a conference call to give updates on local activities and to network with other Main Streets in their area. It is an expectation, as a designee of IMS, that one representative from each local program join and participate when scheduling and time allows. The schedule for these regional meetings is: Northeast: Every second Wednes day of every other month starting January 13 Northwest: Every third Thursday of every other month starting January 20 East Central: Every fourth Wednesday of every other month starting January 27 West Central: Every second Wednesday of every other month starting February 10 Southeast: Every third Thursday of every other month starting February 17 Southwest: Every fourth Wednesday of every other month starting February 24 An IMS Facebook Group was created for Main Street Communities in PY2020 to share succe ss stories, shared challenges, recent innovations and new local initiatives. Partner profiles highlighting statewide resources and opportunities for Main Street organizations are also featured. The Great Lakes Main Street Conference was launched by OCRA in PY2019. The conference was created as a way to convene leaders in downtown and historic commercial district revitalization from all over the Great Lakes region. Through the conference, OCRA aims to highlight asset -based strategies for community and economic development. In PY2020, the GLMSC was held virtually. The conference included over ten breakout sessions, three plenary sessions and networking events. Downtown Development Week has not been reinstated in PY2020 due t ongoing restrictions relate d to COVID -19. OCRA will continued to evaluate its ability to reinstate this event in PY2021. CAPER 35 OMB Control No: 2506 -0117 (exp. 06/30/2018) IHCDA's programs have focused in building institutional structure and are summarized above. IHCDA has also established a strong relationship with the Family and Social Services Administration (FSSA) to coordinate affordable assisted living rental housing production and housing for persons with intellectual or developmental disabilities, or persons who have a chemical addiction. Identify actions taken to overcome the effects of any impediments identified in the jurisdictions analysis of impediments to fair housing choice. 91.520(a) OCRA activities. In FY2020, OCRA began investigating the possibility of creating a program to support the opening of two add itional fair housing centers in Indiana. OCRA will begin by mapping out potential locations to determine where there is the most interest and need for a new fair housing center. This will include a new location in both Southern and Northern Indiana. This effort included meetings with representatives from the Fair Housing Center of Indiana to learn more about current needs and challenges related to fair housing choice. OCRA wants new fair housing centers to be established with enough resources and fundin g to be sustainable. OCRA also continued funding for fair housing education and outreach. OCRA's support of the Fair Housing Center of Central Indiana (FHCCI) resulted in 21 virtual fair housing trainings, which had more than 1,070 registrants and 686 verified participants. The trainings had an overall average evaluation score of 4.85 out of 5.0. The FHCCI is the only fair housing nonprofit advocacy organization in all of Indiana. OCRA's support helps leverage FHCCI's fair housing outreach and education in itiative grants from HUD. Each Fair Housing Rental Basics Training was 120 minutes in length and focused on the following topic areas: Overview of fair housing laws (rental focus), Major fair housing regulations and guidance, Advertising requirements, and Overview of disability specific regulations. Each Fair Housing Disability Training was 120 minutes in length and focused on the following topic areas: Overview of fair housing laws; Disability specific fair housing regulations including reasonable accommodations, reasonable modifications, and design and construction accessibility requirements; and Common questions related to animals as reasonable accommodation. Each Fair Housing 90 Training was 90 minutes in length and was used to be a more in -depth training focusing on a particular fair housing topic that built on the Fair Housing Basics Training. Agendas varied due to the topics discussed. IHCDA activities. During the first part of the program year, IHCDA partnered with the Fair Housing Center of Central Indiana to provide 19 free fair housing training from September 2020 through CAPER 36 OMB Control No: 2506 -0117 (exp. 06/30/2018) February 2021 . These training sessions covered a basic overview of fair housing laws along with a variety of other specific topics related to rental hous ing regulations.

This training provided an in -depth review of fair housing laws and compliance topics including: reasonable accommodations/modifications, recreational drug policies, anti- harrassme nt policies, and language barriers and accommodating Limited English Proficiency populations. IHCDA also partnered with the Indiana Civil Rights Commission to conduct paired testing at HOME - funded rental projects across the state to determine if there wer e any fair housing violations . In addi tion to the paired tes ting, ICRC does intake and reports any constituent complaints regarding poten tial fair housing viola tions at any IHCDA funded projects (RHTC and CDBG). If there are complaints, ICRC will work with IHCDA to ensure we follow up with Property Owners and that recipients of IHCDA funding have a good understanding of fair housing laws. These complaints are also documented in an annual report that is submi tted to IHCDA. Any property where there are verified concerns will be placed on a list to retest to ensure there are no further acts of discrimination . CAPER 37 OMB Monitoring 91.220 and 91.230 Describe the standards and procedures used to monitor activities carried out in furtherance of the plan and used to ensure long -term compliance with requirements of the programs involved, including minority business outreach and the comprehensive planning requirements CDBG Monitoring . OCRA conducts a monitoring of every grant project receiving HUD funds. Two basic types of monitoring are used: off- site or \"desk\" monitoring and on -site monitoring. Desk monitoring is conducted by staff for non -construction projects. On -site monitoring is a structured review conducted by OCRA staff at the locations where project activities are being carried out or project records are being maintained. During the pandemic, OCRA chose to conduct all monitorings off site in order to ensure the safety of staff and recipients. OCRA will cont inue to evaluate this practice utilizing county -level data on COVID outbreaks to determine when on -site monitorings will be reinstituted. OCRA evaluates recipients' and subrecipients' employment practices in order to determine whether or not EEOC guidelines are followed in advertising vacancies . The state's field monitors review recipients' civil rights files to determine if there have been any EEO complaints filed against a recipient within five years. The field monitors also review records of complaints and responses regarding alleged discrimination in the provision of program benefits. IHCDA Monitoring . IHCDA conducts at least one monitoring of every grant project receiving CDBG and HOME funds. The recipient must ensure that all records relating to the award are available at IHCDA's monitoring. For those projects determined to need special attention, IHCDA may conduct one or more monitoring visits while award activities are in full progress . Two basic types of monitoring are used: on - site monitoring and desk -top monitoring. ESG uses a combinati on of reports from HMIS and onsite visits. Annually, subrecipients outcomes are evaluated. Outcomes include: ESG rental assistance program sub -recipients -- at discharge from program, 70 % of persons assisted will still be permanently housing. Sixty percent of persons will increase or maintain their income. Emergency shelter operations, essential services and financial assistance: 56 % of persons will discharge to permanent housing, 55% of persons ' income will increase or maintain their income. Transitional Ho using preparations, essential services and financial assistance --75% will discharge to permanent housing, 60 % will increase or maintain their income. Outreach --50% of identified caseload will exit to a positive housing solution and 40 % of identified caselo ad will increase their income. HOPWA. Consistent with HUD requirements, 50 % of IHCDA's HOPWA programs are monitored annually. If there are any findings or concerns from the monitoring, the subrecipient has 30 days from monitoring date to respond with corre ctions or action plans. CAPER 38 OMB (exp. 06/30/2018) Citizen Participation Plan 91.105(d); 91.115(d) Describe the efforts to provide citizens with reasonable notice and an opportunity to comment on performance reports . Public notices about the comment period of the Draft CAPER were posted September 1, 2021 on agency websites and circulated through e -newsletters. A copy of the notice announcing the availability of the CAPER for public review is appended to this section. T he notice contained both English and Spanish. The CAPER was available for public inspection and members of the public, including low and moderate income persons, were encouraged to review the CAPER online at www.in.gov/ocra from September 15 through Septe mber 28, 2021. Residents were able to mail, email or verbally (via a toll- free number) communicate comments on the - CDBG 91.520(c) Specify the nature of, and reasons for, any changes in the jurisdiction's program objectives and indications of how the jurisdiction would change its programs as a result of its experiences. Due to the COVID -19 pandemic, a portion of the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) funding in PY20 was utilized for economic development purposes, under the COVID -19 Response Program. Specifically, the funds are being used to help support small businesses and retain low to moderate income (LMI) jobs. OCRA suspended its regular programs to redistribute funding towards the COVID -19 response. This included: In 2020, the Main Street Revitalization Program (MSRP) was suspended to re -allocate the funds toward the COVID -19 Response Program; OOR Program (IHCDA): Discontinued; OCRA is conducting a pilot to determine the feasibility of an OCRA administered OOR program ; Stellar Regions Program: Suspended due to COVID -19 Public Facilities Program (PFP): Suspended due to COVID -19 OCRA continued to use FY 2019 Scoring Criteria for FY 2020 grant rounds due to impacts related to the covid -19 pandemic. Based on addition al research and community feedback, OCRA was able to open Phase 2 and 3 to municipalities of all sizes. Other protocols in place for Phase 2 and Phase 3 were: Phase 2 Eligible applicants for Phase 2 of the COVID -19 Response Program included non - entitlement local units of government. Phase 2 was a competitive process with more information requested up -front to reduce after award administration. The two eligible economic recovery activities included grants or loans to businesses to retain low -to-moderate (LMI) jobs. Phase 3 Eligible applicants for Phase 3 of the COVID -19 Response Program included non - entitlement local units of government. Phase 3 was a competitive proc ess with more information requested up -front to reduce after award administration. Eligible activities were: mental health services, childcare services, public WiFi locations, food pantry or bank services, or grants or loans to businesses to retain low -to-moderate (LMI) jobs. Activities were expanded to broaden the impact of the funds for communities with ongoing needs related to COVID -19. CAPER 40 OMB Control No: 2506 -0117 (exp. 06/30/2018) Does this Jurisdiction have Economic Development Initiative (BEDI) grants? No. [BEDI grantees] Describe accomplishments and program outcomes during the last year. N/A CAPER 41 OMB HOME 91.520(d) Include the results of on -site inspections of affordable rental housing assisted under the program to determine compliance with housing codes and other applica ble regulations . Please list those projects that should have been inspected on- site this program year based upon the schedule in \u00a792.504(d). Indicate which of these were inspected and a summary of issues that were detected during the inspection. For those that were not inspected, please indicate the reason and how you will remedy the situation. During PY20 , 659 HOME -funded units were inspected . Of those inspections, 279 failed the inspection due to condition issue s; these represented 42 % of all units . The most common issues included missing water heater pipes or leaking water heaters ; exposed electrical and loose outlets; defective fire alarms and smoke alarms; broken or missing windows; loose light fixtures; and inoperable garbage disposals . The detai led results of the inspections are appended to this CAPER. Provide an assessment of the jurisdiction's affirmative marketing actions for HOME units. 92.351(b) IHCDA reviews the Affirmative Marketing plans to ensure compliance as applications are submitted and reviewed. IHCDA also reviews the Fair Housing Market Plans during closeout of awards. IHCDA had no findings in FY20 20. According to the HOME Performance Report (PR23), one -third of HOME units completed were occupied by minority households, which exceed s the overall proportion in the state. Recipients of our funding were welcomed to attend any of the nine Fair Housing trainings that were hosted by IHCDA and the Fair Housing Center of Central Indiana. Recipients, property managers, maintenance staff, and the general public were invited to attend this training which covered fair housing laws, what to do to avoid fair housing discrimination, and how to develop a marketing plan that ensures fair housing policies have been met. IHCDA also partnered with the I ndiana Civil Rights Commission to conduct paired testing at our rental HOME funded projects across the state to determine if there were any potential violations of fair housing discrimination. ICRC determines if a formal Executive Initiated Compliant will be filed or if education about fair housing laws is required. In addition to the paired testing, ICRC provides a report any constituent complaints regarding potential fair housing violations at IHCDA funded projects (RHTC, HOME, and CDBG specifically). If there are complaints, ICRC will work with IHCDA to ensure we follow up with Property Owners and recipients of IHCDA funding have a good understanding of fair housing laws. These complaints are also documented in an annual report that is submitted to IHCDA. Any property where there are verified concerns will be placed on a list to retest to ensure there are no further acts of discrimination. All HOME and CDBG award recipients with rental or homebuyer projects containing five or more associated units must cer tify compliance with IHCDA affirmative marketing procedures per the award CAPER 42 OMB Control No: 2506 -0117 (exp. 06/30/2018) agreement. Additionally, the recipient must create an Affirmative Fair Housing Marketing Plan by using the HUD form 935.2A. The plan must be updated at least once every five years or more frequently when there are significant changes in the demographics of the local housing market area as described in the instructions for Part 9 on form. The recipient must identify the population(s) least likely to apply for housing and the outreach/m arketing efforts that will be utilized to reach that population. All CDBG and HOME award recipients are required to post the Fair Housing Opportunity poster at public buildings as evidence of the award recipient's fair housing policy. Also, if a subrecipient is associated with an IHCDA award, the subrecipient must also post the poster in its offices. Finally, if the project involves a public facility or a building with a common area, such as a leasing office, the fair housing poster must be hung c onspicuously at those locations as well. Copies of this poster may be obtained from your IHCDA Real Estate Production Analyst or Compliance Auditor. Award recipients must also include the Fair Housing logo on all client correspondence (confirmation letters , brochures, leases, etc.) This logo is available at the following HUD website: http://portal.hud.gov/hudportal/HUD?src=/library/bookshelf11/hudgraphics/fheologo Award recipients must provide all beneficiaries the HUD brochure entitled \"You May Be A Victim Of...\" Documentation of the client's receipt of the brochure must be maintained in the client's file. Therefore, the award recipient is responsible for creating a receipt form for the beneficiary to sign as receipt of the Fair Housing brochure. Refer to IDIS reports to describe the amount and use of program income for projects, including the number of projects and owner and tenant characteristics During PY20, $3,246,076 in HOME program income was received. from PY19\u2014 none for TBRA As allowed under the HOME program, PI is no longer receipted as it is received. It is held in the PI account and is used for rental projects and TBRA. Owner and t enant characterstics are not available for PI investments. Describe other actions taken to foster and maintain affordable housing. 91.220(k) In Spring of 2020, IHCDA held 22 sets of weekly or bi- weekly listening sessions to identify partners' challenges and opportunities through the COVID -19 pandemic. Following the shutdown, IHCDA worked with the Purdue Center for Regional Development (PCRD) to reach out to stakeholders with a detailed survey building upon the six themes that emerged from the listening se ssions. These themes are: prevention; serving Hoosier families; and partner concerns. The survey invited IHCDA partner agencies to rank their concerns as \"immediate,\" \"with in six months,\" or \"in one to two years.\" More than 100 partner agencies responded, yielding 26 pages of commentary. PCRD analyzed these rankings and partner suggestions, matching them with agency resources and opportunities., IHCDA studied information gat hered through other channels, including interviews and public comments submitted on various agency programs. The combined input from a variety of important stakeholders provide the basis for delineating the priorities and action plans outlined for the sta te's Roadmap to Rural Recovery. Those priorities included: increasing rental assistance during COVID -19; support safe, affordable housing; provide resources for homeowners at risk of foreclosure; offer assistance to non -profits that provide direct services to Hoosiers; and facilitate strategies to address non -housing impacts due to COVID -19. IHCDA and Purdue then did targeted interviews and focus groups in August of 2020 on these identified priorities. (STATES ONLY: Including the coordination of LIHTC wit h the development of affordable housing). 91.320(j) In an effort to streamline the multifamily application process, IHCDA allows developers applying for Rental Housing Tax Credits (RHTCs) or Multifamily Private Activity Tax -Exempt Bonds (Bonds) to simultaneously request funds from the HOME Investment Partnerships Program (HOME). If a developer applies for RHTCs or Bonds for any development and wants to also access HOME funds, the developer completes the HOME Section of the \"Multi -Family Housing Finance Application\" and submit all necessary HOME attachments. HOME attachments ( i.e., Historic Review, Environmental Review, Davis Bacon, Match, URA) must be submitted on or before the application deadline. Outside of this process, applications for HOME financing for a RHTC or Bond development will only be considered in accordance with IHCDA's HOME application criteria. HOME funds cannot be committed to a development until all necessary financing has been secured. In the event that an application is competiti ve for RHTCs or Bonds but either (1) the application fails the HOME threshold review; or (2) HOME funds are not available to award, IHCDA will allow the applicant to submit additional information to identify other ways to fill the development's financing gap. Upon timely receipt of requested information, these applications will continue to be allowed to compete for an allocation of RHTCs or Bonds. If the potential development has an open HOME, Community Development Block Grant (CDBG), or Development Fund aw ard, the applicant may request funding through the QAP; however, applicants must request approval at least 30 days prior to the application deadline and IHCDA must approve this action. Requests will be reviewed and underwritten on a case -by-case basis.

Project Outcomes Data measured under the performance standards developed in consultation with the CoC (s) The Balance of State C of C has established the following performance standards for ESG grantees. ESG program sub -recipients that are emergency shelters are funded for operations, essential services and financial assistance: 50% of persons will discharge to permanent housing, 25 % will increase their income. ESG program sub -recipients that are Transitional Housing programs that have activities: operations, essential services and financial assistance: 69 % will discharge to perman ent housing, 50% will increase their income. ESG rental assistance program sub -recipients: At discharge from program, 82 % persons assisted will still be permanently housed. 65 % of persons will increase their income. ESG program sub -recipients that have outreach component: 50 % of identified caseload will be permanently housed; 50 % identified caseload will increase their income. Based on the Sage report for all subrecipients of ESG in PY2020 , 47% of residents exiting the program had positive housing dest inations \u2014slightly less than the performance standard . Of those: 35% were living in rental units without public subsidies; 25% were renting with an ongoing public subsidy; 20% were living with family with permanent tenure; 8% were living with friends with permanent tenure; 3% were living in public housing; 3% were living in homes they own; The balance were living in housing with other subsidies. Households without positive housing destinations were most likely to living in temporary situations with family or friends or had unknown outcomes. Incomes were also improved : 58% of participants had no income at the beginning of the program and this had declined to 4 9% by the time the program ended. For HOPWA, all of the program year goals were met. CAPER 50 OMB Control No: 2506 Expenditures 11. Expenditures 11a.

HOPWA CAPER ______________________________________________________________________________ Previous editions are 1 form HUD- 40110 -D (Expiration Date: 11/30/2023) OMB Approval No. 2506 -0133 Housing Opportunities for Persons With AIDS (HOPWA) Program Consolidated Annual Performance and Evaluation Report ( CAPER) Measuring Performance Outcomes OMB Number 2506- 0133 (Expiration : 11/30/2023) The CAPER report for HOPWA formula grantees provides annual information on program accomplishments that supports program evaluation and the ability to measure program beneficiary outcomes as related to: maintain housing stability; prevent homelessness; and improve access to care and support. This information is also covered under the Consolidated Plan Management Process (CPMP) report and includes Narrative Responses and Performance Charts required under the Consolidated Planning regulations. Reporting is required for all HOPWA formula grantees. The public reporting burden for the collection of information is estimated to average 41 hours per manual response, or less if an automated data collection and retrieval system is in use, along with 60 hours for re cord keeping, including the time for reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection of information. HUD's requirements for reports submitted by HOPWA formula grantees are supported by 42 U.S.C. . Grantees are required to report on the activities undertaken only, thus there may be components of these reporting requirements that may not be applicable. This agenc y may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required to respond to a collection of information unless that collection displays a valid OMB control number. While confidentiality is not assured, HUD generally only releases this information as required or permitted by law. ______________________________________________________________________________ Previous editions are obsolete Page ii form HUD- 40110 -D (Expiration Date: 11/30/2023) OMB Approval No. 2506 -0133 Overview. The Consolidated Annual Performance and Evaluation Report (CAPER) provide s annual performance reporting on client outputs and outcomes that enables an assessment of grantee performance in achieving the housing stability outcome measure. The CAPER fulfills statutory and regulatory program reporting requirements and provides the grantee and HUD with the necessary information to assess the overall program performance and accomplishments against planned goals and objectives . HOPWA formula grantees are required to submit a CAPER demonstrating coordination with other Consolidated Plan resources. HUD uses the CAPER data to obtain essential information on grant activities, project sponsors, , housing sites, units and households, and beneficiaries (which includes racial and ethnic data on program participants). The Consolidated Plan Mana gement Process tool (CPMP) provides an optional tool to integrate the reporting of HOPWA specific activities with other planning and reporting on Consolidated Plan activities.

Information on Individuals, Beneficiaries and Households Receiving HOPWA Housing Subsidy Assistance (TBRA, STRMU, PHP, Facility Based Units, Master Leased Units ONLY) B. Facility -Based Housing Assistance Continued Use Periods . Grantees that used HOPWA fund ing for new construction, acquisition, or substantial rehabilitation of a building or structure are required to operate the building or structure for HOPWA- eligible beneficiaries for a ten (10) years period. If no further HOPWA funds are used to support the facility, in place of completing Section 7B of the CAPER, the grantee must submit an Annual Report of Continued Project O peration throughout the required use periods. This report is included in Part 6 in CAPER. The required use period is three (3) years if the rehabilitation is non -substantial. Record Keeping. Names and other individual information must be kept confidentia l, as required by 24 CFR 574.440. However, HUD reserves the right to review the information used to complete this report for grants management oversight purposes, except for recording any names and other identifying information. In the case that HUD must review client -level data, no client names or identifying information will be retained or recorded. Information is reported in aggregate to HUD without personal identification. Do not submit client or personal information in data systems to HUD. In connect ion with the development of the Department's standards for Homeless Management Information Systems (HMIS), universal data elements are being collected for clients of HOPWA- funded homeless assistance projects . These project sponsor records would include: Name, Social Security Number, Date of Birth, Ethnicity and Race, Gender, Veteran Status, Disabling Conditions, Residence Prior to Program Entry, Zip Code of Last Permanent Address, Housing Status, Program Ent ry Date, Program Exit Date, Personal Identification Number, and Household Identification Number. These are intended to match the elements under HMIS. The HOPWA program -level data elements include: Income and Sources, Non -Cash Benefits, HIV/AIDS Status, Se rvices Provided, Housing Status or Destination at the end of the operating year , Physical Disability, Developmental Disability, Chronic Health Condition, Mental Health, Substance Abuse, Domestic Violence, Medical Assistance, and T - cell Count . Other HOPWA projects sponsors may also benefit from collecting these data elements. HMIS local data systems must maintain client confidentiality by using a closed system in which medical information and HIV status are only shared with providers that have a direct inv olvement in the client's case management, treatment and care, in line with the signed release of information from the client. Operating Year. HOPWA formula grants are annually awarded for a three -year period of performance with three operating years. The information contained in this CAPER must represent a one -year period of HOPWA program operation that coincides with the grantee's program year; this is the operating year. More than one HOPWA formula grant awarded to the same grantee may be used during an operating year and the CAPER must capture all formula grant funding used during the operating year. Project sponsor accomplishment information must also coincide with the operating year this CAPER covers. Any change to the period of performance requires the approval of HUD by amendment, such as an extension for an additional operating year. Final Assembly of Report. After the entire report is assembled, number each page sequentially. Filing Requirements . Within 90 days of the completion of each program year, grantees must submit their completed CAPER to the CPD Director in the grantee's State or Local HUD Field Office, and to the HOPWA Program Office: at HOPWA@hud.gov . Electronic submission to HOPWA Program office is preferred; however, if electronic submission is not possible, hard copies can be mailed to: Office of HIV/AIDS Housing, Room 72 48, U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, 451 Seventh Street, SW, W ashington, D.C ., 20410. Definitions Adjustment for Duplication: Enables the calculation of unduplicated output totals by accounting for the total number of households or units that received more than one type of HOPWA assistance in a given service category such as HOPWA Subsidy Assistance or Supportive Services.

Direct Emergency Financial Assistance (DEFA) - This program helps eligible clients pay for their initial doctor visits, lab fees , and medications until they are eligible for other assistance programs. Client Emergency Assistance Program - Established several years ago, the client emergency fund provides persons living with HIV/AIDS with financial assistance not covered under HOPWA , food and nutrition, and emergency medical assistance. Support Groups - Positive Resource Connection provides support groups on a weekly or monthly basis for persons living with HIV/AIDS, friends and family members of HIV -positive persons, and Spanish- speaking HIV -positive persons and their families. MAC Food Program - The MAC Food Program is designed for individuals with a low CD4 cell count, an opportunistic infection, an AIDS diagnosis, or for people who may be at risk of wasting. The MAC program is a food delivery program that provides eligible individuals with at least half of the monthly calorie requirements to maintain or gai n weight. Special Population Support Program (SPSP) - This program is available to anyone who is HIV+ (you do not have to be a client of Positive Resource Connection) and is interested in exploring options to reduce or cease their substance use/abuse. Outreach staff take a team approach to reducing the number of new HIV infections that occur in northeast Indiana each year. To meet the need for prevention in our community, the Positive Resource Connection has several programs available: HIV/STD prevention and education; HIV testing and harm reduction counseling; youth education and empowerment; pre -exposure prophylaxi s (PrEP); street outreach; and general awareness. All of these programs are free of charge to the public.\" \"Positive Link exists to work with our community to end the HIV epidemic in Indiana by providing prevention, care, and support services. Positive Li nk provides a full continuum of HIV services, including outreach education and testing, health screenings, care coordination, medical care, nutrition programming, transportation assistance, homeless prevention, housing programs and emergency financial assi stance. Services are provided in a 49 -county region of Indiana with 21 counties receiving HOPWA assistance (10 counties - HOPWA IHCDA [Monroe, Lawrence, Bartholomew, Greene, Owen, Clay, Sullivan, Vigo, Parke and Vermillion] and 11 counties - HOPWA City of Indianapolis [Brown, Morgan, Johnson, Shelby, Hancock, Marion, Hendricks, Putnam, Boone, Hamilton, Madison]). Positive Link strives to include and prioritize the rural counties to facilitate statewide access to HOPWA assistance and care. Positive Link prov ides rental assistance and supportive services to at -risk, homeless, and low -income persons impacted by HIV and their families. Both short term HOPWA assistance, including rent, utilities and mortgage and long -term HOPWA assistance through Tenant Based Ren tal Assistance (TBRA) are provided. Limited HOPWA funding is available for first month and deposit assistance to assist households in ______________________________________________________________________________ Previous editions are obsolete Page 7 form HUD- 40110 -D (Expiration Date: 11/30/2023) OMB Approval No. 2506 -0133 securing permanent housing. Housing Case Management services are provided to all households either receiving direct financ ial assistance or are impacted by HIV and need housing resources. Positive Link served 64 households (104 individuals), 91% remained in either their own home, transitioned into permanent affordable housing or remained in HOPWA TBRA housing. All clients re ceived case management services which included an assessment, quarterly review, and a comprehensive housing stability plan. The success of the program is linked to a client centered housing plan that is actively supported through support and referrals from the housing case manager. 100% of clients served with HOPWA funds developed a housing plan, established, and maintained contact with their housing case manager and medical or non- medical case manager. 100% were engaged in medical care, even if completely virtually during the pandemic. A weekly primary care clinic opened on- site in our Bloomington office in 2017 to provide more comprehensive medical services to our clients in that region. Through engagement in medical case management, 100% of housing clients accessed medical insurance and medications. Gainful employment was the biggest challenge this last year during the pandemic even though 77% of the households have at least one source of income. Sufficient income for stable housing costs remains a struggle especially during COVID 19. The other 23% without income are seeking employment now that the restriction is lifted, and unemployment income has dropped or have applied for disability funding.\" \"Aspire Indiana Housing serves our communities through various programs: Section 8 housing, Permanent Supportive Housing, HUD -VASH, Healthcare for the Homeless, the Emergency Food and Shelter Program, VA Homeless Providers Grant & Per Diem Program, Veterans Justice Outreach Initiative, Supportive Servi ces for Veterans' Families (SSVF), Supportive Housing for Persons with Disabilities, Grants for the Benefit of Homeless Individuals, and Assistance for Victims of Sexual Assault and Domestic Violence. We have over 300 apartments available to engage our cli ents in permanent supportive housing and are expanding our services further to ensure that as many people as possible are able to attain a stable living environment. As a safety- net provider, we make all of our services available to all people regardless o f their ability to pay. It is our goal to extend the lives of the people we serve, improve their outlook, and serve as many clients as possible in order to better our community as a whole. Between all of our services at Aspire Indiana, Aspire Indiana Housi ng, and our primary care sister organization, Aspire Indiana Health, we serve over 20,000 people across our four -county footprint. Aspire Indiana has also been the HIV Care Coordination for the Indiana Department of Health in Region 6 (office in Madison County) since 2000 and began providing HOPWA shortly after establishing the Care Coordination program. The program expanded in the early 2000's to include Regions 4 (office in Tippecanoe County), 5 (office in Delaware County), and 9 (office in Wayne County). This HIV Care Coordination program service area includes 32 counties. \" \"The AIDS Resource Group (ARG) is a n ASO providing case management, supplement HIV services, community outreach and education including HIV and HCV testing. HIV services are provided t o HIV+ individuals living in Indiana and income eligible (depending on each program service needed). Services are offered to Southwest Indiana Counties - Warrick, Vanderburgh, Perry, Pike, Gibson, Dubois, Martin, Knox, Spencer, Posey, Daviess. Program conta cts are Stacey Easley - Executive Director, Reggie Baxter -Housing Specialist, and Shalyn Youngblood\u2014HIV Services Program Manager. ARG provides housing assistance HOPWA \u2014TBRA, STRMU, PHP, and Supportive Services. TBRA, STRMU, and PHP provide direct services t o end or prevent homelessness. A major benefit to the PHP and STRMU programs is allowing clients undergoing transition (lose/reduction income, medical issues, changes in household, unexpected repairs) reduce the risk of losing housing. Supportive Services allows the agency to provide an extra resource to ensure clients are able to attend medical/mental health appointments, access food referrals, and pick up medications. While the transportation program is not designed to sustain, the supplement improves the clients' access to above listed services. Nutritional assistance allows the clients to access the food for their household and supplement their budget allocating funds toward housing and utilities. TBRA guidelines require the rent include utilities. Keepi ng utilities functional has been a great barrier to maintaining stable housing for many of our clients . Many of the homeless clients are not able to get utilities in own name which is another barrier to stable housing. HS meets with each TBRA client monthl y and at least quarterly in the home. During these meetings, the HS addresses living conditions to ensure the client is living in a safe, decent, and sanitary environment. If the listed factors are not met, HS addresses with client and Landlord. In order t o maintain health and stability, the housing program requires the unit meet inspection guidelines which are required in the Housing Guidelines. Through housing casement and housing plan, the HS is able to review with needs vs wants, budgeting, and object ives for reaching housing goals. Clients are encouraged and instructed how to review finances when considering housing options. Budgets are reviewed monthly to ensure clients are able to maintain housing and meet long- term housing goals. HS explains to cli ents pro/cons of units with utilities included and explains/reviews lease agreements to ensure the client is aware of the commitment. Clients lacking understanding of lease agreements oftentimes violate the agreement without knowing and face eviction. Hous ing case management strives to increase client awareness of leasing requirements. Challenges for the program continue to be limited access to affordable housing. As majority of our clients have a limited, fixed income or no income at all, housing options a re reduced to a few providers. HS continues to search for options fitting programming guidelines along with offering options for those with lower income. Another challenge is locating affordable, guidelines fitting units for a parent needing more than 1 or 2 bedrooms. The HS consistently searches for rental units and ______________________________________________________________________________ Previous editions are obsolete Page 8 form HUD- 40110 -D (Expiration Date: 11/30/2023) OMB Approval No. 2506 -0133 b. Annual Performance under the Action Plan Provide a narrative addressing each of the following four items: 1. Outputs Reported. Describe significant accomplishments or challenges in achieving the number of housing units supported and the number households assisted with HOPWA funds during this operating year compared to plans for this assistance, as approved in the Consolidated Pla n/Action Plan. Describe how HOPWA funds were distributed during your operating year among different categories of housing and geographic areas to address needs throughout the grant service area, consistent wit h approved plans. IHCDA subrecipients have reported the following outputs: \"For the 2020- 2021 fiscal year, o ur agency helped 35 unduplicated households with HOPWA assistance. 10 households were assisted with TBRA. 21 households were assisted with STRMU. 4 households were a ssisted with PHP. Any client who expressed a housing need to their ISDH Care Coordinator is referred to our Housing Coordinator. The Housing Coordinator meets with each individual or household to complete the HOPWA application and requirements for HMIS to determine the needs each household has. Our agency uses a selection committee that approves/denies all requests for assistance. For STRMU there must be a new financial need relating to HIV/AIDS, i.e., losing income due to illness or discrimination, financ ial burden related to HIV/AIDS care, etc., that will resolve within the 21 weeks of STRMU. To receive TBRA, a client must have an ongoing or long term housing need, i.e., no or extremely low income, chromic homelessness, recently released from incarceratio n, currently homeless, or serious mental illness that will affect the client's ability to maintain housing on their own. PHP is used for clients who are moving into affordable housing and have the income to support the household.\" Another subrecipient reports: \"The Aliveness Project of NWI (APNWI) assisted 35 consumers with the Tenant Based Rental Assistance program for the 2020/2021fiscal period. We also assisted 12 consumers with Short Term Assistance and 4 consumers with placement assistance. The Housin g Case Manager assist consumers with their Housing Plan to develop both a housing and personal financial plan to move toward achieving economic self - sufficiency and the prevention of homelessness.

PHP removed 5 clients from homelessness . Each of these clients transitioned to TBRA. Two clients stabilized financial situation and moved from TBRA to full payment of rent. ARG waitlist is mostly impacted by being able to reach the client and find appropriate housing. The TBRA Waiting list is contingent on available funds, referral date, homeless status, and contact with HS. As TBRA funds become available, the HS contacts clients according to above criteria. STRMU and PHP is available contingent on funds. The grant year began with 26 clients on TBRA. 8 new clients added to TBRA financial program, 5 from homeless situations.\" \"Hoosier Hills AIDS Coalition (HHAC) has been designated as the lead agency for the SE Indiana since the HOPWA program began in the early/mid 1990s with the coalistion admi nistrating the program in affiliation with the Clark Co. Health Department (CCHD). CCHD administers the HIV/STD/Syringe Services Program, which prov ides case management, counseling and testing for HIV/HEP C, syphilis and STD's, Disease Intervention, Speci al Populations Support Program (SPSP), PREP clinic and the syringe exchange. This program serves 14 counties and receives the Kentucky HOPWA entitlement. CCHD is a co -founder of HHAC and continutes to sponsor and support the programs. Having the coalition located in the health department office continues to help our clients with housing opportunities and direct emergency assistance through HHAC/CCHD being the lead agency in SE Indiana for numberous years. Having the housing program helps the clients maintain stable housing as well as the case managers being able to manage the client's health concerns. HHAC/CCHD are active members of the Housing Coalition of Southern Indiana (HCSI) This is a multi - county/regional effort which has a coverage area that essenti ally includes all of our 14 counties of our service region. HHAC/CCHD has worked with Haven House/Catalyst (local homeless shelter) for several years., frequently placing HOPWA and non -HOPWA clients in with their homeless shelter or the transitional housin g units. Close working relationships are established with local landlords and CCHD in order to reduce the risk of homelessness amongst our clients. Once a landlord learns that they can trust our agency they are more likely to rent to our clients and to give good referrals for other housing opportunities. We ensure all HOPWA application intakes review all appropriate community resources - including Energy Assistance Programs, Township Trustees office, Salvation Army, and other such community agencies. We refer every client to apply for Section 8/Income Based Housing Programs. We review client's housing situation/home to ensure that client is in an appropriate (healthy, clean, safe) environment and has access to needed services (like public transportation and Tare 3). Case Managers are accessible to our clients during our regular business hours. We have individual telephone contact numbers and a main telephone line where the client can be assisted by another case manager if they cannot reach their own. We as case managers have a same day response policy, in which we will respond back to clients that leave us a message on our voicemails within twenty- four hours.\" ______________________________________________________________________________ Previous editions are obsolete Page 9 form HUD- 40110 -D (Expiration Date: 11/30/2023) OMB As an additional subrecipient notes: \"TBRA is assigned to clients currently homeless or impending homeless. 61% of grant budget was allocated to TBRA. Although STRMU is helpful, the majority of rental assistance is placed through TBRA. TBRA provides a longer assistance period and a client can transition concurrently to next grant year without a pause in services. TBRA can help a client management rental payment when fi rst obtaining income until able to manage on own or transition to income based housing.\" \"Positive Link assisted 64 households throughout the year with housing assistance and case management services. Positive Link served 24 households in the TBRA program . Households accessing TBRA funds reside currently in Vigo, Vermillion and Monroe counties. Positive Link served 37 households with short term assistance in 9 of the 10 counties covered by the grant w ith 68% residing in Monroe and Vigo County. COVID -19 contributed to loss of income for many households this past year resulting in the need for additional support from both Positive Link and other community agencies. 18 households accessed PHP for security and first month's rent with the majority (15) of them utilizing PHP in conjunction with STRMU or TBRA. All clients were able to access a variety of resources though case management which helped with stabilization and long -term housing goals. In addition, if not already, clients were connected with a medical case manager that assisted them with their options for health care, as a result 100% of housing clients accessed or maintained health coverage during the program year.\" \"We were able to maintain assistance to four (4) long -term clients. The dollars were dis tributed first by making sure that the 4 carried over on long -term assistance would be able to continue with level funding and the remaining dollars would support short - term assistance. Dollars from other grants were obtained to meet our needs. At this tim e, we do not have a waiting list due to level funding and not accepting applications. If this office receives additional funds they will be published and applications will be taken.\" 2. Outcomes Assessed . Assess your program's success in enabling HOPWA beneficiaries to establish and/or better maintain a stable living environment in housing that is safe, decent, and sanitary, and improve access to care. Compare current year re sults to baseline results for clients. Describe how program act ivities/projects contributed to meeting stated goals. If program did not achieve expected targets, please describe how your program plans to address challenges in program implementation and the steps currently being taken to achieve goals in next operating year. If your program exceeded program targets, please describe strategies the program utilized and how those contributed to program successes . IHCDA subrecipients reported multiple challenges during this report cycle due to COVID -19. As one subrecipient reports, \"This fiscal year our organization got a late start due to the delay with the contract and COVID -19. The Housing Works program did not meet our goal of 57 in TBRA, but we came close with 51 consumers housed under this funding cycle. We did ma nage to provide assistance to the high priority clients on our waiting list with the STRMU assistance. The Case Management team continue to maintain housing plans which include goals and objectives, quarterly reviews and adjustments, and re -assessments to measure the program success. Another reports \"For the 2020 -2021 fiscal year, our agency saw an increase in the number of clients who struggled to maintain income. This fiscal year we had 3 clients approved for HOPWA assistance but were unable to house the m due to the client being unable to find a landlord willing to rent to the client due to past rental history and or credit that would also work with HU D's Fair Market Guidelines. Our agency will continue to work with these clients in hopes to get them hous ed. Our agency is continuing to assist our clients with mental health issues that also struggle with housing. \"Positive Link accomplished positive outcomes for the operating year with 83% of clients remaining in or transitioning off TBRA into stable, permanent housing. This year however the TBRA program struggled with 40% of the clients that exited, leaving into unstable housing of either jail, the streets or in temporary housing. Positive Link has found that landlords in the community have become less tolerant of challenging clients and as a result, leases are either not renewed or in some cases evictions occurred due to destructive behavior. In addition, due to the pandemic we saw a significant increase of clients requesting assistance for 2 to 3 consecutive years, 49% compared to 15% the previous year. The 49% recidivism was expected given the economic climate an d the impact of COVID 19.\" \"All clients complete a housing plan with their HIV Non -Medical Case Manager and they receive ongoing non -medical case management to assist them in maintaining a household budget, access to medical care and behavioral healthcare, accessing community resources, and any other referrals they may need to help them meet the goals stated on the housing plan. With the assistance of the HIV Non -Medical Case Manager, clients are able to develop skills necessary to meet the needs on their own to guide them towards self -sufficiency. Because of their involvement with the Non -Medical Case Managers, approximately 95% of clients who chose to remain engaged in the HOPWA and Non- Medical Case Management program were able to establish and/or ______________________________________________________________________________ Previous editions are obsolete Page 10 form HUD- 40110 -D (Expiration Date: 11/30/2023) OMB Approval No. 2506 -0133 maintain a stable living environment in housing that is safe, decent, and sanitary. Additionally, all clients receiving HOPWA were assisted with accessing or maintaining healthcare coverage and medical care.\" \"The HS (ED this grant year) addresses living conditi ons to ensure the client is living in a safe, decent, and sanitary environment. If the listed factors are not met, HS addresses with client and Landlord. In order to maintain health and stability, the hous ing program requires the unit meet inspection guide lines which are required in the Housing Guidelines. Clients learn the importance of a stable environment affecting health and improving HIV adherence. ARG did not set target goals for this factor as clients are not encouraged to live in a place which could negatively impact health. If a unit is not meeting HOPWA Inspection throughout grant year, HS speaks with LL to repair the issues. Clients are encouraged to seek a new place to live when lease is to be renewed if issues continue. HS does remind client of importance of keeping housing clean, trash free, and how cleanliness is for HIV health.\" \"Our goals have been assessed by being able to keep the 4 persons on long- term assistance; if this was not an option, these households would be homeless due to long w aiting lists in rural areas at capacity and with one having a felony conviction and being ineligible for Section 8.\" 3. Coordination . Report on program coordination with other mainstream housing and supportive services resources, including the use of committed leveraging from other public and private sources that helped to address needs for eligible persons identified in the Consolidated Plan/Strategic Plan. Subrecipients report coordination with programs such as Housing Choice Vouchers and other mainst ream programs. As one subrecipient states, \"For the 2020- 2021 fiscal year all of the clients who were receiving TBRA were placed on the Section 8 waiting list when the list is accepting applications in Allen County with the assistance of the Housing Coordi nator. The Housing Coordinator provided additional support to the clients by providing additional assistance with community resources such as Brightpoint, Blue Jacket, the Rescue Mission, Food Stamps, and Food Pantry Listings.\" Another subrecipient reports that they work \"very closely with mainstream resources as well as supportive housing programs available in our community. With the Consolidated Plan goal of reducing homelessness and increasing housing stability for special needs popul ations, we continue to coordinate services and resources through our Region's Housing Network. Agencies that receive CoC, ESG, HOME and CDBG funds all participate in the network. In Monroe and Vigo Counties, we were able to house several clients permanentl y through Housing Choice Vouchers or Public Housing units and have others that were recently added to the waitlist in the past 30 days as Monroe County's Section 8 opened again. Additionally, while not required, we wor k very closely with the coordinated entry process to PSH to ensure that HIV+ individuals are able to be placed in the most appropriate housing program for their situation.\" Another coordinates with local housing authorities to assist clients in applying for HUD/Section 8 when available. Aspir e Indiana has established MOUs with the AIDS Service Organizations who receive HOPWA funds to cover the counties served by Aspire Indiana for Non- Medical Case Management but do not fall into the HOPWA region. Additionally, Aspire Indiana works closely with the PSH, ESG, and SSVF providers in the regions served. Additionally, one subrecipient reports that \"Our facility is special because HIV prevention, testing, and care coordination, medical services, and HOPWA are all offered in one place. This is advantageous to personnel, clients, and potential clients because they can receive many services at one time. We believe that this increases the likelihood that someone who tests HIV+ will receive necessary services and care. Our agency works very closely with ot her social service organizations in our region. A representative from our office attends monthly human services meetings with other service providers to discuss local services . This is a priority because it gives up the opportunity to network and to learn about area organizations. It is very important for care coordinators and HIV prevention and testing workers to be aware of these services, especially when making referrals. We also work very closely with the Wings Clinic from the University of Louisville. Wings is an HIV clinic that offers a sliding scale for uninsured or underinsured individuals. A Wings physician holds a clinic at our office once a week, and this allows the personnel to work very closely with the doctors. A relationship is kept with subst ance abuse treatment facilities and detention facilities because of the educational programs and HIV/Syphilis/Hep C testing that we provide. Our educator spends a great de al of time in treatment facilities and detention centers working on HIV/STD preventio n and testing. Personnel are aware of Medicaid and Social Security services, and make a point to remain updated. Care coordinators are required to attend a Medicai d training to inform them on all services, policies, and procedures. Care coordinators work w ith Medicaid case managers to specialize care plans and to ensure that clients receive necessary services. Our organization employs a prevention case manager that works closely with mental health providers referring clients for care . This staff member works with clients with mental health issues and/or disabilities and has experience in making working relationships with these organizations. Memorandums of understanding are held between our facility and the Wings clinic, and ______________________________________________________________________________ Previous editions are obsolete Page 11 form HUD- 40110 -D (Expiration Date: 11/30/2023) OMB Approval No. 2506 -0133 our STD clinic facility. We also work closely with local housing authorities, township trustees, and additional facilities, all of which sit on our HOPWA selection committee. 4. Technical Assistance. Describe any program technical assistance needs and how they would benefit program beneficiaries. Multiple subrecipients have indicated they could benefit from additional HMIS training and/or an HMIS refresher. As one recipient reports: \"Increase in HMIS training and how to use the reporting options available. Being able to understand the reports and how to apply the information to reporting could increase supplemental funding and communication of client needs. A regional data base updated by community housing partners of property managers and landlords with affordable, inspection approved housing. HS would be able to share information and learn from other providers of safe, stable units available for rent.\" c. Barriers and Trends Overview Provide a narrative addressing items 1 through 3. Explain how barriers and trends affected your program's ability to achieve the objectives and outcomes discussed in the previous section. 1. Describe any barriers (including regulatory and non -regulatory) encountered in the administration or implementation of the HOPWA program, how they affected your program's ability to achieve the objectives and outcomes discussed, and, actions taken in response to barriers, and recommendations for program improvement. Provide an explanation for each barrier selected. Subrecipients report that the greatest barrier in administering the program right now is obtaining suitable housing units for clients in the program. As one subrecipient reports: \"Housing uni ts are limited for many of our clients due to bad credit and rental history. Add affordable housing units in depressed communities where landlords are trying to make money off of government programs and in the end the client suffers. Go Section 8 updates have made it very difficult to find units that meet the new guidelines. Clients with good credit and rental history have no problems, but most of our clients are lower income with bad c redit and spotty rental history.\" Units including utilities in rent are a significant barrier to placement. Clients without income need these units in order to stabilize and these units are decreasing in availability. Budgeting is a barrier to achieving goals \u2014the agency budget limiting assistance available and the client inex perience withbudgeting. Criminal/credit checks are also a barrier for a client finding a unit and has to settle for lesser unit. We attempt to speak with property managers trying to work out the issue. Often, property managers may seek to have the agency t o co-sign and then deny renting to client when learning the agency cannot be co -signer. Clients themselves can be the barrier to maintaining the stable housing as some of the clients have not had stable housing examples t o follow. HS has to review and conf irms understand family and friends cannot move in and out of housing per program guidelines and lease agreement. A client may be referred to program, without a wait list, and due to the items listed about may result i n a several month apartment search. Another subrecipient reports that they continue to find it challenging to secure safe units of housing under FMR and that without the FMR waiver, clients would not have been able to find suitable homes to rent due to substantial increases in rental costs. Even with affordable units available, subrecipeints have found it challenging to find willing landlords to engage with the program or with clients who have difficult backgrounds. Additionally, once leaving the larger towns in our region it becomes quite diff icult to secure and/or maintain units under FMR that can pass habitability standards. We continue to develop relationships with various landlords who are sometimes willing to negotiate rental amounts to assist households in qualifying of our clients. One subrecipient reports that staff turnover caused significant challenges during this report period: \"COVID played a role in difficulties with retaining and training staff. As a result, our data collection for HMIS is incomplete. We are making efforts to correct this and have developed a quality improvement plan moving forward. This entails re -training of current staff and program supervisor, verifying data at least quarterly--with hopes of doing this monthly, and correcting any identified errors in real tim e. Another barrier is that Madison County, the county with the most HIV cases in the Aspire Indiana service area, is part of the ESMA. Aspire Indiana clients who reside in Madison County, where the rest of their services are located (Non -Medical Case Manag ement, primary health, Infectious Disease Care, behavioral healthcare, etc.) are required to seek housing services from an agency located in Indianapolis or Bloomington. This leads to client confusion, client frustration, staff frustration, and significantly impacts the continuity of care.\" ______________________________________________________________________________ Previous editions are obsolete Page 12 form HUD- 40110 -D (Expiration Date: 11/30/2023) OMB Approval No. 2506 -0133 2. Describe any trends in the community that may affect the way in which the needs of persons living with HIV/AIDS are being addressed, and provide any other information important to the future provision of services to this population. Subrecipients report that reduced inventory of low -income housing, along with additional background check requirements and changes in property management, have both been significant trends affecting the tar get populations. In particular, one subrecipient had this to say: \"With the expansion of new HIV -related services statewide including non - medical case management, medical case management, linkage to care, substance use and mental health treatment, and expanded HIV testing efforts, there has been a significant increase in the number of HIV+ individuals seeking services. Staff are being pulled in many directions to meet the needs of their ever -growing caseloads.\" Another subrecipient reports \"In addition, we are seeing a large trend of homeless, newly diagnosed people who inject drugs whom we have been working closely with to house and provide wrap around services to include behavioral health and treatment options. HOPWA's target population is at increased risk for lacking medical care; therefore, ensuring housing stability has the increased effect of also reducing disease transmission.\" 3.

This was the last piece of the puzzle for their Stellar Designation. The contractors completed an ADA accessible playground that included a splash pad, a natural creek bed, musical \u00e2\u00bf\u00bfinstruments\u00e2\u00bf\u00bf including drums and an a large xylophone. Also included was a climbing feature with slides, swings, a ping pong table and concrete cornhole games. There are plenty of grassy areas with trees and shrubs. An ADA bathroom were installed. This playground connects to the city\u00e2\u00bf\u00bfs trails and additional park that is used for outdoor concerts.2021 0Grant Agreement executed, environmental review completed - 11/13/2019 03/27/2020 - The invitation for Bid has been 100% prepared and the first advertisement will run January 24, 2020. The bid opening is scheduled for February 18, 2020. The bid opening deadline is April 7, 2020.2019 0The project was awarded to Globe Asphalt Paving Co. and the contract was signed on 4/17/2020. The project has started construction and is approximately 8% complete. Apr 2021: Contractor bid on 2/18/20 but received the NTP on 4/23/20. The main issue for that delay was COVID related. The Contractor began digging test holes to check subgrade and discovered a fiber optic line cutting directly through project area on May 8th, that services high speed internet to numerous homes south of the river. The city was notified immediately to work with fiber partner on moving the line and that was completed June 9th. Contractor mobilized June 10th and started working. Between June 10th through mid-August contractor had to export 300 tri-axle loads of junk dirt, trash that was found below grade at the project site. Then the contractor had to import 300 tri-axle loads of good fill dirt to install storm sewer and essentially stabilize the site. This excessive additional hauling was not anticipated. Due to the storm system running very close to the new block building contractor was unable to start the building until storm system was complete. Additionally, contractor had to over excavate the building pad 3\u00e2\u00bf\u00bf deeper and backfill with compacted stone. Once the sub grade was approved by the engineer/architects, the contractor confirmed with subcontractor, in late August, that the building could be erected. However, building materials were lagging due to COVID and items that were typically week lead times turned into 6-8 week lead times seemingly overnight. This snowball effect of backups were creating more backups. The splash-pad contractor was delayed in the beginning because the splash pad features, which involved a lot of plastic parts, were also affected by COVID shortages. Contractor and Engineer are anticipating a need for a grant extension due to all of the delays.

Note: The wet weather pushed back construction mobilization from July to August, however, the contractor is confident the scheduled completion date should occur within the week of November 11, 2019. 03/25/2020 - The wastewater treatment plant project was delayed due to an extremely wet weather season and an unforeseen requirement from IDEM to remove an abandoned filter at the constructed wetland area. This activity required more local funding and further approval from the Indiana State Finance Authority (SRF) program for the additional funds. These issues had delayed the construction process and the ability to properly replant and finish the seeding of project site. Seeding will occur in the spring of 2020, however, all other construction activities have been completed and the contractor is currently working through a punch-list issued by the engineer. A 90-day extension was requested on behalf of the Town on January 13, 2020 to extend the completion date from March 31, 2020 to June 30, 2020 to allow more time to complete final reseeding and restoration of the project site when weather conditions are suitable.2019 0All activities complete and administration closeout complete. 2020 0GRANT AGREEMENT EXECUTED AND ER RELEASE ISSUED 02/13/19 - Pre-bid meeting (11/01/18) and open bid meeting (01/15/18) scheduled (01/14/19).2018IDIS - PR28 Date: 27-Sep-2021 Page: - Program Year 2020 200 of 86032108 - PONETO/WW-17-123/ADMINISTRATION General Program 2017 UGLG: Activity to prevent, prepare for, and respond to Coronavirus: No Description: ADMIN FOR WATER WASTEWATER Initial Date: Total Population in Service Area: 0 Actual Accomplishments: Census Tract Percent Low / Mod: 0.00 Number assisted: PR28 Date: 27-Sep-2021 Non Low ModerateOwner 0 0 0 0Renter 0 0 0 0Total 0 0 0 0Person 0 0 0 0 Total Percent Low/Mod0 0.0%0 0.0%0 0.0% 0.0%00 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Annual Accomplishments Year # BenefitingAccomplishment NarrativeIDIS - PR28 Date: 27-Sep-2021 Page: INDIANA - Program Year 2020 202 of 86032111 - KNIGHTSTOWN/PF-17-107/CONSTRUCTION Non-Residential Historic Grant Year: 2017 UGLG: Activity prevent, prepare for, and respond to Coronavirus: No Description: PRESERVATION OF THE HOOSIER GYM TO BE USED AS A COMMUNITY CENTER, ROOFING, MORTAR JOINTS, WINDOWS.

Bids opened publicly on 06/26/2019 which met the bid deadline of 08/31/2019. Unfortunately, bids came in way over the estimated architect's estimate by almost $700,000. Right now, the City and architects are working on a solution for the City to re-bid the project. Architects contacted OCRA to discuss if the project could possibly utilize HRGP dollars to make up the overage now or for re-bidding if the project goes over estimates again. It was determined that was not an option. Currently, there is not a new re-bid date as the City is still trying to determine what to do. The City will keep OCRA informed. 03/26/2020 - The City has decided not to de-obligate at this time. They have decided to go through the bid specs with a fine tooth comb/make some changes and re-bid for a 3rd time. Meeting to go over bid and specs was held on 11-19-19. Any changes will be for types of materials only if any scope gets cut on any buildings. Architects re- worked bid and specs based upon that meeting and emailed to the City on 12-10-19. Currently the City is reviewing the changes and once the City is done with review, bids and specs will be sent to IDNR and SHPO for their review.

Appendix B, pages B-1 to B-5 is a summary analysis and costs for the sewers being rehabilitated as a part of this project. A map showing the location of the sewers to be rehabilitated are shown in Appendix B- 6. Sewer rehabilitation methods will be lining with cured in place pipe (CIPP) and by partially replacing failed sewer sections. In some occasions, a partial replacement must be made and then the sewer lined. The selected sewers to be rehabilitated include and are reflected in the detailed budget: o CIPP lining of 7,245 feet (32 pipes) of 8-inch sewers $573,867 o Performing partial replacement on 8 segments of 8-inch sewer $49,100 o 1,857 feet (7 pipes) of CIPP lining of 10-incg sewers $67,460 o One partial replacement of 10-inch sewer $100,000 o 1,962 (6 pipes) of 12-inch CIPP lining $184,150 o Three partial replacements of 12-inch sewer $132,500 o CIPP lining of 636 feet of 15-inch sewer $65,945 o One partial located at the WWTP; see Appendix B-7 for a plant map showing the location of the work. The screen is the first treatment unit at the WWTP. The most cost effective method to improve performance is to replace the existing headworks screen with a fine bar screen. The photo on Appendix B-8 shows the type of screen proposed to be installed. The cost to replace the screen sand from the failing sewers is causing the diffusers in the Aeration Basin to wear accelerating the time when replacement is required.

All clients and the BLS area require supervision on a 24 hour 7 days a week basis. There is a small non-ADA kitchenette area located in a narrow small room that was part of the break room for employees of the manufacturing facility. Part of the scope of this project is adding a kitchenette that is ADA accessible with ADA sinks, stove, and cabinets that will allow more clients to learn basic life skills in a safer environment. The fully accessible kitchen area for food preparation and instruction will allow clients in wheelchairs or other mobility limitations to have greater involvement in the preparation, cooking, and cleaning up meals afterward.

The scope of work for this project consists of doing test borings to understand the soil and how thick of a slab needs to be poured. Site work will also need to be done to ensure a level foundation. After the slab is poured a premanufactured building will be placed on it at the entrance of the wastewater lagoon. Inside this premanufactured building two new chemical feed pumps will provide chemicals to the wastewater prior to reaching the lagoons. A panel board and equipment will need installed for operational purposes. From the premanufactured building there will be 400 feet of wastewater service line and 433 feet of chemical feed piping and conduit will need to run to straight north to reach the northern most point of the lagoons where the deep chlorine tank slab (14x19x1.5) will need to be poured along with walls and baffles. The exact dimensions of the walls and baffles can be found in the detailed budget cost estimate upload. This chlorine contact tank will sit above grade and require stairs to get above the tank. Once above the tank, grating will need to be installed to walk out over the chlorine contact tank to adjust the weirs if needed. The weirs will be located inside of the chlorine contact tank. A pole light night will be installed for safety in case the operator needs to go out there at dusk or early in the morning. Valves and two tee inserts will need to be installed at the chlorine contact tank and chemical feed piping. Additionally, each lagoon has three valves that need replaced so a total of 16 valves will be installed with this project. This project also contains costs associated for engineering: final design, bidding and administration along with grant administrative costs, environmental review costs, labor standard costs, and legal costs.

The RLF was established in 2010 to create jobs and stimulate private investment in Whitley County by providing low-interest loans to individuals or businesses that are seeking to start or grow a business enterprise. The EDC maintains three different loan programs to assist with a broad array of business development opportunities. Due to the economic hardship caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the Whitley County EDC will expand their RLF program to include a COVID-19 Fund. The purpose of the fund is to retain jobs, stimulate private investment and build long- term financial recovery in Whitley County by providing low-interest loans to small businesses throughout Whitley County. The COVID-19 Fund will supplement the existing programs by focusing investment in job retention. Furthermore, at least 51% of the jobs retained must be held by individuals who are considered low to moderate income. Eligible applicants are businesses geographically located in Whitley County with fewer than 100 employees. Applicants will receive free technical assistance through the EDC's Small Business and Entrepreneurship Initiative. Loans of up to $25,000 are available for a three year term, with an interest rate of 2%. A 1% loan servicing fee will be charged at loan closing. Loan applicants may request either a 6 month loan deferment period or loan forgiveness after two years, if the proposed jobs are still retained.
