{"title": "Clinical Rationale for SARS-CoV-2 Base Spike Protein Detoxification in Post COVID-19 and Vaccine Injury Syndromes", "author": "McCullough; Peter A; Wynn; Cade; Procter; Brian C", "url": "https://zenodo.org/record/8286460", "hostname": "zenodo.org", "description": "The spike protein is responsible for the pathogenicity of the SARS-CoV-2 infection and drives the development of adverse events, injuries, disabilities, and death after vaccination through immunologic and thrombotic mechanisms. The long-lasting spike protein has been found in the brain, heart, liver, kidneys, ovaries, testicles and other vital organs at autopsy in cases of death after vaccination. In the case of vaccine-induced thrombotic injury, the spike protein has been found within the blood clot itself. Thus, there is strong rationale for considering residual SARS-CoV-2 spike protein as a treatment target in post COVID-19 and vaccine injury syndromes. The spike protein participates directly in pathophysiology, incites inflammation, and propels thrombosis. While specific syndromes (cardiovascular, neurological, endocrine, thrombotic, immunological) will require additional therapies, we propose the clinical rationale for a base detoxification regimen of oral nattokinase, bromelain, and curcumin for patients with post-acute sequalae from SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 vaccination. The empiric regimen can be continued for 3-12 months or more and be guided by clinical parameters: -Nattokinase 2000 FU (100) mg orally twice a day without food -Bromelain 500 mg orally once a day without food -Curcumin 500 mg orally twice a day (nano, liposomal, or with piperine additive suggested) No therapeutic claims can be made for this regimen because it has not been tested in large, prospective, double-blind, placebo controlled randomized trials. No such studies are planned or funded currently by federal or institutional sponsors. The main caveats are bleeding and allergic reactions. The regimen can be used in addition to antiplatelet and antithrombic agents, however, caution is advised with respect to monitoring bleeding risks.", "sitename": "Zenodo", "date": "2023-08-25", "cleaned_text": "Journal article Open Access [ McCullough, Peter A; Wynn, Cade; Procter, Brian C](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0997-6355) The spike protein is responsible for the pathogenicity of the SARS-CoV-2 infection and drives the development of adverse events, injuries, disabilities, and death after vaccination through immunologic and thrombotic mechanisms.
