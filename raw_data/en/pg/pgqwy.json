Posted March 3, 2020 | [ Reviewed by Gary Drevitch ](/us/docs/editorial-process) As the [coronavirus](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/coronavirus-disease-2019) spreads, we are hearing about how to reduce exposure and take care of ourselves if we get sick. These are important tips, but we're not hearing much about how we can [boost our immunity](https://www.berkeleywellbeing.com/anti-stress.html) so that if we do get exposed to the virus\u2014or worse, we get sick\u2014our body can effectively fight back. Our immune systems are designed to fight off sicknesses and viruses. But unfortunately, [the immune system can get worn down by many things typical of a modern life](https://www.berkeleywellbeing.com/anti-stress.html)\u2014for example, [stress](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/stress), toxins, lack of exercise, and unhealthy eating. This prevents our bodies from effectively fighting off sickness. With coronavirus continuing to spread, it's more important than ever to support the immune system. We can do this by making a few key tweaks to our thoughts, actions, and habits. Here are 6 essential ways to boost your immunity in preparation for coronavirus: 1. Reduce Stress When [you're stressed out](https://www.berkeleywellbeing.com/anti-stress.html) your body produces stress [hormones](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/hormones) which tax the immune system. So one of the most important ways to boost immunity is to reduce stress. To reduce stress, it's key to ensure you [have decent work-life balance](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/click-here-happiness/201710/4-risk-factors-burnout-and-how-overcome-them), take breaks when you need them (both short \"water-cooler\" breaks and longer vacations), and to employ some calming or relaxing stress-reduction techniques, like [practicing mindfulness](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/click-here-happiness/201902/what-is-mindfulness-and-how-be-more-mindful). And if you're already feeling really [burned out](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/burnout), taking adrenal support supplements like Ashwaganda can sometimes be helpful. 2. Sleep whenever you're tired Many of us walk around this world in a state of constant exhaustion. But every time we stay awake when our bodies want us to sleep, we increase stress and hurt our immunity. If we're drinking caffeinated drinks all the time (e.g., coffee, black tea, soda) we may not even realize just how tired we really are. Because [sleeping is essential](https://www.karger.com/Article/Abstract/281827) to rebuilding a struggling immune system, we need to let ourselves sleep as much as we need. 3. Consume immunity-boosting vitamins To support your immune system, you can eat immunity supporting foods like citrus fruits, garlic, broccoli, and spinach. If your immune system is already weak, it can also be helpful to supplement with key vitamins and minerals that may have become depleted like Vitamin C, Vitamin B, Vitamin D, and Zinc. 4. Reduce Inflammation Sugar, processed meat, vegetable oils, and [alcohol](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/alcohol) tend to be inflammatory foods so they busy the immune system, leaving other problems in your body unaddressed. That's why it can be really helpful to remove these inflammatory foods if we want a healthy immune system. 5. Exercise, but not too much Exercise can be one of the best things to do to boost immunity. But we have to be careful because [too much exercise is stressful](https://link.springer.com/article/10.2165/00007256-200333050-00002) on the body and can be tough on our immune system. So just keep the other tips in mind: Keep stress low, and if you're tired, then rest. 6. Stay away from toxins Toxins can be devastating for the immune system. For example, mycotoxins from mold are notorious for [destroying the immune system](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2019/02/190208095614.htm). Many other toxins and parasites seem to have [negative effects](http://www.inchem.org/documents/ehc/ehc/ehc180.htm) on immunity as well. So do a [parasite cleanse](https://www.berkeleywellbeing.com/parasite-cleanse-protocol-pills-home-remedy.html) and minimize exposure to chlorinated drinking water, pesticides, aromatic hydrocarbons (e.g., air fresheners), heavy metals, air pollution, and food additives. By taking these actions, we can help prevent ourselves and our loved ones from suffering significantly from "}
