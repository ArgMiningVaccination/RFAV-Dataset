Teachers will use the state curriculum frameworks for ADE approved ELA and Math Instruction. Using the Common Core state standards, teachers will integrate arts utilizing the A+ eight essentials of Arts, Curriculum, Experiential Learning, Multiple Learning Pathways, Enriched Assessment, Collaboration, Infrastructure and Climate. Annually, staff will attend a week long training conducted by At+ Fellows to integrate best practices, learn new strategies and go deeper in their understanding of how to increase student achievement by employing the eight essentials in their daily practice. Teachers will work collaboratively in teams and across grade levels to develop curriculum maps for each subject area. Student work samples/anchor papers will be collected to help facilitate discussion during staff meetings on grade level work and tools to increase student learning. Grade level PLC's will serve to help identify gaps in student achievement and develop plans to support students requiring intervention. A rigorous staff development calendar will focus on student assessment, engagement and instruction. The school leadership team which is comprised of a teacher representative from each grade level and/or specials, will meet weekly to develop plans, review progress using MAP scores, teacher reports, student assessments, student work samples and other math , reading data as applicable. Leadership team notes will be shared with staff and used for further discussion and site-based decision making regarding needed materials and supplies as well as RTI supports. The leadership team, under the direction of the building administrator will also make critical budgeting decisions regarding expenditures and purchases for curriculum related materials. Team leads will meet weekly to discuss curriculum maps, programming needs, assessment, RTI, curriculum and student achievement. A PLAN FOR HOW MATH & LITERACY OUTCOMES WILL BE MEASURED To ensure that all teachers are using the Common Core State Standards and student achievement we will use frequent and proven assessment measures wh ich include but are not limited to: Report Card s, quarterly assessments, QUALLS , Dibbles, NWEA MAP at the beginning, Middle and End of each year, Teacher assessments, STAR reading, Portfolios, State summative assessments and standardized tests, daily math and language exercises and mo nthly 2 2data reports using MAP and computer based programs (i.e., Reading Eggs, Math Seeds, IXL Math and Language Arts, Accelerated Reader). Student assessment data will be used to identify students for Title I services and RTI. This plan will be driven by our recently hired data specialist, Vera Deberg. She will drive instructional improvement through the use of this data. Vera DeBerg was hired to help facilitate and manage data and reports. Monthly data reporting and disaggregation meetings will be conducted to ensure positive outcomes. She is also responsible for training staff on how to use data to drive instruction. Mrs. DeBerg schedules tests and monitors all data from MAP, state assessments, grades, STAR testing, eSchool and teacher surveys. Ultimately, she is responsible for all data used for accountability and ACSIP planning and reporting. Vera received her Master's degree in political science from the University of Arkansas in 2010. She has several years of experience teaching courses in American government and international relations at the University of Arkansas as well as NWACC. While her research background is in pol itical science, Vera developed an interest in K -12 education during her time as a Montessori teacher. Since this time, she has studied econometrics and education policy, in addition to conducting research in various areas of education policy. Her researc h experience in education policy includes the area of school choice and racial segregation, but her primary focus includes measurement and teacher quality, specifically through the use of data on student academic achievement and data collected through stud ent surveys. In order to move academic achievement forward and to bring national status to Arkansas Arts Academy, the new Data Specialist will focus on the following: 1. Growth, differentiation, and proper comparisons - Far too often when schools repo rt the academic performance of their students to the general public ( i.e. on a school report card) they only communicate aggregate levels of performance. Tracking student achievement growth over time provides a bigger picture and better illustrates school performance than, for example, an aggregate data point that \"65% of the students scored proficient or above on the Arkansas benchmark exam in mathematics.\" It is also important that academic performance is communicated to parents and community stakeholders in a differentiated way that places performance in a comparative context. For example, while 65% of all students may be performing at the proficient level in math, maybe 80% of FRL -eligible or at -risk students are preforming at the proficient level (clear ly, in this example, the school is doing a great job at educating and serving the very students who are likely to score below proficient on standardized exams). She will communicate this performance by comparing it to that of schools that enroll a similar student body. In the previous 65% proficient example, it is likely that a parent will see this figure and think that there is still considerable need for improvement. But if schools that are similar to the 65% proficient school have proficiency rates betwe en 40 -50%, it is good to communicate relative performance so parents and community stakeholders are less likely to judge and more likely to view the data in a positive light. 3 32. NWEA Map Assessments - Ms. DeBerg favors this formative assessment. One thi ng she will be doing is working closely with teachers and parents so that they not only utilize the information that these assessments provide, but also understand what the numbers mean. Boosting achievement requires extra work and effort of both teachers and parents. The information collected on students that complete the Map assessments will be used to create a holistic plan, where the teacher and the parents participate in developing the goals and specific practices (in the classroom and at home) that ca n help to increase the achievement of each individual student. The NWEA Map assessments are beneficial in guiding this process. 3. Teacher Evaluation - While classroom performance on standardized tests tells a lot about how well a teacher is doing when it comes to educating his or her students, it is still good to measure teacher quality with different tools. The new Data Specialist will assist staff in the Danielson Framework . She feels this is a great tool that should be used in principal evaluations of teachers, and will provide teachers with performance feedback that is consistent over time. We use this framework now but with her assistance use it with more depth and understanding. In addition to this, she will develop a student survey that will also provide us with measures of teacher performance. When students believe that the teacher has high levels of classroom management they are more likely to be happy and work harder at academic improvement. Additionally, while a principal evaluation can help provide valuable feedback to teachers on their classroom performance, students are first-hand witnesses of teacher quality in the classroom and their opinions and suggestions are important in guiding the teacher to better serve their individual needs. Data Technology/Instructional Specialist Vera DeBerg was hired to help facilitate and manage data and reports. Monthly data reporting and disaggregation meetings will be conducted to ensure positive outcomes. She is also responsible for training staff on how to use data to drive instruction. Mrs. DeBerg schedules tests and monitors all data from MAP, state assessments, grades, STAR testing, eSchool and teacher surveys. Ultimately, she is responsible for all data used for accountability and ACSIP planning and reporting. Child Study Team A Child Study Team/RTI will be established to help plan and identify students in need of extra support. The RTI team will meet monthly or bi/weekly if needed to discuss student progress and share ideas on how to better serve students requiring intervention services. Students requiring tier two and tier three intervention services will be more closely monitored and possible referred for special education testing if required. The Child Study Team will also serve as the referral team for special education services in the event that RTI is unsuccessful in meeting the student's academic needs. 4 4A PLAN FOR ADDITIONAL ELEMENTARY EDUCATION STAFFING EXPERTISE A school leadership team will serve to help identify the needs of the staff. Professional Development will be based on teacher self-assessments and informal observations. At the beginning of each year staff will receive necessary training in Bloom Board and TESS to better utilize resources available. All teachers will receive a copy of Enhancing Professional Practice, A Framework for Teaching, by Charlotte Danielson. Teachers will be required to receive 60 hours of professional development by the District, 24 hours above what is required by the state. All teachers will receive professional development from A+ on Arts Integration. Additionally, through the partnership with Crystal Bridges teachers will be supported in the classroom by arts educators as needed and determined by their grade level teams. Intensive support in math and language arts will be provided through AIMES for Math, English and Science Staff. Elementary teachers will be strongly encouraged to attend CGI Math training. Arkansas Arts Academy will strive to hire highly qualified teachers in every area and when not available ensure that teachers are working towards acquiring HQT status in state approved programs. All teachers will be evaluated using TESS. All new teachers will complete required AR-TESS Track 1 and be provided additional support to ensure success based on their teacher self-assessments and conferences with administration. A staff member from Arkansas Arts Academy will be selected to attend state and national conferences for Mathematics and Language Arts and share information at staff meetings and grade level meetings. A newly reconstituted staff was the first step in ensuring additional elementary education staffing expertise. After a rigorous evaluation process in the spring of 2015 several staff members were non -renewed. All teachers that were hired have elementary education backgrounds and/or certifications. Several teachers have advanced degrees. A new building administrator and Instructional/data specialist were hired to help teachers in meeting high stand ards for classroom instruction. Remaining staff were reallocated for best use of talents and skills. The result is a more fine-tuned and focused teaching staff. Two additional teacher's aides will be hired to assist in classrooms to help teachers better serve students. 5 5Language Arts & Math Assessment: Dibbles, Qualls, MAP, State Assessments, Star Testing, Teacher created pre -post tests, classroom assessments, grades Inger Kent Vera DeBerg K-8 Classroom Teachers As Needed or required QUARTERLTERLY, Weekly or Annually Scores Reports Meeting Notes Curriculum Mapping Grade Level Teams develop, adjust and provide reflections and evidence for Cur- riculum Maps for Reading & Math Grade Level Teams Weekly Curriculum Map Binders Lesson Plans Grade Books and Report Cards Weekly Grade Level News Letters Grade Level PLC's Meet weekly to discuss student progress Leadership Team Weekly Meeting Notes Referrals IRI's and AIP's MAP Testing Vera DeBerg Quarterly Test Results Score Reports Accelerated Reader Weekly Goals to support reading achieve- ment.

WMS Charter Revision ADE 8th Grade Pre-AP GT Science Week 5 Gifted and Talented Interest Inventory Charter ADE GT Gravity and Tides Lesson Plans Gravity and Tides Lesson Plans (Revised) Project Rubric Thanks to Rhonda Williams who provided requested answers and revisions. Respectfully, Dr. Mary Kathryn Stein, Director Office of Gifted and Talented and Advanced Placement Arkansas Department of Education Four Capitol Mall, Slot 28 Little Rock, Arkansas 72201 501-682-4224 - Office 501-682-4220 - Fax 1Prior to our waiver for middle school GT, sixth grade students were pulled for forty-five minutes a week to a resource for room for GT. They were also served through PreAP classes in all content areas along with seventh and eighth grade. With the approved waiver, the sixth, seventh, and eighth graded identified students will be served in a self-contained science classroom that will take the STEM approach to learning. The students will continue to work on their regular science curriculum which is required for all students with opportunities for to complete work at a level four(Above and beyond, being able to use the information in a new way, or being able to teach the information to another student.). In addition enrichment and extension activities based on their areas of interest using the STEM approach will be incorporated each week in the curriculum. An interest inventory was completed by all GT students at the beginning of the year which allows the teacher to have opportunities available for all learning styles and needs in all content areas. The students will still be allowed to compete in competitions such as Quiz Bowl, Spelling Bee, National Geography Bee, Technology Titan, and Showcase of the Mind. The GT Science class will be taught by an approved teacher of the gifted as defined by the gifted program approval standards. All students in grades six through eight will continue to be served through PreAP classes in all content areas. The GT Coordinator will oversee the implementation of the curriculum to make sure all gifted students' needs are being met. This approach to learning will be monitored and evaluated at the end of this school year.

There are currently two sections of PreAP classes in all content areas at every grade level. Documentation of differentiation is sent to GT Coordinator each nine weeks. Each PreAP teacher has students complete an interest inventory for their content area. This is a requirement with Standards Based Education and all teachers in the Warren School District complete this task, along with having data binders, a Code of Conduct, Mission Statement, and a Shared Vision. All GT students in our at WArren Middle School are enrolled in PreAP classes in all four content areas. In addition to PreAP classes, a self-contained GT Science class has been added for gifted learners. We felt the PreAP GT Science class was a good program option to allow our GT students time to interact with like intellectual peers and be placed based on their learning and social and emotional needs. The teacher in the GT Science Class uses the interest inventory to ensure that opportunities through activities, process, and products are available to meet the learning needs of the gifted students. Curriculum: The core content teachers in PreAP classes address the learning styles of students with their own interest inventory (which is required by our district) and by differentiation of the curriculum for PreAP classes. The students are also given opportunities to take information and use it in a new way or in a way they create (scores of 4.0). As one of our program options, the Warren School District implemented a new innovative way to meet the needs of the gifted learners in the regular classroom through a PreAP GT Science class at Warren Middle School in grade six, seven, and eight. In the PreAPGT Science classes, the science teacher, Mrs. Justin Beth Woodard, is certified in gifted education and is a previous GT Teacher and Coordinator for two other districts. In the science class, Mrs. Woodard teaches the science frameworks as any other PreAP science teacher does and differentiates the curriculum, not only with PreAP strategies , but also the GT frameworks and scope and sequence that has been approved by ADE. In the differentiation process of the classroom, Mrs. Woodard ensures that critical thinking, creative thinking, communication, research, and affective development skills are worked into the process, activities, and products used in her lesson plans. An example of a unit of study is attached. Mrs. Woodard uses her interest inventory to develop units of study, in addition to the regular science frameworks. Not only are the students allowed to go more in-depth in the science curriculum, they are also able to do independent studies in other areas of interests. By using a 3curriculum that not only uses PreAP strategies, but is connected to the GT frameworks and scope and sequence, the gifted learning needs are being met above and beyond the regular curriculum and PreAP classes as well. They have the opportunity in this GT Science class to work at the level of their abilities not only in science, but their area of interest or talent. This class focuses on higher levels of thinking and complexity. The curriculum for this class is following the GT Scope and Sequence to extend application in Research Skills, Thinking Skills, Organizational Skills, Products and Outcomes, and Communication Skills. These skills are also being assessed in the PreAP GT Science class during the nine week grading report for students and communicated to parents through Empower. The Warren School District is currently working on getting the scope and sequence added to Empower, so that assessment of the GT Frameworks can be assessed at regular intervals. Social and Emotional Needs: The social and emotional needs of the gifted learners are being met in several ways at Warren Middle School. The middle school counselor who is also a previous GT Coordinator and teacher provides monthly counseling services for the gifted students. In addition, the GT science teacher, Mrs. Justin Beth Woodard, is ensuring that the affective development of gifted students is being met by providing opportunities for students to set individual goals, monitor those goals, and reflect on their learning. Individual data binders are kept by each student with their reflection data page where students meet with Mrs. Woodard and self-reflect on their current progress and emotions relating to their goals and accomplishments. By being in a self- contained classroom with like peers, learners are able to work effectively in cooperative situations where they learn to value the abilities and talents of others. The GT Coordinator will conduct evaluations during each semester to get feedback from the students and parents regarding whether their needs are being met in the PreAPGT science classroom and other PreAP classes as well. Evaluation/Observation: The GT Coordinator will conduct an evaluation with students and parents during both semesters of the implementation process of the new GT Science Class at Warren Middle School. She will also have a focus meeting with students from all three grade levels to get feedback to see, if gifted needs are being met. The students will also be assessed throughout each nine weeks and given a final assessment score for meeting the GT Frameworks. This will be communicated to parent using Empower. The students in the PreAP GT Science class are also required to keep an interactive science binder which contains documentation of work completed using the GT Frameworks. At the end of this first year of implementation, the program will also be monitored by a Public School Program Advisor from the Office of Gifted Education. Competitions and Extra Activities: The gifted learners are given opportunities to participate in various competitions and extracurricular activities. Learners are given opportunities to compete in Quiz Bowl, Spelling Bee, National Geography Bee, Technology Titan, Show Case of the Mind, National History Bee, and Chess. These do take place during the school day with various coaches. 4Gifted and Talented Interest Inventory Name:_______________________ Grade:_________ 1.

C8: CURRICULUM ALIGNMENT The information does not provide assurance that courses/materials are completely aligned with the Arkansas Curriculum Frameworks. CHARTER INTERNAL REVIEW COMMITTEE REVIEW AND APPLICANT RESPONSES1 Arkansas Connections Academy PRE-APPLICATION MATERIALS The Arkansas Department of Education requires that all applicants submit a Letter of Intent, outlining a general description of the proposed charter school. Evaluation Criteria: A Letter of Intent filed with Arkansas Department of Education on time and including all the necessary information Fully Responsive PART B EXECUTIVE SUMMARY The Arkansas Department of Education requires all applicants to include an executive summary. Evaluation Criteria: A mission statement (with content to be evaluated for Prompt #3 of Part C); and The key programmatic features of the proposed charter school Fully Responsive Concerns and Additional Questions Explain the discrepancies as the mission statement, key programmatic features, curriculum description, ALE and gifted discussion, and teacher staff qualifications sections of the application state that teachers will be licensed, but the applicant requests a waiver of teacher licensure requirements. Included in the explanation of the licensure waiver request is the statement, \"ARCA estimates that over 90% of course enrollments will be taught by Arkansas- licensed staff, as this is a goal jointly shared by the Board and Connections.\" Applicant Response: ARCA teachers will all be licensed educators. ARCA is requesting waivers of teacher licensure requirements so that some classes that would otherwise not be able to be offered to ARCA students may be taught by teachers who are licensed in states other than Arkansas. All teachers will be subject to required background checks and the Code of Ethics for Arkansas Educators, regardless of state licensure. This arrangement would allow ARCA to offer more courses from Connections' catalog while maintaining the teacher quality indicated by state licensure. There may be courses for which an Arkansas-licensed teacher cannot be identified or courses with lower student interest (e.g., AP courses and advanced and low incidence world languages, CTE courses, and electives). In such instances, ARCA could still offer these courses using the resources of Connections' private school (iNACA), which employs teachers who are licensed in the states they reside. 2 ARCA anticipates these instances would affect very few students and only for the better, as students could enroll in courses that would not otherwise be offered. ARCA estimates over 90% of course enrollments, or 9 out of 10 seats in courses, will be taught by a teacher licensed in Arkansas. For example, if 500 students enroll in six courses each (3,000 total course enrollments), no fewer than 2,700 of those course enrollments (90% of 3,000) would be taught by a teacher licensed in Arkansas. If these teacher licensure waivers are not granted, all ARCA teachers will be Arkansas-licensed. This would not affect the viability of the ARCA program but would limit some of the courses available to students. PART C NARRATIVE DESCRIPTION OF THE PROPOSED CHARTER C1: PUBLIC HEARING RESULTS All proposed school design teams must conduct a public hearing before applying for an open- enrollment charter school, to assess support for the school's establishment. Applicants are asked both to document the logistics of the hearing and to include a narrative of the hearing results. Evaluation Criteria: A thorough description of the results of the public hearing; Evidence of public support exhibited at the hearing; Documentation of required notices published to garner public attention to the hearing; and Documentation of required notices of the public hearing to superintendents of districts from which the proposed school is likely to draw students and to superintendents of districts that are contiguous to the district in which the charter school would be located Fully Responsive Concerns and Additional Questions Provide the number of attendants for the nine online and 12 in-person information sessions held in addition to the six discussed. Applicant Response: In addition to the six attendants at the Bentonville public hearing and three attendants at the North Little Rock public hearing, two people attended in-person information sessions and one attended an online information session. The recording of the online information session remains available for interested families. Connections' experience in other states is that information sessions, though initially attended sporadically, are vital to community outreach efforts. Attendance at information sessions typically increases once presenters are able to offer school enrollment, rather than the possibility of a school in the future. Word of mouth spreads quickly among parents seeking educational alternatives and a single attendee often leads to several other families who want to know more. ARCA has provided information to families through various other channels as well. The ARCA 3 Facebook page has 111 followers and ARCA has received 11 letters of support, which are available upon request. Additionally, over 3,000 families across Arkansas have registered on Connections' website to learn more. Families who choose not to register on the website can still learn about Connections' curriculum, accreditation, and parent satisfaction through the website as well as use tools such as Contact a Parent, Contact a Teacher, and browse the Connections Program Guide. A map of those families who have registered is included in Figure 1, demonstrating strong interest across Arkansas. ARCA will continue to offer online and in-person information sessions throughout the state to reach these and other families. Figure 1. Locations of Interested Families With the statewide interest in the Connections program and its NCAA approval of many high school courses, growing participation in online learning generally (Keeping Pace Report referenced in C.4), and enrollment cap on the state's single online public school, ARCA believes that many Arkansas students and their families will be interested in and benefit from attending ARCA. C2: GOVERNING STRUCTURE The Governing Structure section should explain how the school will be governed. It should present a clear picture of the school's governance processes and composition, what responsibilities various groups and people will have and the relationships among the groups. 4 Evaluation Criteria: Documentation of proper legal structure of the governing board and sponsoring entity; A comprehensive description of the planned relationship between the governing board of the school and governing board of the sponsoring entity; A clear description of the governing board's roles and responsibilities; Adequate policies and procedures for board operation, including board composition, member term length, and member selection; A clear, sensible delineation of roles and responsibilities in relation to governance and school management; and A reasonable plan for involving parents, staff, students and community in the decision- making of the school Fully Responsive C3: MISSION STATEMENT The Mission Statement should be meaningful and indicate what the school intends to do, for whom, and to what degree. Evaluation Criteria: A mission statement that is clear and succinct Fully Responsive Concerns and Additional Question Explain the discrepancies as the mission statement, key programmatic features, curriculum description, ALE and gifted discussion, and teacher staff qualifications sections of the application state that teachers will be licensed, but the applicant requests a waiver of teacher licensure requirements. Included in the explanation of the licensure waiver request is the statement, \"ARCA estimates that over 90% of course enrollments will be taught by Arkansas- licensed staff, as this is a goal jointly shared by the Board and Connections.\" Applicant Response: Please see response to Part B Executive Summary. C4: EDUCATIONAL NEED The Educational Need section should explain the need for a charter school in the proposed location and the innovative educational option offered by the charter school. Evaluation Criteria: Valid, reliable, and verifiable data substantiate an educational need for the charter; Innovations that would distinguish the charter from other schools Fully Responsive 5 C5: ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENT GOALS The Academic Achievement Goals section should define the performance expectations for students and the school as whole and support the charter's mission. Evaluation Criteria: Specific goals in reading and mathematics that are clear, measurable, and attainable; Valid and reliable assessment tools to be used to measure the goals; and Attainment of the goals demonstrate that the charter is meeting the identified educational need for the school and fulfilling its mission Fully Responsive Concerns and Additional Questions Explain what is meant by \"0.90 ratio of school results to state averages on the ACT Aspire.\" Applicant Response: The ratio of school proficiency rates to statewide proficiency rates on the ACT ASPIRE will be at least 0.90, signifying ARCA students are approaching a level of proficiency that is nearly equivalent to other Arkansas students. Figure 2 highlights an example explaining the calculation of ratios of school proficiency versus state proficiency on state assessments. The example is based on actual data from Texas Connections Academy at Houston (TCAH) and the State of Texas for 2013-14 academic year state assessments in reading, math, and science. Figure 2. Example of Calculating Ratios Grade/Subject TCAH # Tested TCAH % Proficient State % Proficient Ratio 3rd grade Reading 95 73.7% 76.0% 0.97 4th grade Reading 137 77.4% 74.0% 1.05 5th grade Reading 225 89.3% 76.0% 1.18 6th grade Reading 245 86.5% 77.0% 1.12 7th grade Reading 334 83.5% 75.0% 1.11 8th grade Reading 374 96.5% 82.0% 1.18 English I 433 74.0% 72.0% 1.03 English II 476 75.0% 73.0% 1.03 Weighted Average for Reading - 2319 tested students 1.09 3rd grade Math 95 37.9% 70.0% 0.54 4th grade Math 138 54.3% 70.0% 0.78 5th grade Math 226 73.5% 79.0% 0.93 6th grade Math 244 77.5% 78.0% 0.99 7th grade Math 315 60.6% 67.0% 0.90 8th grade Math I 420 72.0% 86.0% 0.84 Weighted Average for Math - 1,769 tested students 0.90 5th grade Science 220 65.0% 6 91.0% 93.0% 0.98 Weighted Average for Science - 1,010 tested students 0.94 Overall Weighted Average across all three subjects - 5,098 tested students 0.99 Grade/Subject: Grade and subject area being tested TCAH # Tested: The number of students tested in this grade/subject area TCAH % Proficient: The percentage of TCAH students that scored proficient or higher. State % Proficient: The percentage of students statewide that scored proficient or higher. Ratio: Calculated by dividing TCAH % Proficient by State % Proficient Weighted Average: Average of all the individual tests, taking into the number of students tested. For example, English I has about three times the impact of 4th grade reading for the reading weighted average because there were about three times as many English I students tested compared to 4th grade reading students tested. Similarly, reading has more than twice the impact as Science in the overall weighted average because there are more than twice as many students testing in reading than in science. Discuss growth expectations for students performing below grade level who need accelerated growth to get on pace to graduate. Applicant Response: ARCA's expectations for students performing below grade level are the same as all other students, that they will become proficient in the academic standards. ARCA recognizes such students may need more than one year to achieve proficiency if they enroll more than one year behind and will also need additional support in order to meet these high expectations. This support may include individual tutoring on standards that have not been mastered, intervention programs with frequent process monitoring by teachers, or credit recovery options for students who may have previously failed a high school course. The core academic program has mechanisms in place to identify students who are performing below grade level. Each student is given formative assessments throughout the school year. These assessments let the teachers know if the student is on track academically. If a student does not perform well on the pre-test, the teacher will be notified via real-time data on his or her teacher home page within Connexus showing that the student needs attention. (Intervention indicators are also triggered if the student does poorly on the state assessment. It will be important for the school to gather previous year's test scores and enter them into Connexus. The more data teachers have on previous performance, the better the decisions made for the students.) Teachers can assign interventions, set up tutoring, and create personalized plans to help their students achieve. Some of the interventions that teachers may choose to assign/monitor to increase students' success include SuccessMaker Math, Math-Whizz, Reading Eggs, Reading Eggspress, Think Through Math, SkillsTutor, Study Island, HeadSprout, Math XL, SuccessMaker Reading, and Raz-Kids. 7 Confirm that alternative assessments will be used to assess students with disabilities, as outlined in Individualized Education Programs (IEPs). Applicant Response: Alternative assessments will be used to assess students with disabilities, as outlined in Individualized Education Programs (IEPs). Examples of possible alternative assessments are the National Center and State Collaborative Alternate Assessment on Alternate Achievement Standards (NCSC (AA-AAS)) for students in grades 3-8 and 11 who meet the eligibility criteria and the Arkansas Alternate Portfolio Assessment in science for students in grades 5, 7, and 10. C6: SCHEDULE OF COURSES OFFERED The Schedule of Courses Offered section should describe the schedules for a week at the elementary level and courses offered at each grade at the secondary level. Evaluation Criteria: Evidence that the charter school meets minimum state requirements of courses offered at appropriate grade levels Fully Responsive Concerns and Additional Questions Explain when and how the curriculum will be modified to align with Arkansas Curriculum Frameworks. Applicant Response: English/Language Arts, math, science, and social studies courses for grades K-12 have already been aligned to the Arkansas Curriculum Frameworks. The alignments total hundreds of pages and therefore will be made available upon request. Alignments for electives will be completed by the end of 2015. All alignments will be completed well before the start of the inaugural school year. Connections supports schools in many states and has extensive experience aligning courses to state- specific standards. In preparing to support ARCA, Connections mapped each course to the Arkansas Curriculum Frameworks. After an in-depth analysis of the alignments, any gaps between course content and state standards are addressed in one or more of the following ways: current courses are updated with units, lessons, activities, and/or assessments to meet the standards; a new course is built to meet the standards; and/or resources are shared with teachers to modify the existing courses to strengthen the alignments. If a new course must be built, Connections will use the Arkansas Curriculum Framework to employ a \"backwards mapping\" approach. After an in-depth analysis of standards, the team identifies the types of assessments necessary to allow students to showcase their new understanding and demonstrate growth on essential skills and standards. Once evidence of mastery is determined, an assessment map is created to indicate the types of assessments to be used to monitor and evaluate performance on each standard. Curriculum designers then work backwards to design curriculum maps comprised of learning objectives, lesson activities, and digital and interactive resources that will lead students to successful mastery of concepts. Any gaps between course content and state standards are addressed 8 as described herein. Explain why all courses cannot be offered in first and second years of school operations given the online nature of the delivery. Applicant Response: ARCA will meet state requirements for courses offered at appropriate grade levels and will comply with Standards for Accreditation 9.03.2 (annual instruction content areas for grades K-4) and Standards for Accreditation 9.03.3 (annual instruction content areas for grades 5-8). ARCA is asking for a waiver from Standards for Accreditation 9.03.1.2 and 9.03.4 because the school will not initially serve all high school grades. ARCA is impressed by Connections' catalog of courses but understands the exact courses offered at the school will depend on the number of students enrolled, the grade levels of enrolled students, and the number of staff hired as determined by mutual agreement of the Board, the Principal, and Connections. Although these courses already exist in Connexus, courses require an assigned teacher in order to be offered at the school. Teachers are essential to high-quality online instruction and support students in the following ways: Communicate frequently with students and Learning Coaches; document and review all interactions. Modify lesson pacing, lesson content, and organizational routines to meet diverse instructional needs. Monitor and differentiate instruction based on student achievement, state requirements, and program expectations. Review, grade, and provide high-quality, personalized, and instructionally -focused feedback on student work. Provide immediate intervention to students who are struggling and adjust the intensity, frequency, and nature of interventions and enrichment based on student performance. Monitor student response to intervention regularly, document results, and follow the process for referring any students not making progress to the Student Support Team. Therefore, due to staffing constraints, Connections' wide range of courses may not be fully offered during the first and second years of school operations. Granting ARCA's licensure and professional development waiver requests to allow teachers licensed in a state other than Arkansas to instruct ARCA students would help to alleviate this issue. Regardless of the licensure and professional development waivers, ARCA's initial high school cohort will have access to a full course load that will allow students to graduate on time under Smart Core requirements and by the start of this initial cohort's 12th grade year, ARCA will offer all 38 required units, less any waived requirements. 9 Explain what is offered in the first and second years to ensure that students on an accelerated pathway will be served. Applicant Response: ARCA intends to meet the needs of all students who enroll, including those on an accelerated pathway. To ensure accelerated students will be served, students will be able to take above grade level courses, gifted and talented course offerings (in grades 2-8), honors level courses (in grades 9- 12), and AP courses (in grades 9-12). The Connections program is highly unique in that middle school students have previously been offered and completed courses as advanced as Algebra II. Online students have these opportunities without the typical challenge of transportation to a high school campus and concern about the age gap among students. Waiving teacher licensure and professional development requirements to allow instruction by teachers licensed in a state other than Arkansas will help ensure accelerated students have access to additional advanced courses. ARCA is asking for a waiver from Standards for Accreditation 9.03.1.2 and 9.03.4 because the school will not initially serve all high school grades. However, advanced high school courses already exist in Connexus and may be made available to students. Should accelerated high school students wish to take above grade level courses, those courses will be offered pending ARCA Board and teacher approval. Accelerated students will be identified during the formulation of their Personalized Learning Plans (PLP). During enrollment, Academic Placement Advisors and School Counselors will review students' past records and performance to place them in appropriate courses. The PLP will be developed collaboratively by the teacher, Learning Coach, and student to tailor curriculum and instruction. Throughout the year, teachers will monitor students' progress and adjust their learning programs to identify areas where students need to improve and areas in which they can build on their strengths. Remaining issue : It remains unclear what gifted and t alented course s will be offered and who will teach them . C7: EDUCATIONAL PROGRAM The Educational Program section should describe the educational foundation of the school and the teaching and learning strategies that will be employed. Evaluation Criteria: A clear description of the proposed educational program, including but not limited to the foundational educational philosophy and curricular and instructional strategies to be employed; An educational program with ample resources to ensure that students achieve academic goals and excel; Revenue to pay for all curriculum expenses as outlined in the budget; and A description of the grade levels and maximum enrollment, by year, if the charter plans to grow over time 10 Fully Responsive Concerns and Additional Questions Explain which Connections courses have not been approved by the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Eligibility Center and how this information is routinely conveyed to students, parents, and the community. Applicant Response: The NCAA Eligibility Center only approves courses in the areas of language arts, math, science, social studies, and world languages that are needed to meet NCAA graduation requirements (a total of 16 core courses). In addition, the NCAA does not approve courses taught \"below the regular academic level\" and therefore Connections' Foundations courses are not approved, as they are considered below Connections' regular (college-prep) academic level. Connections maintains a list of its 75 NCAA approved courses; all other Connections courses not on the list can be considered NCAA non -approved courses. Connections' 75 NCAA-approved courses are communicated to families in variety of formats such as the school website, the main Connections Curriculum website,1 and in the school's Virtual Library. Families can also check the NCAA's public website where submitted approved and non- approved courses are displayed. All submitted but non-approved courses show the reason for not being approved. Because Arkansas requires more credits for graduation than the NCAA requires for eligibility, NCAA-interested students can take courses outside of the NCAA approved courses. The Manager of Counseling will be responsible for communicating the NCAA approved/non -approved courses to families and students. The Manager of Counseling will also help ensure students pursuing NCAA eligibility are placed in NCAA-approved courses to meet NCAA graduation requirements and placed in appropriate NCAA non-approved courses to meet state graduation requirements. Explain the discrepancies as the mission statement, key programmatic features, curriculum description, ALE and gifted discussion, and teacher staff qualifications sections of the application state that teachers will be licensed, but the applicant requests a waiver of teacher licensure requirements. Included in the explanation of the licensure waiver request is the statement, \"ARCA estimates that over 90% of course enrollments will be taught by Arkansas- licensed staff, as this is a goal jointly shared by the Board and Connections.\" Applicant Response: Please see response to Part B Executive Summary. Confirm or correct the grade levels and maximum enrollment by year in the following table: School Year Grade Levels Maximum Enrollment 2016-2017 11 Applicant Response: ARCA confirms the grade levels and maximum enrollment by year in the above table are appropriate. C8: CURRICULUM ALIGNMENT The Curriculum Alignment section should define the process by which the charter will ensure that the curriculum aligns with Arkansas Curriculum Frameworks and state standards. Evaluation Criteria: Evidence that the applicant has a process to ensure all curriculum materials , used in the educational program, align with the Arkansas Department of Education's curriculum frameworks and the state standards Fully Responsive Concerns and Additional Questions Provide information on the way that each course, has been mapped to the Arkansas Curriculum Frameworks, other than the seven courses previously approved by the ADE to be offered digitally. Applicant Response: To ensure alignment to the Arkansas Curriculum Frameworks, the appropriate standards are first identified.2 Connections' alignment specialists create templates that contain the standards and the course to be aligned. Working through the course, an alignment specialist reviews each lesson in the course, course materials, resources, multimedia, and assessments to notate where each standard is addressed. It is important to note that this is not simply a keyword search, but an in-depth analysis of the course content and a manual mapping of the standards to the course content. Once the alignment is completed, Connections conducts another review to ensure accuracy and, if necessary, adjustments are made as previously described in the response to C.6. Alignments are updated annually, or sooner if a change in standards necessitates. Completed alignments are housed in Connections' Virtual Library and are made available to teachers to guide their instruction. As a result of the alignment process, lessons and/or units may be created to enhance an existing alignment or further support students' mastery of the content. Remaining issue: The information does not provide assurance that courses/materials are completely aligned with the Arkansas Curriculum Frameworks. *Access the Curriculum Framework Alignment Documents for Arkansas Connections Academy Courses by using the following URL: https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B4jUQm3oumJpa0lWaFRnNks2dkU/view?usp=sharing 12 C9: STUDENT SERVICES The Student Services section should describe how the school will address specific services for its student body. Evaluation Criteria: A description of the ways in which the following services will be provided to students even in each area for which a waiver is requested : A guidance program that will serve all students; A health services program that will serve all students; A plan for a media center for use by all students; Sound plans for educating special education students that reflect the full range of programs and services required to provide such students with a high quality education; A transportation plan that will serve all eligible students; An alternative education plan for eligible students, including those determined to be at-risk and to offer access to one or more approved Alternative Learning Environments; A plan to serve students who are English language learners; and Plans for a gifted and talented program for eligible students Fully Responsive Concerns and Additional Questions Explain the discrepancies as the mission statement, key programmatic features, curriculum description, ALE and gifted discussion, and teacher staff qualifications sections of the application state that teachers will be licensed, but the applicant requests a waiver of teacher licensure requirements. Included in the explanation of the licensure waiver request is the statement, \"ARCA estimates that over 90% of course enrollments will be taught by Arkansas- licensed staff, as this is a goal jointly shared by the Board and Connections.\" Applicant Response: Please see response to Part B Executive Summary. Define the term \"mentor\" as used on page 37 of 77. Applicant Response: The mentor assigned to ARCA will be a Connections Special Education Senior Manager with experience implementing special education procedures and instruction in a virtual environment. The mentor will provide support, training, and modeling for the ARCA Special Education Manager. The mentor will not provide any direct service to students. Confirm that mentors providing direct service to special education students will have special education certification. 13 Applicant Response: The mentor will not provide any direct service to students. C10: GEOGRAPHICAL SERVICE AREA The Geographical Service Area section must outline the impact of a new school opening within the current public education system. Evaluation Criteria: The specific geographical area that would be served by the charter school; and Information on the school districts likely to be affected by the charter school, including data on the expected number of students to transfer to the charter school Fully Responsive C11: ANNUAL PROGRESS REPORTS The Annual Progress Reports section should define how the academic progress of individual students and the school as a whole will be measured, analyzed, and reported. Evaluation Criteria: A timeline for data compilation and completion of an annual report to parents, the community and the authorizer that outlines the school's progress; and A plan for dissemination of the annual report to appropriate stakeholders Fully Responsive C12: ENROLLMENT CRITERIA AND PROCEDURES The Enrollment Criteria and Procedures section should describe how the school will attract and enroll its student body, including any criteria for admission and enrollment. Applicants must also describe the random, anonymous lottery selection process. Evaluation Criteria: A student recruitment plan that will provide equal opportunity for all parents and students to learn about and apply to the school; An enrollment and admissions process that is open, fair, and in accordance with applicable law; A clear and transparent to the public process for, and a guarantee of, an annual random, anonymous lottery process should there be more student applications than can be accommodated under the terms of the charter; and The method by which parents will be notified of each child's selection for the school or placement on the waiting list. 14 Fully Responsive Concerns and Additional Questions Describe the timeline for enrolling, the date of the lottery, and the process for notifying parents about each child's selection or order on the waiting list. Applicant Response: The open enrollment period will begin on 3/1/16 and end on 4/1/16. If the school is oversubscribed, a lottery will be held on 4/11/16. The parents of selected students will receive an email confirmation within five business days after the lottery and must confirm student attendance within 10 business days of the receipt of the email. Students without confirmed attendance within 10 business days will forfeit their slots to the next eligible students on the waiting list. The parents of students who are not selected will be notified within five business days after the lottery that their students are on the waitlist. Movement from the waitlist is based on availability in a student's grade level and also allows for sibling enrollment preference. Because of this, parents will be notified when an opening is available based on the grade level opening or sibling preference. If the school is not oversubscribed by the end of the open application period, no lottery will be held and ARCA will continue to accept applications and admit eligible students in the order in which they complete all enrollment tasks, based on availability in their respective grade clusters. Again, once the enrollment limit has been met, students will be placed on a waitlist and allowed to enroll if space becomes available in their grade cluster. Siblings of enrolled students will receive preference on the waitlist. Should this arrangement conflict with any present or future state law or ADE policy, the ARCA Board will adopt changes to ensure compliance. Confirm that if a lottery is necessary, the names of all students who apply by deadline will be drawn, and once grade level capacity is reached, names will be placed on a waiting list in the order drawn. Applicant Response: ARCA confirms that if a lottery is necessary, the names of all students who apply by deadline will be drawn, and once grade level capacity is reached, names will be placed on a waiting list in the order drawn. For each grade cluster, a computer program developed by Connections using Microsoft Excel will randomly select a student name from the pool of enrollment applicants for that grade cluster until the number of available slots is filled, or the pool of enrollment applications is exhausted. As each student in a grade cluster is selected, siblings of that student who have also completed the applicable enrollment steps, excluding course placement, will be accepted as long as a slot in their grade cluster is available. When all available slots in a grade level have been filled, students not selected will be placed on a waiting list in the order in which they were drawn in the random lottery. These students will have until a pre-determined date to complete the enrollment process or forfeit their space on the waitlist. Children of Founding Board Members and siblings of enrolled students will be given enrollment 15 preference. Up to five spaces will be held for the children of Founding Board Members and will be released if not filled by a published date. The children of Founding Board Members who were not exempt from the lottery process and were not accepted in the lottery will be placed on a Founder Preference List. These students will be given the first opportunity to enroll as space becomes available. Students on this list with the lowest lottery number will be placed first. Waitlisted siblings of selected students will be offered enrollment after students on the Founder Preference List, as space becomes available. Again, students on this list with the lowest lottery number will be placed first. ARCA will then offer enrollment to all students on the waiting list in the order drawn. Should this arrangement conflict with any present or future state law or ADE policy, the ARCA Board will adopt changes to ensure compliance. Explain how the charter will ensure the lottery is transparent to the public. Applicant Response: ARCA is committed to informing all interested parties of its open enrollment period and potential lottery dates through publication on the ARCA website. If a lottery is required at the conclusion of the open enrollment period, ARCA will provide lottery information on its website and the subsequent steps for enrollment. Because ARCA would use a computer program developed by Connections for any lottery, Connections would make this program available to the ADE for inspection upon request. C13: PRIOR CHARTER INVOLVEMENT The Prior Charter Involvement section should identify all prior charter involvement, if any, for each individual connected with the proposed charter. Evaluation Criteria: A complete Prior Charter Involvement Template for each individual connected with the proposed charter; Accurate data in each Prior Charter Involvement Template, including active links to assessment data Fully Responsive C14: STAFFING PLAN The Staffing Plan section should describe the job duties of the school director and other key personnel. This section should also describe the professional qualifications which will be required of employees. Evaluation Criteria: A job description for the school director and other key personnel, including but not limited to 16 an operations director, board members, teachers, etc.; An outline of the professional qualifications required for administrators, teachers, counselors, etc.; A staffing plan that clearly outlines both the types and numbers of positions to be filled at the school and salary scales for such positions, and The staffing plan presented in this section matches the staff members noted in the budget Fully Responsive Concerns and Additional Questions Provide the minimum qualifications that will remain unchanged for the following positions: o Principal; o Assistant Principal; o Administrative Assistant; o Manager of Special Education; o Manager of Counseling; o Teachers; o Advisory Teacher/School Counselor; and o Special Education Teachers. Remove \"or related Education Field\" given that Special Education teachers must be licensed in Special Education. Applicant Response: Principal (contracted position) - Minimum Qualifications Administrative credential strongly preferred Minimum of five years teaching experience and some administrative/management experience Online teaching experience is preferred Advanced degree is preferred Excellent communication skills, oral and written Ability to work well in fast paced environment Technologically proficient Assistant Principal (contracted position) - Minimum Qualifications Administrative certification preferred Minimum of five years of relevant work experience Some operational/logistical experience and/or administrative/management experience Relevant advanced degree is preferred Education experience Excellent communication skills, oral and written Technologically proficient 17 Administrative Assistant (contracted position) - Minimum Qualifications Proficient with Microsoft tools and web-based applications Ability to multitask in a fast paced environment Good interpersonal skills and attention to detail Excellent communication skills, oral and written High degree of flexibility Ability to work well in fast-paced team environment Manager of Special Education (contracted position) - Minimum Qualifications Masters' Degree in Special Education or related Education Field Valid Special Education credential in Arkansas Teaching experience in Special Education Expertise in special education law and compliance Experience in IDEA administration Excellent communication skills, oral and written Demonstrated ability to work well in fast paced environment Technologically proficient Manager of Counseling (contracted position) - Minimum Qualifications Minimum of 5 years teaching experience, some counseling/management experience Arkansas Counseling Credential endorsement Advanced degree Technologically proficient Excellent communication skills, oral and written Ability to work well in fast paced environment K-5 and 6-12 Teachers (contracted position) - Minimum Qualifications Licensed to teach (appropriate to grade and subject level responsibilities). If ARCA does not receive a waiver to licensure requirements, all teachers will be licensed in Arkansas. If ARCA does receive a waiver to licensure requirements, some classes that would otherwise not be able to be offered to ARCA students due to low student enrollment may be taught by teachers who are licensed in states other than Arkansas. Strong technology skills Excellent communication skills, oral and written Demonstrated ability to work well in fast paced environment Team player track record Ability to work some occasional evening hours, as needed to support some families 18 Advisory Teacher/School Counselor (contracted position) - Minimum Qualifications Arkansas teacher certification in a secondary content area or grade level or Arkansas Counseling certification Strong technology skills Excellent communication skills, oral and written Excellent attention to detail and organizational skills High degree of flexibility Team player with demonstrated leadership skills Ability to work well in fast-paced environment Special Education Teachers (contracted position) - Minimum Qualifications Degree in Special Education Valid Special Education credential in Arkansas Experience in policy (IDEA) and/or administration with Special Education Strong technology skills Excellent communication skills, oral and written Ability to work well in fast paced environment Explain the discrepancies as the mission statement, key programmatic features, curriculum description, ALE and gifted discussion, and teacher staff qualifications section of the application state that teachers will be licensed, but the applicant requests a waiver of teacher licensure requirements. Included in the explanation of the licensure waiver request is the statement, \"ARCA estimates that over 90% of course enrollments will be taught by Arkansas- licensed staff, as this is a goal jointly shared by the Board and Connections.\" Applicant Response: Please see response to Part B Executive Summary. Explain how 1.8 FTE's of a position can perform all special education services required for a charter with a student population of 600. Applicant Response: ARCA has revisited special education staffing assumptions and made adjustments. These adjustments are reflected in the new Budget Template, which has been submitted to the ADE. ARCA projects that 11% of enrolling students will present with IEPs, matching the Arkansas 2013- 14 State Report Card's statewide percentage of students eligible to receive special education. The adjustments to special education staffing assume that students with IEPs who enroll in ARCA will present a range of disability types and service needs. ARCA projects a breakout by disability similar to that of other school supported by Connections, as show in Figure 3. 19 Figure 3. Percentage of Students by Disability Type Disability Type Percent Specific Learning Disability 44% Other Health Impaired 15% Autism 13% Emotionally Impaired 11% Speech language Impaired 10% Cognitive Disability 5% Multiple Disability 1% All other disabilities 1% ARCA expects that students' IEPs will identify a range of services that include speech language therapy, co-teaching, itinerant instruction, resource services, and special class services options. Special education teacher staffing will be reviewed weekly during each school year. ARCA will adjust staffing based on the number of students who enroll with IEPs and students who are evaluated by ARCA and determined to be eligible for special education and related services. This process of weekly staffing review and adjustment will ensure ARCA remains in compliance with ADE Rules regarding Special Education and Related Services, particularly Section 17.03 Maximum Teacher/Pupil Caseloads. For the 2016-17 school year, ARCA anticipates 66 students with IEPs (11% of 600) will enroll. Special education staffing will include a Manager of Special Education and 2.2 FTE special education teachers. During 2016-17, the Manager of Special Education will have 0.4 FTE special education teaching responsibility that first year, for a total of 2.6 special education teacher FTE. The remaining 0.6 FTE for the Manager of Special Education will be dedicated to leading the school in special education compliance and providing instructional leadership for students with disabilities. For the 2017-18 school year, ARCA will have a full-time Manager of Special Education as well as 5.1 FTE special education teachers. ARCA anticipates these five special education teachers will teach 132 students (11% of 1200). Explain how mentors, mentioned in the discussion of Special Education, fit in the staffing plan. Applicant Response: The mentors mentioned in the Special Education section do not factor into the ARCA staffing plan. They are not ARCA employees and do not provide any direct services to students. A mentor is a Connections Special Education Senior Manager with experience implementing special education procedures and instruction in a virtual environment. The mentors provide support, training, and modeling for ARCA's Manager of Special Education. 20 C15: BUSINESS AND BUDGETING PLAN The Business and Budgeting Plan section should describe how the charter school will organize its business office and manage its fiscal responsibilities. Evaluation Criteria: An appropriate plan for managing procurement activities; A description of the personnel who will perform business duties, including the requisite qualifications of any proposed personnel; A realistic timeline and process by which the governance structure will review and adopt an annual budget; A balanced two-year budget estimate that accurately reflects the revenue currently available to the school and expenditures for program implementation and does not rely on one-time grants or other funds that are not presently guaranteed; A budget that includes costs for all personnel, programs, and expenses described in other sections of the application; An understanding of the minimum number of students required for financial viability and a contingency plan to provide the education program outlined in the program if fewer students than necessary for viability enroll and/or attend; and Plans to pay for unexpected but necessary expenses Fully Response Concerns and Additional Questions Provide the minimum number of students required for financial viability and describe a contingency plan to provide the education program outlined in the application if fewer students than necessary for viability enroll and/or attend. Applicant Response: ARCA projects it will require a minimum of 50 students enrolled by June 2016 to be financially viable for the 2016-17 school year. In the unlikely scenario that fewer than 50 students are enrolled by June 2016, the ARCA Board will ask the ADE for permission to delay its opening by one school year. Connections' enrollment team will work with enrolled families to find the best available educational alternatives. ARCA believes enrollment above this level will make the school financially viable. ARCA's budgeted expenses will be largely variable rather than fixed and thus able to flex up and down with enrollment. Further, Connections has pledged to protect ARCA from deficits by offering \"service credits\" (discounts on Connections products and services) as needed. A letter from the Connections CFO was provided in Attachment 12 of the submitted application. ARCA is confident about student/family demand for online learning in Arkansas and in the schools outreach plan supported by Connections program to increase awareness statewide. In Connections' 13+ year history of supporting schools, there has never been a school that has closed its doors due to concerns about lower than expected enrollment. 21 Given that Special Education funds can only be used to provide services to Special Education students, provide a detailed breakdown of the funds in the \"Special Education Oversight and Support fee\"; specifically, explain how the funds will be distributed for G/T, English Language Learners (ELL), and Special Education. Applicant Response: ARCA and Connections acknowledge that special education funds can only be used to provide services to special education students. In the Connections Standard Fee Schedule (Attachment 16), there are two fees related to Special Education: Special Education Oversight and Support - 2.5% of all revenue from governmental sources, excluding any special education revenue Special Education Direct Services - 100.0% of all special education revenue Special education revenue supports the provision of special education services. The Special Education Oversight and Support fee specifically excludes special education revenue so that these funds may be used in other ways. Special Education Oversight and Support includes: Special Education Protocol Development Special Education Training and Professional Development Special Education Oversight and Compliance Support IEP Management Software and Support Assistive Technology Procurement Special Education Service Provider Coordination Accessibility Support 504 Plan Guidance Gifted Program Support At-Risk Population Support Services Homeless and Migrant Support ELL Support (provided by ESOL/TESOL certified leaders and teachers) School Counseling Support This list of services funded by the Special Education Oversight and Support fee does include support for Special Education and other at-risk populations. This will supplement the 100% of special education funding that will be dedicated to special education services. 23 Provide a detailed breakdown of the monies budgeted to pay to Connections Academy of Arkansas, LLC in the expenditures related to administration, regular classroom instruction, special education, and maintenance and operations. Applicant Response: Administration - See Budget Line see budget line 19 (V-AD 1) - Connections Academy of Arkansas, LLC in Attachment 6 Revised 2015-16 amount is $435,740 and revised 2016-17 amount is $869,105.

Evaluation Criteria: An identified facility appropriate to meet the needs of the school over the term of its charter; A realistic plan for remodeling or adapting a facility, if necessary, to ensure that it is appropriate and adequate for the school's program, the school's targeted population, and the public; Evidence that the school understands the costs of securing and improving a facility and has access to the necessary resources to fund the facility plan; and A sound plan for continued operation, maintenance, and repair of the facility 45 For schools that will be using district-owned facilities, a response that meets the standard will present: Documentation that the school district and charter school officials are in agreement over the use of the facility and its equipment For schools that will NOT be using district-owned facilities, a response that meets the standard will present: Documentation that the property owner and school are in agreement over the use of the facility and its equipment; A statement of the facilities' compliance with applicable codes; and A detailed outline of any relationships between the property owner and: o Members of the local board of the public school district where the charter school will be located; o The employees of the public school district where the charter school will be located; o The sponsor of the charter school; and o Employees, directors and/or administrators of the charter school Fully Responsive Concerns and Additional Questions Explain how and where students will be accommodated to take the state assessments. Applicant Response: ARCA students will participate in state proficiency tests depending upon grade level. The school will set up in-person, proctored locations throughout the state based on the geographic locations of the student population. While the teaching/learning center in Bentonville may potentially be enlisted as a testing site, most testing will occur at other locations. Testing sites may include locations such as hotel conference rooms, public library meeting rooms, local schools if available, private tutoring and learning centers, and local colleges. Test sites will be easy for families to find, safe, secure, and ideally will provide free parking. Geographic population maps will be created to identify areas where testing sites are needed based on student population. Sites will be reviewed annually to adjust for an increase in student population. Students will be assigned to a testing center. If a family has transportation issues and is not able to make it to a testing site, ARCA will work with the family to make accommodati ons and may help them travel (via public transport). Through the Educational Products and Services Agreement, Connections will provide testing support. Connections currently provides services to approximately 33 virtual and blended public schools, some of which have successfully administered state tests for over 10 years. Connections maintains and distributes a National State Testing Best Practices Manual to help facilitate the testing process. In addition, ARCA will create a State Testing Master Plan each year. The testing plan will address the tests, testing schedule, testing sites, student registration, test security, site security, and Special Education accommodations. 46 All staff that proctor tests will be trained on the specific state rules and requirements for testing. This training will be conducted synchronously by the school's Testing Coordinator with staff members at least two to three weeks before testing commences. Each staff member will acknowledge via a data view in Connexus that they have been trained and understand the importance of maintaining test security. Tests will be kept secure in the teaching/learning center. Paper and pencil tests, when transported to students throughout the state, will be moved in locked cases (like a locked suitcase or other device). Teachers will be trained to stay with their tests throughout the testing process. The ARCA Special Education Manager will implement students' IEP/504 accommodations at the testing site. The Special Education Manager will ensure the testing site can meet the accommodations and that there are enough staff scheduled to provide the accommodations. Any test administrator who proctors state assessments to Special Education/504 students will be trained in how to administer the test and provide accommodations.

All staff will be subject to background checks and the Code of Ethics for Arkansas Educators. Teachers will be licensed in Arkansas except for those situations where an in-state teacher cannot be identified or for classes with low student interest (e.g. foreign language & AP courses). In those circumstances, ARCA intends to utilize the resources of Connections' private school, which employs teachers who are licensed in the states they reside. This will enable ARCA to offer the full Connections' catalogue of courses to its students. ARCA estimates that over 90% of course enrollments will be taught by Arkansas-licensed staff, as this is a goal jointly shared by the Board and Connections. While certified administrators will be sought, the Board would like the discretion to hire the best leader for the school that is available. This will increase student achievement by providing students with the most effective teachers and a robust catalogue of courses. Legal Comments: Other sections of the application indicate that teachers will be licensed. Page 4 Red=Waivers not previously requested, need additional discussion, or have remaining issues Green=Waivers pr eviously granted, no remaining issues Information provided by Applicant is in italics. Applicant Response: ARCA teachers will all be licensed educators. ARCA is requesting waivers of teacher licensure requirements so that some classes that would otherwise not be able to be offered to ARCA students may be taught by teachers who are licensed in states other than Arkansas. All teachers will be subject to required background checks and the Code of Ethics for Arkansas Educators, regardless of state licensure. This arrangement would allow ARCA to offer more courses from Connections' catalog while maintaining the teacher quality indicated by state licensure. There may be courses for which an Arkansas-licensed teacher cannot be identified or courses with lower student interest (e.g., AP courses and advanced and low incidence world languages, CTE courses, and electives). In such instances, ARCA could still offer these courses using the resources of Connections' private school (iNACA), which employs teachers who are licensed in the states they reside. ARCA anticipates these instances would affect very few students and only for the better, as students could enroll in courses that would not otherwise be offered. ARCA estimates over 90% of course enrollments, or 9 out of 10 seats in courses, will be taught by a teacher licensed in Arkansas. For example, if 500 students enroll in six courses each (3,000 total course enrollments), no fewer than 2,700 of those course enrollments (90% of 3,000) would be taught by a teacher licensed in Arkansas. If these teacher licensure waivers are not granted, all ARCA teachers will be Arkansas-licensed. This would not affect the viability of the ARCA program but would limit some of the courses available to students. Remaining Issues: None 6. Business Manager Qualifications ARK. CODE ANN. \u00a76-15-2302 General Business Manager ADE Rules - Business Manager Qualifications ARCA anticipates contracting with Connections for financial management services, which will include a business manager responsible for the fiscal operations of the public charter school. The Connections financial services team maintains a sterling record with charter finance experience in 17 states and will support ARCA under the direction of its Board-designated treasurer through its team of professional staff, many of whom possess CPA and/or CFE designations. Contracting with Connections for a business manager will avoid potential duplication of effort, enabling the school to direct resources to its educational program.

This model which consists of competitive salary, incentive compensation based on school outcomes, responsibility -driven stipends, a rich benefit plan, and a flexible paid time off program, is tailored to the unique aspects of a virtual school setting and will enable ARCA to attract, retain, and promote staff who share our vision of a focus on student outcomes.

Professional development ADE Rules - Professional Development Emergency Rule Effective July 1, 2014 ADE Rules - Advanced Placement and International Baccalaureate Diploma Incentive Program 4.00 Standards for Accreditation 10.01.3 Required Time for Instruction and School Calendar Standards for Accreditation 15.04 Professional Development and In-Service Training ARCA's teachers who are not licensed in Arkansas will complete required professional development as a condition for maintaining their state licenses. Teachers licensed in other states and providing instruction in an area where a state-based teacher could not be found or in courts with low student interest (e.g. foreign language and AP courses) will receive professional development in their own home states. This will increase student achievement by providing students with most effective teachers and a robust catalogue of courses. Legal Comments: Rationale should be provided to explain how these waivers will help the Applicant achieve its goals. The Applicant should describe the training and professional development it will offer its staff. Applicant Response: ARCA teachers who are licensed in Arkansas will meet all ongoing continuing education requirements to maintain their licensure. If the licensure waiver is approved, teachers who are licensed in a state other than Arkansas will meet continuing education requirements in their state(s) of licensure. These waivers to Arkansas professional development requirements for those teachers licensed in a state other than Arkansas will help ARCA meet its goals by allowing students to enroll in courses that would not otherwise be offered. In addition to state requirements, Connections will provide additional training and professional development to ARCA teachers. These training and professional development sessions will include best practices in education as well as training specific to teaching in an online environment and supporting at-risk student populations. Research on effective professional development indicates that professional development must be intensive, ongoing, and connected to practice. Connections provides a systematic approach to professional learning for all teachers. ARCA staff will participate in Connections' Page 7 Red=Waivers not previously requested, need additional discussion, or have remaining issues Green=Waivers pr eviously granted, no remaining issues Information provided by Applicant is in italics. Foundations for Teaching program to make a transition from teaching in a brick-and-mortar school to teaching online. This professional development will help ARCA teachers learn about the school year cycle and associated tasks and become familiar with instructional tools and resources that are used to engage learners. The following training modules must be completed by new teachers in Connexus within the first 30 days of employment: Teacher Orientation Accessibility for All - a module focusing on Exceptional Children and their needs, including 504 and IDEA compliance Internet Safety Training Students in Distress - a module focusing on the wellbeing of students including recognizing and responding to physical, emotional, and sexual abuse, child neglect, depression, suicide, and cyberbullying Special Education, English Language Learner (ELL), and Gifted/Talented teachers will receive additional training and professional development related to serving their respective student populations in an online environment. Designated professional development days will have a specific focus and additional professional learning support will be available on a daily basis. Teachers will have multiple opportunities for seeking assistance and support with instructional strategies for engaging students and families, making decisions based on data, and completing school year cycle tasks in a timely and efficient manner. ARCA will have multiple levels of ongoing support from the Connections' Instructional Services Department. Listed in Figure 1 are the training and professional development programs and initiatives that may be facilitated throughout the school year following the time table and topics noted in each section. Topics covered in School Support training correspond with specific times of the school year. Each session is one hour in length. Figure 1.

These are open to all teachers who are looking to expand their skill sets. Sessions are designed for specific content areas, grade level teams, or experience levels. The optional learning experiences are designed as multi-part series or stand-alone sessions, depending on their content.

Class Size and Teaching Load Standards for Accreditation 10.02 Class Size and Teaching Load ARCA educators utilize Connections' curriculum and assessments rather than preparing their own and will not face the typical challenges of classroom management, as instruction is delivered online. The Board will adopt class size and teaching load requirements that are more appropriate for an online setting to allow for a more effective allocation of school funds. ARCA proposes the following specific alternative maximum student-to-teacher ratios: Teachers (K-5) - 50:1 Teachers (6-8) - 38:1 Advisory Teachers - 300:1 Special Education Teachers - 35:1 Legal Comments: Special Education standards regarding class size and teaching load cannot be waived. Applicant Response: The ARCA Board acknowledges that Special Education standards regarding class size and teaching load cannot be waived and withdraws that portion of the waiver request. ARCA proposes the following specific alternative maximum student-to-teacher ratios: Teachers (K-5) - 50:1 Teachers (6-8) - 38:1 Advisory Teachers - 300:1 ARCA will comply with Special Education class size and teaching load requirements authorized by A.C.A. \u00a76-41-309 and specified in ADE Rules - Special Education and Related Services 17.00 Program Standards, specifically Section 17.03.1.2.

The ratio required for brick-and-mortar schools in which counselors and students must meet face-to-face is not necessarily appropriate for a full- time online program. The Board believes in the importance of guidance and counseling services and will ensure appropriate staffing levels are maintained. One or more properly certified guidance counselors will be on staff, but the services provided to students can be distributed differently among staff. Advisory teachers (estimated 300:1 ratio) will handle most course scheduling and post-graduation planning support. Legal Comments: None Remaining Issues: None 15. School Boards ARK.

The ARCA Board will allow board members to call in to a pubic conference line for quorum and/or voting to ensure statewide representation on the board. Connections will be the employer of school leader, even though he/she will serve at the pleasure of the Board. This flexibility will allow the Board to focus on student achievement. Legal Comments: None Remaining Issues: None 16. Commodity Bidding ARK. CODE ANN. \u00a76-21-301 et seq. Acquisition of Commodities Generally ARCA intends to contract with Connections for provision of its education program. Connections' education program integrates technology, curriculum, instructional materials and tools, staff, and support services into a single education services offering. The Connections program is proprietary and Connections is the only source from which ARCA can obtain access to the Connections education program. ARCA believes that this service offering falls within the single source exemption of ACA \u00a7 6-21-05. Because of the unique nature of the Connections education program, the Board would prefer RFP requirements be waived only for its contract with Connections. This will increase student achievement as ARCA will have more time to establish its program. All other purchases will be subject to ACA \u00a7 6-21-01 et seq. Should this waiver not be granted, ARCA will follow the required RFP process for a contract with an educational service provider. Legal Comments: None Remaining Issues: None 17.

Any new depository would be redundant and the expenses passed onto the school would be better spent serving ARCA students. Legal Comments: The Applicant should explain why these waivers are necessary and how they will help the Applicant meets its goals. Applicant Response: A.C.A. \u00a76-21-406(b) and ADE Rules Governing Instructional Materials Section 6.02 require that publishers doing business in the State of Arkansas maintain at least one book depository in Arkansas. ARCA anticipates contracting with Connections which already maintains a national array of depositories linked by an efficient logistics network. A waiver is necessary because maintaining a book depository in Arkansas would be redundant to Connections' operations. Connections is already able to store and ship instructional materials for ARCA students with its existing depositories. As such, requiring a redundant depository would increase costs to Connections and ARCA without any benefit to students. If this waiver is granted, ARCA would allocate those school funds that would have funded a depository to other services that the ARCA Board decides will best support students. This financial flexibility will help ARCA meet its goals for student academic success. If this waiver is not granted, ARCA and Connections agree to comply with A.C.A. \u00a76-21-406(b) and ADE Rules Governing Instructional Materials Section 6.02 and will take the steps necessary to do so. Remaining Issues: None 18. Annual Progress Report Publication ARK. CODE ANN. \u00a76-15-2006(b) Annual Report Standards for Accreditation 7.02.2 School District Goals ARCA will operate as a statewide school making it cost-prohibitive to publish a report in newspapers with general circulation in all served districts. ARCA will report to parents online and to the State Board of Education in writing which will be more effective in engaging parents. Legal Comments: None Remaining Issues: None 19.

The online nature of ARCA does not lend itself to a group Period of Silence or recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance. Time is available for students to do so individually. Legal Comments: None Remaining Issues: None 20. Adult Education Standards of Accreditation 19.04 ARCA may make a summer school available depending on student need and demand but will not offer an adult education program. The ARCA Board prefers to focus on serving students in grades K-12, from which an adult education program may distract. Legal Comments: None Remaining Issues: None 21. Material Allotment to Teachers ARK. CODE ANN. \u00a76-21-303(b)(1)(A) Rules [Acquisition of Commodities Generally] ARCA teachers will not have traditional classrooms and will be provided with the materials necessary for class activities. Legal Comments: Applicant should provide rationale of why this waiver is necessary and how it will help the Applicant achieve its goals. Applicant Response: A.C.A. \u00a76-21-303(b)(1)(A) requires a school district to provide to each PK- 6th grade teacher for use in his or her classroom or for class activities the greater of $500 or $20 per student enrolled in a teacher's class for more than 50% of the school day at the end of the first three months of the school year. A waiver is necessary because ARCA teachers, who will teach in a fully-online environment, will not need to spend out-of-pocket on their virtual classrooms or class activities. ARCA anticipates contracting with Connections for instructional materials, which includes materials for class activities (e.g., science kits, math manipulatives, and art supplies). If this waiver is granted, ARCA would allocate a portion of those school funds that would have been provided for teachers' classrooms and class activities to other services that the ARCA Page 17 Red=Waivers not previously requested, need additional discussion, or have remaining issues Green=Waivers pr eviously granted, no remaining issues Information provided by Applicant is in italics. Board decides will best support students. This financial flexibility will help ARCA meet its goals for student academic success. ARCA may implement procedures akin to those required by A.C.A. \u00a76-21-303(b)(1)(B), whereby teachers may draw from or be reimbursed from a discretionary fund. These procedures would be set by the ARCA Board and may target core subject teachers or teachers serving high- need students. If this waiver is not granted, ARCA agrees to comply with A.C.A. \u00a76-21-303(b)(1)(A) and will adopt the procedures necessary to do so. Remaining Issues: None 22. Eye and Vision Screening ARK. CODE ANN. \u00a76-18-1501 et seq. Mandated Eye and Vision Screening Procedures and Tests for Children ADE Rules - Eye and Vision Screening Report in Arkansas Public Schools ARCA students will not be physically present at the teaching/learning center to receive eye and vision screening exams. Should these waivers be denied, ARCA will comply with state law and ADE rules in one or more of the following ways: contracting with screening providers in students' local areas, subsidizing households to provide for screening, proving for screening at sites where students will be present (e.g. state assessments, field trips). Transportation may be provided for those families who require it in a similar fashion to state assessments procedure. Legal Comments: None Remaining Issues: None 21. Secondary Units Offered Standards for Accreditation 9.03.1.2 and 9.03.4 ARCA will not initially serve all secondary grades. ARCA's initial high school cohort will have access to a full court load that will allow students to graduate on time under Smart Core requirements. By the start of this initial cohort's 12th grade year, ARCA will offer all 38 required units, less any waived requirements. Legal Comments: None Remaining Issues: None Page 18 Red=Waivers not previously requested, need additional discussion, or have remaining issues Green=Waivers pr eviously granted, no remaining issues Information provided by Applicant is in italics. 22. Secondary Units Offered - Instrumental and Vocal Music Standards for Accreditation 9.03.4.5 ARCA will not offer a unit of instrumental music or a unit of vocal music. ARCA will offer at least 3 \u00bd fine arts units better suited to an online environment, which will benefit student achievement.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Provide the mission statement of the proposed school. Briefly describe the key programmatic features that the school will implement in order to accomplish the mission. Arkansas Connections Academy (ARCA) will offer families throughout the state access to a quality education by providing the personalized learning inherent in a high quality online school. ARCA will provide a complete public school experience for students in grades K-12 focusing on the students' academic growth, social and emotional needs, and post-secondary goals. The school will embody multiple hallmarks of excellence: a rigorous curriculum aligned to the Arkansas Curriculum Frameworks; licensed teachers actively engaged with students and families; and an educational management system designed to provide accountability through data collection, analysis, and reporting. In \"The Rise of Online Education\" Clayton Christensen and Michael Horn observed, \"...[T]he rise of online learning carries with it an unprecedented opportunity to transform the schooling system into a student-centric one that can affordably customize for different student needs by allowing all students to learn at their appropriate pace and path, thereby allowing each student to realize her fullest potential.\" (Clayton Christensen and Michael Horn. \"The Rise of Online Education\". Washington Post, 11 October 2011. Available at <http:// www.washingtonpost.com/national/on-innovations/the-rise-of-online-education/2011/09/14/ gIQA8e2AdL_story.html>) ARCA will provide students with a student-centric, whole-school experience with academic, behavioral, emotional, and post-secondary supports. The personalized approach to learning will benefit each and every student, including those who struggle academically as well as high achievers. The placement process will ensure that each learner is provided with the most appropriate curriculum, pacing, teaching approach, and support from the first day. ARCA's full-time public school experience will include licensed teachers, award-winning curriculum aligned to the Arkansas Curriculum Frameworks, and personalized learning plans for each student. ARCA will promote academic and emotional success for all learners by combining the best in online education with real and engaging connections among students, families, teachers, and the community. Students at all grade levels participate in clubs, activities, field trips, and electives. In addition, high school students will have individualized and supported progression plans focused on college and career readiness in order to realize their full potential after graduation.Applicant Response:Applicant Response:Page 5 of 77C.NARRATIVE DESCRIPTION OF THE PROPOSED CHARTER SCHOOL The applicant for the proposed charter school, if approved by the authorizer, agrees to operate the educational program described below in accordance with the provisions described within this document, Arkansas Code Annotated \u00a76-23-101 et seq., the State Board of Education Rules Governing Public Charter Schools, and the attached assurances. Provide a narrative description of the various components of the proposed charter school by responding to the following prompts: 1. Describe the results of the public hearing, which was held for the purpose of assessing support for the establishment of this public charter school. Provide copies of supporting evidence. Applicant Response: The ARCA Board hosted three public hearings to assess support for its charter application: July 17, 2015 at 6:00 PM Holiday Inn Express & Suites Bentonville 2205 S.E. Walton Blvd Bentonville, AR 72712 July 18, 2015 at 2:00 PM Hilton Garden Inn North Little Rock 4100 Glover Lane North Little Rock, AR 72117 July 27, 2015 at 9:00 AM Holiday Inn Express & Suites Bentonville 2205 S.E. Walton Blvd Bentonville, AR 72712 The July 17th public hearing in Bentonville was attended by six people. Board President Dennis Beck spoke about the effectiveness of online learning. The audience discussed the flexibility available to students in an online school, particularly in pursuing extracurricular activities, and the differences between a public online school and homeschooling. It was made clear to the audience that while there is flexibility in scheduling coursework, ARCA will have required state assessments, certified teachers, and a curriculum aligned to state standards. The July 18th public hearing in North Little Rock was attended by three people. The audience had some prior knowledge of online schools from speaking with parents of student-athletes in other states and previous enrollment with other providers (both private and public). The response to the presentation was overwhelmingly positive, with interest in the personalized instruction, IEP services, and connections with other students. The July 27th public hearing in Bentonville received two RSVPs but was unattended. Evidence of Public Support Exhibited at the Hearing There were nine attendees at the hearings. Response at the hearings was positive and participants made the following comments: \"I've heard great things about Connections from [Oklahoma, Louisiana, and Texas] parents at gymnastics meets. I wish Arkansas had this option too.\" \"We need the flexibility but I don't want to homeschool. I really like that you have certified teachers and NCAA accreditation.\" \"I think my son would learn better with the one-on-one attention.\" \"My son wants to be an FBI agent and was told he needs to study Chinese, Arabic, and computer programming. It's great you can offer those across the state.\" \"There are so many parents out there who don't even know about this option who are going to love it.\" Page 6 of 77Documentation of Required Notices Published to Garner Public Attention Copies of the notices are provided in Attachment 2. The notice for the first and second public hearings ran in the Arkansas Democrat Gazette (statewide edition) on 6/21/15, 6/28/15, and 7/5/15.

Applicant Response: ARCA acknowledges the Charter Authorizing Panel and the State Board of Education are both authorizing agents for charter schools in the State of Arkansas. ARCA will be governed by an independent Board of Directors specially trained and supported to serve in this role. The Board will be responsible for negotiating and overseeing all contracted services, including those provided by Connections Academy (a division of Connections Education, collectively referred to as Connections throughout this application), the proposed educational services provider for the school. ARCA received non-profit 501(c)(3) status in January 2015 and is eligible to sponsor a public charter school in Arkansas (documentation provided in Attachment 1). The school will conduct its affairs as a governmental entity Page 8 of 77exempt from federal income taxes under Section 115 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code or any successor law.

Carla Hartwell, Board Secretary, is a parent of three children, former substitute teacher, and homeschooler of her second child. Carla has experience as a Learning Coach with her middle child, who was previously enrolled in Arkansas Virtual Academy with much success. She strongly believes in providing online learning options for all Arkansas children and expects to enroll her youngest child in Arkansas Connections Academy. Relationship between Board of School and Board of the Sponsoring Entity The Board of the school (ARCA) is the same as the Board of the sponsoring entity (Arkansas Connections Academy, Inc.). ARCA is a standalone corporate entity with non-profit status and is not a division or part of the Arkansas Department of Education (ADE). The relationship between ARCA and the ADE will be based on the terms of the charter. The Board anticipates a positive and effective relationship with the ADE and the State Board of Education. Board of Directors Roles and Responsibilities The Board will have all the powers and duties permitted by law to manage the business, property, and affairs of the school and to adopt policies by which the school will be governed. The Board will be responsible for assuring that the school operates according to its charter and applicable law. ARCA will be a fully autonomous, fully accountable public charter school. The Board will have the tools and resources necessary to ensure a combination of autonomy and accountability. The Board will oversee the charter and use appropriate access to student performance data (abiding by student data privacy laws and regulations) as well as frequent reporting on school operations and finance to carry out its tasks. The Board will monitor such data closely to ensure that the school is meeting its academic performance goals and remaining operationally effective and fiscally sound. The entire Board will have academic performance as its purview; the Treasurer will serve as first reviewer of fiscal data; and the Board will appoint members to monitor operations issues such as staffing and facilities during both the start-up and implementation phases. The Board will hold its partners and vendors accountable for performance, and will in turn be accountable to the ADE. The operating structure of ARCA will be similar to that of a traditional educational environment. The Board will oversee and support the Principal and administrative team, who while implementing the policies and procedures of the Board, will in turn supervise and support the teaching staff. The Board will oversee the management of the charter school and be legally accountable for its operations. The Board will set policy and select contractors, including those providing the school's day-to-day operations, curriculum, technology, and instructional services. ARCA anticipates contracting with Connections for educational and operational support, with the approval and oversight of the Board. Working with the Principal and School Leadership Team, Connections will hire and employ the instructional staff with Board approval. The Board will be responsible for ensuring that all aspects of the financial and programmatic accountability systems fulfill the school's obligations to the ADE and to stakeholders. The Board will meet approximately ten times per year in open session to fulfill its duties and may create subcommittees or task forces to carry out special tasks. ARCA's instructional leader will be the Principal, who will be selected by the Board and serve at its pleasure but will be employed and supervised by Connections under the guidance of the Board. The Principal will build Page 9 of 77consensus as well as inspire teachers to teach, students to learn, and parents to engage in their children's learning. The Principal is responsible for overall school operation, working with parents, students, support staff, and teachers. The Board evaluates the Principal annually and, based on that evaluation, approves the Principal's compensation. The Board is supported in the evaluation process by Connections. Since the Board selects, evaluates, approves compensation for, and retains the power to fire the Principal, the Board has influence over the Principal. Policies and Procedures for Board Operation Board Composition The Board will consist of parents, educators, and business and community leaders who are committed to bringing a high-quality, highly accountable online public school to Arkansas. The founding members may recruit additional members to form a diverse and well-balanced Board. The Board will be deemed public agents authorized by the State Board of Education to supervise and control the charter school. The Board will be comprised of no fewer than three and no more than seven voting members. No member of the Board will be an employee or independent contractor or otherwise be compensated by ARCA or its partner, Connections. The Board intends to recruit at least one parent of an enrolled student to serve as a member. Each Board member brings unique skills and expertise to support ARCA and to make decisions regarding operations of the school, including budgeting and curriculum. ARCA will be a statewide school and as such, the Board members have community ties across the state. The wide range of expertise on the Board demonstrates the capacity for initial start-up operations and the successful launch of the school for fall 2016. The officers will be a President, a Treasurer, and a Secretary. All will be voting Board members. The members will choose officers in accordance with the Bylaws. Member Term Length Members will serve staggered terms of one, two, or three years. The Board may renew a Member with an expiring term for an additional three-year term. Member Selection The Board is self-perpetuating with new members selected by the Board as membership terms expire. Any member of the greater Arkansas community may seek election to the Board of Directors, with the exception of employees of ARCA, employees of Connections, and any person who has been convicted of a felony. The Board anticipates selecting members through an involved review process which includes identifying and interviewing interested candidates to ensure eligibility and that the candidates are supportive of the school's mission. During an open meeting, the Board will meet with the candidates as described in the Bylaws. The Board members shall be elected at any duly organized meeting of the Board by a majority of the Directors then in office. Roles and Responsibilities The Board sets policy and selects contractors, including those providing management, curriculum, technology, personnel, and instructional services. The Board will be responsible for assuring that all aspects of the financial and programmatic accountability systems fulfill the charter agreement. The Board will: Create and monitor the vision/mission of the school Set Board and school policy Govern the operations of the school Practice strategic planning Select contractors, negotiate service agreements, and hold contactors accountable for performance under such agreements Assess the school's performance Exercise sound legal and ethical practices and policies Ensure that the school adheres to the same safety, civil rights, data privacy, and disability rights requirements as are applied to all public schools operating in Arkansas Comply with state and federal reporting requirements Manage assets, revenue, and liabilities wisely and in compliance with applicable state and federal laws Ensure adequate resources for administration, teachers, and students and manage them effectively Oversee, protect, and defend the legal interests of the school Page 10 of 77 Advocate good external relations with the ADE and its Charter Office in the Division of Learning Services, the State Board of Education, school districts, parents, students, media, and the wider community Once the charter is approved, the Board expects to attend trainings and meetings as may be appropriate to governing the school. Members will have the opportunity to attend national conferences such as the annual International Association for K-12 Online Learning's (iNACOL) Virtual School Symposium on Blended and Online Learning and the National Charter School Conference, as well as training sessions conducted by groups such as Greater Capacity Consortium and Above Board Training. Training topics will include charter school governance, non-profit management, conflicts of interest, budgeting and financial oversight, effective meetings, policy development, and human resources oversight. Board members will participate in national conferences to network with other charter school board members and further their development as effective board members. School administrators and staff will also support the school. School administrators and staff will be employed by Connections through a professional services agreement, but will serve at the pleasure of the Board. The employee wages related to these positions, which are 100% dedicated to ARCA, will be reimbursed to Connections at cost. The school will be staffed with the following positions: Principal Assistant Principal(s) Administrative Assistant(s) Manager of Special Education Manager of Counseling Qualified Teachers Advisory Teachers/School Counselor(s) Special Education Teachers Involving Parents, Staff, Students and Community Administrators, faculty, parents, students, and community members will provide leadership and input in school decision-making. The Board will meet approximately ten times per year in open, public session to ensure transparency in operation. Administrators lead the school, direct the goal setting and improvement planning process, and create a positive education environment conducive to student academic success and teacher professional growth. Administrators ensure compliance with applicable state and federal law and regulations. Faculty members participate in the leadership of the school through professional learning communities (PLCs) and provide direct feedback and guidance to administrators. Extensive professional development ensures faculty members are familiar with best practices for online instruction and also provides an opportunity for instructors to provide input to the school. Faculty members will be responsible for serving Special Education and English Language Learner (ELL) students. Teachers also influence the curriculum and instruction of the school by: Collaborating with the Curriculum team to review planning documents Reviewing and providing feedback on unit and lesson content Evaluating lesson/assessment alignment Providing suggestions for Curriculum Based Assessments and LiveLesson session content Parents actively participate in the school and with the Board. The Board may create ad hoc parent/Learning Coach advisory groups to provide guidance on particular subjects such as community partnerships and neighborhood outreach. Parents are also encouraged to be involved with the Board's activities. The schedule and agenda for all Board meetings will be posted to the school website. ARCA will make all Board minutes available to families on request and will report on Board activities in the newsletter. The Board will aim to have at least one parent of an ARCA student on the Board. The Board will also have a public comment policy to support parent interaction. Volunteer parents will serve as Community Coordinators and develop a vibrant and active school community. In addition to facilitating family get-togethers and formal field trips, Community Coordinators and ARCA staff will also reach out to community-based organizations and businesses to coordinate face-to-face community service opportunities. Students and families will have the opportunity to participate in regular field trips and outings throughout the state, so that all students may join. Once students have enrolled, administrators will select field trip locations based on the location of students throughout the state. Field trips may include visits to the Page 11 of 77Arkansas Arts Center in Little Rock, the Arkansas River Valley Nature Center in Fort Smith, the Garvan Woodland Gardens in Hot Springs, the Heifer Ranch & International Learning Center in Perryville, and the University of Central Arkansas Archives in Conway. ( http://www.arkansas.com/kids/parents-teachers/field- trips.aspx ) Community Coordinators provide an important communication link between families and the school, ensuring through phone conferences and news updates that school staff are attuned to needs of the parent community. Parental feedback is an important hallmark of the school's outreach and information sessions in the community. The school will take full advantage of this valuable communication with families to ensure that the school reflects their unique needs and creative ideas. Parent satisfaction will be a main focus of the Board. ARCA families will be given an annual opportunity to participate in a thorough parent satisfaction survey, conducted by an independent market research firm. The school will aim for at least 90% of families to agree that the curriculum is high quality and that they are satisfied with the educational program and instruction. The independent evaluation results are used to ensure effective parent satisfaction with the program. Faculty and administration use these results to undertake continuous school improvement and focus on areas where improvement is needed. Parent satisfaction is key to monitoring the success of the program. An independent February 2015 survey of families with students enrolled in schools supported by Connections found the following: 95% of parents agree that the curriculum is high quality 95% of parents agree that their children are satisfied with the program 96% of parents are satisfied with their teachers' helpfulness 93% of parents are satisfied with the variety of learning activities 93% of parents would recommend Connections Academy to other families 93% of parents agree that our technology tools improve their child's learning experience Students provide feedback on courses and teachers. Input will be gathered on an ongoing basis via StarTrack. A StarTrack box requesting text feedback and ratings on a five-star scale is embedded in virtually every lesson in the curriculum and on the home page for each Learning Coach. Data gathered from this feedback is examined carefully and acted upon by school staff and Connections. As of March 2015, 736,049 lesson ratings have been submitted during the 2014-15 school year in schools supported by Connections, with an average rating of 4.20 out of five stars. Community members are crucial to the planning process of the school, as well as its operation. The Board has actively solicited feedback from the community. The school will continue to take full advantage of valuable community partnerships to ensure that the school reflects the needs and wishes of the wider Arkansas community. The school will actively seek out community organizations to partner with and provide real connections among students and the community. As part of the planning process for the school, the following community organizations were contacted to see if they would be interested in collaborating: Arkansas Hospitality Association Northwest Arkansas Council William J. Clinton Presidential Library Pea Ridge National Military Park Arkansas Studies Institute Janet Huckabee Arkansas River Valley Nature Center Fort Smith National Historic Site Little Rock Central High School National Historic Site Information was provided to educate and inform these organizations about ARCA's unique school model and to find opportunities to work together. The Board plans to continue these discussions after the school has been approved and identify specific activities in which students may participate. A. (1) The Board will have final decision-making authority for the school in the areas of finance, and purchasing. Page 12 of 77(2) and (3) The Principal will have final decision-making authority in the areas of student discipline and hiring and firing of staff, with the advice, recommendation, and approval of the Board. (4) The Board will have final decision-making authority in the hiring and firing of a school Principal. The Board will govern ARCA and maintain responsibility for ensuring that the charter school program meets all of the educational, fiscal, and programmatic goals outlined in the charter. The Board, with input and guidance from school leadership, will decide matters related to the operation of the school, including budgeting, curriculum, and operating procedures. The Principal will run the day-to-day operations of the school. The Principal, in consultation with the Board and following the Board-approved Employee Handbook, will be the final decision-maker in employment matters. Connections will ensure that all personnel undergo required background checks before they are employed in the school. The Board will approve pay scales, performance criteria, a performance appraisal system, and disciplinary policies for all employees. The Board will ensure that the school adheres to the same safety, civil rights, data privacy, and disability rights requirements as are applied to all public schools operating in Arkansas. The Board will also be responsible for ensuring that the public as well as students, parents, and employees have the ability to communicate appropriately with the Board in keeping with state law and regulation. New policies may be suggested by parents, school staff, or others, but the development of those policies will be the responsibility of the Board with advice from its independent legal counsel. The Board will be well-informed regarding Charter School Law, ADE Policy, and operating policies established by the Charter Office in the Division of Learning Services. Such knowledge is imperative for the Board to make appropriate policy decisions that will affect the operation of the school and the work environment for students and staff. The Board is a non-profit entity with 501(c)(3) status. By conferring this status to the Board, the IRS validates the independence of the school's corporation. ARCA is not related to nor is it a part of a holding company system and the Board does not include, and will never include, an employee or former employee of Connections. B. The Board plans to contract with Connections to recruit the Principal (the final decision-maker identified in A(3)) and provide human resource services, including recruiting, to ensure ARCA is staffed by well-trained and effective online learning professionals. Daily management of the school will be the Principal's responsibility, while overall governance is the responsibility of the Board. The Board will annually evaluate the Principal's performance. Annual performance will be based upon meeting school goals, staff evaluations, and input from Connections based upon their experience interacting with Principals and supporting successful online school programs nationwide. The Board will adopt pay scales, performance criteria, a performance appraisal system, and disciplinary policies for the Principal. C. ARCA's leadership will also be accountable to the parents. The parents will participate annually in a survey to provide feedback and input to the school. The Board will also institute a parent grievance resolution process to ensure parent needs are met and issues are addressed.Page 13 of 773. Give the mission statement for the proposed charter school. Arkansas Connections Academy (ARCA) will offer families throughout the state access to a quality education by providing the personalized learning inherent in a high quality online school. ARCA will provide a complete public school experience for students in grades K-12 focusing on the students' academic growth, social and emotional needs, and post-secondary goals. The school will embody multiple hallmarks of excellence: a rigorous curriculum aligned to the Arkansas Curriculum Frameworks; licensed teachers actively engaged with students and families; and an educational management system designed to provide accountability through data collection, analysis, and reporting.Applicant Response: 4.Describe the educational need for the school by responding to the following prompts. Complete the following charts to include 2014 literacy and mathematics performance assessment data and graduation rates for the district in which the charter would be located and the schools closest to the proposed charter.

Be certain to include the source for information presented. Applicant Response: Valid, Reliable, and Verifiable Data Substantiate an Educational Need for the Charter Per the ADE's guidance, we are providing two sets of data for comparison in this application. The first set, provided in the tables herein, pertains to the Bentonville Public School District where the physical teaching/ learning center will be located. In the second, provided in Attachment 14, we provide data for statewide averages. ARCA will operate as a K-12 statewide online public school, meaning its positive impact will not be constrained to the Bentonville Public School District. As such, in this section of our application, we address the statewide data provided in Attachment 14. We also address the specific benefits for those students in school districts statewide, including Bentonville, in need of a flexible and personalized online public school option. In the subsequent section, which asks for a demonstration of need in districts not represented in the previous charts, we consider the statewide benefits provided by ARCA. The school will address an unmet need for students to be educated outside of traditional brick-and-mortar schools, substantiated by the dramatic growth of online public schools across the country. According to the 2014 Keeping Pace Report, 30 states plus Washington DC have fully online schools operating statewide in 2014-15. Statewide virtual schools had about 740,000 course enrollments in 2013-14. About 315,000 students took all of their courses online in 2013-14, growing 6.2% from 2012-13. ( http://www.kpk12.com/states/ ) ARCA will serve students who want or need a full-time online educational environment for a variety of reasons, including: Students not on pace with their peers in school, including students coping with social issues. High-achieving students who wish to take AP, language, and elective courses that may not be offered locally Students who have been bullied or subjected to unwanted social pressures. Students with special learning needs. Arkansas reported in 2014 that 11% of students qualified to receive Page 16 of 77special education services. (https://adesrc.arkansas.gov/ReportCard/View?lea=AR&schoolYear=2014) As shown previously in the charts, these students significantly lag in proficiency rates. Students undergoing medical treatment or are homebound due to illness or physical/emotional disability. Students in rural communities who may spend several hours on a school bus each day and lack access to public school options. According to the Rural School and Community Trust, 40% of Arkansas students are rural (http://www.ruraledu.org/user_uploads/file/2013-14-Why-Rural-Matters.pdf) Students with family livelihood responsibilities. According to Kids Count, there were 288,969 students qualifying for free and reduced lunch in 2014, representing a large population that may need flexibility for the parents' or students' work. (http://datacenter.kidscount.org/data/tables/256-number-of-students-receiving- free-and-reduced-school-lunch?loc=5#detailed/2/any/false/869,36,868,133/any/9778) Participation rates in the FRL program are higher in rural areas. Students who need a more flexible learning environment, including students pursuing artistic or athletic careers. Some of these students will enroll for a shorter period of time then return to their previous schools; others will choose to stay enrolled as long as is appropriate for their child. In the 2014-15 school year, there were 476,083 public school students across Arkansas. ( http:// www.arkansased.org/about-ade/fast-facts ) In the majority of districts, families are assigned to their closest school, regardless of fit, and homeschooling is the only alternative. Families in some districts have limited choices based on local charter school availability. As of now, only 2,000 Arkansas students are able to enroll in the state's sole full-time online public school option (an average of 165/grade for the whole state). The choice of a second online public school will encourage online schools, as well as traditional schools, to innovate. There is strong demand in Arkansas for alternatives and in particular for online education. Since January 2011, without any marketing or parental outreach efforts, over 4,000 Arkansas families have expressed interest in learning more about a Connections program once available. The Board anticipates that a broad range of students from across the state will enroll once information about the school is widely available. ARCA's student population may have an over-representation of students who are struggling academically or credit deficient and would benefit from an individualized program. As indicated in the statewide data provided in Attachment 14, economically disadvantaged students and Students with Disabilities do not perform as well as their peers. Schools supported by Connections have performed particularly well with these underserved populations. Among all schools supported by Connections, low-income students in nearly 80% of school grades outpace the statewide reading performance for low-income students. Schools supported by Connections also have substantial experience serving students with disabilities. Nationally, these schools serve an average of 9.8% of students with IEPs, with percentages as high as 18%. Schools supported by Connections have also demonstrated their high quality in surrounding states and are the top-performing online schools in neighboring Texas and Louisiana. ( http://ritter.tea.state.tx.us/perfreport/ account/2013/statelist.pdf ) (http://www.louisianabelieves.com/data/reportcards/2013/ ) ARCA will provide opportunities for students who may have otherwise been unsuccessful in their educational and non-academic goals. Supporting the academic and non-academic goals of students will ultimately have a positive impact on individual student's lives and the state's economic future. View the videos at the following URLs for personal stories from online school students attesting to how online schooling helped them succeed: Tori is a cancer survivor and high school student who has aspirations to become a speech pathologist. (http:www.connectionsacademy.com/our-program/students/tori-hornick.aspx) Beau is a high school student who chose to attend an online school to avoid the bullying he experienced in his brick-and-mortar school. (http://www.connectionsacadem y.com/our-pro gram/students/beau-patterson.aspx ) If the performance of students at schools and or/districts not noted in the previous charts demonstrate the need for the charter, provide the student performance data and its source and explain.Page 17 of 77Applicant Response: In addition to supporting students in each school district, ARCA will also meet the needs of students and families statewide, bringing new courses, particularly college-level and career/technology electives, to students who previously lacked access to these courses. A high-quality statewide online school leverages excellent teachers and curriculum to meet the needs of students who need this option. ARCA will bring opportunities similar to what is currently provided at Louisiana Connections Academy (LACA), a school supported by Connections in Louisiana. LACA students have access to: Advanced Placement\u00ae(AP) courses, including several in STEM subjects such as calculus, statistics, computer science, biology, and environmental science Foreign languages, including courses that many Arkansas students are not typically offered, such as Chinese, Japanese, German, French, and American Sign Language Technology courses such as Emergent Computer Technology, Engineering Design, and Game Design Career/Technical courses that allow students to explore future career interests in business, law, criminal justice, medicine, management, and marketing In addition to these courses, ARCA can offer students anywhere in the state dozens of clubs and activities as well as resources that will help prepare them for the global economy. The personalized approach at ARCA will help students develop critical skills, including independent thinking and problem solving. Students are also able to collaborate with people in their community and potentially across the globe. Students will have access to more than 27 clubs and 14 special events (e.g., talent shows, virtual art galleries, cards for hospitalized children) through which they can explore interests beyond the classroom, develop leadership skills, and make friends within the school. An online yearbook allows each student to create a personal page including photos, videos, responses to poll questions, and autographs collected from friends. Clubs and activities include online and in-person meetings. Some of the online clubs and activities include: Art Club: The Art Club sparks students' creativity by exploring art, photography, and graphic design. Students explore the nuances of each medium and have opportunities to create and share their own creative designs. Optional LiveLesson sessions let students interact with art experts. This club is available to students in grades 6-12. Broadcast and Theater Arts Club : Students in grades 6-12 learn about choreography, set design, and tech crew for on- and off-Broadway productions. Working both individually and collaboratively, students are encouraged to write their own plays and musical scores. Students also learn about the history of and trends in broadcast media, exploring print, audio, and video mediums. LiveLesson sessions provide opportunities for students to share their theatrical talents as well as segments similar to those on television news magazines. Career Club: The Career club encourages students to learn about potential careers and explore fields that interest them. The club enables middle school students to enter high school with a direction in mind, making them more likely to embrace and succeed in a high school program that prepares them to pursue their career interests. At the high school level, this club facilitates the identification of a career goal and guides students to the postsecondary education needed to achieve it. Chess Club: Club members learn, socialize, and play in an atmosphere of friendly competition. After completing an online tutorial for either beginner or advanced players, students are matched with competitors of the same skill level and the games begin. Students can even play in a national tournament on an exclusive Connections site. College Planning Club: Designed for students in grades 9-12, this club helps those students who plan to attend college develop a portfolio that focuses on elements sought by college admissions committees. First Generation Student Club: Exclusively for high-achieving students who aspire to be the first in their families to graduate from college, this club provides high school students mentoring, advice, and personal development activities to help them prepare for a challenging and successful future. Leadership and Global Awareness Club: Students in middle and high school who are natural leaders in their communities are challenged to take on a leadership role at the state, national, and international levels. Students meet regularly to discuss, plan, and share service learning projects and outcomes. Additionally, students learn about various global cultures historically and presently in an effort to better prepare themselves for careers and lives in our global economy. Page 18 of 77In addition to clubs and activities, ARCA will produce monthly newsletters that celebrate student and school successes, showcase student work, provide tips from teachers, and highlight upcoming events. ARCA will apply for a chapter of the National Honor Society. Of schools supported by Connections nationwide, 19 are members of the National Honor Society and 15 are members of the National Junior Honor Society. Students who have demonstrated outstanding talent in the performing arts, competitive sports, or math and science will have the opportunity to flourish in the school's proposed Talent Networks devoted to fostering focused growth. The Talent Networks will give exceptional students the opportunity to network with other students in their areas of interest. The programs will also provide guest speakers, collaborative projects, activities, and competitions to help students excel in their fields. ARCA will focus on post-secondary plans for high school students. Graduates of schools supported by Connections have been accepted at Hendrix College, the University of Central Arkansas, University of Alabama, Savannah College of Art and Design, Louisiana State University, Southern Methodist University, University of California, Berkeley, Yale University, Tulane University, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and hundreds of other colleges. The counselor(s) will work with post-secondary institutions to arrange college explorations for ARCA students. All of these features will help students statewide and ensure ARCA does its part to improve student outcomes. Describe three (3) innovations that will distinguish the charter from other schools. Applicant Response: ARCA's instructional methods, educational philosophy, and program include many unique elements. ARCA anticipates contracting with Connections for educational and operational support, with the approval and oversight of the Board. Connections' program includes: Education Management System Connexus\u00ae Education Management System (EMS) : Connexus will be the platform for organizing and supporting the school's entire educational environment. This proprietary, web-based software delivers assignments and tracks activity (whether on or offline) while monitoring the completion of individual lessons as well as the mastery of discrete skills and knowledge. This all occurs under the watchful eye of administrators, teachers, and Learning Coaches. Data-driven homepages provide teachers and administrators real time data to facilitate personalized instructional programming. Connexus operates within a secure technology infrastructure, protecting data from loss and intrusion while maintaining a safe environment. Students and Learning Coaches will access Connexus to organize, document, and interact, ensuring an unprecedented level of time-on-task documentation. New releases and updates are automatically provided. StarTrack: This integrated rating system allows every student, Learning Coach, and teacher to rate each lesson in which they engage from one to five stars and to give detailed feedback. Progression Plan: A Progression Plan, automated in Connexus, will define and track requirements that must be accomplished to meet a goal. Teachers and counselors will use four-year academic progression plans for students to ensure they are on target for graduation and for meeting their college and career goals. In the future, progression plans will also be used to track speech therapy goals and completion of middle school courses. WebMail: This proprietary email system is securely located within Connexus. Students, Learning Coaches, and teachers may only use it to communicate with each other, protecting them from spam, contact from strangers, and other mainstream email issues. Student Performance Data Student Status/Escalation Process : The school will track and report ongoing student progress based on objective data generated by Connexus. Staff will analyze attendance, participation, performance, assessments, and teacher contact. The student status is displayed on the home page for instant identification of potential problem areas. The Escalation Process goes into effect when students are in Page 19 of 77statuses other than \"On-Track\" in order to ensure students are effectively participating and learning. Intervention Indicators: Intervention Indicators will be displayed on the teacher home page in Connexus to facilitate teachers' ability to identify students who may be in need of an instructional intervention. These indicators are data-driven codes and are the first phase of a multi-phase initiative to facilitate teachers' ability to ensure that all students learn at high levels of achievement. These codes will be used to identify at-risk students, determine and implement appropriate instructional interventions, and monitor the effectiveness of interventions. Assessment Objective Performance Reports (AOPR): These reports will provide real-time student performance data on essential skills and standards based upon individual math, language arts, and science assessment items. These reports identify the objectives students should master by the end of a grade level based upon the Arkansas Curriculum Frameworks and display students' performance against the objectives. Data can be sorted to identify students who have or have not mastered specific objectives. Curriculum-Based Assessments : The program will use eight curriculum-based assessments (CBA) via telephone conversation per year as a quick and effective way to gather additional information on students' understanding of concepts. Diagnostic curriculum-based assessments (DCBA) pinpoint strengths and weaknesses in student mastery of concepts and verification curriculum-based assessments (VCBA) gauge authentic student learning of concepts previously graded as successfully completed. Longitudinal Evaluation of Academic Progress (LEAP) : LEAP is a technology-facilitated pre-, mid-, and post-test that will be used for students in grades K-8. LEAP will provide essential diagnostic information for developing and planning instruction. It will provide an early read on a student's performance on state- mandated tests, and report key accountability data on student progress. Instructional Model Personalized Performance Learning (PPL): This instructional process creates a unique learning experience for each student. During enrollment, Academic Placement Advisors and School Counselors will review students' past records and performance to place them in appropriate courses. A Personalized Learning Plan (PLP) will then be developed collaboratively by the teacher, Learning Coach, and student to tailor curriculum and instruction. Throughout the year, teachers will monitor students' progress and adjust their learning programs to identify areas where students need to improve and areas in which they can build on their strengths. SSTAIR: This instructional model links curriculum, standards, assessments, and interventions that have a direct impact on student mastery and resulting assessment performance. The SSTAIR program targets Essential Skills/Standards by subject/grade level, uses specified assessments within the curriculum to measure student mastery of these skills and standards, provides tiered interventions for non-mastered skills and standards, and tracks students' response to the implemented interventions by skill/standard. SSTAIR is an acronym for Skills, Standards, Assessments, Intervention, and Response. Multi-tiered Intervention: The school will employ a multi-tiered intervention model so that every student has access to the resources they need to be successful: Tier 1 - Core Instructional Program; Tier 2 - Supplemental Programs and Supports; Tier 3 - Alternative Support Programs. Student Support Teams will meet regularly to develop an intervention plan and strategies for improvement for students who are struggling. Learning Coach: A parent, extended family member, or similarly qualified adult designated by the parent/ guardian selected during the enrollment process who will work in person with the student under the guidance of the certified teacher. The Learning Coach and student will interact with the teacher via telephone, WebMail message, LiveLesson sessions, and in-person meetings. The school will provide a unique login and ongoing training to help the Learning Coach carry out this important role while making optimal use of the available technology tools and professional teacher support. Connections' \"Get Coaching\" program provides direct support to Learning Coaches through its three program components: Learning Coach Resources (synchronous and asynchronous), Learning Coach Link (monthly newsletter), and Learning Coach Central (web-based site for connecting Learning Coaches to one another and essential resources). LiveLesson\u00ae Session: A real-time, interactive web conferencing tool, LiveLesson sessions allow teachers to work synchronously and directly with individual or groups of students using voice-over IP, chat, electronic whiteboard, and shared web surfing based on Adobe\u00ae Connect. Teachlet\u00ae Tutorials: Teachlet tutorials are proprietary, interactive, asynchronous graphic/video/audio tutorials, incorporated into most lessons to provide students a dynamic, fun, and engaging way to learn the concepts they need to master learning objectives and standards. Students learn best in a safe and positive environment in which they are respected, accepted, valued, and Page 20 of 77nurtured as unique individuals and challenged to achieve their full potential. Students succeed academically when instruction is tailored to their unique needs and when they are supported by adults who are committed to their success. The centerpiece of instruction at ARCA will be the Personalized Learning Plan (PLP), which provides for individualized instruction tailored to the learning needs of each student. Supported by Connexus and student performance data, the school will use the PLP and a variety of interventions to ensure students are on track and thrivin g academicall y. On the following table, list the specific measurable goals in reading, reading comprehension, and mathematics, based on the state mandated assessments, and any other assessment tools if used, for improving student academic achievement for each year of the public charter school's initial five-year period. For each goal, include the following: The tool to be used to measure the academic performance; The level of performance that will demonstrate success; and The timeframe for the achievement of the goal.5.Page 21 of 77GOALAssessment Instrument for Measuring PerformancePerformance Level that Demonstrates AchievementWhen Attainment of the Goal Will Be Assessed 1) Proficiency 3-5: Official published state test proficiency rates for school grades 3-5 will meetACT Aspire 0.90 ratio of school results to state averages on ACT Aspire.

ARCA will have specific, measurable, and attainable objectives for success based upon the academic progress of its students and the school's performance on several academic measures. Attaining Goals Demonstrates that ARCA is Meeting Educational Need and Fulfilling its Mission By attaining these goals, the school will fulfill its mission of offering students access to a quality education. ARCA will support a complete public school experience for students by focusing on students' academic growth, Page 22 of 77social and emotional needs, and post-secondary goals. ARCA administration will use Connexus, the EMS provided by Connections, to closely monitor the school's overall success and ensure students are on track for success on state assessments and the ACT. The Principal, in collaboration with school staff and the Connections administrative support team, will develop a list of measurable annual school goals that are designed to ensure continuous improvement. The Board will approve these goals and the performance of the Principal and staff will be measured in part against them. As a public school, ARCA will measure and annually report the academic achievement of all students, as well as the ongoing progress and performance of cohorts and the school as a whole. ARCA students will participate in state proficiency tests depending upon grade level . The school will set up in-person, proctored locations for state testing. State assessment data will be reported through the ADE and logged in Connexus to complete a data snapshot of student academic performance. The school will periodically account for its progress against its student performance goals to all stakeholders, including parents/guardians, the ADE, and community. In addition, the Board may contract with an outside evaluator (such as a university) to assess the school's overall performance against its mission on a longer-term basis. In addition, in an effort to ensure transferability of credits, ARCA will apply for accreditation through the Southern Association of Colleges and School Council on Accreditation and School Improvement (SACS CAS) within the first three years of operation. This accreditation is similar to those received by other schools supported by Connections. Responsibility for monitoring, evaluating, and adhering to the school's assessment policies and practices will follow a traditional model. Teachers will have primary responsibility for administering assessments and providing feedback to administrators. The Principal will oversee the assessment program and work with education specialists in evaluating and making recommendations for changes. The Board will have ultimate responsibility for ensuring that the school is fulfilling the expectations and obligations under charter school law, its charter, and Board-approved school policy. Valid and Reliable Assessment Approach to Measure Progress Toward Goals Each student will be assigned an Advisory Teacher/School Counselor who, in collaboration with the Learning Coach, develops a Personalized Learning Plan for each student and closely tracks their overall academic progress. Student academic progress will be tracked on a daily basis via online discussions, quizzes, tests, science labs, and portfolio items to ascertain mastery of the material. They will also track other parameters of student success, such as attendance and participation. In keeping with the school's mission and overall educational priorities, ARCA will utilize ongoing online and offline assessments to measure student progress and a technology-based assessment tool to measure student gains over the school year. The Board understands and will ensure the school will comply with the statewide system of assessment and accountability applicable to all Arkansas public schools. The following paragraphs describe the assessments ARCA will use to evaluate the progress of students and cohorts toward school goals. State Testing: ARCA will meet all requirements for state-mandated assessments. In keeping with the school's mission and overall educational priorities, ARCA will utilize ongoing online and offline assessments to measure student progress and a technology-based assessment tool to measure student gains over the school year. The Board of Directors will ensure the school complies with the statewide system of assessment and accountability applicable to all Arkansas public schools. Whenever possible, state standardized test results will be integrated into an incoming student's basic information in Connexus. Likewise, results for state standardized tests that students take while enrolled at ARCA, which are proctored face-to-face at a physical location, will be included in Connexus, along with internal pre-, mid-, and post-test data. This data will be used to track student progress from year to year and within the year, and to inform the course placement and instructional needs of students. Assessment Objective Performance Reports (AOPR): This report provides real-time student performance data on essential skills and standards based upon individual math, language arts, and science assessment Page 23 of 77items. The report will identify the objectives students should master by the end of that grade level based upon the Arkansas Curriculum Frameworks and display students' performance against the objectives. Data can be sorted to identify students who have or have not mastered specific objectives. Teachers can run this report as frequently as they like to see exactly how students are progressing with regard to each of the skills and standards for that subject and grade. This method: Enhances the multi-tiered instruction model Identifies essential skills and standards by subject/grade level Identifies how and where these essential skills and standards are assessed within the program Supports a Response to Intervention model Provides access to and analysis of real-time data to determine mastery/proficiency Incorporates data-driven decisions throughout instruction Maximizes use of the instructional support programs, resources, and data; identifies tiered interventions for non-mastered/proficient skills and standards, and identifies students' response to the implemented interventions LEAP: LEAP provides essential yearly progress diagnostic information for developing the PLP and planning instruction. It provides an early predictor of performance on state-mandated tests and reports key accountability data on progress throughout the academic year. This assessment tool, updated annually based on a review of student performance on specific questions, is a web-based criterion-referenced test which gives teachers diagnostic results on reading and math. LEAP was updated for content in 2013-14 and aligns with state standards and required state tests. At ARCA, it will be used for students in grades K-8. It includes a technology- facilitated pre-, mid-, and post-test. The assessment systems are designed based on a pre-test and post-test to ensure that: The pre-test and post-test assess the same objectives Ample opportunity is given to students to demonstrate mastery in each sub-category The pre-, mid-, and the post-tests are at the same difficulty level To ensure content validity, items are selected from a larger databank of test questions previously tested for grade appropriateness, readability, and item difficulty. Each item is also evaluated to be included based on specific criteria such as clearly assessed content standards and that it contained a set of alternatives that were plausible. Teachers monitor the results of the LEAP through Connexus. Results from the LEAP are included in the data (a combination of prior year test scores and current and prior LEAP and the Scantron\u00ae Performance Series scores) used to assign student intervention indicators on a teacher's home page. Teachers then take action and modify instruction based on the intervention indicators. Students assigned a red indicator require intervention. Students assigned a yellow indicator may require an intervention in math and reading. Students assigned a green indicator will be monitored for changes but will not require additional assistance at that time. ARCA administrators and teachers may assess high school students with the Scantron\u00ae Performance Series, a web-based, computer-adaptive, norm-referenced test. It is a valid, reliable, current test that measures student proficiency in reading and mathematics. It provides a scaled score that can be used to measure academic growth, and therefore serves as a useful tool in assessing student curricular needs. The online test is a computer-adaptive assessment which automatically adjusts to each student's ability level, generating more difficult questions if the student is answering correctly and easier ones if the student is answering incorrectly. It provides a valid and reliable scale score in math and reading so that student learning growth can be tracked over time. The version that ARCA will use provides teachers with reports and information to address individual student needs. The Scantron\u00ae Performance Series gives the teachers' diagnostic results in English Language Arts, reading, and mathematics. It provides a large pool of items to pull from in order to create test session for students. The Scantron\u00ae Performance Series provides a wide variety of normative scores, as well as sub-test scores. The Scantron\u00ae Performance Series uses standards from the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM), the National Council of Teachers of English (NCTE), and the National Assessment of Educational Progress Page 24 of 77(NAEP). Ongoing Informal Assessments: In all courses, students will engage in formative assessments that tap into all levels of student learning such as scored daily assignments, daily checks for understanding requiring students to apply and integrate new skills in a thoughtful manner, and regular online quizzes and tests to measure understanding of newly presented material. Unit Assessments and Offline and Online Portfolio Assignments: Throughout each logical unit of study, students are required to complete series of offline and online assessments. Offline assessments include written compositions, science lab reports, short-answer questions and essays, book responses, and a variety of work samples. These assessments require direct teacher evaluation. Online assessments include quizzes and a unit test. While the quizzes are brief and frequent, the more comprehensive unit tests occur at the end of an entire unit. Online assessments provide students and families with immediate objective feedback, while offline assessments provide valuable reflection, feedback, and expertise from certified teachers. Student progress reports and grades will include a combination of quizzes, tests, work samples, and teacher feedback. Curriculum-Based Assessments: The school will use curriculum-based assessments (CBA) as a quick and effective way to gather additional information on students' understanding of concepts, through telephone conversation. Diagnostic curriculum-based assessments (DCBA) pinpoint strengths and weaknesses in student mastery of concepts. Verification curriculum-based assessments (VCBA) authenticate student learning of concepts previously graded as completed with scores of B or higher. Response to Intervention : Data is used throughout the school year to implement a Response to Intervention model for all students. Students who are struggling with the curriculum are identified by teachers and assigned Tier 1 (adaptations) and Tier 2 (supplements) interventions. This process is facilitated by Connexus which uses data to help identify students' intervention needs. A teacher's home page displays a student performance dashboard and shows, for each student, an icon indicating if interventions have been identified and if they have been assigned. The teacher can use his or her professional judgment to override these indicators and log the decision and rationale within Connexus. Also, the school has a Student Support Team (SST) and an on-going process of identifying student intervention needs, assigning those interventions, tracking their success, communicating with parents, and escalating, if necessary, from Tier 1 to Tier 2 and ultimately Tier 3 (alternative placement, most of which involve an IEP). All efforts are made to meet each student's needs within the general education program. Tracking Student Work Online: Connexus captures all necessary data about students, their attendance, and their performance. This data will be accessible to school administrators, teachers, and Learning Coaches on a moment-by-moment, day-by-day basis. The school will track and report ongoing student progress based on the objective, quantitative data generated by Connexus. Staff members will analyze attendance, participation, performance, assessment submissions, lesson completion, and teacher contact. The student status will be displayed to parents, Learning Coaches, and students on the home page for instant identification of potential problem areas. The Escalation Process will go into effect when students are in statuses other than \"On-Track\" to ensure students being educated appropriately and receiving any appropriate interventions. Both Learning Coaches and teachers will have access to an electronic grade book that tracks all results and serves as the basis of changes in the student's learning plan. ARCA will also use a variety of advanced data visualization tools that provide students, parents, teachers, school administrators, institutional education partners, regulators, and researchers with views of how students are performing. Tracking Student Work Offline: Teachers will track students work offline through multiple avenues, including communications with students and Learning Coaches to monitor the student's progress. Scheduled phone calls, WebMail, LiveLesson sessions, and face-to-face meetings will all be used to help teachers gauge student's mastery of concepts and to determine appropriate instructional recommendations. Communications that take place offline are documented in each student's log in Connexus; the data can be accessed by teachers and school administrators through a variety of reports. Throughout each unit of study, students may be required to complete offline or phone-based assessments when Page 25 of 77the format requires, including submitting certain kinds of work samples. Training Teachers to Monitor Student Work: Teachers will receive intensive professional development both prior to and throughout the school year. Training for teachers at a new virtual school includes a combination on in-person and online training. Professional development throughout the school year will focus on monitoring student performance both online and offline based on available data. The school will use the National Standards for Quality Online Teaching published by the International Association for K-12 Online Learning (iNACOL) (available at http://www.inacol.org/resources/nationalstandards/NACOL%20Standards%20Quality% 20Online%20Teaching.pdf ) and the Connections Core Standards for Facilitating Student Learning as guides for pinpointing necessary teacher skills and professional development requirements. The Principal and all teachers will complete the Teacher Orientation Course, which is delivered through Connexus and contains lessons, assessments, and links to online tutorials. This course focuses on preparing teachers to teach through the Connexus platform. It covers curriculum, assessment, personalizing instruction, school year events, grading and the Grade Book, communication, and essential Connexus tools. This course also covers how to monitor student progress, assign tiered-supplemental instructional support programs based on that data, and how to log offline communications within Connexus. In April 2015, Connections was recognized with a Silver Award for Best Practices for Distance Learning Programming by the United States Distance Learning Association (USDLA) for its Professional Learning Model. This prestigious award recognizes organizations that have designed and delivered outstanding and comprehensive best practices in distance learning programming, including program content and delivery, integration of technology, presentation, and impact on participant learning. The USDLA International Distance Learning Awards are presented to five major sectors of distance education and training and include the PK-12, Higher Education, Corporate, Government, and Telehealth markets. Ongoing Communication with Learning Coaches: At ARCA, communication with parents and Learning Coaches will be frequent and purposeful throughout the school year and will communicate formative and summative progress. Communication will serve three main objectives: to help the teacher monitor the student's progress, to keep parents \"in the loop\" with current school happenings, and to help ARCA grow and improve from parent feedback. Scheduled phone calls, LiveLesson sessions, progress within the curriculum including frequent and substantive feedback from the teacher, and optional face-to-face meetings will all be used to help teachers gauge students' mastery of concepts and to determine appropriate instructional recommendations. A student's teacher will conduct follow-up conversations by parent-teacher/teacher-student conferences at least on a weekly basis using WebMail messages, LiveLesson sessions, feedback when grading, Message Board postings, phone conversations, and/or face-to-face interactions. 6.For elementary charter schools, provide a daily schedule for all grade levels indicating the classes that will be provided for a one week time period. For secondary schools, provide required and elective courses for every grade level. If the school plans to phase in grade levels, include expansion grade levels by year with courses to be offered. Applicant Response: Typical Student Day The instructional time commitment required by ARCA's online program is comparable to that of a traditional school day. Because online learners do not face the distractions and interruptions of a typical school setting, students often use their learning time much more efficiently. The in-depth application of concepts that is often relegated to homework in a conventional school setting will be an integral part of the learning day; the application of discrete skills, extended projects, and remedial and enrichment activities will be part of the daily routine for students and their Learning Coaches. The program provides for and offers more than the minimum requirements for instructional time for every grade. Activities vary based upon student needs, coursework, and personal schedules. Learning is integrated within Page 26 of 77individual activities as well as LiveLesson sessions and phone calls with teachers. Learning can occur when students learn best - not just between 9 a.m. and 3 p.m. Students create daily checklists to ensure they are staying on-task. The daily routine may include checking WebMail, looking at the To Do List on their Connexus home page, reviewing the daily planner in Connexus, attending scheduled synchronous sessions, and completing lessons listed in the planner. Students see which lessons are due in bolded text and as lessons are completed, they change from bold to regular text. Students can access lessons directly from their daily planners. In addition, students can access any notes or tips provided by their teachers and view important course-related information like LiveLesson schedules, recordings, and supplemental materials. Students in grades 3-12 can track their progress and grades at any time in the Grade Book. Learning Coaches can view their students' Grade Book at all grade levels. For example, a school day for first grade student might consist of the following: Morning Learning Coach logs on, reads Webmail messages, and reviews lessons the student is expected to complete. Student reads and responds to WebMail messages from teacher about student progress (with the help of the Learning Coach depending upon reading level). Student participates in a LiveLesson session for math with teacher and classmates. Student completes a math lesson. Learning Coach monitors and facilitates learning as necessary. Student completes a Language Arts lesson, including reading, writing, and discussing the lesson activities and text. Student takes a quiz online. Student goes outside for a playground activity with Learning Coach. Afternoon Student makes sandwich for lunch, as part of the Practical Living Skills activity. Student completes a science lesson and finishes reading a non-fiction reading selection (with the help of the Learning Coach depending upon reading level). Student does hands-on science experiment outside with Learning Coach. Student goes to soccer practice and the local library. After returning, student completes art lesson and then participates in Book Club. Learning Coach confirms completed lessons and records student attendance. Learning Coach and student review next day's schedule and prepare accordingly. Learning Coach and student review next day's schedule and prepare accordingly. Elementary Schedule for All Grade Levels ARCA will meet state requirements of courses offered at appropriate grade levels and will comply with Standards for Accreditation 9.03.2 (annual instruction content areas for Grades K-4) and Standards for Accreditation 9.03.3 (annual instruction content areas for Grades 5-8). Although students in a full-time online school have flexibility in their daily schedules, the following lessons will be scheduled on a weekly basis for students in elementary grade levels, K-8: Kindergarten-4th Grade: Language Arts, 5 lessons per week Mathematics, 5 lessons per week Social Studies, 3-4 lessons per week Science, 3 lessons per week Fine Arts, 1-2 lessons per week Educational Technology, 1 lesson per week, which introduces Tools for Learning Physical Education & Health, 1 lesson per week, which includes safety content Practical Living Skills/Career Exploration are integrated in all courses with real world connections through portfolio activities and career exploration connected to student's learning in content areas. 5th-8th Grades: Language Arts, 5 lessons per week Mathematics, 5 lessons per week Social Studies, 3-5 lessons per week Page 27 of 77 Science, 4-5 lessons per week Fine Arts, 1-2 lessons per week Educational Technology, 1 lesson per week, which introduces Tools for Learning Physical Education & Health, 1 lesson per week, which includes safety content Career and Technical Education are integrated into all courses and career education is woven throughout the content areas so that students can see the connections between the content they are learning and associated careers. Social Studies in each elementary grade level will include units on the history and culture of Arkansas, with an emphasis on Arkansas history and culture in Grades 4 and 5. Social Studies lessons at all grade levels will include foreign language experiences. Secondary Grade Level Expansion To accommodate a phasing in of secondary grade levels, ARCA is requesting an initial but expiring waiver from the Standards for Accreditation 9.03.1.2 and 9.03.4 requirements that 38 units be taught annually in secondary schools. ARCA anticipates serving Grades K-9 in Year 1 (2016-17), Grades K-10 in Year 2 (2017-18), Grades K-11 in Year 3 (2018-19), and Grades K-12 in Year 4 (2019-20) and beyond. The required 38 units, less any waived unit requirements, will be available and taught annually, except as otherwise allowed by \u00a76-15-213 and \u00a76-15-214, by the 12th grade year of ARCA's first graduating class. Secondary Required and Elective Courses ARCA will offer all required courses, less any initially or permanently waived unit requirements or as otherwise allowed by \u00a76-15-213 and \u00a76-15-214. To ensure all ARCA students can graduate under the Smart Core curriculum, or the Core curriculum if a parent or guardian waives the student's right to participate in Smart Core, ARCA will offer a full course load to its first 9th grade cohort. These students will be offered and directed toward course units that are required to graduate on time. Please see Attachment 5 for ARCA's suggested course progression. Students who elect to graduate under the Smart Core curriculum will be expected to complete the required and elective courses to ensure they meet the Smart Core requirements for graduation: English - 4 units Mathematics - 4 units (or 3 units of math and 1 unit of Computer Science) Science - 3 units with lab experience (or 2 units with lab experience and 1 unit of Computer Science) Social Studies - 3 units Oral Communications - \u00bd unit Physical Education - \u00bd unit Health and Safety - \u00bd unit Economics - \u00bd unit which may count towards Social Studies or Career Focus Fine Arts - \u00bd unit Career Focus - 6 units Computer Science - optional Descriptions of the Connections curriculum, which can be modified to align with Arkansas Curriculum Frameworks, are provided at the following URL. If the licensure waiver is approved, ARCA students will have access to most of these elective and foreign language courses. ( http://www.connectionsacademy.com/ curriculum/online-high-school ) Length of School Day and School Year ARCA will follow a traditional school year calendar that includes 180 school days during which instruction is provided by school staff, with 200 work days for teachers. The Board will approve the school calendar annually. ARCA will abide by observance days as required by state law. To support the mission of an online school, the school calendar may be extended to allow families more flexibility in completing work or to provide extra learning time for students who are at risk, though generally not by more than two weeks. Although there is flexibility in an Page 28 of 77online school program regarding when instruction occurs, students are still held fully accountable for meeting all state-mandated attendance requirements. Because students will not physically attend the teaching/learning center, ARCA is requesting a waiver to state seat-time requirements. Attendance hours recorded by the Learning Coach in Connexus and verified by the student's teacher will be the legal record of school attendance. These records will ensure ARCA is properly calculating and adequately monitoring that students complete 30 instructional hours per week and 180 instructional days per school year. Students are able to work across the entire week rather than five days, so instructional time may average less than six hours per day. The calendar includes days when teachers will not be available due to professional development (all other Support Services are available during these days), and days when the school is completely closed (no Support Services are available during these days, summer break, and any holidays). During the school year, student learning may continue during any days when the school is closed, as students still have access to their online courses, learning content, and personalized learning plans. For teachers, the school day is not limited to certain hours for start and end times. However, the teaching staff will be available during the school's hours of operation, typically 8:00 a.m. - 4:00 p.m. Teachers will work primarily from the teaching/learning center in Bentonville. Teachers collaborate to share ideas, information, and teaching techniques among the full staff both vertically (same subject across grade levels) and horizontally (different subjects in the same grade level). Families are always welcome to visit the teaching/learning center. Calculating Instructional Days While students will have a great deal of flexibility regarding when and where they complete their coursework, they will nevertheless be held fully accountable for meeting all state-mandated attendance requirements. Attendance recorded by the Learning Coach and verified by teachers will ensure ARCA is properly calculating and adequately monitoring that students complete 30 instructional hours per week and 180 instructional days per school year. Entering attendance is expected to be taken seriously as a regular part of the school day for the Learning Coach. ARCA will verify that the attendance records are accurate, which includes not only the attendance hours recorded by the Learning Coach, but also the lesson and assignment completion rates and the amount of communication the student has with the teacher. During course design and alignment, lesson and assignment completion times are estimated, thus student lesson and assignment completion can be used to estimate amount of student time spent on learning. If a teacher has concerns about the validity of a student's attendance records, he or she may revise the student's recorded hours of attendance based work completion rates and/or contact the school's Attendance Coordinator for further assistance. A Learning Coach will be notified if attendance records are changed. Therefore, even if a Learning Coach records a high number of instructional hours in the attendance records, if a student's work completion rates are not on track and/or if he or she fails to communicate on a regular basis with the teacher, he or she will be flagged for review. This Approaching Alarm or Alarm status is displayed in Connexus and will require follow-up action from the school to ensure that the student completes his or her lessons, assessments, and required weekly hours of attendance. ARCA's administration will monitor and review attendance records on a weekly basis. After a predetermined amount of time (usually 10 days) or as of a specific date (per state regulations), Connexus will no longer allow a teacher or Learning Coach to edit past attendance records. Any requests for adjustments to the \"locked\" records must first go to the Homeroom Teacher (in writing via WebMail or email) for review and approval and then to the Attendance Coordinator for adjustment. Students may record attendance hours on Saturday and/or Sunday to meet their weekly requirements. However, if a student does not participate in school activities on any day Monday - Friday, his or her Learning Coach MUST enter 0 hours on this day. These expectations and procedures for attendance will be documented in the School Handbook, alongside the state requirements for weekly and annual hours of instruction. Parents must agree to the policies in the Handbook when completing enrollment. Attendance procedures will be addressed in trainings for all Page 29 of 77stakeholders (Learning Coaches, students, teachers, and administrators). If a student accrues too many unexcused absences, ARCA will follow state law in reporting non-attendance and truancy. Unexcused Absences and Truancy Regular attendance is imperative to maximize student learning. ARCA will offer flexibility regarding how many hours each day students spend on school work and which days of the week they complete that work. Due to this flexibility, ARCA will have a zero tolerance policy for truancy. Parents will be held legally responsible for ensuring that their students are fully participating in school, even if they have designated another adult as their student's Learning Coach. In order to avoid truancy, the parent must ensure that the following activities take place: Learning Coach enters attendance hours each day of school Student completes all assigned lessons and assessments Student participates in educational activities for an appropriate number of hours, as outlined in the school handbook Student is available for regularly scheduled telephone calls with teachers Student attends all assigned LiveLesson\u00ae sessions Student demonstrates that he/she is doing his/her own schoolwork Student attends mandatory state testing Learning Coach communicates with the homeroom teacher in advance if student needs to deviate from the regular school calendar (for example, switching a vacation and school day) If a student's teachers become aware that the student is not fully participating in school as required by state law and Board policy, the student may be marked with an unexcused absence at the teacher's discretion. In addition, the Attendance Coordinator may override the number of attendance hours previously entered by a Learning Coach by entering the code for an unexcused absence (U) if the student's teachers believe the student has not participated as required. The final decision about whether an absence is considered unexcused will be made by the Principal. Missing a day of school will be defined as missing a day's worth of hours in one week. 7.Provide a description of curriculum, programs, and instructional methods used to support core classes. Include all associated costs in the proposed budget. Applicant Response: Grade Levels and Maximum Enrollment by Year The ARCA Board is requesting a cap of 2,000 students over the first three years of the school's operation and a cap of 3,000 for years four and five. The Board anticipates the following enrollment levels in the specified grade ranges. The ARCA Board will approve enrollment levels annually. Year 1 - Grades K-9; Projected Enrollment - 600; Enrollment Cap - 2,000 Year 2 - Grades K-10; Projected Enrollment - 1,200; Enrollment Cap - 2,000 Year 3 - Grades K-11; Projected Enrollment - 2,000; Enrollment Cap - 2,000 Year 4 - Grades K-12; Projected Enrollment - 2,500; Enrollment Cap - 3,000 Year 5 - Grades K-12; Projected Enrollment - 3,000; Enrollment Cap - 3,000 Foundational Educational Philosophy ARCA will reach students who need a flexible schedule and for whom a cutting-edge virtual approach provides the best pathway to successful completion of their educational program. ARCA will provide a full-time school experience with clubs, activities, and electives. ARCA will promote academic and emotional success for every learner through an individualized learning program combining the best in virtual education with real and engaging connections among students, families, teachers, and the community. Beginning in 9th grade, guidance counselors work with each student individually on graduation plans with a focus on courses, credits, and post- secondary planning. Educational Program Page 30 of 77Curriculum The developmentally appropriate curriculum increases its integration of technology as students advance through the grades. Each Connections course is designed to promote student learning and includes active learning elements (including online and offline interaction) that address diverse learning styles and preferences, including textual, visual, auditory, and/or hands-on. Connections' courses include 1,800 Teachlet\u00ae proprietary instructional movies and more than 1,000 primary source and instructional videos. Integrated \"i-text\" electronic textbooks are licensed from a variety of leading publishers including Pearson, Perfection Learning and others, while non-proprietary technology-based content is licensed from \"best of breed\" providers such as Grolier Online, Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, and Discovery Education. The instructional design includes interactive LiveLesson\u00ae sessions and threaded discussions. Clubs and Activities As an integral part of the academic program, students will also be offered access to 27 clubs, 14 special events, and an online yearbook. Through each of these, students can explore interests beyond the classroom, develop leadership skills, and make friends within ARCA and other schools supported by Connections. The online yearbook allows each student to create their own personal page including photos, videos, and autographs collected from friends. Talent Networks Connections offers three different Talent Networks with a focus on sports, the visual and performing arts, and science and technology . These Talent Networks are virtually facilitated programs designed for enrolled middle and high school students who are actively involved at a high level in competitive sports, the visual and performing arts, or advanced STEM coursework. These programs provide exceptional students in grades 6-12 the opportunity to network with other students with similar talents, hear from engaging guest speakers, and participate in collaborative projects and competitions. Instructional Methods used to Support Core Classes Personalized Performance Learning (PPL) Students learn best when lessons match their interests and abilities. Studies have shown that in conventional classrooms, many instructional tasks are not matched to students' skill levels. Through its personalized educational program, the school's proposed placement process will align with the needs of the students. ARCA will help each student maximize his or her potential and meet the highest performance standards through a uniquely personalized learning program. Through the placement process and the school's pre-, mid-, and post- test assessments, students will be provided with curriculum materials and instructional resources appropriate to their achievement level, with the goal of attaining at least one year's academic progress within the school year. The Personalized Performance Learning process is an academic road map for each student that provides differentiated instruction in a unique, tailored way. Students, Learning Coaches, and teachers meet throughout the year to review progress, modify the student's program, and adjust goals as needed. A parent or other caring adult will serve as a Learning Coach and play an active role in the learning process by supporting students and communicating regularly with teachers. Review of Student Background and Learning Styles. Teachers, Learning Coaches, and students will discuss student strengths, skill deficiencies, and previous school performance. Students will complete a questionnaire to identify their unique learning style to help inform and guide the best teaching and learning approach. Performance Testing. In grades K-8, students will take the LEAP test at the beginning, middle, and end of the year. The LEAP test identifies areas of strength and need in the student's learning profile and measures student growth during the school year to help formulate learning goals and monitor student progress. Students in grades 9-10 may take the Scantron\u00ae Performance Series. Schedule Modifications and Electives. Once the school year gets started, teachers will help personalize the learning schedule. For students in grades K-8, teachers will inquire about the student's daily routines and make adjustments to the student's online learning schedule. They will also add an elective course when students are ready to handle the additional challenge. At the high school level, students are able to add electives during the initial placement and course selection. The PLP displays a comprehensive number of data points, and allows for teachers to document notes and use the information to personalize instruction for each student. Teachers regularly review the student's PLP Data View (a screen within Connexus providing snapshots and views of student data) and document any change in Page 31 of 77instructional interventions, goals, or student performance. Progress Notes in the PLP Data View are visible to Learning Coaches and students in grades 3-12 and summarize the student's overall progress, and intervention plans (if applicable). Learning needs that go beyond the purely academic (such as study habits and interpersonal skills) will be addressed in the PLP as well. The PLP will then guide the student's course through the Connections curriculum that supports the Arkansas Curriculum Frameworks. All lessons will be provided to students and families online directing them step-by-step through the instructional sequence and use of the comprehensive set of instructional resources such as textbooks, trade books, simulations, interactives, manipulatives, and consumables. The PLP tool will place at each teacher's fingertips all of the assessment data available for students (e.g. state test scores, LEAP and the Scantron\u00ae Performance Series pre-, mid-, and post-test assessment data, participation and performance metrics, and any IEP information). Teachers will also be trained to use the Accountability Radar report. The report can be updated daily and has several metrics that show which students' PLPs have been recently updated. The report also contains data elements for tracking completion of LEAP, LEAP results, and intervention indicators based in part on those results. High-quality Teaching ARCA will employ licensed teachers trained in online delivery and individualized instruction. Depending on the needs of the learner, teacher contact with the student varies and may be as frequent as several times a day. In April 2009, John Watson and Butch Gemin on behalf of the International Association for K-12 Online Learning (iNACOL) published the Management and Operations of Online Programs as part of the series Promising Practices in Online Learning. The authors noted, \"Most programs agree that new online teachers must 1) put their role as a facilitator of student learning above other aspects of teaching, 2) have the ability to adapt and manage change, 3) have a high level of content mastery, and 4) be ready to make the shift to online instruction.\" (Watson, J. and Gemin, B., (April 2009) Promising Practices in Online Learning: Management and Operations of Online Programs: Ensuring Quality and Accountability. Evergreen Consulting Associates, iNACOL http:// www.inacol.org/research/promisingpractices/iNACOL_PP_MgmntOp_042309.pdf ) For example, 2005's A Synthesis of New Research on K-12 Online Learning shows that the unique ability of an online teacher to communicate one-on-one with students and offer personalized feedback is key to student success in virtual learning environments. (NCREL Synthesis of New Research on K-12 Online Learning, 2005, North Central Regional Education Laboratory/Learning Point Associates. www.ncrel.org/tech/synthesis ) LiveLesson Sessions and Teachlet Tutorials LiveLesson sessions allow teachers and students to interact with one another in real time in an online classroom. Teachers will use the LiveLesson session tool as needed to convene groups of students together to focus on particular learning topics, and may also use LiveLesson sessions for independent student work groups to collaborate on activities via voice-over IP, chat, electronic whiteboard, and shared web surfing. Threaded discussions on course-based message boards are also used as appropriate by grade level to provide important opportunities for collaboration and interaction among students. Teachlet tutorials increase the effectiveness of the instructional model. Teachlets, highly interactive asynchronous tutorials, are incorporated into most lessons and provide students a dynamic, fun, and engaging way to learn. They incorporate graphics, video, and audio to show students the concepts and ideas they will need to complete the lessons. In addition, the high school courses will incorporate graded asynchronous online discussions, which are required for all students. These discussions provide important opportunities for collaboration and interaction among students, increase writing skills, and provide opportunities for a \"real-world\" audience. Focus on Literacy in the Elementary Curriculum and Program Literacy skills become more complex as students gain mastery. The five main components shift from Kindergarten to Grade 3 in Connections' language arts courses. Phonemic awareness , the awareness of discrete sounds or phonemes is present at the earliest stages of literacy growth. As students master the recognition and production of individual sounds, the need for targeted phonemic awareness instruction declines. Phonics instruction capitalizes on phonemic awareness and focuses on the relationship between written letters, their names, and their sounds. Instruction progresses from letter sounds and small combinations to syllabic awareness. Fluency, the ability to read quickly and accurately, improves as the other components of Page 32 of 77literacy also improve. In the early years, vocabulary and text comprehension instruction is primarily listening- focused. As students improve in their ability to decode, vocabulary and comprehension instruction shifts to involve more reading. Direct instruction in fluency, vocabulary, and comprehension continues throughout elementary school. In the earliest years, literacy instruction is largely a collaborative process as students interact regularly with their teachers and Learning Coaches to build the foundations for success in reading and writing. As students grow in their literacy skills and enter into upper elementary courses, they assume more independence. Parent Involvement: A parent or another adult will play an active role in the learning process as a Learning Coach by supporting the student and communicating regularly with teachers. Surveys and the StarTrack rating system allow Learning Coaches to provide feedback about the curriculum, learning process, and overall academic program. Training will be provided to ensure Learning Coaches have the necessary tools and supports to be successful in their role. Decades of research show that parent participation in education is closely related to student achievement. (Fan, X., & Chen, M. Parental involvement and students' academic achievement: A meta -analysis. Educational Psychology Review, 13, 1, 1-22.,2001) In a 2010 article titled \"Parent Involvement and Student Academic Performance: A Multiple Mediational Analysis,\" in the Journal of Prevention & Intervention in the Community , authors David R. Topor , Susan P. Keane, Terri L. Shelton, and Susan D. Calkins noted that, \"Parent involvement in a child's education is consistently found to be positively associated with a child's academic performance. Results indicated a statistically significant association between parent involvement and a child's academic performance, over and above the impact of the child's intelligence.\" (Topor, David R., Keane, Susan P., Shelton, Terri L., & Calkins, Susan D. 2010). Parent Involvement and Student Academic Performance: A Multiple Mediational Analysis, Journal of Prevention & Intervention in the Community, 38:3, 183-197 http:// dx.doi.org/10.1080/10852352.2010.486297 ) Carrie A. Semke and Susan M. Sheridan researched the effects of parental involvement on student academic achievement in their working paper published in 2011, Family-School Connections in Rural Educational Settings: A Systematic Review of the Empirical Literature , and found, \"Parental participation and cooperation in their child's educational affairs is related to several outcomes deemed important in educational arenas: increased student achievement and academic performance, stronger self-regulatory skills, fewer discipline problems, better study habits, more positive attitudes toward school, improved homework habits and work orientation, and higher educational aspirations...\" (Semke, C. A., & Sheridan, S. M. (2011). Family-School Connections in Rural Educational Settings: A Systematic Review of the Empirical Literature (R2Ed Working Paper No. 2011-1). Retrieved from the National Center for Research on Rural Education website: http:// r2ed.unl.edu ) The Learning Coach Instructional Support Team will offer supports for Learning Coaches through Connections' Get Coaching program including: Learning Coach Central - accessed from the Learning Coach Home Page in Connexus and includes FAQs, social networking opportunities, and resources to assist in providing instructional support to their students. Learning Coach Link - a monthly communication with articles on instructional best practices, Connexus updates, tips and strategies for motivating reluctant learners, and information about upcoming Learning Coach Resource sessions. National Learning Coach Resource sessions -virtual sessions designed to provide Learning Coaches with strategies for working with and supporting their student. Sample session topics include: Effective Questioning Techniques to Assess Learning, Improving Student Writing Skills, Providing Valuable Feedback, and Unlocking Math in a Virtual World. Ample Resources to Ensure that Students Achieve Academic Goals and Excel Accreditation Connections Academy is a division of Connections Education LLC, which is accredited by AdvancED. (an Accreditation agency serving 27,000 public and private schools and districts ( http://www.advanc-ed.org/ )) AdvancED recently recommended Connections Education LLC for accreditation in April 2015 with an overall score exceeding AdvancEd's average score for the 32,000+ schools and corporations they accredit. Connections Education received many commendations from the review committee. The following quotes are from the visiting team's exit report (the full report still going through the review and final approval process at AdvancED):Page 33 of 77 \"A culture and commitment focused on student learning permeates throughout the Connections Education organization. \" \"The corporation embodies a culture of collaboration that exists throughout all aspects of the corporation and schools. \" In addition, in an effort to ensure transferability of credits, ARCA will, within the first three years of operation, apply for accreditation through the Southern Association of Colleges and School Council on Accreditation and School Improvement (SACS CAS). This is similar to the accreditation of schools supported by Connections in South Carolina, Georgia, Louisiana, Oklahoma, Texas, and Florida. High school AP courses are approved by the College Board and many high school core and elective courses are approved for use towards initial eligibility by the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Eligibility Center. ( http://www.connectionsacademy.com/ Libraries/PDFs/NCAA_Approved_Course_List.pdf ) Revenue to Pay for all Curriculum Expenses as Outlined in the Budget As demonstrated in the budget, ARCA has sufficient revenue to pay for all curriculum expenses outlined in the budget included in Attachment 6. In addition, we have included a letter from Connections in Attachment 12 assuring that the school will have sufficient funds to launch and start operations before beginning to receive per- student funding and will maintain a balanced budget thereafter. 8. Describe the process that will be used to ensure all curriculum materials used in the educational program are aligned with the Arkansas Curriculum Frameworks and the state standards as adopted, and periodically revised, by the State Board of Education. Applicant Response: In March 2015, Connections was approved as a Digital Learning Provider and its math and English courses will be available through Virtual Arkansas starting 2015-16. Through Connections' curriculum and instructional design, ARCA will be aligned with Arkansas Curriculum Frameworks and leading standards for effective online course development and instruction. Alignment details and documents are easily accessible to teachers within Connexus. Research underscores the importance of integrating tools for student-to-teacher and student-to-student interaction and the central role of licensed, specially trained professional teachers. (Smith, Rosina, Clark, Tom, and Blomeyer, Rober, A Synthesis of new Research on K-12 Online Learning, Learning Point Associates/North Central Regional Educational Laboratory; Naperville, IL; 2005.) In addition, the school will follow the National Standards for Quality Online Teaching which focus on teacher use of assessments, data, and ongoing communication to bring out the best in each unique online learner. (The National Standards for Quality Online teaching, International Association for K-12 Online Learning (iNACOL), http://www.inacol.org/cms/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/iNACOL_TeachingStandardsv2.pdf, 2011) The proposed curriculum and instructional design accommodate the range of learning styles and is designed for individualized pacing, balanced with optimal interaction. The rigorous program includes both fundamental skills and higher- order thinking, which together prepare students for further education as well as lifelong, independent learning. Curriculum Development Approach Each course is mapped to the Arkansas Curriculum Frameworks. With these standards in mind, the Connections curriculum development team employs a \"backwards mapping\" approach. After an in-depth analysis of standards, the team identifies the types of assessments necessary to allow students to showcase their new understanding and demonstrate their growth on essential skills and standards. Once evidence of mastery is determined, an assessment map is created to indicate the types of assessments to be used to monitor and evaluate performance on each standard. Curriculum designers then work backwards to design curriculum maps comprised of learning objectives, lesson activities, and digital and interactive resources that will lead students to successful mastery of concepts. Connections utilizes ADDIE, a five-phase curriculum development framework consisting of Analysis, Design, Development, Implementation, and Evaluation, to guide and inform curriculum development and maintenance. Page 34 of 77Each step has an outcome that feeds into the next step in the sequence. Analysis- During analysis, the curriculum team identifies the goals and objectives, the audience's needs, existing knowledge, and any other relevant characteristics. This step also considers the learning environment, any constraints, the delivery options, and the timeline for the project. Design - During this systematic process of specifying learning objectives, detailed storyboards and prototypes are often made. The look and feel, graphic design, user-interface, and content are determined. Development - In this step, production and actual creation of the content, assessments, and learning materials based on the Design phase occurs. Implementation - During implementation, the plan is put into action and a procedure for training the learner and teacher is developed. Materials are delivered or distributed to the student group. After delivery, the effectiveness of the training materials is evaluated. Evaluation - This phase consists of formative and summative evaluation. Formative evaluation is present in each stage of the ADDIE process. Summative evaluation consists of tests designed for criterion-related referenced items and providing opportunities for feedback from the users. Revisions are made as necessary. These key principles are reflected in a consistent instructional design for all courses, allowing ease of use by students and Learning Coaches. 9. Describe the manner in which the school will make provisions for the following student services, even in each area for which a waiver is requested: A) Guidance program; Applicant Response: The guidance program will serve all students and will be delivered by certified school counselors with the support of the Connections Director of Counseling. The program will offer individual and group counseling as needed and will focus on academic development, personal and social growth, and college and career readiness activities through a variety of communication tools (LiveLesson sessions, phone calls, message boards, Virtual Library, newsletters, and/or face-to-face events). The counseling team will work to engage students and support both their academic and emotional growth. The team will communicate with students and parents to ensure post-secondary plans are established and students are following through on actions to realize their post- graduation goals. Technology in Connexus supports this effort with the Progression Plan Manager and the College and Career Readiness Data View. With specialized training, counselors will be skilled at helping students address the personal, social, and academic issues that can affect their success in school and life. Counselors will have appropriate certification. The program will be built on relationships, so counselors will be readily accessible to students and families online, in person, and by phone. Counselors are at the heart of fostering students' engagement, safety, and wellness. As they become aware of issues concerning students' school participation, mental and emotional health, or overall well-being, the counselor will collaborate with school staff to ensure the student is supported by teachers and the family is connected with resources, as needed. With the additional support from Connections and its collaborative network of school counselors, ARCA will bring both individual attention and extensive expertise to students and families. Counselors will review each student's transcripts to determine when an Honors or AP course is appropriate. Counselors will help high school students prepare for college and career with: The College and Career Readiness Data View, which focuses on tasks that will prepare students to meet their post-graduation goals Interactive LiveLesson sessions connecting families with real-time information on financial aid and scholarships, college application processes, entrance requirements, and more College test preparation courses for the SAT/ACT 1-to-1 counseling with seniors to provide resources and assistance with post-secondary planning, including career options, vocational training, and selecting the right college High school students will have access to the national counseling LiveLesson session program, which delivers weekly guidance curriculum lessons and national college admissions sessions throughout the school year. The Page 35 of 77sessions include the Career Fireside Chats on the fourth Friday of each month. Previous sessions have covered such topics as Teen Dating Violence Awareness, Educational/Training Opportunities After High School, Why School Matters: Navigating Your Educational Development Plan, How to Develop a Growth Mindset, Aligning Individual Goals & Abilities, and ACT & SAT Overview. A college newsletter is sent to high school students each month. In addition, students will be encouraged to enroll in clubs such as College Planning (grades 9-12) and Career Explorations (grades 6-12), which include regular LiveLesson sessions with a college counselor. ARCA will also offer Student Development courses (for example: Career Exploration, College Prep with SAT/ACT, and Life Management Skills). There are several clubs focused on post-secondary planning including: College Planning Club (grades 9-12) First Generation Club (grades 9-12) High School Career Club (grades 9-12) Middle School Career Club (grades 6-8) The counselor will also plan additional sessions for students which will address specific student needs. The counselor will be a resource to students, families, and staff in order to ensure that all students are safe and will confirm all staff members are trained on student distress protocols. The counselor will actively seek resources in the communities in case families need to address the personal and social needs of the child. The counseling program will be based on the American School Counselor Association framework, encouraging membership for all professional school counselors, and abiding by their legal and ethical standards of practice. B) Health services; Applicant Response: The health services program will serve all students. Nurse ARCA is requesting a waiver from \u00a76-18-706 since students will not be on-site to receive services. Should the waiver not be approved, ARCA will comply with state laws and ADE rules regarding school nurses. Connections would either employ or contract with an agency or individual(s) to provide one licensed nurse per 750 students or the proportionate ratio thereof, or at a higher rate if designated as a district with a high concentration of children with disabling conditions. Nurses would be available via Internet and phone. Since nurses would see students in-person, they would not administer medication or treatment but may inform and advise. ARCA is requesting a waiver from \u00a76-18-1501 et seq. for mandated eye and vision tests. If required, ARCA would contract with local providers for screenings and services at reduced or no cost to the families. Physical Education This program will be contracted through the professional services agreement with Connections. ARCA will ensure students participate in a planned physical education program designed to optimize their physical, mental, emotional, and social development. Teachers will encourage students to engage in a variety of physical activities and sports they enjoy and could pursue throughout their lives. The physical education program supports state standards and aims to accomplish the following goals: Maintain physical, social, and emotional health in students by practicing healthy behaviors and goal setting Engage students in a physically active lifestyle Focus on the acquisition of important personal, interpersonal, and life skills Engage parents and community members Be periodically reviewed, evaluated, updated, and improved Physical education is a core course and will be implemented as such. Students will complete assignments and will be graded to measure their progress in the course. Teachers may use synchronous instruction and/or CBAs to differentiate instruction, demonstrate techniques, ascertain student knowledge, grade class participation, and/ or evaluate demonstration of knowledge, skills, and concepts. Teachers also monitor students' participation and Page 36 of 77progress through the Activity Tracker and periodic performance tests. Throughout ARCA's physical education program, students will document goals and activities in an online Activity Tracker. This tracker includes activities that align to curriculum goals and state-specific standards. Students choose an exercise that aligns with the activity and indicate the frequency, intensity, time, and type (FITT). As students engage in the physical activities, they input data to track their progress. Students then export their tracked activity into an Excel file and send this to their teachers in an online dropbox. Teachers access the students' files to grade and provide feedback to the students on their FITT goals. These activity assessment portfolios are incorporated throughout each physical education course in grades K-12. Learning Coaches mark lessons complete for students and teachers monitor the completion of assessments and grade students based on participation and success in meeting their physical education goals. Additionally, to ensure reliability and accountability, teachers may conduct CBAs to verify completion of physical activities, discuss their progress, give fitness tips and feedback, and differentiate instruction to meet students' needs. To ensure students utilize safe, efficient, and effective movement to develop and maintain a healthy, active lifestyle and apply health-related and skill-related fitness concepts and skills, students will be enrolled in a comprehensive, sequential physical education program that includes: The Presidential Fitness Challenge. Health, safety, and physical education in all grades (unless otherwise specified by state requirements and/or students' educational plans). Grade K-8 physical education courses integrating: Connections' Physical Fitness Program, Personal Fitness Program, and Yoga. The courses provide students the option to start with one program and choose another as they proceed through the course or to participate in the same program throughout the course. Course content generally includes nutrition guidelines and tips for leading a healthy lifestyle. Teachers monitor students' activity thought the submission of activity logs which are reviewed by Learning Coaches and submitted for a grade. High School core and elective courses in physical education, personal fitness, and health fitness and nutrition, plus an optional yoga component. Students' activities are monitored and assessed by teachers who grade activity logs submitted online. C) Media center; Applicant Response: ARCA is applying for a waiver from \u00a76-25-103 and \u00a76-25-104. Should the waiver not be approved, ARCA will hire or contract with the required trained and certified library media services program personnel and administer a library media services program as specified in state law. The media center will be available for use by all students. Regardless of waiver status, media resources and support will be available through the professional services agreement with Connections. Extensive educational media resources will be available online via the Internet to online school students, including the Connections' Virtual Library. While some hard copy resource materials will be housed at the teaching/learning center, the school will not provide a traditional brick-and-mortar library or media center for students. All resources will be provided online with guidance on how to utilize online resources provided by teachers. D) Special education; Applicant Response: The Board anticipates contracting this program to Connections. ARCA will comply with all applicable requirements of IDEA, 20 U.S.C. 1400 et seq. and implementing regulations, including Section 300.209 of Title 34 of the Code of Federal Regulations and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. 794. ARCA will also comply with Arkansas Procedural Requirements and Program Standards and state caseload maximums. ARCA will provide a free appropriate public education (FAPE) to children with disabilities, including identifying, evaluating, and planning educational programs and placement in accordance with state and federal regulations. After submitting an application, all families will be asked if their child has had an IEP within the last three years Page 37 of 77and if that IEP is currently active. The Manager of Special Education will review the student's special education documentation (IEP and Evaluation Report) and recommend course placement. Upon enrollment, ARCA will convene an IEP meeting to adopt or amend the student's IEP and will provide services comparable to those of the previous district. Special education staff will work closely with the general education teachers to ensure that every student receives accommodations, modifications, and all needed services to access and progress in the general education curriculum in the Least Restrictive Environment. To support students with IEPs, ARCA will: Conduct IEP team meetings, including the parents, for all new students to adopt or amend the IEP. Prior Written Notice detailing the decisions of the IEP team will be provided to parents along with Parental Rights. Hold annual reviews of the IEP, including reviewing progress within the existing IEP, reevaluating whether the student is benefitting from the program and creating new IEP goals. A full continuum of special education and related services will be provided, including but not limited to assistive technology and accessibility tools. Program adjustments will be made based on student performance. Provide required services including but not limited to speech-language pathology and audiology services, interpreting services, psychological services, physical and occupational therapy, social works services, and transportation. Services may be provided in-person or in the virtual classroom, as determined by the IEP team. ARCA will contract with quality providers across the state and proximate to students' homes for face- to-face related services. These services and any necessary transportation will be provided to students for free. Conduct triennial evaluations, or more frequently as appropriate, or, if no new data is needed, conduct a review of the records. Ensure student participation in state-mandated assessments. Training is provided throughout the year for the Manager of Special Education and special education teachers. A Connections mentor with experience in online implementation of special education and corresponding state regulations will be assigned to ARCA. Connections will provide extensive training for the entire school leadership team regarding the identification of students suspected of having a disability and types of services available for all students with disabilities. To identify students entering without prior special education identification, the Principal and general and special education staff will conduct Child Find exercises including regular review of teacher observations, assessment results, and other data to identify any possible special education needs among students. Parents will provide input and may initiate a Child Find request. Section 504 Eligible Students: Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 is a statute designed to prohibit discrimination and to assure that disabled students have educational opportunities and benefits equal to those of non-disabled students. An eligible student under \u00a7504 is a student who (a) has, (b) has a record of having, or (c) is regarded as having a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits a major life activity such as learning, self-care, walking, seeing, hearing, speaking, breathing, working, and performing manual tasks. \u00a7504 plans are typically written for students who are not receiving services under IDEA but who require accommodations and modification to their instructional program. \u00a7504 plans may also be written for students who need modified instructional materials or assistive technology due to their disability. Preexisting \u00a7504 plans will remain in place for new students, and potentially revised for the virtual environment, and will be updated periodically. ARCA personnel will be alert for and will identif y\u00a7504-eligible students and will complete a \u00a7504 plan for each identified eli gible student. E) Transportation; Applicant Response: As ARCA will be an online school serving students throughout Arkansas, routine transportation will not be necessary. Students will not require transportation services for regular school activities which will occur primarily in their homes and immediate vicinities. The only mandatory school events that may require students to report somewhere other than their home or immediate neighborhood will be special orientation sessions and state standardized tests, which students will take at proctored locations. As a statewide online school, ARCA's obligation to provide transportation services will be limited to those students whose IEP and/or 504 Plan requires services to be provided outside the home. ARCA will utilize three options for providing students with access to these services. 1. ARCA will compensate a service provider to provide services in the student's home whenever possible.Page 38 of 772. For parents who prefer students to receive services outside the home, or when a service provider is not available to provide services inside the home, ARCA will provide mileage reimbursement to parents who are available to transport the student. 3. In all other circumstances, ARCA will contract with one or more third-party transportation providers, at no cost to the student or caretaker, to transport the student to the service provider location. F) Alternative education, including Alternative Learning Environments; Applicant Response: ARCA is applying for a waiver from \u00a76-48-101 et seq. ARCA will provide academic support, student success plans, interventions, and counseling to students who are experiencing academic, social, or emotional issues to help those students make continued educational progress. ARCA will assist students with achieving their highest potential through flexible educational experiences designed to enhance students' academic growth and foster life-long learning. As the IEP team deems appropriate, if a student requires alternative curricula and is assessed based on alternative standards, ARCA will provide said curriculum at the student's instructional level. Licensed instructors will deliver this rigorous curriculum and innovative strategies in a non-traditional setting through the use of technology. ARCA will assess student learning with continuous assessments and will use data to address students' specific needs. Furthermore, ARCA will strive to eliminate barriers for students and will provide interlocking structured academic and behavioral Response to Intervention (RTI) supports. Moreover, ARCA will provide performance-based education for students to move at their own paces. Should a student need a more restrictive placement, ARCA will work with the student's local zoned district to find an appropriate alternative placement. G) English Language Learner (ELL) instruction Applicant Response: ARCA will follow state procedures to identify English Language Learners (ELLs). ARCA will designate an ELL Lead Teacher, who will work with content teachers, Learning Coaches, and students to ensure material is adapted and accessible for all ELL students. ARCA will aim to hire an ELL Lead Teacher with TESOL certification. The ELL Lead Teacher will maintain student files, consult with Learning Coaches, provide direct instruction to ELL students via LiveLesson sessions and telephone calls, conduct progress monitoring throughout he school year, create and implement targeted interventions based on the data from progress monitoring, monitor exited ELL students for academic progress using state-specific criteria for two years, and comply with state and federal law pertaining to ELL students. In hiring staff, consideration will be given to selecting an ELL-certified leader/teacher; ELL roles will be distributed to those staff with proper certification. Staff will have access to Connections' ELL experts who will support the school and its efforts to identify and educate ELL students. Incoming families will fill out a Home Language Survey (HLS) which will be retained in the student's record. If the HLS indicates any responses other than English, students will be flagged as a potential ELL student. The student's records will be reviewed to determine the need for possible further language testing to identify the specific level of English proficiency. If an enrolled student has transferred from another Arkansas district or a state that uses English Language Proficiency Assessment for the 21st Century (ELPA21), he or she may have already participated in the yearly language proficiency assessment. If administered within the last calendar year, the ELL Lead Teacher will use those test results to determine the student's English language proficiency. If none of the student's records indicate former language testing, a trained test administrator will administer the screener assessment and the results determine whether the student will or will not be identified as an ELL student. ARCA will notify parents/guardians of the initial screening results and program placement decisions within 30 days of the beginning of the school year or within two weeks if the student enrolls during the school year. ARCA will provide these parent notifications both in English and in the parent's language, to the extent feasible. Once identified as an ELL, a student will receive support based on English proficiency via LiveLesson sessions Page 39 of 77by a certified ELL teacher. Instruction will be aligned to standards based on scientific research for English acquisition in reading, writing, listening, and speaking. The ELL Lead Teacher will use the Sheltered Instruction Observation Protocol (SIOP) framework to help students attain English and will participate in monthly professional development sessions. ELL teachers will work with content teachers to ensure that grade level content is accessible for ELL students and the development of academic language skills are promoted in content classes. ELL students at ARCA will fully participate in the core curriculum and will be provided with additional supplementary instructional support software and progress monitoring throughout the school year. In addition, all teachers will consult with Learning Coaches to guide instructional support and will modify content lessons and/or assessments as needed. When a student demonstrates proficiency, a school-based team consisting of the ELL Lead Teacher, student's content teachers, and the parent/guardian will decide whether the student continues to require ELL instruction. They will use the English language proficiency scores, class performance, academic grades, and teacher recommendations to determine the student's language classification. If the team determines that the student is English proficient and can successfully perform in classes without significant language support, he or she will be reclassified and moved to the monitoring stage. ARCA will monitor ELL students for academic progress using state-specific criteria for two years after exiting the program. ARCA will also inform parents of the rights to opt out of ELL services. Although parents may choose not to participate in the language programs, ARCA will still be required to ensure that the students' language and academic needs are being met. Students who opt out of services must continue to participate in the state's annual language proficiency assessment until they meet the state exit requirements. ARCA will continue to notify parents/guardians of the assessment results annuall y and continued participation in or exit from the ELL pro g H) Gifted and Talented Program. Applicant Response: ARCA is applying for a waiver from \u00a76-20-2208(c)(6) and \u00a76-42-101 et seq. If the waiver is not approved, ARCA will administer a program complying with \u00a76-42-101 et seq. and will expend revenues in accordance with \u00a76-20-2208(c)(6). Regardless of whether the waiver is approved, ARCA will provide services to address the needs of gifted and talented students. This program will be contracted through the professional services agreement with Connections via the Gifted and Talented program for elementary and middle school students and the Honors/ Advanced Placement\u00ae (AP) program for high school students. Both programs have a history of success, as demonstrated by a national survey of families with students enrolled in gifted or AP classes at a school supported by Connections. In the survey conducted in February 2015 by Shapiro (an independent market research company), 94.2% of parents stated they were satisfied with the courses and instruction and 93% said the courses are high quality. The placement process will ensure gifted students are provided with the most appropriate curriculum, pacing, and teaching approaches from day one. Founded on ADE Gifted and Talented Program Approval Standards, the identification process will make use of a multi-criterion approach for identifying gifted students from school entry through grade 12. An identification team of five members, chaired by a gifted education specialist, will identify gifted students by using objective and subjective measures. At no point will a cut-off score be used to include or exclude a student from the program. Students may be placed in different curriculum levels for different subjects, thus allowing them to specialize in their areas of strength. Students will be able to work significantly above grade level without fear of ostracism or other negative social repercussions that gifted students may encounter in a brick-and-mortar setting. ARCA will also offer a focused gifted program for selected grades that will include specially designed gifted courses in language arts, mathematics, and science which will be taught by licensed teachers. Grouped together with other gifted learners, students in these courses will cover the same educational standards as they would in the standard offerings, but with more challenging assignments covered at an accelerated pace. These courses will offer additional activities that will build upon lesson topics by promoting higher-level thinking and understanding. These students will also be provided with opportunities to work collaboratively and to interact Page 40 of 77with other gifted learners, particularly through LiveLesson sessions. ARCA will also offer an exclusive online version of Junior Great Books\u00ae. Gifted students will enjoy age- appropriate works and participate in online literary inquiry and discussions together with other high-ability students. The gifted math program allows a student to accelerate their learning with the potential of working two years above his/her peers. As the school grows to add all grades the full high school program will offer a rigorous college preparatory curriculum through the provision of dozens of Honors courses and up to 16 AP courses. Students with special interests will also be able to design their own focused course of study through an \"Independent Study\" course. These courses will provide advanced students with opportunities to participate in extension projects, investigations, and activities centered on integrated skills application and higher-level thinking and understanding. Placement within these courses will be made through careful review by school counselors and in close consultation with students, parents, and the assigned teacher of the course. In addition to providing specialized education to students on the basis of general intellectual ability and specific academic aptitude, ARCA will also provide programs for those who excel with regards to artistic ability. Through student portfolios, self-referrals, or referral by parents, peers, or members of the community, gifted students may be placed in the Visual and Performing Arts Academy. A student may be referred to a club or activity within their field of interest and/or giftedness. Gifted program availability and enrollment information will be communicated to families and the ARCA community through website postings and school wide communications. Opportunities for community involvement in the gifted and talented program, including but not limited to annual committee meetings, will also be communicated through these mediums. All staff will be provided with opportunities to attend monthly gifted and talented professional development sessions in order to further their own practice and understandin g of gifted educ 10. Describe the geographical area to be served by the charter. List all school districts within the geographical area likely to be affected by the open-enrollment public charter school. Applicant Response: Specific Geographical Area Served by ARCA ARCA will be open to all students statewide. As requested by the Charter School Program Advisor, we provided a list of school districts in Attachment 13. ARCA will actively recruit students across the state through extensive community outreach and full disclosure about the school's program and expects to attract those students and families who are most committed to student success in a virtual school setting. ARCA will utilize a broad- reaching student recruitment effort, thereby ensuring outreach to families with a wide variety of racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic backgrounds. In addition, ARCA may focus on certain subgroups for extra recruitment efforts in order to achieve a pool of potential students that reflects a balanced student population. Partnerships and outreach efforts using a variety of community and youth organizations may aid in this process. There is strong demand for online schooling throughout Arkansas. Without any marketing efforts, over 4,000 families have expressed interest in learning more about a statewide, online school supported by Connections. In addition, three public hearings were held on 7/17/15, 7/18/15, and 7/27/15 and nine online and twelve in-person information sessions were held in May, June, and July 2015, during which information was shared about the proposed public charter school. The Board anticipates that a broad range of students from across the state will enroll once information about the school is widely available. Information on the School Districts likely to be Affected by ARCA , including Data onthe Expected Number of Students to Transfer to ARCA While ARCA will enroll students statewide, Connections' experience in other states where they support schools indicates that no single district will be severely impacted. For example:Page 41 of 77 In Georgia, 5,472 students from 170 of the 180 school districts in the state have enrolled in the school, representing 0.32% of statewide public school enrollment. In Louisiana, 2,358 students from 76 of the 76 school districts in the state have enrolled in the school, representing 0.35% of statewide public school enrollment. In Oklahoma, 1,551 students from 255 of the 517 school districts in the state have enrolled in the school, representing 0.23% of the statewide public school enrollment. ARCA requests an initial enrollment cap of 2,000 students for Years 1, 2, and 3 and a cap of 3,000 students in Years 4 and 5. ARCA anticipates enrolling 600 students in Year 1; 1,200 students in Year 2; and 2,000 students in Year 3. Students whose academic and social needs will be effectively met by ARCA include: Students who are far ahead of or far behind their peers in school, including students at risk of academic failure and those coping with social or bullying issues Students who are homebound due to illness or disability Students with special learning needs Rural students with limited curricular options Students pursuing artistic or athletic careers or career development opportunities requiring a flexible schedule As a public school, ARCA will not charge tuition. Outreach communications will inform families that the school is tuition-free. ARCA is committed to making sure all students can access the program regardless of socio- economic status and will ensure everyone has access to the education program. This will include providing a computer and Internet subsidy to enrolled families who require these to access the school. Computers shall remain the school's property and must be returned upon graduation or dis-enrolling. As a public school, ARCA will be non-sectarian in its programs, admission policies, employment practices, and all other operations. Admission to the school will not be determined according to the place of residence of any pupil or his/her parent or guardian within Arkansas. 11. Describe the plan for the school officials to provide an annual report to parents, the community, and the authorizer that demonstrates the progress made by the charter school during any previous academic year in meeting its academic performance objectives. ( See ADE Rules Governing Standards for Accreditation of Arkansas Public Schools and School Districts.) Applicant Response: ARCA will follow ADE Rules Governing Standards for Accreditation of Arkansas Public Schools and School Districts (http://www.arkansased.org/public/userfiles/Legal/Legal-current%20Rules/ ade_282_standards_0709_current.pdf ) ARCA will maintain reports and records necessary for effective planning, operation, and education. ARCA will submit timely and accurate reports appraising student performance to the ADE. Timeline for Data Compilation The school will begin compiling data in the spring of the current school year and will finalize all reports during the summer following the school year. All reports and information will be final, available, and disseminated by November 15 of each year for the previous school year. Disseminating Annual Report to Stakeholders ARCA will develop, with staff and community participation, a plan to disseminate the annual report. Goals will be compatible with state and national educational goals and address state needs. ARCA will file the plan with the ADE. ARCA will provide and publish before November 15 of each school year a report to the public detailing progress toward accomplishing program goals, accreditation standards, and proposals to correct deficiencies. In addition, ARCA will notify parents of the report via email. ARCA will systematically and at least annually explain its policies, programs, and goals to the community in a Page 42 of 77public board meeting and provide opportunities for parents and other members of the community to ask questions and make suggestions. Measuring, Analyzing, and Reporting Academic Progress As described previously, ARCA will have very specific and measurable objectives for success, based upon the academic progress of its students and the school's performance on several academic and non-academic measures. The school administration will use Connexus to watch each of these variables closely to monitor the school's overall success. The Principal, in collaboration with the staff and with the Connections administrative support team, will develop a list of measurable annual school goals that are designed to ensure continuous improvement. The Board will approve these school goals and the performance of the Principal and staff is evaluated in part by using the school goals. As a public school, ARCA will measure and report the academic achievement of all students annually, as well as ongoing progress and performance of cohorts and the school as a whole. ARCA students will participate in state proficiency tests depending upon grade level . The school will set up in-person, proctored locations for state testing. Results of these assessments will be reported through the ADE. In addition, state assessment data is logged in Connexus to complete a data snapshot of student academic performance. The Board and school leadership will also include the results of the state-mandated testing in the evaluation of the school's overall performance. Responsibility for monitoring, evaluating, adjusting, and adhering to the school's assessment policies and practices will follow a traditional model. Teachers will have primary responsibility for administering assessments and providing feedback to administrators. The Principal will oversee the assessment program and work with education specialists in evaluating and making recommendations for changes. The Board will have ultimate responsibility for ensuring that the school is fulfilling the expectations and obligations under charter school law, the charter, and Board-approved school policy. 12. Describe the enrollment criteria and recruitment processes, that will provide an equal opportunity for all parents and students to learn about and apply for admission to the proposed public charter school. Applicant Response: Enrollment Criteria - Eligible students must reside in Arkansas and submit a valid proof of residency such as a recent mortgage statement, current lease, or utility bill (gas, electric, or water) showing service or property address. ARCA has an expected enrollment of 600 students for the 2016-2017 school year. The school will obtain from the state data system or incoming students a most recent report card, unofficial transcript, or prior academic history to verify prior schooling. Students must meet minimum/maximum age requirements or qualify for an exception as noted in state regulations. Kindergarten students must turn five on or before August 1 of the year in which they are seeking initial enrollment. First grade students, initially enrolling, must be six on or before October 1. The maximum age of a student to enroll is 21. Prior to completing enrollment, a birth certificate, a statement by the local registrar or a county recorder certifying the child's date of birth, passport, or United States military identification must be provided. Prior to admission, a copy of the student's up-to-date immunization record or the appropriate and current exemption form must be provided .ARCA has the right to not enroll any student that is currently expelled. Equal Opportunity Student Recruitment Plan - Student recruitment and enrollment policies need to be balanced with the mutual goals of ensuring that families are aware of their choices with the Board's need to be fiscally conservative. Enrollment will generally begin in March for the school year starting in August, with reasonable public notice given at least 30 days before the open enrollment deadline and according to all Arkansas rules and regulations. Upon approval of the charter, ARCA will actively recruit families that represent the full cultural, demographic, and socioeconomic range of Arkansas. ARCA will use a variety of means to inform families about its services and provide them an opportunity to enroll, including: Direct Mail: ARCA will conduct direct mail campaigns announcing the school to families. Information Sessions: ARCA will conduct multiple information sessions across the state to assure that families from a variety of communities are able to attend. Information sessions may also be online and families may attend from home via their computers. Page 43 of 77 Website: Connections will create and maintain a website specific to ARCA. The website will include enrollment and school information and also create opportunities for parent-to-parent communication through Contact-A- Parent (an opportunity provided through the Connections website to of a student enrolled in a school supported by Connections). Telephone/email information service: ARCA will launch and maintain a toll-free information line and an email information service to answer parents' questions. Community and youth services partnerships : ARCA will provide information about the charter school to the community that may include youth-serving organizations. Media Outreach: ARCA will make use of paid advertisements in local media outlets. Search Engines and Social Media: ARCA will be linked to leading Internet search engines with local reference capability to help Arkansas families looking for an online school option find this high-quality charter school (Facebook, Twitter, and other social media sites). Open and Fair Admissions Process - ARCA will be open to all students statewide on a space available basis and will not discriminate in its admission policies or practices. ARCA admissions procedures will comply with IDEA 2004 and Civil Rights protections. ARCA will comply with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, and Part B of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act and will comply with the same Federal and State audit requirements as do other public schools in Arkansas. The school will comply with the McKinney-Vento Act regarding homeless students. Students who meet the definition of homeless shall not be barred from enrolling due to lack of required documents. All students who enroll in ARCA will be full-time public school students. As a public school, ARCA will not charge tuition. Check which of the following enrollment preferences, as permissible in Arkansas Code Annotated \u00a76-23-306(14)(C), would be allowed at the charter school. 1. Children of founding members of the charter 2. Siblings of enrolled students 3. No enrollment preferences (No other boxes may be checked in order to select this option.) It is affirmed that a random, anonymous student selection method will be utilized in the event that more students apply for admission to the open-enrollment public charter school than can be accommodated under the terms of the charter, except as allowed for in Arkansas Code Annotated \u00a76-23-306(14)(C). NoYesIf box 1 and/or 2 are checked, explain the policy. Children of Founding Board Members and siblings of enrolled students will be given enrollment preference. Up to five spaces will be held for the children of founding board members. The spaces will be reserved until a published date and will be released if not filled. The children of Founding Board Members who were not exempt from the lottery process and were not accepted in the lottery will be placed on a Founder Preference List. These students will be given the first opportunity to enroll as space becomes available. Students on this list with the lowest lottery number will be placed first. Siblings of enrolled or accepted students who were not accepted in the lottery will be placed on a Sibling Preference List. These students will be made an offer of enrollment after students on the Founder Preference List as space becomes available. Students on this list with the lowest lottery number will be placed first.Applicant Response:Page 44 of 77Describe procedures for conducting the an annual single lottery enrollment process, including the timeline for enrolling, the date of the lottery, and the way in which students will be placed on waiting lists, and the process for notifying parents about each child's selection or order on the waiting list. Explain how the charter will ensure that the lottery process is transparent to the public. Applicant Response: Tentative Open Enrollment and Lottery Dates (Subject to Change) Open Enrollment begins: Tuesday 3/1/ 2016 Lottery Determination Date/Close of Open Enrollment: Friday 4/1/2016 Lottery If Needed: Monday 4/11/2016 Random and Anonymous Lottery - As an online school, ARCA will not be subject to the same facility space restrictions a brick-and-mortar school might face in accommodating as many students as may wish to attend. Each year the school will conduct an open application period. If it becomes necessary, ARCA will conduct a random selection process that is in keeping with state and federal guidelines. No applicants will be enrolled during the open application period. During this period, applicants who are interested in enrolling must begin and proceed through the enrollment process with the exception of course placement. If a random lottery is needed, ARCA will post the date and time of the lottery on its website enrollment page. Attendance is not required. Following the first year of operation, returning students and siblings will be accounted for when determining the need for a random lottery. Lottery selection allows for fair and equitable selection of students in the event more students apply than can be accommodated. Sibling preference in the lottery process helps committed families handle the logistics of successful participation in the online school. The random selection process provides all applicants who have completed all enrollment tasks by a specified, publicly-announced deadline an equal chance of being admitted. ARCA will notify students with preferences of their right to enroll and then shall conduct a random selection process to fill remaining openings. ARCA will give preference to students who were enrolled in the school in the prior year (once enrolled, students will not be required to reapply) and siblings of students presently enrolled. ARCA will post the date and time of the lottery on its website Enrollment page. The lottery will be conducted in three clusters: Grades K-5, 6-8, and 9. The school will open with grades K-9 but will eventually serve grades K-12. As high school grades are added, they will be clustered together. The order in which those clusters are drawn and the total number of students selected for each cluster may vary each year in consideration of the school's overall enrollment limit, the expected number of returning students and any of their siblings who complete an enrollment application during the open application period, and/or other operational factors. This allows for as many students who are interested in enrolling the opportunity to enroll up to the overall enrollment limit each year. If the number of applicants exceeds the overall allowed amount, then the school will determine which grade cluster has exceeded its limit and conduct a lottery accordingly for the oversubscribed grade clusters. For each grade cluster, a computer program will randomly select a student name from the pool of enrollment applicants for that grade cluster until the number of available slots is filled, or the pool of enrollment applications is exhausted. As each student in a grade cluster is selected, siblings of that student who have also completed the applicable enrollment steps, excluding course placement, will be accepted as long as a slot in their grade cluster is available. When all available slots have been filled, students not selected will be placed on a waiting list in the order in which they completed enrollment tasks based on the automated Connexus waitlist time/date stamp. Waitlisted siblings of selected students will be given the first priority to enroll. The parents of selected students will receive an email confirmation within five business days after the lottery and must confirm student attendance within 10 business days. Students without confirmed attendance within 10 business days will forfeit their slots to the next eligible students on the waiting list. ARCA will continue to accept applications after the open application period. If the school is oversubscribed these students will be placed on the waiting list in order they complete the applicable enrollment process steps, including course placement. These students will be allowed to enroll based on the availability of space in their Page 45 of 77grade cluster and their place on the waiting list. Students who complete the entire process first will be offered the space first, after siblings. If the school is not oversubscribed by the end of the open application period, no lottery will be held and ARCA will continue to accept applications and admit eligible students in the order they completed all enrollment tasks, based on availability in their respective grade clusters. Again, once the enrollment limit has been met, students will be placed on a waitlist and allowed to enroll if space becomes available in their grade cluster. Siblings of enrolled students will receive preference on the waitlist. If it is believed that the use of a weighted lottery is required by federal court or administrative order, explain and furnish a copy of the order. Applicant Response: ARCA will not use a weighted lottery, as the conditions required by \u00a76-23-306(14)(c) in order to use a weighted lottery do not exist. ARCA and Connections have no history of discriminatory practices and the lotteries, if necessary, are public and monitored for fairness. The current racial/ethnic demographics of students attending the 29 schools supported by Connections nationwide are representative of similar demographics to the 26 states in which the schools are located. Currently schools supported by Connections serve students of the following races/ethnic groups, as reported by families during the enrollment process: 67% White, 10% Black/African American, 2% Asian, and 1% American Indian or Alaskan Native. Additionally, 13% of families identified their ethnicity as Hispanic/Latino and 87% Non-Hispanic/Latino. Based on these figures, it is evident that schools supported by Connections do not include discriminatory practices in the enrollment process and furthermore encourage families regardless of their socio-economic circumstances to enroll. ARCA will continue this in adherence with state and federal regulation and anticipates enrolling students of similar demographics to the public school population in Arkansas. Applicant Response:13.

Specify the qualifications to be met by professional employees (administrators, teachers, counselors, etc.) of the program. List the types of administrative positions, teaching positions, and support positions for the school. Applicant Response: Staffing levels are described in full-time equivalent units (FTE). FTE represents the total hours worked divided by the maximum number of hours in a full-time schedule for that position, allowing for fractional representation of some positions.

ARCA will comply with Federal monitoring requirements for any Federal funds it receives. Each month, the Board will receive a set of detailed financial statements that will include a revenue and expense statement, a balance sheet, invoice detail (vendor, amount, date, purpose), any grant fund expenditures, cash receipts from all sources, and a transaction listing of all activity in the school's bank account. 15.Explain how the school will conduct its business office. Tell about business office personnel and describe the plan for managing procurement activities, and the process by which the school governance will adopt an annual budget. Applicant Response: The Board is responsible for the completion and results of all accounting reports as required by law, regulation, or the charter, including a report of budgeted and actual expenses. The Board will provide any information required by the ADE or its auditors. ARCA will use the chart of accounts outlined in the Arkansas Financial Accounting Handbook, as reported via APSCN. The Board designated Virginia Walden Ford, one of its members, to serve as the Treasurer of the school. The Treasurer has the oversight responsibility for all funds and securities and for monies due and payable from any source, including the deposit of monies in the banks, trust companies, or other depositories as will be selected in accordance with the provisions of the Bylaws. The Treasurer will receive supporting documentation for all invoices as well as a transaction listing of all activity in the school's bank account. In addition to reviewing the actual monthly and year-to-date results for the school, the Treasurer will review a monthly projection for the balance of the school year in order to provide the Board with visibility to the projected financial position of the school at the end of the fiscal year. This report will be reviewed at each Board meeting to ensure that the school has sufficient funds to meet all of its obligations and to Page 50 of 77stay on a sound financial footing. Potential shortfalls will be identified with sufficient time to make adjustments in the school's operations to ensure that a sufficient fund balance is always available at the end of each school year. ARCA will use industry-standard accounting software to ensure proper bookkeeping. ARCA will also establish policies and procedures and will institute rigorous financial controls including the following: ARCA will develop and maintain simple check request and purchase order forms to document the authorization of non-payroll expenditures. All proposed expenditures must be approved by a designee of the Board. The designee will review the proposed expenditure for approval and to determine whether it is consistent with the Board's adopted budget. Supporting documentation will be required for all expenditures. To ensure fiscal responsibility and compliance, the Board will meet regularly to review the operations and financial performance of the school. ARCA will maintain its accounts at a federally insured commercial bank or credit union. Funds will be deposited in non-speculative accounts including federally-insured savings or checking accounts or invested in non- speculative federally-backed instruments. Access to these accounts will be limited to individuals designated by the Board. Each month, ARCA will produce a set of detailed financial statements that include a statement of activities, a balance sheet, bank reconciliations, invoice detail, payroll registers, any grant fund expenditures, cash receipts from all sources, and a transaction listing of all activity. The Treasurer will be provided with access to such financial documents for review as an increased measure of oversight and governance. The Board will use a sound budgeting and forecasting policy and procedures to monitor revenue and authorize expenditures according to any restrictions placed on such revenue. A detailed revenue and expense statement will be reviewed at each Board meeting and will serve as the vehicle to authorize future expenditures, along with the adopted budget and other policies. Plan for Managing Procurement Activities ARCA is requesting a waiver from \u00a76-21-301 et seq. to contract with Connections for Connections' education services, which are only available from a single source and thus exempt under \u00a76-21-305. The Board will follow state regulations regarding all other procurement activities. Should the waiver not be granted, ARCA will follow the required process for a contract with an education services provider. Members have experience operating businesses and schools and are familiar with standard procurement processes including the Request for Proposal process. The Board will work with legal counsel to ensure all required procurement steps are completed and that all regulations are met. Personnel who will Perform Business Duties ARCA intends to contract with Connections for business support and assistance with performing various financial functions. Connections will be required to provide financial reports and supporting documentation for all expenditures to the Treasurer and the Board as a whole. The Charter School Financial Services team at Connections currently performs this similar function for 28 other charter schools in 17 other states and has an exemplary audit record. Functions performed by this team, under the direction of the various boards, include: Preparing financial reports and disclosures to meet the reporting needs of multiple schools in various states. Performing daily accounting activities and general ledger maintenance to record charter school financial activity. Providing accounting and financial/legislative audit support services for schools reporting under non-profit and governmental GAAP. Monitoring federal/state accounting and regulatory requirements unique to various states to ensure school compliance. Assisting with developing internal control design and providing support for the implementation of school financial processes and procedures. Assisting with financial budgeting and forecasting functions on behalf of the schools. Providing training sessions to school management to increase their awareness of financial and compliance matters unique to their school. Page 51 of 77Connections will work closely with the Treasurer and the Board to deliver information in a manner that ensures proper oversight is maintained over the school's financial operations. Timeline and Process by which the Board will Review and Adopt an Annual Budget On an annual basis and prior to any deadline specified in the charter, ARCA will present a balanced budget (i.e., not resulting in a cumulative net asset deficit) for the following fiscal year to the ADE or its auditors. Developing ARCA's annual budget will be an iterative process incorporating input from key stakeholders including the designated members of the Board including the Board Treasurer and the school's Principal. A preliminary budget based on initial assumptions will be presented to the Board for approval before the start of the school year. Once the beginning enrollment and updated per pupil funding figures are known, a revised budget will be prepared. On a monthly basis, the budget will be compared to actuals and a reforecast will be prepared. This process will provide the Board with the ability to change the financial direction of the school at any point. Balanced Two-Year Budget A balanced two-year budget estimate is included in Attachment 6. The budget does not rely on one-time grants or other funds not presently guaranteed. It includes costs for all personnel, programs, and expenses. Complete the budget template showing a balanced budget with realistic expectations of revenue and expenditures. Provide the minimum number of students who must attend the charter in order for the school to be financially viable. Describe the method used to calculate this number. Tell who made the calculations and describe the financial expertise of the individuals who assisted in this assessment. Describe the contingency plan if fewer students than necessary for financial viability enroll before the first day of school. Provide a detailed explanation of the ways in which the charter leaders will provide the education program outlined in the application to fewer students that determined necessary for financial viability or a date certain by which charter leaders will notify the parents, leaders of surrounding districts and open-enrollment charters, and staff at the Arkansas Department of Education that the school will not open as anticipated. Explain how charter leaders will provide the education program outlined in the application if enough students for financial viability enroll and are admitted but fail to arrive when school begins. Describe preparations to pay for any unexpected, but necessary and possibly urgent expenses. Applicant Response: The school's mission is to offer families throughout the state access to a quality education by providing the personalized learning inherent in a high quality online school. In order to achieve its mission, the school must remain fiscally sound. The completed budget template, provided in Attachment 6, is carefully aligned to the mission of the school and demonstrates a school with sound financial planning.Page 52 of 77Revenue is limited to State Charter School Aid. Enrollment figures have been based on the projections for the initial size of the school and subsequent school growth and are consistent with demand in Arkansas for full-time virtual education. Expenditures are based upon reasonable estimates of anticipated expenses and are aligned to the school's mission and performance goals. A majority of the school's expenses will be variable instead of fixed. Personnel assumptions are based on staffing ratios that have been found to be effective in other online schools and according to best practices in teaching in an online environment. The budget provides for a student-to- teacher ratio (on an FTE basis) of approximately 35:1 in Year 1 and 35.5:1 in Year 2. Substitute teachers are usually not required in an online environment, as the staff of the school can typically cover when a colleague is absent. ARCA does intend, however, to identify some substitute teaching resources to address longer-term absences if needed. School administrators and staff will be employed by Connections through the professional services agreement, but serve at the pleasure of the Board of Directors. The positions reflected in the budget are 100% dedicated to ARCA. Wages will be reimbursed to Connections at cost. For expenditures other than personnel, the budget assumes that expenses will be consistent with the full-time online schools supported by ARCA's proposed partner, Connections. Unless specifically itemized in the budget template, it was assumed that products and services will be provided by Connections under their Standard Fee Schedule (included as Attachment 16 of this application). In the completed budget template, the anticipated expenses can be found under the following expenditure types: Administration Regular Classroom Instruction Special Education Fiscal Services Maintenance and Operations For Administration, the budgeted Connections expenditure covers expenses such as: School Launch Support School Oversight School Leader Support and Development Legislative, Policies, Rules and Regulations Monitoring Accreditation Support Research and Analysis School Handbook Support Outreach Support Enrollment Services Academic Placement Services Student Records Management Professional Development and Training External Reporting Support State Testing Support Accountability Support Grant Identification, Writing, and Administration General Board Support Governance Training Authorizer Compliance and Reporting Support Human Resources Support For Regular Classroom Instruction, the budgeted Connections expenditure covers expenses such as: Core and Elective courses Gifted and Talented Curriculum Advanced Placement (AP) courses Career Technology Education (CTE) courses Clubs and Activities Page 53 of 77 Specialty Academies Connexus Education Management System (EMS) LiveLesson (Online Classroom) Staff Instructional Technology, and Software Student Instructional Technology, and Software Supplemental Instructional Support Programs Connections' courses include 1,800 Teachlet proprietary instructional movies and more than 1,000 primary source and instructional videos. Integrated \"e-text\" electronic textbooks are licensed from a variety of leading publishers including Pearson, Perfection Learning, and others, while non-proprietary technology-based content is licensed from \"best of breed\" providers such as Grolier Online\u00ae Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, and Discovery Education. In addition, the instructional design includes interactive LiveLesson sessions and threaded discussions. The Board understands that Gifted and Talented, ELL, and guidance services are not special education programs. These bundled purchased services are included within the \"Special Education Oversight and Support\" fee. For Special Education, the budgeted Connections expenditure covers expenses related to special populations such as: Special Education Protocol Development Special Education Training and Professional Development Special Education Oversight and Compliance Support IEP Management Software and Support Assistive Technology Procurement Special Education Service Provider Coordination Accessibility Support 504 Plan Guidance Gifted Program Support At-Risk Population Support Services Homeless and Migrant Support ELL Support (provided by ESOL/TESOL certified leaders and teachers) School Counseling Support For Fiscal Services, the budgeted Connections expenditure covers expenses such as: School Financial Services Federal Programs Support Payroll Accounts Payable Cash Flow Protection School Business Support Internet Subsidy Management and Payment Processing For Maintenance and Operations, the budgeted Connections expenditure covers expenses related to: Systems Administration Telecommunications Support Networking & Internet Connectivity MIS Help Desk Facilities Support Services Insurance/Risk Management Support Purchasing Support Minimum Number of Students Required for Financial Viability Although ARCA can budget for a minimum enrollment level, the revenue would not support some of the features proposed in this application. Any changes to the model presented in this application would require discussion and a decision by the Board. In the event that enrollment is less than anticipated, the school would remain financially viable and the model would remain consistent with the adopted budget. Most expenses of the school are anticipated to be variable instead of fixed. This will ensure the majority of expenses will flex up and down with enrollment, thus cushioning Page 54 of 77the impact of lower than estimated revenue due to an enrollment shortfall. Therefore, unlike a brick-and-mortar charter school, there is no minimum number of students required for financial viability. Contingency Plan to Provide the Education Program outlined in the program if fewer students than Necessary for Viability Enroll and/or Attend As stated, most expenses of the school are anticipated to be variable instead of fixed. As an added measure Connections has pledged to protect ARCA from deficits by offering \"service credits\" (discounts on Connections- provided products and services) as needed. A letter from the Connections' CFO is provided in Attachment 12. These factors ensure that the school would remain financially viable and that the model would remain consistent with the adopted budget. Plans to Pay for Unexpected but Necessary Expenses The budget includes a contingency fund balance which should allow for unexpected but necessary expenses. Connections Education is ARCA's proposed partner and will, as part of its Educational Products and Services Agreement, protect the school from cash flow volatility by awaiting reimbursement of charges until the school has the funds available to make payment and by allowing the school to pay in installments. 16. Describe the manner in which an annual audit of the financial and programmatic operations of the school will be conducted. If the school wishes to request that the authorizer allow a licensed accountant or licensed certified public accountant, rather than the Legislative Auditor, to perform the first-year audit, identify the accountant by name, firm, address, and phone number. The named accountant must meet the requirements of ADE Rules Governing Publicly Funded Educational Institution Audit Requirements, including the prohibition on auditors providing non-audit services (such as accounting or consulting services) to auditees. A school's preference as stated in this application may not be changed without prior approval of the authorizer. Applicant Response: Annually, the Board will arrange for an audit of ARCA's financial statements in accordance with Government Auditing Standards and the OMB Circular A-133. The financial statements will be presented using a fund basis format which will include, at a minimum, the general fund and the special revenue fund presented separately and all other funds presented in the aggregate. These statements will be prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles and applicable ADE requirements. ARCA requests the first year financial statement audit to be performed by a licensed Certified Public Accountant in good standing with the Arkansas Division of Legislative Audit. If approved, Rasco Winter Abston Moore & Associates, LLP in Little Rock is the preferred CPA firm. Alan Abston, CPA Partner Rasco Winter Abston Moore & Associates, LLP Little Rock, AR 72201 501-375-8500 The audit will be completed and filed with the ADE and the Arkansas Division of Legislative Audit within nine months as in required by \u00a76-20-1801. The Board will review the results of the audit and all comments provided by the auditor in accordance with requirements specified under \u00a76-1-101 and, if needed, develop a corrective action plan to amend any material weakness noted by the auditor. Page 55 of 7717.It is affirmed that the public charter school will participate in the Arkansas Public School Computer Network, as required by state statute and by State Board of Education rule, for reporting both education data and financial data, including grant funds or private donations received directly by the charter school. Yes No 18.Describe the facilities to be used. Give the present use of the facility. If the facility to be used for the school is a facility of a school district, describe the terms established by the local school board of the district stipulating the relationship between the proposed public charter school and the district pertaining to the use of the facility. Attach a copy of the agreement, signed by the president of the local school board, the chair or president of the governing body of the proposed open-enrollment public charter school, and the chief operating officer of the proposed charter. If the facility is not operated by a school district, attach a copy of the Facilities Utilization Agreement, signed by the entity owning or operating the facility and the chief operating officer of the proposed charter. A proposed lease may also be submitted but is not required. Please note that any lease or other debt must be approved by the Commissioner of Education. Applicant Response: Identified Facility ARCA will lease permanent space for administrative and teaching staff in Bentonville to serve as the teaching/ learning center where administrative and teaching staff will work. Currently, the Board has an agreement in place with Regus to lease office space at 609 SW 8th Street in Bentonville. ( http://www.regus.com/locations/ business-centre/arkansas-bentonville-bentonville-plaza ). The teaching/learning center will include at least one conference room with doors for use in IEP conferences and other special education related activities. In addition, the Board has discussed potentially securing an additional satellite office after the charter is approved to serve as a resource center for students. Having the teachers located in physical centers allows for expanded professional development opportunities, ensures quality control and visibility into the teaching process by school administration, and promotes collaboration amongst teachers to excel student achievement. The teaching/learning centers can also host parent teacher conferences as needed. ARCA students will participate in state proficiency tests depending upon grade level . The school will set up in- person, proctored locations for state testing throughout the state based on the geographic location of the student population. As the school grows, the Board may explore additional satellite teaching/learning centers throughout the state that are allowed under current rules and regulations. This would allow regional teaching/learning centers where families may visit and teachers could be involved in local school field trips and state testing. Remodeling or Adapting Facility The facility will be appropriate and adequate for the school's program, the targeted population, and the public. Online education requires minimal build out and can be accomplished in the timeframe needed. Criteria used to analyze facilities include: Page 56 of 77 Central location - easy access from major roadways, allowing students and staff from various areas to reach the facilities easily. The facilities will have adequate space for teacher cubicles, a Principal's office, a conference room, and a break room/kitchenette. A certificate of occupancy, air-conditioning, heating and illuminated fluorescent lights, male and female bathrooms, parking, handicapped accessible, and fully equipped with sprinklers and other fire safety equipment. Necessary infrastructure to support the computer network and phone system. In compliance with or capable of modification to bring them into compliance with all local building, zoning and health and safety requirements. Meet all local minimum Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) standards. Ample parking accommodations. Comprised of approximately 20% office space and 80% open area for cubicles. Secure location for storing testing materials and protected student data. ARCA has Access to the Necessary Resources to Fund the Facility Plan The facility has been accounted for in the budgeting process. Lease Terms While the lease has not yet been negotiated with Regus or approved by the Commissioner of Education, the Board anticipates doing so once the charter is approved. Certain key terms will likely be included in the lease. These include, but are not limited to: Early termination provision in the event of charter revocation or non-renewal Turnkey demo and build-out of space by landlord at landlord's expense Options for renewal Rights of First Offer or First Refusal, when possible, on contiguous space Inability of landlord to re-locate the premises Rent abatement in the event of diminution of space Insurance terms consistent with ARCA's policies Pre-approval for tenant's improvements (voice/data/electric) ARCA's demos and build-outs will encompass setting up a typical office environment. The landlord will provide turnkey solutions with standard building finishes, pursuant to a Computer Aided Design (CAD) test fit provided to landlords by ARCA. Given this method of securing space, ARCA plans to primarily provide the space layout and understand the landlord's amortization schedule for tenant improvements. Continued Operation, Maintenance, and Repair of Facility ARCA will take the necessary steps to secure the Certificate of Occupancy for the teaching/learning center. The lease for the selected teaching/learning center provides for necessary repairs and for janitorial service. The facilities will comply with all applicable state and local health and safety requirements. ARCA will follow applicable city planning review procedures.Page 57 of 77Identify the owner(s) of the proposed facility and describe their relationship, if any, with: (1) Members of the local board of the public school district where the proposed open- enrollment public charter school will be located, (2) Employees of the public school district where the proposed open-enrollment public charter school will be located, (3) The eligible entity sponsoring the open-enrollment public charter school, or (4) Employees/directors/administrators of the sponsoring entity or proposed open- enrollment public charter school. Applicant Response: Regus is publicly traded on the London Stock Exchange. To the best of their management's knowledge, they do not have any ties to members of the Bentonville Public School District board, employees of Bentonville Public School District, Arkansas Connections Academy, Inc., or employees/directors/administrators of Arkansas Connections Academy, Inc. The facility will be in compliance with all requirements for accessibility in accordance with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) and all other state and federal laws and local zoning ordinances. Yes No If the facility does not currently meet these requirements, provide a list of items that will need to be addressed to bring the facility into compliance. Also include a statement of permissible uses for the facility from the local zoning authority, and whether there are any alcohol sales within 1,000 feet of the facility. Applicant Response: The facility will meet all Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) requirements. The property is zoned C-2 (General Commercial) which permits standard office use as well as multiple other uses specified in the attached statement of permissible uses for the facility (Attachment 15). There are no alcohol sales within 1,000 feet of the facility. Page 58 of 77(A) Any other individual specifically identified by name in Section A of the application; (B) Any individual or entity with whom the sponsoring entity or charter school has contracted, or intends to contract, to provide any services or products for the proposed charter school; and/or (C) The owner(s) of the facilities to be used. For the purpose of this prompt, an individual has a financial relationship with another individual or entity if he or she: (1) Receives compensation or benefits directly or indirectly from the entity or individual; (2) Is an officer, director, partner, employee, or owner of more than 5% of the shares of an entity that is a corporation, partnership, sole proprietorship, or LLC; and/or (3) Has a family member (spouse, sibling, parent or child, or the spouse employee, or owner of more than 5% of the shares of an entity that is a corporation, partnership, sole proprietorship, or LLC. 19.For each and every individual specifically identified by name in Section A of the application (the contact person, chief operating officer, board members, and other individuals), identify any family or financial relationship which may exist between that individual and: Applicant Response: The following Board Members, who are volunteers and not receiving any pay for being on the Board or working on this application, were identified in Section A of the application: Dennis Beck, Board President Virginia Walden Ford, Board Treasurer Carla Hartwell, Board Secretary The following people work for and are paid by the Board's support partner, Connections, and were identified in Section A of the application: Melissa Nelson, Connections Education, Vice President Bryce Adams, Connections Education, Executive Director Lyn McCullen, Connections Education, Senior Director None of the Board Members have a family or financial relationship with any other individual specifically identified by name in Section A of the application; or any individual or entity with whom Arkansas Connections Academy, Inc. or ARCA have contracted, or intends to contract, to provide any services or products for ARCA; or Regus, the owner of the facilities to be used. None of the Board Members receive compensation either as an employee or independent contractor, from Arkansas Connections Academy, Inc., ARCA, or Connections.Further, none of the Board Members are an officer, director, partner, employee, or owner of more than 5% of the shares of an entity that is a corporation, partnership, sole proprietorship, or LLC. None of the Board Members have a family member (spouse, sibling, parent or child, or the spouse of a sibling, Page 59 of 77parent, or child) who is an officer, director, partner, employee, or owner of more than 5% of the shares of an entity that is a corporation, partnership, sole proprietorship, or LLC. The Connections staff support team, Melissa Nelson, Bryce Adams, and Lyn McCullen do receive compensation from Connections. These individuals were involved in the application process at the behest of the Board. Explain the procedures to be followed if a conflict of interest is identified. The procedures must ensure that all actions are in the best interest of the school and the students at the school. Applicant Response: The Board is committed to the highest standards of ethical conduct. The purpose of a Conflict of Interest policy is to protect ARCA when the Board is contemplating a transaction or arrangement that might impermissibly benefit the private Financial Interest of an Officer or Director of the Board. In addition, the Conflict of Interest policy provides the Board with a procedure which, if observed, will allow a transaction or arrangement to be treated as valid and binding even though Board Director has, or may have, a Conflict of Interest with respect to the transaction. The Board places great importance on making clear any existing or potential Conflicts of Interest. All such Conflicts of Interest shall be declared by the member concerned and noted in the Board meeting minutes. Duty to Disclose In connection with any transaction or arrangement that might give rise to a Conflict of Interest, an Interested Person must disclose the existence of his or her Financial Interest and must be given the opportunity to disclose all material facts to the Board. The Interested Person must make this disclosure at the start of the regularly scheduled Board meeting following discovery of the Financial Interest; provided, however, that no action can be taken on such disclosure unless the issue was identified in the posted agenda for the meeting where required by the Open Meetings Law. Determining Whether a Conflict of Interest Exists After disclosure of the Financial Interest and all material facts, and after any discussion with the Board, the interested Board member shall not participate in the discussions or vote on the matter. The remaining Board members and Board Counsel will determine whether a Conflict of Interest exists. Procedures for Addressing the Conflict of Interest If the Board determines that a Financial Interest of a Board member constitutes a Conflict of Interest, the Board Chair (or acting Board Chair if the sitting chair is the Interested Person) shall, if appropriate, appoint a disinterested person or committee to investigate alternatives to the proposed transaction or arrangement giving rise to the conflict. After exercising due diligence, the Board shall determine whether it can obtain a more advantageous transaction or arrangement with reasonable efforts from a person or entity that would not give rise to a Conflict of Interest. If a more advantageous transaction or arrangement is not reasonably attainable, and the State's Ethics Laws do not prohibit or invalidate the proposed transaction, the Board or committee shall determine by a majority vote whether the proposed transaction or arrangement is in the School's best interest, for its own benefit, and whether the transaction is fair and reasonable to the School. Based on this determination, the Board shall decide whether to enter into the proposed transaction or arrangement. The Board shall make its determination using the Rebuttable Presumption Checklist (Property) as a guide. Violations of the Conflict of Interest Policy If the Board or committee has reasonable cause to believe that a member has failed to disclose an actual or possible Conflict of Interest, it shall inform the member of the basis for such belief and afford the member an opportunity to explain the alleged failure to disclose. If, after hearing the response of the member and making such further investigation as the Board deems warranted under the circumstances, the Board determines that the member has in fact failed to disclose an actual or possible Conflict of Interest, the Board shall take appropriate corrective action. Page 60 of 77Records of Proceedings The minutes of the Board shall document the Conflict of Interest and contain: The names of the persons who disclosed or otherwise were found to have a Financial Interest giving rise to an actual or possible Conflict of Interest, the nature of the Financial Interest, any action taken to determine whether a Conflict of Interest was present, and the Board's decision as to whether a Conflict of Interest in fact existed. The names of the persons who were present for discussions and votes relating to the transaction or arrangement, the content of the discussion, including any alternatives to the proposed transaction or arrangement, and a record of any votes taken on the subject. Compensation A voting member of the Board who receives direct or indirect compensation from the School for services that are necessary for carrying out ARCA's purposes (other than serving as a Board Director), where this is permitted by law or not otherwise prohibited, is precluded from participating in discussions or votes pertaining to that member's compensation. A voting member of any committee whose jurisdiction includes compensation matters and who receives direct or indirect compensation from ARCA for services is precluded from participating in discussions or votes pertaining to that member's compensation. When setting compensation for any individual, the Board committee with jurisdiction over compensation matters shall set such compensation using the Rebuttable Presumption Checklist (Compensation). No Board member is precluded from providing information to the Board of Directors or any committee of the Board regarding member compensation. Annual Statements Each Director and member of the Board shall annually sign the Conflict of Interest Disclosure Statement, which affirms that the Board member: Has received a copy of the Conflict of Interest Policy Has read and understands the Policy Has agreed to comply with the Policy Understands that ARCA is a charitable organization and that in order to maintain its federal tax exemption, it must engage primarily in activities that accomplish one or more of its tax-exempt purposes Periodic Review The Board shall conduct periodic reviews to ensure that ARCA operates in a manner consistent with its charitable purposes and does not engage in activities that could jeopardize its status as an organization exempt from federal income tax. The periodic reviews shall, at a minimum, address the following subjects: Whether compensation arrangements and benefits are reasonable and the result of arm's-length bargaining and do not result in inurement or impermissible private benefit. Whether partnership and joint venture arrangements and third party transactions conform to written policies, are properly recorded, reflect reasonable payments for goods and services, further the ARCA's charitable purposes, and do not result in inurement or impermissible private benefit. Whether agreements with employees and third-party payers further the ARCA's charitable purposes and do not result in inurnment or impermissible private benefit. In conducting the periodic reviews provided for above, ARCA may use outside advisors. The use of outside advisors does not relieve the Board of its responsibility for ensuring that periodic reviews are conducted. 20.Describe the manner in which the school will make provisions for food services. State whether the proposed charter school will apply to participate in the federal National School Lunch program or other federal nutrition programs. Applicant Response: ARCA is requesting a waiver from the Food Services requirement, including the School Breakfast Program in Page 61 of 77\u00a76-8-705. Since ARCA serves students statewide primarily out of their homes, the school will not be offering a food service program. Parents will be fully informed of this fact prior to their students' enrollment so that they may make the best school choice for their family. The school does not intend to participate in the National School Lunch program. For purposes of demographic documentation, ARCA will request during the enrollment process that families who qualify for Free or Reduced Price Meals, based on past eligibility for these services or current family income, to identify themselves. The purpose of collecting this information is to ensure that the school will be prepared to arrange supplemental educational resources with income-based eligibility requirements for students and the school. Parents will be fully informed that volunteering this information will not entitle their family to food service. ARCA staff will refer families who qualify for Free or Reduced Price Meals to local social service agencies for food assistance upon request. In the event that the federally funded lunch program is changed to permit the distribution of direct assistance to families, ARCA will be prepared to seek funds to provide this service. 21. Describe how the parents or guardians of the enrolled students and other members of the community will be involved with the school to positively impact the charter school's educational programs. Applicant Response: Plan for Involving Parents and Guardians in ARCA's Education Programs ARCA understands parental engagement is vital to student success. Parents may serve as Learning Coaches and play an active role in the learning process, providing input and communicating regularly with teachers. ARCA will promote the significant role of parents by providing training for parents and multiple avenues for communication. Regular feedback through surveys and the StarTrack system encourages involvement in the learning process. Frequent and purposeful communication with parents and Learning Coaches help the teacher monitor the student's progress, keep parents informed of current school happenings, and help the school grow and improve. Scheduled phone calls, LiveLesson sessions, WebMail messages, and face-to-face meetings will all be used to help conduct parent-teacher conferences. ARCA will regularly distribute important information in collaboration with the Principal through school newsletters, the school's website, and must-read WebMail messages. Teachers will document all communication with parents and/or students in the log section of Connexus, which allows for detailed tracking of interactions as well as seamless support for students and their families from multiple individuals. Families are encouraged to participate in various events such as picnics, educational field trips, and service opportunities offered throughout the year. These activities are organized through the school staff and Community Coordinators (volunteer parents) throughout the state. Families are notified through WebMail and the school newsletters. Parents can also join Club Orange. This exciting club brings together currently-enrolled parents and parents of prospective students. Parents in Club Orange reach out to their local communities to spread the word about ARCA. Engaging Learning Coaches Although ARCA teachers will ultimately be responsible for delivering instruction, checking for student understanding, and administering any necessary interventions, Learning Coaches have an important role to play in conferencing with teachers and recording student attendance. ARCA will work with Learning Coaches to help them become effective educational partners and will encourage them to engage in all support activities including Page 62 of 77the Getting Started onboarding program, the Get Coaching Learning Coach support program, and the Get Connected socialization and connectedness program. During the enrollment process, Learning Coaches will be provided with the School Handbook, which clearly outlines the role of and expectations for the Learning Coaches. Learning Coaches will also be provided an online orientation course detailing how the program works, how to use Connexus, and particulars about their specific role. Homeroom teachers provide ongoing support to Learning Coaches and ARCA will provide support for Learning Coaches throughout the year with modules on participation, motivation, assessments, and summer learning. If a student is not having attendance taken, is not completing work, or is not succeeding in the school, the student's teachers will intervene and conference with the Learning Coach. If it is determined this stems from a Learning Coach issue (rather than from academic difficulties), the staff would take action such as creating an action plan or contract with the Learning Coach that further specifies expectations and tasks. The school will conduct check-in meetings with the Learning Coach, student, teacher, and administrator throughout the process. Involve the Parents, Employees, and Broader Community in Carrying Out the Terms of the Charter Active involvement of all stakeholders will ensure the success of ARCA and the successful fulfillment of the school's charter. Parents, employees, and community members will be actively involved in the planning the school's future and developing close relationships with each other. Administrators and teachers will have regularly scheduled staff meetings to discuss issues important to the school and maintaining the charter. Professional development will also be conducted at the staff meetings and offered virtually periodically throughout the year. Connections will contract with a third party to survey parents and employees annually to evaluate ARCA on several criteria including student progress, teacher support, and quality of the curriculum. Parents and employees will be surveyed to get their feedback on the program to help identify what the school is doing well and how it can improve. To keep families and community members informed and involved, ARCA will maintain a public website and social media pages (Facebook, Pinterest, Twitter, etc.) that contains all required and relevant information. ARCA will develop a student information and community education plan to inform potential students, their parents/ guardians, and other interested parties about the education program. 22. Describe the potential impact of the proposed public charter school on the efforts of affected public school district(s) to comply with court orders and statutory obligations to create and maintain a unitary system of desegregated public schools. Applicant Response: A.C.A. \u00a7 6-23-106 requires each open-enrollment charter school applicant to review the potential impact of the proposed charter school on the efforts of affected public school districts to comply with court orders or statutory obligations to create and maintain a unitary system of desegregated public schools. The following desegregation analysis explains that ARCA's charter approval will not negatively impact the desegregation efforts of any public school district in the state. ARCA will operate as an online school; since all learning and assignments are delivered to students online, ARCA may attract and enroll students across the entire state. ARCA cannot fully predict the demographics of its student body, but it will not discriminate in its admissions on the basis of gender, national origin, race, ethnicity, religion, disability, or academic or athletic eligibility. If applications for enrollment exceed the set enrollment cap, ARCA will use a random, anonymous lottery for admissions. Since ARCA will draw students statewide, enrollment is not expected to be concentrated in any particular district, meaning that no particular school district will be severely or adversely affected. It is reasonable to expect that at least some of the students that choose to enroll in ARCA may previously have been enrolled in private, parochial, or home schools. These students would have no impact on the desegregation efforts of any public school district. Even if all students that enroll in ARCA do come from public school districts, this is a small fraction of the approximately 460,000 Arkansas public school students.Page 63 of 77All school districts, of course, are continuously bound by the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in Brown v. Board o f Education which requires the operation of a unitary and desegregated system of public schools. It is extremely unlikely, however, that the enrollment of a mere 2,000- 3,000 students or less from numerous school districts across the state will hamper any active efforts to maintain a unitary school system for any particular school district or districts. (ARCA is seeking an enrollment cap of 2,000 students for the first 3 years of operation, and a cap of 3,000 students for years 4 and 5.) ARCA plans to operate a teaching/learning center in Bentonville within the boundaries of the Bentonville School District. Even assuming that the majority of the 2,000- 3,000 students who may enroll in ARCA come from the Bentonville School District and its six contiguous districts, which again is not likely, it's hard to imagine that 2,000- 3,000 students could affect the racial makeup of the over 57,000 students enrolled in the seven school districts in question. The Bentonville, Pea Ridge, Gentry, and Gravette School Districts all currently have a student body of over 65% white students with Hispanic students being the highest minority concentration. The Rogers and Decatur School Districts both have a student body of approximately 50% white students, again with Hispanic students making up the highest minority concentration at 44% and 33% respectively. The only school district with less than a 50% white student body is Springdale. The Springdale School District has a student body of just under 40% white students. These seven districts, as a whole, enjoy a fairly diverse student body. (Student body information is based on that published by the ADE Data Center for the 2014-2015 school year.) It's unlikely that any of these districts are struggling to maintain desegregated schools. It's even more unlikely that ARCA could negatively impact any desegregation efforts currently in place. Based on the analysis presented, ARCA will not negatively impact the desegregation efforts of the Bentonville School District (where administrative offices will be housed) the six contiguous districts to the Bentonville School District, or any other school district throughout the state. ARCA will operate in full compliance with all state and federal statutory and regulatory requirements for the creation and maintenance of desegregated public schools. 23. Explain what the charter founders and other leaders are doing or will do to ensure the success of the charter school in perpetuity. Applicant Response: Student academic success will be monitored and evaluated by all stakeholders: parents, teachers, students, administrators, and the Board. Strong accountability metrics and a high-quality curriculum will ensure the Arkansas Curriculum Frameworks are implemented with fidelity. Comprehensive but appropriate data collection and analysis through Connexus will be used to design and implement student supports and interventions. To increase transparency and accountability, the school's performance will be measured and communicated annually to parents and reported monthly by the Board. To ensure the success of the charter school in perpetuity and the sustainability of the charter in the future, the Board will focus on ongoing professional development for the Board, school leaders, and teachers to ensure professional growth; continue the staggered term limits of board members to ensure the Board can maintain the organizational knowledge base; and maintain appropriate levels of staffing at the school. In addition, the Board will receive ongoing support from the Connections' Compliance Team to ensure all state laws are met. ARCA will ensure everyone has access to the education program, including providing a computer and Internet subsidy. ARCA is committed to making sure all students can access the program regardless of socio-economic status. Additionally, the Board will be responsible for ensuring that all aspects of the financial and programmatic accountability systems meet the obligations to the ADE. Plans for monitoring and reporting on the effectiveness of curriculum, instructional methods, and practices include: Student learning: The Board will hold the school faculty, staff, and its support partner accountable for student learning. Examples of student learning outcomes include measurable learning gains, performance on the state standardized tests, and meeting or exceeding Arkansas's Annual Measurable Objectives (AMO). Curriculum Alignment: The content is aligned to the Arkansas Curriculum Frameworks. If the state standards change, the curriculum can also change to maintain alignment. Page 64 of 77 Stakeholder feedback: The Board will take into account and hold the school responsible for implementing constructive and actionable stakeholder feedback, including feedback received from parents and students via StarTrack. This integrated rating system allows every student (along with every teacher and Learning Coach) to rate each lesson from one to five stars and give comments. Ratings are used by curriculum staff to identify areas of strength, as measured by student learning outcomes, as well as areas in need of improvement. This same tool is also used to measure the school's success. The StarTrack system will be fully embraced by students, teachers, and the school's leadership as a dynamic means to provide real-time feedback on the quality of the curriculum and the school. Parent satisfaction: The Board is focused on parent satisfaction. Parents enroll students in online schools for a variety of reasons. ARCA will measure parental satisfaction and use the data to improve the school. ARCA families will be given an annual opportunity to participate in a thorough parent satisfaction survey, conducted by an independent market research firm and overseen by the Board. The school will aim for at least 90% of families to agree that the curriculum is high quality and that they are satisfied with the educational program and instruction. School growth: ARCA has a responsible plan for school growth, balancing the desire to serve as many students as possible with the challenges of a growing school that positions both the students and ARCA for future success. The school hopes to responsibly grow from 600 students (Year 1) to up to 2,000 (Year 3) through a combination of parent outreach, high student retention rates, and word-of-mouth recommendations and referrals by current ARCA families. Compliance with state and federal laws: The Board will ensure the school is compliant with all applicable state and federal laws regarding public education and specifically charter schools, including ADE policies. This compliance will include the timely and accurate reporting of required state data. Fiscal accountability: The Board is fully committed to fiscal accountability, including cost control, responsible growth, and regular audits. At a minimum on a monthly basis, the Board Treasurer will review all invoices and expenditures and the Board will review a re-forecasted budget in order to adjust to unexpected financial events on a timely basis. The Board will also continually examine processes to make sure best practices are being followed and solid financial accountability is being upheld. ARCA is partnering with an experienced organization, Connections, which will help ensure that the school can open on time the first year. In the event that enrollment is less than anticipated, the school would remain financially viable and the model would remain consistent with the adopted budget. Most expenses of the school are anticipated to be variable instead of fixed. This will ensure the majority of expenses will flex up and down with enrollment, thus cushioning the impact of lower than estimated revenue due to an enrollment shortfall.Page 65 of 7724. Complete the following table showing all sections of Title 6 of the Arkansas Code Annotated (Education Code) and State Board of Education rules, including the Standards for Accreditation of Arkansas Public Schools and School Districts , from which the public charter school seeks to be exempted in order to meet the goals of the school.

Students are able to work across the entire week rather than five days, so instructional time may average less than six hours per day over a seven-day week.

All staff will be subject to background checks and the Code of Ethics for Arkansas Educators. Teachers will be licensed in Arkansas except for those situations where an in- state teacher cannot be identified or for classes with low student interest (eg foreign language & AP courses). In those circumstances, ARCA intends to utilize the resources of Connections' private school, which employs teachers who are licensed in the states they reside. This will enable ARCA to offer the full Connections' catalogue of courses to its students. ARCA estimates that over 90% of course enrollments will be taught by Arkansas-licensed staff, as this is a goal jointly shared by the Board and Connections. While certified administrators will be sought, the Board would like the discretion to hire the best leader for the school that is available. This will increase student achievement by providing students with the most effective teachers and a robust catalogue of courses.

The Board believes in the importance of guidance and counseling services and will ensure appropriate staffing levels are maintained. One or more properly certified guidance counselors will be on staff, but the services provided to students can be distributed differently among staff.

Connections' education program integrates technology, curriculum, instructional materials and tools, staff, and support services into a single education services offering. The Connections program is proprietary and Connections is the only source from which ARCA can obtain access to the Connections education program. ARCA believes that this service offering falls within the single source exemption of ACA \u00a76-21-305. Because of the unique nature of the Connections education program, the Board would prefer RFP requirements be waived only for its contract with Connections. This will increase student achievement as ARCA will have more time to establish its program. All other purchases will be subject to ACA \u00a76-21-301 et seq. Should this waiver not be granted, ARCA will follow the required RFP process for a contract with an educational services provider.N/A N/AArkansas Connections Academy 2015 Application Open-Enrollment Public Charter School Cover SheetAttachment 1 - Arkansas Connections Academy 501(c)(3) Application x501(c)(3) Determination Letter xArticles of Incorporation xEmployer Identification NumberArkansas Connections Academy 2015 Application Open-Enrollment Public Charter School Attachment 1-1Arkansas Connections Academy 2015 Application Open-Enrollment Public Charter School Attachment 1-2Arkansas Connections Academy 2015 Application Open-Enrollment Public Charter School Attachment 1-3Arkansas Connections Academy 2015 Application Open-Enrollment Public Charter School Attachment 1-4Arkansas Connections Academy 2015 Application Open-Enrollment Public Charter School Attachment 1-5Arkansas Connections Academy 2015 Application Open-Enrollment Public Charter School Attachment 1-6DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE CINCINNATI OH 45999-0023 Date of this notice: 05-28-2014 ACADEMY INC % ASHLI GOBLE 1001 FLEET ST FL 5 For assistance you may call us at: BALTIMORE, MD 21202 1-800-829-4933 IF YOU WRITE, ATTACH THE STUB AT THE END OF THIS NOTICE.

I have an elementary aged child and I want more options for his education. Many students and families can benefit from flexible schedules and the ability to learn at a students unique pace. Virtual schools offer families who choose to home school, support and structure. They help encourage a high standard. They also offer students who's parents don't feel comfortable homeschooling on their own, or who couldn't otherwise afford home schooling materials, the chance to try a flexible, home-learning environment. Having more than one virtual school option in Arkansas gives families greater choice. Introducing a second virtual charter school option helps ensure that healthy competition will keep each virtual academy striving to provide a high-quality education to Arkansas families. Children are so unique--their learning style varies. It is in the best interest of our children and our future to offer a diverse collection of educational choices for Arkansas families. As an Arkansan, I want my tax dollars spent to fund a variety of education options. And as a parent, I want my family to have a variety of options for my son and his peers. Thank you for working to make education for Arkansas kids the best it can be. Sincerely, Samantha Lesher Arkansas Connections Academy 2015 Application Open-Enrollment Public Charter School Attachment 3-2Parent Support Letter from Kristi Rhodes Arkansas Connections Academy 2015 Application Open-Enrollment Public Charter School Attachment 3-3Parent Support Letter from Marsha McCarver Dear Arkansas Department of Education, My name is Marsha McCarver and I would like to share with you why I think you need to approve a second on-line public school program. My youngest son, Enoch, decided he wanted to home school this year as a 6th grader. He has been in private Christian schools up until this year. We began to do research last July and found the current on line public school that Arkansas offers. We made inquiries and began the application process. We were told we would be on a waiting list because our son was coming from a private school and not a public school. There was a great deal of paper work to send in, and some of it was rejected for unknown reasons. We became frustrated with the process and knew we had to make a decision and find home school curriculum or an on line school before time for school to start....August 18th. So we gave up on the on line public school and went with an on line private school, Keystone, out of Pennsylvania. However, after talking to a representative from Connections Academy in person twice since then , I am convinced that Connections Academy would provide a very good well-rounded education for my son two years from now as an 8th grader. He would have the benefits of a public school without the negative influences of one. My son has a quiet and sensitive personality and is a grade ahead for his age since he started school early. We don't want him exposed to the roughness of a traditional public school. We also like the idea of him taking classes that our local public school doesn't offer, like Chinese. I also like the idea of clubs he can join with other on line public schoolers. Another advantage is that it will be an Arkansas school with Arkansas certified teachers free to us as Arkansas property taxpayers instead of one out of Pennsylvania that we have to pay for. I also like that there is some flexibility in the schedule when it comes to hours of the day and vacation days. Finally, I just want to say that I believe that this program is one that many people in Arkansas will want to take advantage of if they know about it. It is a progressive program with several other states already setting the example of its benefits. I am disappointed that this new school wasn't approved for the coming school year. Please, please consider this and make it a new charter on line school in Arkansas for the 2016-17 school year. If Arkansas goes to more of these type of schools, think of the money being saved... less building upkeep, utilities, and school bus drivers. Put that money into good teacher training and salaries for teachers of online public schools. Thank you for your generous consideration.

Because online learners do not face the distractions and interruptions of a typical school setting, students often use their learning time much more efficiently. The in-depth application of concepts that is often relegated to homework in a conventional school setting will be an integral part of the learning day; the application of discrete skills, extended projects, and remedial and enrichment activities will be part of the daily routine for students and their Learning Coaches. Figure 5-1 represents an example of a student school day. Activities vary based upon student needs, coursework, and personal schedules. Learning is integrated within individual activities as well as LiveLesson sessions and phone calls with teachers. Learning can occur when students learn best - not just between 8 a.m. and 3 p.m. Students will create daily checklists to ensure they are staying on-task. The daily routine includes checking WebMail, looking at the to-do list on Connexus, reviewing the daily planner in Connexus, and completing lessons listed in the planner. Students will easily see which lessons are due as they are in bolded text. As lessons are completed they will change from bold to regular text. Students can access the lessons directly from their daily planners. In addition, students can access any notes or tips provided by the teacher and view important course-related information like LiveLesson session schedules, recordings, and supplemental materials. Students can track their progress and grades at any time in the Grade Book. Figure 5-1.

Teachers collaborate to share ideas, information, and teaching techniques with the families, who are always welcome to visit. Figure 5-2.

Currently, the Board has an agreement in place with Regus to lease office space at 609 SW 8th Street in Bentonville.1In addition, the Board has discussed potentially securing an additional satellite office after the charter is approved to serve as a resource center for students. While the lease has not yet been negotiated with Regus, the Board anticipates doing so once the charter is approved. Certain key terms will likely be included in the lease. These include, but are not limited to: xEarly termination provision in the event of charter revocation or non-renewal xTurnkey demo and build-out of space by landlord at landlord's expense xOptions for renewal xRights of First Offer or First Refusal, when possible, on contiguous space xInability of landlord to re-locate the premises xRent abatement in the event of diminution of space xInsurance terms consistent with ARCA's policies xPre-approval for tenant's improvements (voice/data/electric) ARCA's demos and build-outs will encompass setting up a typical office environment. The landlord will provide turnkey solutions with standard building finishes, pursuant to a CAD test fit provided to landlords by ARCA. Given this method of securing space, ARCA plans to primarily provide the space layout and understand the landlord's amortization schedule for tenant improvements. 1 http://www.regus.com/locations/business-centre/arkansas-bentonville-bentonville-plaza Arkansas Connections Academy 2015 Application Open-Enrollment Public Charter School Cover Sheet Attachment 11 -Weighted LotteryArkansas Connections Academy 2015 Application Open-Enrollment Public Charter School Attachment 11-1ARCA will not use a weighted lottery, as the conditions required by \u00a76-23-306(14)(c) in order to use a weighted lottery do not exist. ARCA and Connections have no history of discriminatory practices and the lotteries, if necessary, are public and monitored for fairness. The current racial/ethnic demographics of students attending the 29 schools supported by Connections nationwide are representative of similar demographics to the 26 states in which the schools are located. Currently schools supported by Connections serve students of the following races/ethnic groups, as reported by families during the enrollment process: 67% White, 10% Black/African American, 2% Asian, and 1% American Indian or Alaskan Native. Additionally, 13% of families identified their ethnicity as Hispanic/Latino and 87% Non- Hispanic/Latino. Based on these figures, it is evident that schools supported by Connections do not include discriminatory practices in the enrollment process and furthermore encourage families regardless of their socio-economic circumstances to enroll. ARCA will continue this in adherence with state and federal regulation and anticipates enrolling students of similar demographics to the public school population in Arkansas.

ARCA will utilize a broad-reaching student recruitment effort, thereby ensuring outreach to families with a wide variety of racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic backgrounds. In addition, ARCA may focus on certain subgroups for extra recruitment efforts in order to achieve a pool of potential students that reflects a balanced student population.

Friendship Aspire seeks to fulfill this mission by providing students a high quality, liberal arts education focused on preparin g students with the academic and life skills needed to be successful in college and beyond. Friendship Arkansas will the charter holder for the school operating under the name Friendship Aspire. Through a management agreement with the Friendship Education Foundation, Friendship Arkansas will replicate the program of the Washington, DC -based Friendship Public Charter School - a program that has spawned three high performing elementary/middle schools, been recognized by the DC State Education Officer for pre paring students to graduate high school on time (greater than 90% cohort rate) and enroll in college (100% college acceptance rate for graduates), and helped to turnaround two of the lowest performing elementary/middle schools in Baltimore. The Friendship program was designed to instill an appreciation for education, high aspirations and personal standards that prepare students to become responsible contributors to their communities and world. We seek to serve children from kindergarten to eighth grade in elementary and middle school classes. At capacity we will enroll approximately 450 students. The student population targeted will be predominantly low income, minority children with a moderate to high incidence of special needs. Independent studies show that at-risk children are a population that most benefits from Friendship's model of instruction, intervention and co - curricular programs. Information on the School District in Which the Charter Would Be Located Little Rock 74.9 % free and reduced -price lunch (2014 -2015) Needs Improvement District (ESEA 2014) - Literacy and Mathematics 2 Documentation Provided in Support of the Charter Petition of Support Included in Application Three names on the petition Issues that Remain Unresolved as Determined by th e Charter Internal Review Committee : C7: EDUCATIONAL PROGRAM Remaining issue: It is unclear why grade five will not be served in 2017-2018. C9: STUDENT SERVICES Remaining issues: The use of a manifestation determination team seems to be misused since, a manifestation team meets when a student with a disability has been suspended for 10 days and must meet to determine if the behavior is a manifestation of the student's disability. The applicant needs to confirm an understanding that all federal and state laws related t o Special Education Services are applicable. The applicant neglected to comply with the following request: Remove \"In the event that the team does not feel that the student's current setting is adequately meeting his or her needs, the student, either by parent or school request, can appeal to the board to have the student placed into a more restrictive, out -of-general education setting\" and confirm that placement decisions for students with disabilities will be made by the IEP team, including the parent, in an appropriately called IEP conference. The applicant did not respond to the following comment: \"Revise the response to section H based on ADE Rules Governing Gifted and Talented Program.\" C18: FACILITIES No Facilities Utilization Agreement was provided. C20: FOOD SERVICES The applicant needs to confirm that the charter school will follow federal and state procurement regulations when procuring a food service m anagement company. Other: The calendar provided by the applicant is a list of events and does not show the number of student or staff days. CHARTER INTERNAL REVIEW COMMITTEE REVIEW AND APPLICANT RESPONSES1 Friendship Aspire Academy PRE-APPLICATION MATERIALS The Arkansas Department of Education requires that all applicants submit a Letter of Intent, outlining a general description of the proposed charter school. Evaluation Criteria: A Letter of Intent filed with Arkansas Department of Education on time and including all the necessary information Fully Responsive PART B EXECUTIVE SUMMARY The Arkansas Department of Education requires all applicants to include an executive summary. Evaluation Criteria: A mission statement (with content to be evaluated for Prompt #3 of Part C); and The key programmatic features of the proposed charter school Fully Responsive PART C NARRATIVE DESCRIPTION OF THE PROPOSED CHARTER C1: PUBLIC HEARING RESULTS All proposed school design teams must conduct a public hearing before applying for an open - enrollment charter school, to assess support for the school's establishment. Applicants are asked both to document the logistics of the hearing and to include a n arrative of the hearing results. Evaluation Criteria: A thorough description of the results of the public hearing; Evidence of public support exhibited at the hearing; Documentation of required notices published to garner public attention to the hearing; and Documentation of required notices of the public hearing to superintendents of districts from which the proposed school is likely to draw students and to superintendents of districts that are contiguous to the district in which the charter school would be located 2 Fully Responsive Concerns and Additional Questions Provide the third notice of public hearing for Friendship Aspire as only two notices for Aspire, published on July 3 and July 10, were included. Explain why two applications for the same address and grade levels were submitted. Applicant Response: The 3rd Notice was published on July 17, 2015 in the Arkansas Democratic Gazette. An affidavit of publication is included along with the copy of the Tear Sheet from the application. Friendship Education Foundation seeks to develop a cluster of three schools serving grades K - 12 over time. In order t o support a high school in the future , two K-8 feeder schools are needed, so there are separate applications for Friendship Aspire and Friendship Lead. Friendship Lead plans to open a year later, in 2017, and at a separate address. C2: GOVERNING STRUCTU RE The Governing Structure section should explain how the school will be governed. It should present a clear picture of the school's governance processes and composition, what responsibilities various groups and people will have and the relationships amon g the groups. Evaluation Criteria: Documentation of proper legal structure of the governing board and sponsoring entity; A comprehensive description of the planned relationship between the governing board of the school and governing board of the sponsoring entity; A clear description of the governing board's roles and responsibilities; Adequate policies and procedures for board operation, including board composition, member term length, and member selection; A clear, sensible delineation of roles and responsibilities in relation to governance and school management; and A reasonable plan for involving parents, staff, students and community in the decision - making of the school Fully Responsive Concerns and Additional Questions Identify what individual, job position(s), or entity(s) will have final decision making authority for the school in the areas of finance and purchasing; hiring and firing of staff; and hiring and firing of the school director or superintendent. Applicant Response: Friendship strives to keep all its decision making at a site level. Final decision making authority for finance and purchasing is set by the board -approved Fiscal 3 Policies and Procedures Manual, which will comply with the Arkansas Financial Accounting Handbook and which will specify thresholds for approval at the financ e team level (typically $500), school director level (typically $1,500), board treasurer (typically $5,000) and full board (typically $10,000). All finance and purchasing decisions are pre-approved by the finance team to ensure compliance with the adopted budget. Final decision making authority for hiring and firing of staff rests with the school director, to ensure their accountability for the school's academic performance. Final decision making authority for hiring and firing of the school director is the joint responsibility of the school board and the Friendship Education Foundation's Executive Director. In practice, both parties must approve the hiring and either one can recommen d the termination of the School Director or superintendent. C3: MISSION STATEMENT The Mission Statement should be meaningful and indicate what the school intends to do, for whom, and to what degree. Evaluation Criteria: A mission statement that is clea r and succinct Fully Responsive C4: EDUCATIONAL NEED The Educational Need section should explain the need for a charter school in the proposed location and the innovative educational option offered by the charter school. Evaluation Criteria: Valid, reliable, and verifiable data substantiate an educational need for the charter; Innovations that would distinguish the charter from other schools Fully Responsive C5: ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENT GOALS The Academic Achievement Goals section should d efine the performance expectations for students and the school as whole and support the charter's mission.

Teachers in schools supported by Friendship are trained to apply the cur rent research on instruction to best meet the needs of the students in their classrooms. Teachers use the \"gradual release of responsibility\" model of instruction: I do, We do, You do. The cognitive load is passed from the teacher-as-model to the student for maximum learning (Fisher, Frey, 2008). The learning process starts in a structured manner, generally with a mini -lesson (I do), and becomes less structured as the responsibility transfers from the teacher to the student. The teacher facilitates the guided practice (We do) then re leases the responsibility to the students through collaborative and independent work (You do). Teachers are expected to differentiate instruction at every phase based on the needs of their students. Friendship's training program reinforces the idea that p roficient teachers use a variety of appropriate instructional strategies based on the standards, lessons, and needs of their students. Friendship supports teachers in making the cognitive shift to become diagnosticians who skillfully determine the appropr iate instructional \"prescription\" to ensure that students meet the standards and gradually release responsibility to students for ownership of their learning. Intense professional development is provided to ensure that teachers are equipped with the knowl edge and skills to ensure that this happens effectively in each and every classroom. Friendship trains teachers to review the available curriculum resources and develop high -quality learning experiences that ensure that each student will learn as efficient ly and effectively as possible. Friendship provides teachers with research -based, common core -aligned program materials form Houghton Mifflin Harcourt so that teachers will have at hand a plethora of resources to support the learning of their individual s tudents. Through differentiated instruction, teachers enable students to 11 achieve outcomes in ways that work best for each learner (Tomlinson, Wiggins, and McTighe, 2004). Friendship -trained teachers are always focused on learning for students at every le vel. Teachers continually ask the following key questions: How do we know our students are learning? What do we do when students are not learning? What do we do when students have learned? C9: STUDENT SERVICES The Student Services section should describ e how the school will address specific services for its student body. Evaluation Criteria: A description of the ways in which the following services will be provided to students even in each area for which a waiver is requested : A guidance program that wi ll serve all students; A health services program that will serve all students; A plan for a media center for use by all students; Sound plans for educating special education students that reflect the full range of programs and services required to provide such students with a high quality education; A transportation plan that will serve all eligible students; An alternative education plan for eligible students, including those determined to be at -risk and to offer access to one or more approved Alternative Learning Environments; A plan to serve students who are English language learners; and Plans for a gifted and talented program for eligible students Partially Responsive Concerns and Additional Questions Explain why a counselor will be hired mid -year in the first year of operation instead of before school begins. Confirm that a \"full continuum\" of services will be provided to special education students . Remove, \"In the event that the team does not feel that the student's current setting is adequately me eting his or her needs, the student, either by parent or school request, can appeal to the board to have the student placed into a more restrictive, out -of-general education setting\" and confirm that placement decisions for students with disabilities will be made by the IEP team, including the parent , in an appropriately called IEP conference. Verify that all state and federal laws pertaining to Special Education will be followed . Revise the response to section H based on ADE Rules Governing Gifted and Talented Program. Explain how and when \"The nurse may also teach some health education.\" Applicant Response: Because of the initial grade configuration Friendship does not feel the need to employ the guidance counselor until January of the year preceding year 2 when the middle grade will be 12 added. Friendship Aspire shall provide a full continuum of services for special education students. When a student has been referred for special education services, the special education department must first review all current data on the student including, but not limited to, medical history (including hearing and vision reports), parent and teacher input, outcomes of prior response to intervention initiatives, attendance, formal and informal school -based assessment s, and student observations/input when deemed appropriate. Upon review of all documentation, the team, consisting of the parent, general and special education teacher, related service provider(s), SSST and Special Education Coordinator, nurse, guidance counselor, and building administrator, must determine if evaluations are warranted, and denote which areas of concern are to be assessed (reading, writing, behavior, speech and language etc.). After the evaluations are compl eted, the Manifestation Determina tion Team must convene to review the findings of the evaluation and determine, with the assistance of the disability criteria checklist found in the special education data system, if the student meets the criteria of the suspected disability. Each studen t's Individualized E ducation Plan (IEP) is provided to each general educator at the beginning of the school year and securely stored in the classroom for collaborative planning. All teachers working with students who have disabilities are expected to use the IEPs to incorporate accommodations, modifications, and instructional strategies necessary to meet student needs. Furthermore, general and special educators have access to resources that guide instructional decisions in an inclusive setting and address challenging behaviors. These resources include curriculum guides and intervention materials intended to \"fill in gaps\" for struggling students. The ongoing collaboration among general and special educators is the foundation for effective co -teaching str ategies that foster growth for all students. As teachers work with one another, they also leverage parents, community organizations, and related service providers to accomplish short and long -term positive outcomes in academic and social-emotional areas. Friendship's goal is to maximize new partnerships to increase accountability, share resources/strategies, analyze data, and meet agreed -upon student goals. All student accommodations are reviewed on an individual basis. For example, some students transition before or after their peers in alignment with a Behavior Intervention Plan to ensure that they are not distracted by the environment. In other situations, such as enrollment in an intervention program, a special educator will work with the schedule to ensure the appropriate hours and services are provided. Friendship will comply with all applicable federal and state laws related to Special Education Services. The nurse will work with health educati on teachers (PE and Science) in a team approach to provide additional resources to health lessons. Remaining issues: The use of a manifestation determination team seems to be misused since, a manifestation team meets when a student with a disability has been suspended for 10 days and must meet to deter mine if the behavior is a manifestation of the student's disability.

Fully Responsive Concerns and Additional Questions Explain how the charter will ensure that the lottery process is transparent to the public. Explain in more detail what is meant by \"a marketing plan .\" Applicant Response: If the number of students seeking admission to the school exceeds the school's capacity, students will be selected on the basis of an open lottery. Applications will be accepted throughout the spring. The schools will continue to accept applications until seven days prior to the lottery, and the lottery will take place in the spring before the school opens. The lottery will also be supervised by an independent local CPA firm. An additional admissions lottery will be conducted each subsequent year for the entering class of the lowest grade. In addition, spaces open in existing grades will also be filled by lottery in subsequent years. The lottery may be conducted by using specialized computer software or publicly at a scheduled event. The lottery proced ures will be as follows: o All students who apply have equal chance for admission. A drawing will be held and each child will have his or her name entered. 15 o A sibling preference will apply to families seeking to enroll more than one child in the school. o The lottery drawing will rotate through the grade levels, beginning with the lowest grade. The first student will be selected from the school's lowest grade; the next student will be selected from the next lowest grade, and so on through every grade level. The process will then repeat until all spaces have been filled. o Once spaces in a given grade have been filled, the names of the remaining applicants for that grade will be drawn and their names will be placed on the school's waiting list, ranked with resp ect to the order in which they were drawn. Children whose parents or guardians submit applications after the lottery will have their names placed at the bottom of the wait list in the order in which their applications are received. Friendship will employ the following marketing plan . Upon final approval of our charter, we will immediately: o Produce all relevant marketing m aterials (in mul tiple languages ), including A letter from the CEO outlining the new school, its mission, philosophy on education, curric ulum highlights, location, student eligibility, and registration information. Posters outlining the new school, its mission, philosophy on education, curriculum highlights, location, student eligibility, and registration information. Fliers outlining the n ew school, its mission, philosophy on education, curriculum highlights, location, student eligibility, and registration information. o Disseminate marketing materials by Canvassing homes in the surrounding neighborhoods with fliers . Placing posters and leavi ng fliers at local businesses, libraries, doctor offices, social service agencies, etc. Mailing letters to local residents . Communicate with local residents and their children at parent meetings and community events hosted by a variety of community groups In addition , the following strateg ies will also be selectively employed : o Press Releases and Marketing Communications : Key information will be shaped into messages that can be communicated in all subsequent media operations. o Radio Advertising : Radio has proven to be one of the most effective ways of advertising local school enrollment. The school may use radio ads when holding a social event, open house, registration week, and any other special events. o Newspaper Advertising : In conjunction with other eff orts, newspaper advertising can also be effective. We will determine if newspaper advertising is needed depending on 16 the number of students that have enrolled and how much time is left to recruit students as we approach opening day. o TV Advertising : This form of advertising is expensive, so we will determine if TV advertising is necessary depending on the number of students that have enrolled and how much time is left to recruit students as we approach opening day. o Q & A Session w ith Parents and Students : The principal will hold a Q & A session with parents and students to address any questions or concerns parents may have. Grassroots marketing is the best and the least expensive of all form of recruitment, especially when dealin g with a local audience. B elow are the strategies we will employ to maximize the impact of grassroots marketing. o Door-to-Door Campaign : We will organize teams consisting of two or more people to go door-to-door in the neighborhood or attendance zone, to inform parents and potential students of the new school. We will ensure that each team is well stocked with applications, a fact sheet, information about the new campus, handouts, and giveaways. Samples of door -to-door scripts will be made available prior to the campaign to ensure t hat the teams are well informed and can address all questions. o Information Sessions : As with every new school, an abundance of questions and concerns will emerge from parents' minds. It is very important to respond to those immediately. For that reason, information sessions are necessary. This gives us the opportunity to immediately inform parents, students, and other members of the community about the change before any concerns surface. o Distribution of Marketing Material : We will blanket surrounding nei ghborhoods and nearby community organizations with flyers, door hangers, brochures and as much marketing materials to advertise the new school. Specifically, we will distribute those materials in local businesses, preschool s, day care centers, libraries, grocery stores, beauty salons, churches, and laundromats in the area. o Community Events and Education Fairs : A very effective way to recruit families is to participate in education -related community events and fairs. We will create teams of at least two pe ople to be present at booths during such community events. We will create a schedule well in advance to cover different shifts during each event. It is important that there are enough materials to distribute during the event. Each booth will have a scho ol fact sheet, literature about Fr iendship, sign -in sheets, student applications, materials that showcase the school and giveaways for parents and potential students. o Principal Meet and Greet with Parents : The principal will schedule a \"meet and greet\" event for parents and potential students. Ideally, this will take place at the school so that parents can see where their child will be attending and also become familiar with the school's surroundings. Allowing parents the opportunity to ask questions di rectly to the principal is essential. 17 C13: PRIOR CHARTER INVOLVEMENT The Prior Charter Involvement section should identify all prior charter involvement, if any, for each individual connected with the proposed charter.

Electronically signed, Sandra Ward On the Second day of July 2015. 121 East Capitol Avenue l Little Rock, AR 72201 Gunman chases family into home Police were seeking an armed robber who chased a man and two children in- to their Little Rock home Wednesday. Isaias Trujillo, 36, said he was outside his home at 5616 Baseline Road when a man pulled up in a white Cadillac sedan just before midnight, according to a police report. The man walked toward Tru- jillo and two boys, ages 14 and 15, and demanded mon- ey. Trujillo said he and the boys ran inside and blocked the door. The robber ran after the three and damaged the door trying to get inside, but even- tually fled empty-handed, ac- cording to the report. No injuries were reported. Police searched the area but made no arrests. The robber is described only as black and between the ages of 30 and 45. He wore a white T -shirt. 2 rob LR eatery's workers, rifle safe Two armed men robbed Gus's Fried Chicken on W ednesday night, taking cash and cellphones from employ- ees and money from the safe, police said. The men jumped a priva- cy fence about 10 p.m. and approached a female em- ployee sitting on the patio of the restaurant at 400 N. Bowman Road. They pointed black handguns at the woman and one of the men told her to \"Give me all your money,\" according to the report. The men took the wom- an's cellphone and money and then ordered her back into the restaurant where the men demanded money from the safe, took the restaurant's phones and the cellphone of another employee before running from the restaurant, the report said. The men also reportedly fired one shot into the air while they were running from the business. Officers searched the area but made no arrests.

The network is working with the Rape, Abuse and Incest National Network and Darkness to Light \u2014 along with the Duggar family \u2014 in creating a one-hour, com- mercial-free documentary that will air later this summer. In Touch Weekly magazine reported May 21 that Josh Dug- gar had been the subject of a criminal investigation in 2006 involving actions in 2002 and 2003. He resigned as a lobbyist for the conservative Family Re- search Council after the report appeared. In March 2002, then-14-year- old Josh Duggar told his parents that he had run his hands over young girls in the Duggar house- hold as they slept, his parents said in a June 3 Fox News in- terview with Megyn Kelly . Josh Duggar was disciplined and pre- cautions were taken, his parents said, but they didn't seek outside assistance for him or his victims. Josh Duggar then admitted to his parents in July 2002 that he took similar advantage of girls who had fallen asleep on the family couch and was again punished, Jim Bob and Michelle Duggar told Fox News. The Duggars said they sought out- side help after a third admission in March 2003 by Josh Duggar that he touched two girls while they were awake. Josh Duggar was then sent to Little Rock for four months. The Springdale Police De- partment began an investigation in 2006, after an anonymous tip was forwarded to state authori- ties. The investigation conclud- ed that the statute of limitations had passed for any charges. Duggar sisters Jill Dillard, 24, and Jessa Seewald, 22, ap- peared on Fox News' The Kelly File on June 5 and acknowledged that they were inappropriately touched by their brother. But the two sisters said the problem had been taken care of years ago, and Josh Duggar had been forgiven and is a changed person. Two of the other girls fon- dled by Josh Duggar as a teen were also his sisters, the Dug- gars told Fox News. The fifth victim was a family friend. \"With God's grace and help, Josh, our daughters and our en- tire family overcame a terrible situation, found healing and a way forward,\" the Duggar fam- ily said in a statement released Thursday. \"It is our prayer that the painful situation our family went through many years ago can point people toward faith in God and help others who also have lived through similar dark situations to find help, hope and healing as well. \"W e look forward to working with TLC on this upcoming spe- cial documentary and hope that it is an encouragement to many.\"Shannon Llanes, senior di- rector of publicity for TLC parent company Discovery Communications, said neither the network nor the family had any further comment beyond its statements. The show 19 Kids and Count- ing started in September 2008 and lasted for 10 seasons. The series' final episode, which aired May 19, drew about 1.7 million viewers.

His next court appearance is to be Aug. 24, about two weeks after he turns 37 , for a progress report on the evaluation process. Trial dates cannot be set until the question of his mental health is resolved. Taylor has been jailed with- out bail since his court hearing on May 29 in which the judge learned that T aylor was going to be arrested on the beating allegations. Condon was found uncon- scious the evening of May 13 on the floor of a cabin at the Oa- sis Renewal Center on Cooper Orbit Road in Little Rock. After he regained consciousness, he could not initially tell investiga- tors what had happened to him. No one at the center reported seeing what had gone on be- tween the men, although at least two witnesses heard something, according to Pulaski County sheriff's office reports.Also, Taylor told a center worker that something had oc- curred between Condon and himself, but the reports don't say what he said beyond a quote from T aylor: \"I told dude to stop f****** with me.\" It was not until the next day that a hospitalized Con- don reportedly described being punched in the face by T aylor, who he said got angry when he greeted the boxer and attempt- ed to high-five him. An arrest affidavit states that Condon suf- fered five fractures in his face around his eyes and nose, inju- ries that required reconstructive surgery. The second-degree battery charge against T aylor carries a maximum of six years in pris- on, but that penalty can be dou- bled if he is deemed a habitual offender by being convicted of the other charges against him. The judge had agreed to al- low Taylor to enter rehabilita- tion in March, after the boxer had spent about six weeks in jail after his arrest over accusations that he'd fired a gun at a family with three children after Little Rock's Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Day parade in January. Taylor had been in rehabili- tation for less than three months when he was arrested on Con- don's accusations. Taylor's other charges are: m First-degree battery and ter- roristic threatening in the Au- gust shooting of his 42-year-old cousin, Tyrone DaWayne Hin- ton of Jacksonville, and allega- tions that he threatened the life of another man, Aharon Coley , 20, of Little Rock. Hinton re- portedly required surgery for treatment of his injuries. Tay- lor's lawyers have suggested that T aylor acted in self-defense. The charges together carry a poten- tial of 26 years in prison. m Five counts of aggravated assault, and single charges o f terroristic threatening and mis- demeanor marijuana posses- sion stemming from his Martin Luther King Day arrest. The charges together carry a poten- tial 36-year maximum and are based on accusations that he threatened a family of five by firing a gun at them and threat- ened to kill the father, 42-year- old Thelton Smith of Little Rock, outside a gym owned by Taylor.Taylor v Continued from Page 1B Duggars v Continued from Page 1B News For story ideas and news tips: (501) 378-3485 news@arkansasonline.com City Editor Danny Shameer (501) 378-3568 dshameer@arkansasonline.com State Editor Heidi White (501) 378-3483 hwhite@arkansasonline.com Chief Photographer John Sykes Jr. (501) 918-4529 jsykes@arkansasonline.com Mail Arkansas Democrat-Gazette P.O.

The district is in the midst of what started as a $265 mil- lion dollar capital improve- ment program that is reduc- ing what were 21 campuses to 13 schools. Twelve of the 13 are being built anew or ex- tensively renovated. The North Little Rock public school system does not typically require its re- turning students to physi- cally register for each new school year. This year, however, the district is moving student information from the Ar- kansas Public School Com- puter Network to the state's e-School system, North Little Rock Deputy Superintendent Beth Stewart said. As part of that transition, district offi- cials are trying to obtain up- to-date, correct information on all students, Stewart said. District officials said more information about registra- tion will be made available to district parents in the next few days through the news media, recorded \"robo-calls\" to homes and on the district's website and Facebook page.Parents seeking to regis- ter their children must pro- vide proof of their address by showing a current utility bill or a lease or mortgage agreement. The parents al- so must provide a working telephone number, and they will be asked for an email address, although that is not required. Parents of students new to the district must also show a birth certificate for their child, the child's immuniza- tion record, Social Security number and information from the child's previous school.NLRSD v Continued from Page 1B Police beat More information on the Web arkansasonline.com/right2knowRight2Know crime databaseSCOTT CARROLL AND EMILY NITCHER ARKANSAS DEMOCRAT -GAZETTE Today's radar speed checks Little Rock and North Little Rock police and the Pulaski County sheriff's ofce will use radar to detect speeding at these locations.

Friendship is requesting this waiver from these statutes, which are on the ir face applicable only to school districts, to ensure that there is no confusion as to the applicability of the statutes to the governance structure of Friendship's charter. The waivers requested under the Ark. Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 6 -13-601 et seq. series do not include the monthly meeting requirements under Ark. Code Ann. \u00a7 6 -13-619 and the board training requirements under Ark. Code Ann. \u00a7 6 -13-629. Legal Comments: Rationale should be provided to explain how this waiver will help the Applicant meet its goals. The Applicant should provide as much detail about the structure and operation of its governance as possible.

Friendship selects educators based upon grit, classroom and culture management, high expectations, commitment to data -driven instruction, and past achievement. Continuous targeted support and development is critical in closing the achievement gap. All of our teachers will be Highly Qualified and will need to meet specific rigorous Friendship network hirin g standards. However, within those requirements, we want our principal to have the autonomy to hire the best possible teachers, even if some of those candidates' qualifications do not include an Arkansas license. The school will be committed to recruiting and hiring quality staff members. Friendship builds human capital through annual training for all new principals and other leadership team members. The training addresses the fundamentals of school organization, student management, and student achievement. A year -round leadership developme nt program Page 3 supports the growth of principals in effective leadership. Additional waivers relating to payment of certified teachers are requests so that we are able to appropriately compensate non -certified but Highly Qualified teachers. Legal Comments: None 3. Uniform Date of Beginning and End of School Year ARK. CODE ANN. \u00a7 6-10-106 Uniform Dates for Beginning and End of School Y ear Friendship's model uses more time on instruction to accelerate student achievement. A longer school day and year requires that the state date and end of date of school is extended. Legal Comments: The Applicant should describe how it intends to count a \"school day .\" It appears the Applicant may also need to request a waiver from ARK. CODE ANN. \u00a7 6 -16-102. Applicant Response: A school day is any calendar day that students attend not inclusive of weekends. Friendship requests a waiver of ARK. CODE ANN Section 6 -16-102. This was erroneously omitted from the initial application. Remaining Issues: The Applicant shou ld be prepared to discuss the hour -by-hour structure of its school day before the Authorizer. 4.

We propose to use the Freindship compensation policy, which includes a salary schedule and is intended to be competitive in the marketplace and fair to a ll employees. Using Page 4 this schedule will ensure that the school is able to pay teachers fairly and also balance its budget. Since, as a charter school, we bear the additional cost of rent and up fit for a facility, we must be quite conservative in budgeting. Legal Comments: Rationale should be provided to explain how this waiver will help the Applicant meet its goals. The Applicant should explain the duties of each of its projected classified employees. Applicant Response: See job descriptions attached to review response and application section. Maintaining a balanced budget and quality operation along with ensuring the ability to hire andretain quality classified personnel is necessary to ensure that the bet teacher is in every classroom. Remaining Issues: The descriptions referenced in the initial Legal Comments were not found in the attached list of job descriptions. The job descriptions that were found in the attached list were very brief. 5. Class Size and Teaching Load Standards for Accreditation 10.02 Class Size and Teaching Load We believe that the research on the benefits of reducing class size is mixed. While there are studies that suggest class sizes of less than 20 do imp rove student achievement, other studies question the val idity of this data. Total enrollment will not exceed 450 for grades K -8. Class size at Friendship Aspire will not exceed 20 in K and 25 in all other grades except that the school may adjust the class size by 10% without exceeding the charter if circumstanc es require. Legal Comments: Rationale should be provided to explain how this waiver will help the Applicant meet its goals. Applicant Response: In order to ensure that Friendship meets the goals (For example) a minimum of 1.5 years growth on NWEA MAPP it is necessary that we have the flexibility of class sizing. In certain instances smaller classes help with student performance but there is other research to the contrary. We request the ability to make the right decision on class size to meet the needs of the students served. Remaining Issues: None 6. Superintendent ARK. CODE ANN. \u00a7 6 -13-609 Page 5 ARK. CODE ANN. \u00a7 6 -17-427 Superintendent License - Superintendent Mentoring Program Required ADE Rules Governing the Superintendent Mentoring Program Standards for Accreditation 15.01 School District Superintendent Friendship seeks exemption from these portions of the Education Code and the ADE Rules to allow Friendship the flexibility to utilize an Executive Director and a School Principal in fulfilling both superintendent and principal roles in concert with its companion waiver requests concerning teacher and administrator licensure. This would allow Friendship to promote the most efficient use of human and financial resources in the school. Friendship seeks exemption from these Education Code provisions and ADE Rules in order to have the flexibility to attract and retain an individual who is highly skilled and suitable to oversee a Friendship school. The individual selected will receive extensive tra ining and professional development in order to successfully carry out the requirements of the position. Legal Comments: No waiver is required from ARK. CODE ANN. 6-13-609, as it has been repealed. Applicant Response: Please remove the request for the waiver of ARK. CODE ANN. 6 -13-609, as it has been repealed. Remaining Issues: None 7. Library Media Services ARK. CODE ANN. \u00a7 6-25-101 et seq . Public School Library Media and Technology Act Standards for Accreditation 16.02 Media Services We request a waiver from this rule because while we will purchase classroom libraries but will be unable to support a media center in the school's opening years. Start -up expenses combines with the conservative budgeting that makes that start -up period much more like ly to go smoothly, prevent us from investing in the media center and library professionals in the school's first few years. We would like the principal and Board, along with Friendship to have the autonomy to make all staffing decisions in a way that best supports our arts -infused program. Legal Comments: Rationale should be provided to explain how this waiver will help the Applicant meet its goals. The Applicant should explain the make -up of \"classroom libraries\" and should provide examples of how these libraries are intended to be used in its \"arts -infused program.\" Page 6 Applicant Response: Friendship maintains classroom libraries that are geared towards the content being taught in the classroom. It is vital for the success of the scholars that teachers and principals are allowed to select the appropriate books for the classrooms. Remaining Issues: The Applicant should be prepared to provide a more detailed explanation of the classroom libraries and its arts -infused program before the Authorizer. 8. ALE ARK.

The guidance program, our devotion to parallel cultures and respect and achievement, and our arts infusion all help us connect with students who are struggling and make them successful. We will seek to meet individual needs with individual plans as nee ded. At times, this may include steps such as providing students with an aide, making space available for small groups, or offering extra help If a student's needs are such that his or her special education team recommends an out -of- district placement, we will follow all laws to ensure that the student's right are always protected. Legal Comments: Rationale rel ated to ALEs should be provided . The Applicant should provide examples of how its \"arts infusion\" helps connect with students who are struggling and make them successful. The guidance program will not be operational until, at the earliest, mid -year in the first year of the school's opera tion. Applicant Response: Applicant uses multiple interventions including advisory, Read 180, and COMPASS Math. Each student has an individualized learning plan, which incorporates math, science, socials starts, reading and Art. Each student is assigned an advisor who is responsible for monitoring their individual plans Additionally Read 180 and Compass have their own coach. A school based counselor wil be more focused on to an thru college preparation and not student interventio ns. Remaining Issues: This answer is confusing. The role of the guidance program is still unclear, and there is no explanation of why the guidance position is set to be a mid -year hire, nor how the Applicant intends to find qualified applicants for a pos ition at the mid -year point when most Page 7 qualified would -be applicants are already employed at schools. The identity of the \"advisors\" mentioned in the Applicant Response above as being assigned to each student is left unclear. Desegregation Analysis: Fully Responsive ADE LEGAL DESEGREGATION ANALYSIS 1 ARKANSAS DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION ==================================================================== MEMORANDUM ==================================================================== To: ADE Charter Authorizing Panel From: ADE Staff Re: Desegregation Analysis of Open -Enrollment Public Charter School Application for Friendship Aspire Academy Date: September 30, 2015 I. INTRODUCTION Friendship Education Foundation submitted an application for an open -enrollment public charter school, Friendship Aspire Academy . The proposed charter school would be located within the boundaries of the Little Rock School District . The proposed charter school wo uld provide instruction to students in grades kindergarten through eighth (K -8). The proposed charter school would possess a student enrollment cap of 450. According to its a pplication, the proposed charter school expects to draw students from the Little Rock, North Little Rock, Pulaski Co unty Special, Benton, and Bryant school districts. II. STATUTORY REQUIREMENTS Ark. Code Ann. \u00a7 6 -23-106(a) requires the applicants for a charter school, the board of directors of the school district in which a proposed charter school would be located , and the charter authorizer to \"carefully review the potential impact of an application for a charter school on the efforts of a public school district or public school districts to comply with court orders and statutory obligations to create and maintain a unitary system of desegregated public schools. \" Ark. Code Ann. \u00a7 6 -23-106(b) requires the charter authorizer to \"attempt to measure the likely impact of a proposed public charter school on the efforts of public school districts to achieve and maintain a unitary system.\" Ark. Code Ann. \u00a7 6 -23-106(c) states that the authorizer \"shall not approve any public charter school under this chapter or any other act or any combination of acts that hampers, delays, or in any manner negatively affects the desegregation efforts of a public school district or public school districts in this state. \" This analysis is provided to inform the decision-making of the charter authorizer with regard to the effect, if any, of the proposed public charter school upon the desegregation efforts of a public school district. 2 III. INFORMATION SUBMITTED BY THE APPLICANT AND THE AFFECTED SCHOO L DISTRICTS The applicant addresses Desegregation Assurances on p age 38 of its application (attached) . To date, none of the affected school districts have submitted a desegregation analysis . IV. ANALYSIS FROM THE DEPARTMENT The October 1, 2014 , enrollment for the school districts listed by the applicant as affected by its proposed school , and for open -enrollment charter schools operating in the same county , is: 2 or More Races Asian Black/ African American Hispanic Native Am.

The ADE is aware of desegregation orders affecting LRSD, PCSSD, and the North Little Rock School District (NLRSD). Little Rock School District, et al. v. Pulaski County Special School District, et al., Case No. 4:82 -cv-00866-DPM (E.D. Ark.). The goal of a desegregation case with regard to assignment of students to schools is to \"achieve a system of determining admission to the public schools on a non -racial basis.\" Pasadena City Board of Education v. S pangler, 427 U.S. 424, 435 (1976) ( quoting Brown v. Board of Education, 349 U.S. 294, 300 -301 (1955)). The ADE is unaware of any desegregation orders applicable to the Benton or Bryant School Districts. The ADE is aware of the existence of a desegregati on order applicable to the Pulaski County Special, Little Rock, and North Little Rock school districts . In 2002, the Little Rock School District was declared unitary with respect to the majority of its desegregation plan obligations and released from cou rt supervision in those areas. Little Rock School District v. Pulaski County Special School District, 237 F. Supp. 2d 988, 999 (E.D. Ark. 2002). In 2007, LRSD successfully completed its desegregation efforts and was declared fully unitary by the federal court. Little Rock School District v. Pulaski County Special School District, Case No. 4:82 -cv-0866 (E.D. Ark.), Order filed February 23, 2007. This order was affirmed by the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals on April 2, 2009. Little Rock School District v. Pulaski County Special School District, 561 F.3d 746 (8th Cir. 2009). In February and March 2010, the federal court held hearings on the motions of NLRSD and PCSSD to be declared unitary. On May 19, 2011, the federal court held that neither district wa s fully unitary. Little Rock School District v. Pulaski County Special School District, Case No. 4:82 -cv-0866 (E.D. Ark.), Order filed May 19, 2011. However, on December 28, 2011, the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that NLRSD is fully unitary but th at PCSSD is not. Little Rock School District v. State of Arkansas, 664 F.3d 738 (8th Cir. 2011). On January 13, 2014, the presiding federal judge in the Pulaski County Desegregation Case gave final approval to a settlement agreement between the Joshua I ntervenors, Knight Intervenors, Little Rock School District, North Little Rock School District, PCSSD and the State of Arkansas. Pursuant to the settlement agreement, the only remaining obligation of the State of Arkansas is to continue the distribution o f desegregation payments to the three Pulaski County school districts through the 2017 -2018 school year. On January 30, 2014, the 4 Court also approved a stipulation among the parties that PCSSD is unitary in the areas of Assignment of Students and Advanced Placement, Gifted and Talented and Honors Programs. Based on the stipulation, the Court released PCSSD from supervision and monitoring in these areas. Thus, as of January 30, 2014, all three school districts in Pulaski County are unitary in the area of s tudent assignments. On April 4, 2014, the court found that PCSSD is unitary in the areas of special education and scholarships. PCSSD remains non - unitary in the following five areas areas of its desegregation plan: (1) Discipline; (2) School Facilities; (3) Staff; (4) Student Achievement; and (5 ) Monitoring. Because Friendship Aspire Academy would draw students from Pulaski County, Arkansas, the authorizer must e nsure that any act it approves does not hamper, delay, or in any manner negatively affect t he desegregation efforts of PCSSD. As the Supreme Court noted in Missouri v. Jenkins , 515 U.S. 70, 115 (1995): [I]n order to find unconstitutional segregation, we require that plaintiffs \"prove all of the essential elements of de jure segregation -- that is, stated simply, a current condition of segregation resulting from intentional state action directed specifically to the [allegedly segregated] schools.\" Keyes v. School Dist. No. 1, 413 U.S. 189, 205-206 (1973) (emphasis added). \"[T]he differentiating factor between de jure segregation and so -called de facto segregation . . . is purpose or intent to segregate.\" Id., at 208 (emphasis in original). As noted above, PCSSD remains under federal court supervision with regard to five areas of the district's desegregation plan. Therefore, the authorizer should consider whether granting an open -enrollment charter for Friendship Aspire Academy will negatively affect PCSSD's efforts to achieve full unitary status. V. CONCLUSION As stated above, Arkansas law does not allow the authorizer to approve any public charter school that \"hampers, delays, or in any manner negatively affects the desegregation efforts\" of a public school district. Ark. Code Ann. \u00a7 6 -23-106(c). It is difficult to con clude, from data currently available, that the proposed charter school is motivated by an impermissible intent to segregate schools, or that approval would hamper, delay or negatively affect any applicable desegregation efforts of any affected school distr ict. However, the authorizer should carefully examine the proposed charter school application in an attempt to determine whether there are legitimate, non -racially motivated reasons for the charter school's existence.

Describe the potential impact of the proposed public charter school on the efforts of affected public school district(s) to comply with court orders and statutory obligations to create and maintain a unitary system of desegregated public schools. Applicant Response: Friendship Aspire will locate its open-enrollment charter school in Little Rock, Arkansas within the boundaries of the Little Rock School District. Friendship Aspire expects to obtain most of its students from within the boundaries of the Little Rock School District with the remaining students coming from North Little Rock and Pulaski County. Friendship Aspire is required by Ark, Code Ann. Section 6-23-106 to carefully review the potential impacts its opening would have upon the efforts of the school district to comply with court orders and statutory obligations to create and maintain a unitary system of desegregated public schools. In conducting its review, Friendship Aspire has substantiated that the Little Rock School District (LRSD) and North Little Rock School District (NLRSD) have been found by the Federal District to be unitary in all respects to their school operations. The Pulaski County Special School District (PCSSD) has been determined by the Federal District Court to be unitary in all respects concerning inter-district student assignment. The importance of the attainment of unitary status of the LRSD and NLRSD and the status of PCCSD as unitary in the area of inter-district student assignment is that those school districts have no further obligations to comply with court orders in these areas. Therefore, the granting of an open-enrollment public charter for Friendship Aspire cannot be said to have a negative impact on the LRSD, NLRSD, and PCCSD's ability to comply with the districts court orders or statutory obligations to create and maintain a unitary system of desegregated public schools. Friendship Aspire is requesting an enrollment cap f 450 students. According to the 2014-2015 school year enrollment figures (the latest school year for which official enrollment figures are available) as maintained by the ADE Data Center, the PCSSD had a student population of 16,592 students, the NLRSD had a student population of 8,576 students; and the LRSD had a student population of 23,363 students. Ark Code Ann. Section 6-23-106 requires that Friendship Aspire must be race-neutral and non-discriminatory in its student selection and admission processes, so it is not possible to accurately project racial composition. Ark. Code Ann. Section 6-23-106 also requires that Friendship Aspire's operation not serve to hamper, delay or in any manner negatively affect the desegregation efforts of a public school district or districts within the state. Friendship Aspires careful review of the relevant statutes and court orders affecting the 3 Pulaski County School districts and the student populations of such shows that such negative effect is not present here. In January 2014 Federal District Judge D. P. Marshall Jr. accepted a Settlement Agreement which effectively concluded the desegregation case (Little Rock School District et al. v. North Little Rock School District et al., Lorene Joshua et al., Arkansas Virtual Academy, et al. Case NO. 4:82-CV-866-DPM, U.S. District Court Eastern Division of Arkansas Western Division) involving the three (3) Pulaski County School Districts. One of the provisions of the Settlement Agreement was the voluntary dismissal with prejudice of its appeal to the Eighth District Court of Appeals concerning charter school issues. In conclusion, Friendship Aspire submits that upon the basis of its review, neither any existing federal District Court desegregation order affecting the NLRSD, LRSD, or PCSSD, nor the Settlement Agreement prohibit the State's charter school authorizer from granting a new charter for an open-enrollment public charter school in LRSD/ Pulaski County.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Provide the mission statement of the proposed school. Briefly describe the key programmatic features that the school will implement in order to accomplish the mission. The mission of Friendship Aspire is to provide a world-class education that motivates students to achieve high academic standards, enjoy learning and develop as ethical, literate, well-rounded and self-sufficient citizens. Friendship Aspire seeks to fulfill this mission by providing students a high quality, liberal arts education focused on preparing students with the academic and life skills needed to be successful in college and beyond. Friendship Arkansas will the charter holder for the school operating under the name Friendship Aspire. Through a management agreement with the Friendship Education Foundation, Friendship Arkansas will replicate the program of the Washington, DC-based Friendship Public Charter School - a program that has spawned three high performing elementary/middle schools, been recognized by the DC State Education Officer for preparing students to graduate high school on time (greater than 90% cohort rate) and enroll in college (100% college acceptance rate for graduates), and helped to turnaround two of the lowest performing elementary/middle schools in Baltimore. The Friendship program was designed to instill an appreciation for education, high aspirations and personal standards that prepare students to become responsible contributors to their communities and world. We seek to serve children from kindergarten to eighth grade in elementary and middle school classes. At capacity we will enroll approximately 450 students. The student population targeted will be predominantly low income, minority children with a moderate to high incidence of special needs. Independent studies show that at- risk children are a population that most benefits from Friendship's model of instruction, intervention and co- curricular programs. Friendship's model draws on three tenets of Friendship's culture of achievement: strong leadership, a consistent message of achievement from all of the school's stakeholders, and an organizational structure conducive to fostering achievement. Friendship does not bring a simple program or philosophy to its mission; rather, it delivers a comprehensive educational package that uses research based, Common Core-aligned curricular resource materials to lead students to meet and surpass rigorous standards as measured by their post- assessments. The curriculum framework of Friendship has three primary components: 1) a solid foundation of core academic subjects, 2) exposure-to-the-world to prepare students for both extended learning and global citizenship, and 3) college level coursework connected to career study (in the high school grades). To instill students with a strong fundamental education, research-based, core curriculum materials are used in conjunction with deep training for teachers in a standards-based curriculum implementation process. Friendship's \"backwards design\" model trains teachers to plan with the end in mind. Friendship's theory of change starts with the creation of a positive learning environment and does not sacrifice the need for long-term transformation in order to realize short-term gains. Friendship's commitment puts an emphasis on having the infrastructure in place so that a performance and results-oriented culture flourishes and school leadership acts in ways that are fully supportive of, and responsive to, academic and instructional needs. Applicant Response:Applicant Response:Page 5 of 45C. NARRATIVE DESCRIPTION OF THE PROPOSED CHARTER SCHOOL The applicant for the proposed charter school, if approved by the authorizer, agrees to operate the educational program described below in accordance with the provisions described within this document, Arkansas Code Annotated \u00a76-23-101 et seq., the State Board of Education Rules Governing Public Charter Schools, and the attached assurances. Provide a narrative description of the various components of the proposed charter school by responding to the following prompts: 1. Describe the results of the public hearing, which was held for the purpose of assessing support for the establishment of this public charter school. Provide copies of supporting evidence. Applicant Response: A public hearing was held on July 24, 2015 at 6:00 P.M. at the Dee Brown Library located at 6235 Baseline Road in Little Rock. The meeting was presided over by Ms. Kimberly Williams, Executive Director of Friendship Education Foundation. It included a 45 minute presentation on the Friendship national model and success serving similar student populations in DC, Baltimore and Louisiana. The presentation focused on the Friendship School Model and included a question and answer session. No further information was requested and no one present spoke in opposition to the proposed school. The notice of public hearing was posted in the Arkansas Democrat Gazette on July 3, July 10 and July 17 in the news section. See Attachment B for ad copies reflecting publication dates. Emails were sent to superintendents of affected school districts notifying them of the hearing. Copies of these emails are included in Attachment B. Additional supporting documentation is also included in Attachment B. Attach documentation to demonstrate that each of the following requirements of Arkansas Code Annotated \u00a76-23-302 was met: A. B. C. D. The notice of the public hearing was published on a weekly basis for at least three (3) consecutive weeks prior to the date of the hearing in a newspaper having general circulation in the school district in which the school will likely be located. The notice of the public hearing was not published in the classified or legal notice section of the newspaper. The last publication date of the notice was no less than seven days prior to the public meeting. Within seven calendar days following the first publication of the notice of the public hearing, emails announcing the public hearing were sent to the superintendent of each of the school districts from which the open- enrollment public charter school is likely to draw students for the purpose of enrollment and the superintendent of any district that is contiguous to the district in which the open-enrollment public charter school will be located. Page 6 of 452. Describe the governing structure of the open-enrollment charter school, including board composition, selection process, and responsibilities. Also describe the role of the administrators, faculty, parents, students, and community members in the leadership and decision-making of the school. As part of your response, answer the following specific questions: A. Identify what individual, job position(s), or entity(s) will have final decision- making authority for the school in the areas of (1) finance and purchasing; (2) student discipline; (3) hiring and firing of staff; and (4) hiring and firing of the school director or superintendent. B. Specify how the final decision-maker(s) identified in response to (A)(3) will be selected or elected, including (1) length of term, (2) method of selection or election, and (3) who will have the authority to participate in the selection or election process. C. Explain how and to what extent the school's leadership will be accountable to parents. Applicant Response: Friendship Arkansas will be incorporated as an Arkansas nonprofit organization. The existing non-profit management organization, Friendship Education Foundation, has submitted its application for 501(c)3 status to the Internal Revenue Service. See Attachment A. Board Composition A Board of Directors will govern the school. Board members are being recruited. Friendship is seeking civic or educational local leaders who are involved in educational reform or have experience evaluating senior executives, and are, therefore, highly qualified to evaluate the school leader. The Friendship Arkansas board members will be representative of the community in which the school is located. They will have a diverse set of professional skills and practical work experience in the areas of education, public/ non-profit and/or for-profit administration or operations, community development, finance, and law. Parents who meet or supplement these criteria will be considered for board membership. Responsibilities of the Board of Directors Governance: The board is responsible for: Formulation and supervision of overall school policy Approval of and monitoring the school's annual budget Supporting the school's mission and purposes Monitoring, evaluating and holding management accountable for school performance Approval of the school leadership teams and assessment of their performance Ensuring effective organizational planning and sound board policy Ensuring adequate resources Management of resources effectively Enhancing public standing Ensuring legal and ethical integrity and maintaining accountability Recruitment and orientation of new board members and assessing board performance. Board Committees: Friendship plans to form the following committee structure: Discipline Committee to oversee the handling of matters relating to student discipline. The Discipline Committee may recommend Codes of Conduct for adoption by the Board of Trustees and may, by majority vote of the members of the Discipline Committee, approve on behalf of the Board of Trustees expulsions of students from Friendship Philadelphia. Page 7 of 45 Finance Committee to oversee the financial management of Friendship Aspire The Finance Committee shall recommend an annual budget for adoption by the Board of Trustees and may, by majority vote of the members of the Finance Committee, accept the annual audit of financial statements on behalf of the Board of Trustees. Personnel Committee, which may include persons who are not Trustees but shall not include any person who is also an employee of Friendship Aspire to make recommendations to the Board of Trustees with respect to the hiring, retention, eventual retirement, and compensation of school leaders. Oversight The board will have login access to Friendship's performance management dashboard system. The system provides real-time input on enrollment, attendance, discipline, interim assessment results, and summative assessment results. As a national leader in the development of performance management systems, Friendship has a highly developed performance management system that the board will find user-friendly. The Friendship Aspire school will use all of the performance management tools employed by Friendship elsewhere. The board will also receive a standard monthly financial reporting package that includes a statement of budget vs. actual results, a revised forecast for the balance of the year, a balance sheet and monthly cash flow projection. This financial package will be reviewed in detail by the board treasurer or finance committee prior to each monthly board meeting. Meetings of Board of Directors The board will meet monthly throughout the year, usually at the school. Date, time, and place of all board meetings will be included in the school calendar that parents receive. The calendar will also be on the school website. Meetings of the Board shall be open to the pubic to ensure members of the community are able to communicate their concerns to the Board. Any person may speak at an open meeting of the Board. To the fullest extent allowed by law, all such discussions shall take place in an open meeting. Friendship Education Foundation (FEF) Friendship opened two elementary schools in 1998 and now operates six public charter schools serving grades preK-12 in the lowest income wards of the District of Columbia, and two turnaround schools serving grades K-12 in partnership with the school district of Baltimore City. Its charter and turnaround schools consistently outperform traditional public schools serving similar populations. Friendship also plans to work with 4th Sector Solutions, a provider of back-office services including financial management and reporting, school operations, and human resources management services that has served charter schools since 2004. Friendship has references from its current operation sites: Michelle Rhee, Founder and CEO of StudentsFirst and former Chancellor of DC Public Schools. Kaya Henderson, current Chancellor of DC Public Schools. Andres Alonso, CEO of Baltimore City Public Schools. Friendship is considered one of the most effective educational providers by the Baltimore City Public Schools district leadership. Its schools serve disproportionately low-income and special education populations. All of its DC charter schools serving grades preK-8 significantly outperform the DC Public Schools serving the most disadvantaged students (Wards 5-8), by 12-15%. Four of Friendship's six schools are larger than any of the comparable DCPS schools in total enrollment. Friendship Collegiate Academy in DC, which enrolls 900 students, consistently achieves proficiency levels that are two to three times the levels of DCPS high schools serving similar populations. Friendship's performance implementing a turnaround at Anacostia High School - for which it was originally hired by then DCPS Superintendent Michelle Rhee - was remarkable. A Washington Examiner article on October 14, 2012 noted, \"Anacostia's high school graduation rate last year was 78 percent, up from only 56 percent only three years ago. Before our partnership began, no record was even kept of how many students were accepted to college -- a sign of where that aspiration fell in the scheme of priorities. Last year, half of our graduating students were accepted to college.\" Page 8 of 45 Unlike many other high-performing CMO networks, Friendship operates large schools (more than 500 students) effectively. Friendship's network includes the largest high school and four of the seven largest elementary schools out of over 80 charter and traditional public schools in Wards 5-8. Because of this scale, over the past 12 years, Friendship has improved the academic achievement of the largest number of high-needs students in DC. Role of Administration The Friendship Aspire leadership team has not yet been selected. Job descriptions are attached. When selected, the team will include the principal and two deans/assistant principals (one of which starts in year two, and the other at full enrollment). Deans are instructional leaders of the school and act in concert with the principal to ensure that instructional goals are met. They are responsible for driving the school's mission and guiding principles to ensure a positive achievement focus and school culture among teachers, staff and students. Deans are assigned a cohort of teachers for observation, evaluation, and development. They guide staff top achieve high performance through data analysis, goal setting, providing meaningful feedback, and constructive evaluations. Friendship also provides an instructional performance coach to support new and veteran teachers in becoming highly effective educators. Coaches support teachers to organize, set up, and manage a classroom by emphasizing the delivery of quality data-driven instruction using formative and interim assessments; leading data talks across grade levels or content; modeling excellent delivery of content; planning differentiated lessons; helping develop quality unit plans using the Understanding by Design (UBD) framework; observing and reviewing teachers' daily lesson unit plans; and providing feedback. Additionally, deans are responsible for implementing the school-wide positive behavior plan to ensure an effective discipline system with high standards that is consistent with the philosophy, values, and mission of the school and district, in accordance with due process and other laws and regulations. Deans advise Academic Advisors in creating a positive culture of behavior in the school and team with teachers, staff, social workers, the parent, curriculum, and professional development coordinators in the plan's development and implementation. Parental Involvement Parents will have a voice working with the board and principal through the school Parent Action Committee (PAC). The committee will help bring parents into the fold by fostering formal and informal opportunities to engage with school staff, other parents and other community members on school programming. The Parent Action Committee will provide opportunities for all parents to be an active part of the school's culture and model the core values. There will also be leadership opportunities within the PAC. In addition to PAC participation, parents sign a pledge committing to responsibilities as a member of our school community. Page 12 of 45If the performance of students at schools and or/districts not noted in the previous charts demonstrate the need for the charter, provide the student performance data and its source and explain. Applicant Response: The North Little Rock, Bryant and Pulaski County School Districts are adjacent to the home district of the proposed charter. According to the data provided by the Arkansas Department of Education all of these were in Needs Improvement Status on 2014. All 3 districts missed their AMOs in both math and literacy. None of the districts met their Growth AMOs in either Math or Literacy. All 3 districts are also dealing with significant achievement gaps. In North Little Rock, Caucasian students graduate at rates almost 20% higher than students of color. Proficient and Advanced rates for Caucasian students for Math and Literacy are greater than 25% higher than the Proficient and Advanced rates for students of color. Additional less than 30% of students with disabilities are proficient in Math or Literacy. Similarly in Pulaski County the district shows the same gaps to a smaller degree. Caucasian students score Proficient or Advanced at rates between 15% and 23% higher than African American students in both Math and Literacy. Students with disabilities are performing at less than 30% proficient as well. In Bryant County where the proficients level is a 83.7% Caucasian students still out perform students of color at a rate of 12% in Literacy. This gap is more distinguished in Math with a 20% gap between Caucasian and students of color scoring proficient and advanced, Describe three (3) innovations that will distinguish the charter from other schools. Applicant Response: Smaller Learning Communities (House/ Career Academies) The purpose of the house/career academy structure is to give each student a smaller community within which s/ he can grow and learn throughout his/her tenure in the academy. Smaller learning communities allow for differentiated instruction and the creation of individual learning plans so that each student will have a defined program of scholarship that allows him or her to excel. The organizational structure of Friendship schools is unique and conducive to delivering a message of achievement, in that it will create smaller clusters of students within the larger school community. These smaller learning communities group students that are in similar positions with respect to academic and personal development. Using this structure, the school leadership is able to target students effectively using the best practices, teaching, and disciplinary techniques that have been proven to be most effective for students of a given age group. The school may have many grade levels, students still feel like they are in a small community of like-minded students. Friendship's theory of change starts with the creation of a positive learning environment and does not sacrifice the need for long-term transformation in order to realize short-term gains. Friendship's school design puts an emphasis on having the infrastructure in place so that a performance and results-oriented culture flourishes and school leadership acts in ways that are fully supportive of, and responsive to, academic and instructional needs. Friendship anticipates effecting measurable change immediately, leading to a doubling of the number of students rated \"proficient\" in math and reading, a 50% increase in graduation rates (for high schools), and a 75% reduction in truancy within three to five years. Friendship welcomes the responsibility of playing a leadership role to raise the quality of education citywide. It maintains a ten-year vision of seeing high-performing organizations Page 13 of 45across the board, believing that a widespread culture of achievement has positive effects on the capabilities of every individual student, teacher, and leader in every individual school. Curriculum and Education Program The Understanding by Design framework ensures that teacher teams make informed decisions about the specific texts, performance tasks, and other resources that will be included within a unit in order to provide cultural relevancy. The curriculum resource materials are reviewed carefully by the Friendship Curriculum Committee to ensure cultural relevancy in content, and equity of access for second-language learners. Opportunities for targeted differentiation for English Language Learners (and the supporting resources) are embedded in the resource materials and teacher lesson plans. The curriculum framework of Friendship has three primary components: 1) a solid foundation of core academic subjects, 2) exposure-to-the-world to prepare students for both extended learning and global citizenship, and eventually 3) college level coursework connected to career study (for high school students). To instill students with a strong fundamental education, research-based, core curriculum materials are used in conjunction with deep training for teachers in a standards-based curriculum implementation process. Friendship's \"backwards design\" model trains teachers to plan with the end in mind. Through implementation of Understanding by Design, teachers use backwards design to plan units that address the six facets of understanding (explanation, interpretation, application, perspective, empathy, and self-knowledge). Understanding by Design facilitates the planning process by enabling teachers to clarify learning goals, assess student understanding, and craft engaging learning activities. Friendship Honors and Supports the Whole Child Integral to the Friendship model is support of the whole child. Teachers receive intensive training in using \"differentiated learning\" that is designing variations in lesson plans for children with different learning styles and diverse capabilities. Each campus has access to a school nurse and a mental health counselor in addition to the school guidance counselor. Each campus has regularly scheduled School and Student Staff Support Team (SSST) meetings to support individual students. Meeting typically in common teacher planning periods, SSST teams include: classroom teacher, school counselor, parent/guardian, school leader, mental health counselor and nurse. Support for individual students is reinforced by the Friendship Design mandate to share individual academic data with students. Teacher's work with students to choose how they would show they have mastered an academic standard based on their interests, creativity and their learning styles. Friendship Aspire will offer Saturday School for any child who needs extra help. The school will also offer Friendship Cares and other opportunities after school for students to challenge themselves in activities such as athletics, chess, band, and journalism. On the following table, list the specific measurable goals in reading, reading comprehension, and mathematics, based on the state mandated assessments, and any other assessment tools if used, for improving student academic achievement for each year of the public charter school's initial five-year period. For each goal, include the following: The tool to be used to measure the academic performance; The level of performance that will demonstrate success; and The timeframe for the achievement of the goal.5. Page 15 of 45elementary school. The educational need identified in the data presented above for local non-magnet schools shows a consistent achievement gap and steady decline in proficiency from elementary through middle and high school. By addressing academic deficits early in elementary school and exceeding district average academic performance with a more at-risk student population, Friendship Aspire will set its students on the path to high school success when they complete their K-8 experience. 6. For elementary charter schools, provide a daily schedule for all grade levels indicating the classes that will be provided for a one week time period. For secondary schools, provide required and elective courses for every grade level. If the school plans to phase in grade levels, include expansion grade levels by year with courses to be offered. Applicant Response: Please see schedule included in Attachment D. 7. Provide a description of curriculum, programs, and instructional methods used to support core classes. Include all associated costs in the proposed budget. Applicant Response: Educational Philosophy: The Culture Intensive is a concentrated and focused course of study in which the whole school and all students participate, including special needs students, those receiving special education services, English Language Learners (ELL), and any students at risk of academic failure. The focus of the Culture Intensive is to instill the culture of achievement across the school. During the first weeks of school, in addition to the curriculum, every class devotes a significant amount of time to lessons devoted to teaching the school Code of Conduct and practicing the expected behaviors for each area of the school. The lesson plans in the Intensive do not assume students know appropriate behavior and, therefore, explicitly teach what is Page 16 of 45expected. The goals of the Intensive are to be sure students can articulate and demonstrate the code and that they are motivated to follow it. The lessons created for teaching the code are not unlike those in any other curriculum area. Just telling students is not enough. Students will need quality and engaging instruction including discussion, guided practice, and feedback in order to learn the expected behaviors. They need to be actively involved in understanding, practicing, and internalizing the code. These lesson plans also use fun activities to increase student enthusiasm and use positive reinforcement and incentives to engage their cooperation. Instructional Techniques: Teachers are given state-of -the-art classroom technology tools and a multitude of resources to engage, motivate, and push students to high levels of academic achievement. Friendship provides extensive professional development and coaching to help teachers make the shift from a teacher-centered to a student-centered classroom. Teachers are trained to use the three-step \"Gradual Release Model\" as the foundation for differentiating instruction: I Do: The Gradual Release Model begins with a focus on teacher modeling. Students need plenty of opportunities to see an expert - the teacher - at work, interacting with texts and showcasing the thinking that undergirds doing a task well. We Do: Much of classroom instruction takes place in the central area of the Gradual Release Model - The Zone of Proximal Development. \"Teaching in the zone\" relies on scaffolding, support that is integrated into a lesson that guides student learning and prompts effective thinking. You Do: The rationale of the Gradual Release model is the constant attention to ceding increasing responsibility to the students for directing their own learning. Students need regular reminders that the focal point of instruction is to empower them to be able to accomplish important and sophisticated tasks without the support of the teacher and their classmates (Pearson and Gallagher). Pedagogy Used to Support the Friendship Mission: A key feature of the differentiated classroom is that it is student-centered. Shifting the emphasis from the \"teacher and instruction\" focus to the \"student and learning\" focus means redefining the role of the teacher (Tomlinson, Wiggins, and McTighe, 2004). Friendship's professional development program supports teachers in making the shift to managing classrooms that exemplify this set of behaviors. Differentiated classrooms observe the following characteristics: Teachers and students accept and respect one another's similarities and differences. Assessment is an ongoing diagnostic activity that guides instruction. Learning tasks are planned and adjusted based on assessment data. All students participate in respectful work -- work that is challenging, meaningful, interesting, and engaging. The teacher is primarily a coordinator of time, space, and activities, rather than a provider of information. The aim is to help students become self-reliant learners. Students and teachers collaborate in setting class and individual goals. Students work in a variety of group configurations, as well as independently. Flexible grouping is evident. Time is used flexibly in the sense that pacing is varied based on student needs. Students often have choices about topics they wish to study, ways they want to work, and how they want to demonstrate their learning. The teacher uses a variety of strategies to target instruction to student needs. Curriculum Map and Summary The curriculum of Friendship Arkansas has three primary components: 1) a solid foundation of core academic subjects, 2) a world exposure program to prepare students for both extended learning and participation in the global community, and 3) college level coursework connected to career study (for high school students). Instilling students with a strong core education is considered crucial so use of research-based core curriculum materials is partnered with deep training for teachers in a standards-based curriculum implementation process. Objectives, Content for Each Grade, and Rational for Curriculum Selection: Attached Rationale Teachers in schools supported by Friendship are trained to apply the current research on instruction to best meet the needs of the students in their classrooms. Teachers use the \"gradual release of responsibility\" model Page 17 of 45of instruction: I do, We do, You do. The cognitive load is passed from the teacher-as-model to the student for maximum learning (Fisher, Frey, 2008). The learning process starts in a structured manner, generally with a mini-lesson (I do), and becomes less structured as the responsibility transfers from the teacher to the student. The teacher facilitates the guided practice (We do) then releases the responsibility to the students through collaborative and independent work (You do). Teachers are expected to differentiate instruction at every phase based on the needs of their students. Friendship's training program reinforces the idea that proficient teachers use a variety of appropriate instructional strategies based on the standards, lessons, and needs of their students. Friendship supports teachers in making the cognitive shift to become diagnosticians who skillfully determine the appropriate instructional \"prescription\" to ensure that students meet the standards and gradually release responsibility to students for ownership of their learning. Intense professional development is provided to ensure that teachers are equipped with the knowledge and skills to ensure that this happens effectively in each and every classroom. Friendship trains teachers to review the available curriculum resources and develop high-quality learning experiences that ensure that each student will learn as efficiently and effectively as possible. Friendship provides teachers with research-based, common core-aligned program materials form Houghton Mifflin Harcourt so that teachers will have at hand a plethora of resources to support the learning of their individual students. Through differentiated instruction, teachers enable students to achieve outcomes in ways that work best for each learner (Tomlinson, Wiggins, and McTighe, 2004). Friendship-trained teachers are always focused on learning for students at every level. Teachers continually ask the following key questions: How do we know our students are learning? What do we do when students are not learning? What do we do when students have learned? Research The Understanding by Design framework is known to be rigorous, engaging, and effective for the anticipated student population. Some specific research-based components required for the selection of curricular resource materials include: Explicit Strategy Instruction - Students must know, access, and apply specific strategies when reading texts and solving mathematics problems. Research shows that reading comprehension instruction must support students, directly and explicitly, to use the strategies needed to comprehend a text (Cantrell, Almasi, Carter, Rintamaa & Madden, 2010; National Reading Panel, 2000; Hollingsworth and Woodward, 1993). In mathematics, in order to become proficient and fluent with problem-solving, students must efficiently track what they know and how well or poorly an attempt at problem-solving is proceeding (Reyes, Suydam, Lindquist, & Smith, 1998). Writing Across the Content Areas - Students must have the ability to think and write across subject areas to meet the 21st century demands and the college-readiness standards of Common Core. In order to teach these skills, teachers must focus on both process and product (Chapman, 2006), providing students opportunities across the curriculum to process new information and make sense of complex ideas through writing (Knipper & Duggan, 2006). Explicit Strategies for Differentiation and Intervention - It is critical that all students receive access to grade-level content and strategies, while receiving the necessary support and scaffolding through intensive skills-instruction to \"close the gap\" for struggling learners (Au, 2002; Allington & Walmsley, 1995). 8. Describe the process that will be used to ensure all curriculum materials used in the educational program are aligned with the Arkansas Curriculum Frameworks and the state standards as adopted, and periodically revised, by the State Board of Education. Applicant Response: The Friendship Aspire curriculum is aligned with national standards. The curriculum will be aligned to the Arkansas Common Core Standards and Arkansas Curriculum Frameworks. Our national team will work to align Page 18 of 45with the standards as required by the state similar to what has been done in DC, Baltimore and Louisiana. The Common Core alignment process links grade level mastery objectives to state standards so that as students master specific course objectives, they are mastering state standards. The steps in the alignment process are as follows: Common Core and Arkansas Frameworks crosswalks are reviewed and studied to understand the shifts. These crosswalks are used as part of the pre-opening professional development where teachers `unpack' the standards to gain a complete picture of the learning expectations for their students. Teachers then work in teams using Curriculum guides to complete their grade level crosswalks as a means of learning what they will teach. Specific training on the instructional program is then provided. Demonstration lessons taught by members of the staff and the Leadership Team help put it all together. Ongoing professional development and coaching by leadership is used to support teachers in the implementation of the education program. 9. Describe the manner in which the school will make provisions for the following student services, even in each area for which a waiver is requested: A) Guidance program; Applicant Response: Friendship Aspire will have a guidance counselor (mid-year hire in year one) and access to two community resource specialists/psychologists. They will be devoted to students with mental health and social/emotional challenges and oversee Student Support Services and parent relations. They are supported by classroom teachers and school administrators who will provide input regarding the needs and progress of students needing mental, emotional, and social support. Initial information from enrollment and attendance prompts guidance counselors and mental health providers to talk to the students individually about personal and family needs. Confidential student records are maintained by school counselors and psychologists. Case management includes outreach to parents and extended family members and linkages to community resources and service providers. B) Health services; Applicant Response: The school will comply with all state laws regarding staffing in this area. A nurse will manage all distribution of medication, train staff as needed to keep students safe (food allergies, etc.), manage student medical information in full compliance with all relevant privacy statutes, and advise the principal in the creation of necessary medical policies. The school nurse will work daily and will coordinates delivery of health services and will contribute to the professional development of school personnel as colleagues. The school's health service program shall insure administrative and office staff members will be trained in emergency procedures, first aid, CPR and administration of medicine. The nurse may also teach some health education. He or she will coordinate with local agencies, hospitals, physicians, and organizations that have as their missions to improve children's or community health in order to make sure that all students have access to the care that they need. Page 19 of 45C) Media center; Applicant Response: The school will not have a media center when it opens, and we have applied for a waiver from the staffing requirement. Instead, the school will open a computer lab so that students have access to the Internet for basic research. Additionally the school will use Scholastic Read 180 as a reading intervention software and provide classroom libraries in all classes. D) Special education; Applicant Response: The special education programs at Friendship are well-aligned with the Least Restrictive Environment (LRE) requirements under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Improvement Act (IDEA: Section 300.114- 300.117 and 300.320). Specifically, during the 2016-2017 school year, each campus will provide a continuum of services (inclusion and resource), which is the cornerstone of IDEA. Friendship offers a program that includes both instructional support and related services that are determined by the team to ensure that students meet academic and social goals. For instance, visually impaired students receive Orientation & Mobility (O&M) services and students with autism receive Applied Behavioral Analysis (ABA) support. Finally, specialized self- contained programs are available within the LEA to students who have disabilities that require a more restrictive setting. Except in rare instances when it is not in the best interest of the student, s/he is given opportunities to be successful with appropriate supports starting with an inclusion setting and moving only to a more restrictive educational setting when data and input from the Special Education team members require it. The final decision about a student's ability to make progress within the school-based setting is the responsibility of the team. There are multiple methods for making a determination about the student's location and placement of services. The IEP can be enhanced to include additional supports or supplemental services, or the IEP team can request support from the Academic Affairs Office to conduct a panel review of the student's file and provide additional programming ideas. In the event that the team does not feel that the student's current setting is adequately meeting his or her needs, the student, either by parent or school request, can appeal to the board to have the student placed into a more restrictive, out-of-general education setting. The final decision about the student's next continuum of placement is made by the IEP team in conjunction with members of the Office of Academic Affairs SPED Leadership Team. E) Transportation; Applicant Response: Friendship will provide transportation for students as required. Inspired by models of successful community- based schools nationwide, Friendship will encourage students and families to carpool as much as possible through such means as an online carpool \"board\" for students and families to connect. Friendship will initiate discussions with the appropriate officials to negotiate transportation options, including transportation for students with special needs. Friendship may also contract with a third-party vendor, such as First Student, to manage daily transportation for all students. F) Alternative education, including Alternative Learning Environments; Applicant Response: It is the intention and commitment of the founders of Friendship Aspire to educate all students who choose our school. We will make necessary accommodations for students who need support beyond that provided by the general curriculum accommodation program. The guidance program, our devotion to parallel cultures of respect Page 20 of 45and achievement, and our arts infusion all help us connect with students who are struggling and make them successful. We will seek to meet individual needs with individual plans as needed. At times, this may include steps such as providing students with an aide, making space available for small groups, or offering extra help. If a student's needs are such that his or her special education team recommends an out-of-district placement, we will follow all laws to ensure that the student's rights are always protected. A waiver is being requested. G) English Language Learner (ELL) instruction Applicant Response: Friendship is accustomed to accommodating students with multiple levels of ability and multiple learning styles in one classroom. The curriculum supports teachers in internalizing and gaining ownership over its content by guiding their thinking as they make instructional decisions about how best to lead the full range of students in their classrooms to achieve the rigor of the standards as measured by their post-assessments. To support the development of their units and daily lesson plans, Friendship adopts curricular resource materials that are aligned to Common Core State Standards. H) Gifted and Talented Program. Applicant Response: The environment that meets the needs of high needs students also provides appropriate learning opportunities for gifted students. The curriculum and culture of Friendship promote student success and reward teachers for results. Friendship believes that academic success starts with adults who commit to changing the school and its uses a performance-based compensation system. Tracking the behavior and outcome metrics of teachers and administrators is an integral part of Friendship's performance management system which uses a data tracking system as a platform for administrator and teacher accountability. Per extensive research conducted by Perna in 2002, programs targeting low income students for academic success must contain the following critical components to be successful: creation of a culture with college completion expected of all, rigorous academic experiences, parental involvement in the education and college preparation process, early facilitation of course selection and career planning, and, eventually, college visits. the Gifted and Talented Program at Friendship contains all five elements. 10. Describe the geographical area to be served by the charter. List all school districts within the geographical area likely to be affected by the open-enrollment public charter school. Applicant Response: Friendship Aspire Academy will be an open-enrollment public charter school; therefore, we could draw students from anywhere in the state. The school will be located within the city limits of Little Rock, and will be located within the boundaries of the Little Rock School District. It is anticipated that Friendship Aspire Academy will receive most of its students from the Little Rock, North Little Rock and Pulaski County Special School Districts; some students may also be received from the Benton and Bryant School Districts. The maximum enrollment in the first five (5) years of the charter will be 450 students. According to the 2014-2015 enrollment information housed on the Department of Education Data Center's website, there were 23,363 students enrolled in the Little Rock School District; 8,576 students enrolled in the North Little Rock School District; 16,592 students enrolled in the Pulaski County Special School District; 5,000 students enrolled in the Benton School District, and 9,017 students enrolled in the Bryant School District. At its five (5) year maximum enrollment, it is estimated that up to 300 students would come to Friendship Aspire Academy from the Little Rock School District; up to 75 students from the Pulaski County Special School District; up to 55 students from the North Little Rock School District, and up to 20 students from the Benton and Bryant School Districts combined. Page 21 of 45 It is possible that Friendship Aspire will enroll students who currently attend private schools or who are home schooled students, thus further reducing the impact to the named school districts. 11. Describe the plan for the school officials to provide an annual report to parents, the community, and the authorizer that demonstrates the progress made by the charter school during any previous academic year in meeting its academic performance objectives. ( See ADE Rules Governing Standards for Accreditation of Arkansas Public Schools and School Districts.) Applicant Response: Friendship will report annual school-wide progress on high stakes, state-mandated assessments to the school community each year. This report will be made available to parents during open houses and back-to-school nights, on the school website, and also to any parent or community member requesting the information. Promotion and graduation criteria will be communicated regularly to parents and students. At the beginning of the school year, they will receive information regarding promotion and graduation requirements during orientation and open house sessions. In addition, parents will learn about student progress toward promotion throughout the school year by way of report cards and parent-teacher conferences. Shorter reports on the school's progress will reach parents and the community through school newsletters, which will include general progress reports as well as the NCLB-mandated school report card. Moreover, the school will post its performance in common areas of the school, including the main office and front hallways for parents and community members to see. The school will publish an Annual Report in compliance with ADE Rules reflecting academic progress for the previous year and progress towards meeting network goals. 12. Describe the enrollment criteria and recruitment processes, that will provide an equal opportunity for all parents and students to learn about and apply for admission to the proposed public charter school. Applicant Response: Friendship Aspire will enroll students based on preference and lottery status. The lottery will be held on or about April 1, each year. In accordance with federal laws, no student will be denied admission based on race, ethnicity, national origin, gender, disability, aptitude, or athletic ability. The school shall be open to any child who is eligible under the laws of the state of Arkansas. New students will be admitted each year without regard to prior measures of achievement or aptitude, athletic ability, disability, ethnicity, race, creed, gender. national origin, religion or ancestry. Enrollment Process The School will accept applications for enrollment up until the deadline, approximately April 1. All applicants will be included in the lottery. The following preferences will be honored in the enrollment process: a. Siblings of current students - Students who share a common parent, either biologically or legally through Page 23 of 45Describe procedures for conducting the an annual single lottery enrollment process, including the timeline for enrolling, the date of the lottery, and the way in which students will be placed on waiting lists, and the process for notifying parents about each child's selection or order on the waiting list. Explain how the charter will ensure that the lottery process is transparent to the public. Applicant Response: If a school receives more enrollment forms than available seats, the school will conduct a randomized lottery, as required by law, in early April. This lottery must be observed or conducted by an outside third party. Students who meet the previously stated preference criteria are exempted from this lottery. These exempted students are then taken out of the lottery and are then enrolled in their grade, thus lowering the target lottery enrollment number for that grade. All other students who have applied to enroll in the grade for which there is to be a lottery are assigned a lottery number. Lottery numbers will be randomly pulled and assigned seats. Student names are then matched back to their lottery numbers. This process is repeated for all applicable grades. All students whose lottery number fall within the target number are enrolled. All other students are placed, in order, onto a waitlist. In the event that applications exceed open seats and a lottery process is necessary to determine enrollment, all names will be drawn in order to create a priority-ranked waiting list to be used for future enrollment in the same school year. If and when there are openings at Friendship Aspire, students will be pulled first from the waiting list based on priority order until all seats are filled. Following the lottery, letters will be mailed to all the families in the lottery confirming they received a seat and to enroll or to notify of their waitlist status. Students on the waitlist are contacted as a seat in their grade becomes available. Enrollment is by blind lottery with no pre-screening and no post-lottery interviews. All students are welcome to apply to the school. Friendship Aspire maintains a sibling policy for siblings of currently enrolled students. Siblings are eligible for preferential status, which permits the student to pre-empt other students from the general lottery based on available seats. All families will attend a school orientation prior to the beginning of the school year. Because we have a non-exclusive, open enrollment lottery, and blind admissions policy, with no pre-screening interview process, the majority of our students will be a direct reflection of the socio and economic demographics of the neighborhood. Friendship Aspire shall admit students of any race, color, national origin, and ethnic origin and every student shall enjoy all rights, privileges, programs, and activities generally accorded or made available to students at the school. It shall not discriminate on the basis of race, color, national origin, gender, disability and ethnic origin in administration of its educational policies, admission policies, and all other school-administered programs. We will employ various methods to publicly announce the application/enrollment period and will communicate our desire to serve both English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The application form along with all dates and deadlines for the submission of new applicants for available grades will be posted on our school website. Hard copies of the application will be available at the school or by mail upon request. Community-outreach is an important element of our marketing and mission. We will distribute informational materials to the Head Start locations and day cares throughout Little Rock and surrounding areas, local businesses including libraries, community centers, and faith-based organizations. During the entire year, including the application and enrollment period, our offices will be open from 7 a.m. to 5 p.m. where we accept both phone calls and in-person inquiries from interested parents. Once a student has been accepted to the school, a registration packet is given to the parents for completion. The packet consist of a student directory form (which collects emergency contact information in addition to demographic information), health assessment form, release of records from previous school, transportation request/information, media release, birth certificate, social security card, immunization records, parent/guardian identification, Free and Reduced lunch application, and any other required documentation by the State of Arkansas. Families have several weeks to accept their admission to the school. Any unfilled spots will be given to students on the waitlist. Page 24 of 45If it is believed that the use of a weighted lottery is required by federal court or administrative order, explain and furnish a copy of the order. Applicant Response: A weighted lottery is not necessary. Applicant Response:13. Name any founders or board members of the proposed charter's sponsoring entity, management company staff, and/or leaders of the proposed charter who have any prior involvement in the operation of one or more other charter schools and complete a Prior Charter Involvement template for each individual listed. The Prior Charter Involvement template includes Donald Hense, Patricia Brantley, and Kimberly Williams of Friendship Education Foundation. Page 28 of 45assumptions consistent with past practice. After the budget is adopted, the finance team will meet monthly with the school leader to review actual accounting data, any revenue and expense changes that have occurred, and update its forecast model for the balance of the year. In the event the forecast is worse than the budget, the finance team will work with the principal to identify expense reductions (e.g., non-personnel expense reductions that are least critical to academic performance, non-replacement of any open positions, staff reductions, and use of contingency) that would re-balance the forecast. As part of this process, school educational priorities are always taken into account to minimize any negative educational effects from a budget shortfall. In the event that the forecast is better than budget, the finance team will work with the school leader to determine if the additional resources should be re-deployed on current year priorities or saved for future year. 4th Sector's finance team has extensive experience supporting school leaders in this process, having conducted hundreds of such monthly budget reviews over 15+ years. The board will then receive a standard monthly financial reporting package that will include a financial dashboard (that included income statement, balance sheet, enrollment and staffing indicators), a contextual narrative summary of the school's finances, a year to date budget vs. actual comparison, a revised forecast for the balance of the year, a balance sheet and monthly cash flow projection. This financial package will be reviewed in detail by the board treasurer or finance committee prior to each monthly board meeting. Any proposed actions to re-balance the operating budget will be reviewed and discussed with the board finance committee. Complete the budget template showing a balanced budget with realistic expectations of revenue and expenditures. Provide the minimum number of students who must attend the charter in order for the school to be financially viable. Describe the method used to calculate this number. Tell who made the calculations and describe the financial expertise of the individuals who assisted in this assessment. Describe the contingency plan if fewer students than necessary for financial viability enroll before the first day of school. Provide a detailed explanation of the ways in which the charter leaders will provide the education program outlined in the application to fewer students that determined necessary for financial viability or a date certain by which charter leaders will notify the parents, leaders of surrounding districts and open-enrollment charters, and staff at the Arkansas Department of Education that the school will not open as anticipated. Explain how charter leaders will provide the education program outlined in the application if enough students for financial viability enroll and are admitted but fail to arrive when school begins. Describe preparations to pay for any unexpected, but necessary and possibly urgent expenses. Applicant Response: The budget template is included as Attachment E. In the experience of Friendship Education Foundation - whose team has managed charter schools in several states over 15+ years -- a minimum of 100 students is necessary to operate a financially viable school. This level of enrollment enables the school to have a full-time administrator who is not also a teacher, pay for the facility expenses, and have a base of enrollment from which to expand additional grades in the future. Friendship has a detailed, 300+ line start-up plan that will be implemented commencing in January 2016. Its Page 29 of 45components include teacher recruiting and professional development, curriculum and FF&E purchasing, human resources policies and employee benefits, financial systems and insurance, and most importantly, student recruiting. Friendship Arkansas's student recruiting efforts will be tracked daily, and during weekly calls the start-up team will update its projection for opening day enrollment so that the appropriate number of teaching positions will be filled. Friendship Arkansas would seek to confirm its decision to open, based on projected enrollment, prior to the end of the previous school year. In the event of a budget shortfall attributable to lower than expected student enrollment, Friendship Arkansas would seek to reduce non-mission critical non-personnel expenses, and adjust its staffing level to match the actual enrollment experienced. The Friendship Education Foundation would also consider deferring its management fee until a time when enrollment had stabilized, or even advancing a working capital loan to Friendship Arkansas to maintain academic program integrity. This flexibility also would enable Friendship Arkansas to handle any unexpected or urgent expenses. 16. Describe the manner in which an annual audit of the financial and programmatic operations of the school will be conducted. If the school wishes to request that the authorizer allow a licensed accountant or licensed certified public accountant, rather than the Legislative Auditor, to perform the first-year audit, identify the accountant by name, firm, address, and phone number. The named accountant must meet the requirements of ADE Rules Governing Publicly Funded Educational Institution Audit Requirements, including the prohibition on auditors providing non-audit services (such as accounting or consulting services) to auditees. A school's preference as stated in this application may not be changed without prior approval of the authorizer. Applicant Response: Friendship Arkansas will use the Arkansas Public School Computer Network. In addition, the 4th Sector finance team has extensive experience complying with generally accepted accounting principles and providing financial information to authorizers and other government authorities in the proper format. Friendship Arkansas plans to have the Legislative Auditor perform is first-year audit, and thereafter retain a third party audit firm experienced in independent charter school audits to review the school's financial information and adherence to the school's financial policies, and express an opinion on the financial statements. The independent audit report shall also include a report to management detailing any issues and corrective action needed. The board of directors will exercise its oversight responsibilities by reviewing the periodic financial reports, requesting additional information as needed to understand the school's financial position fully and question any procedures or items on the financial statements. The board will select a treasurer with knowledge of finance or accounting, and that person will lead the Board's finance committee. The treasurer and finance committee will ensure that the board monitors the school's finances. The school will perform a series of reconciliations, including monthly bank account reconciliations, throughout the year to ensure that employees are being paid their agreed upon amounts, that amounts paid are consistent with forecasted expenditures, that all payments to vendors are fully recorded in the school's accounting system and that all cash receipts are both recorded and consistent with amounts owed to it by state, federal, and local sources. The school will keep track of expenditures that meet its capitalization thresholds, and will perform periodic inventories to ensure that the school has proper control over these physical assets. The finance team will also conduct a mid-year internal audit to ensure accurate accounting and adherence to the school's adopted fiscal policies. The board will utilize the following fiscal controls and financial management policies to remain informed and oversee the school's financial position: Page 31 of 4518. Describe the facilities to be used. Give the present use of the facility. If the facility to be used for the school is a facility of a school district, describe the terms established by the local school board of the district stipulating the relationship between the proposed public charter school and the district pertaining to the use of the facility. Attach a copy of the agreement, signed by the president of the local school board, the chair or president of the governing body of the proposed open-enrollment public charter school, and the chief operating officer of the proposed charter. If the facility is not operated by a school district, attach a copy of the Facilities Utilization Agreement, signed by the entity owning or operating the facility and the chief operating officer of the proposed charter. A proposed lease may also be submitted but is not required. Please note that any lease or other debt must be approved by the Commissioner of Education. Applicant Response: Friendship Education Foundation, a nonprofit organization awaiting 501(c)3 designation from the IRS, will sign a Facilities Utilization Agreement (Attachment F) with Flake & Kelly Commercial, Inc. The proposed facility to be leased is the former site of the University of Arkansas Criminal Justice Institute, which is located at 7723 Colonel Glenn Rd., Little Rock, AR 72204. The property consists of four large buildings closely connected by walkways. One building currently hosts day care, and another houses a pre-school operated by the UAMS Head Start program. Friendship Education Foundation will lease the third and fourth buildings, which have a combined 21,059 square feet. The buildings include multiple general purpose classrooms as well as ample space for a large multipurpose room. The multipurpose room can be used for physical activities, assemblies, and lunch. Each building also has multiple restrooms as well as administrative offices and conference rooms. The second building includes a library space and is furnished as such. The building will be wired for administrative and instructional use. As the site is located on over 4 acres, there is abundant parking space with plenty of room for outdoor activities. There is a built-in playground in a large greenspace adjacent to the building, and there is sufficient room for Friendship Education Foundation to add more equipment or to prepare the space for alternative use.

For each and every individual specifically identified by name in Section A of the application (the contact person, chief operating officer, board members, and other individuals), identify any family or financial relationship which may exist between that individual and: Applicant Response: NonePage 34 of 45Explain the procedures to be followed if a conflict of interest is identified. The procedures must ensure that all actions are in the best interest of the school and the students at the school. Applicant Response: Friendship Arkansas plans to adopt the following Conflict of Interest Policy. 1. Purpose. The purpose of the conflict of interest policy is to protect the Corporation's interest when it is contemplating entering into a transaction or arrangement that might benefit the private interest of an officer or director of the Corporation. This policy is intended to supplement but not replace any applicable state and federal laws governing conflict of interest applicable to nonprofit and charitable organizations or to charter schools. 2. Definitions. (a) Interested Person: Any director, executive officer, or member of a committee with Board of Directors delegated powers, who has a direct or indirect financial interest, as defined below, is an interested person. (b) Financial Interest: A person has a financial interest if the person has, directly or indirectly, through business, investment, or family: i. An ownership or investment interest in any entity with which the Corporation has a transaction or arrangement, ii. A compensation arrangement with any entity or individual with which the Corporation has a transaction or arrangement, or iii. A potential ownership or investment interest, other than de minimis, in, or compensation arrangement with, any entity or individual with which the Corporation is negotiating a transaction or arrangement. Compensation includes direct and indirect remuneration as well as gifts or favors that are not insubstantial. 3. Procedures. (a) Duty to Disclose. In connection with any actual or possible conflict of interest, an interested person must disclose the existence of a financial interest and be given the opportunity to disclose all material facts to the directors and members of committees with Board delegated powers considering the proposed transaction or arrangement (b) Determining Whether a Conflict of Interest Exists. A financial interest is not necessarily a conflict of interest. A person who has a financial interest may have a conflict of interest only if the Board or committee decides that a conflict of interest exists. After disclosure of the financial interest and all material facts, and after any discussion with the interested person, he/she shall leave the Board or committee meeting while the determination of a conflict of interest is discussed and voted upon. The remaining Board or committee members shall decide if a conflict of interest exists. (c) Procedures for Addressing a Conflict of Interest. i. An interested person may make a presentation at the Board or committee meeting, but after the presentation, he/she shall leave the meeting during the discussion of, and the vote on, the transaction or arrangement involving the possible conflict of interest, ii. The chairperson of the Board or committee shall, if appropriate, appoint a disinterested person or committee to investigate alternatives to the proposed transaction or arrangement, iii. After exercising due diligence, the Board or committee shall determine whether the Corporation can obtain with reasonable efforts a more advantageous transaction or arrangement from a person or entity that would not give rise to a conflict of interest. Page 35 of 45iv. If a more advantageous transaction or arrangement is not reasonably possible under circumstances not producing a conflict of interest, the Board or committee shall determine by a majority vote of the disinterested directors whether the transaction or arrangement is in the Corporation's best interest, for its own benefit, and whether it is fair and reasonable. In conformity with the above determination it shall make its decision as to whether to enter into the transaction or arrangement. v. All such transactions or arrangements shall be reviewed by the Board every six months for the duration of the transaction/arrangement. 4. Violations of the Conflicts of Interest Policy. (a) If the Board or committee has reasonable cause to believe a director has failed to disclose actual or possible conflicts of interest, it shall inform the director of the basis for such belief and afford the director an opportunity to explain the alleged failure to disclose. (b) If, after hearing the director's response and after making further investigation as warranted by the circumstances, the Board or committee determines the director has failed to disclose an actual or possible conflict of interest, it shall take appropriate disciplinary and corrective action. 5. Records of Proceedings. The minutes of the Board and all committees with board delegated powers shall contain: (a) The names of the persons who disclosed or otherwise were found to have a financial interest in connection with an actual or possible conflict of interest, the nature of the financial interest, any action taken to determine whether a conflict of interest was present, and the Board's or committee's decision as to whether a conflict of interest in fact existed. (b) The names of the persons who were present for discussions and votes relating to the transaction or arrangement, the content of the discussion, including any alternatives to the proposed transaction or arrangement, and a record of any votes taken in connection with the proceedings. 6. Compensation. (a) A voting director of the Board who receives compensation, directly or indirectly, from the Corporation for goods or services is precluded from voting on matters pertaining to that member's compensation. (b) A voting director of any committee whose jurisdiction includes compensation matters and who receives compensation, directly or indirectly, from the Corporation for goods or services is precluded from voting on matters pertaining to that member's compensation. 7. Annual Statements. Each director, executive officer and member of a committee with Board delegated powers shall annually sign a statement which affirms such person: (a) Has received a copy of the conflicts of interest policy, (b) Has read and understands the policy, (c) Has agreed to comply with the policy, and (d) Understands the Corporation is charitable and in order to maintain its federal tax exemption it must engage primarily in activities which accomplish one or more of its tax-exempt purposes. Page 36 of 458. Periodic Reviews. To ensure the Corporation operates in a manner consistent with charitable purposes and does not engage in activities that could jeopardize its tax-exempt status, periodic reviews shall be conducted. The periodic reviews shall, at a minimum, include the following subjects: (a) Whether compensation arrangements and benefits are reasonable, based on competent survey information, and the result of arm's length bargaining. (b) Whether partnerships, joint ventures, and arrangements with management organizations conform to the Corporation's written policies, are properly recorded, reflect reasonable investment or payments for goods and services, further charitable purposes and do not result in inurement, impermissible private benefit or in an excess benefit transaction. 9. Use of Outside Experts. When conducting the periodic reviews as provided for in Article 8, the Corporation may, but need not, use outside advisors. If outside experts are used, their use shall not relieve the Board of its responsibility for ensuring periodic reviews are conducted. 20. Describe the manner in which the school will make provisions for food services. State whether the proposed charter school will apply to participate in the federal National School Lunch program or other federal nutrition programs. Applicant Response: Friendship Arkansas will contract with a qualified foodservice vendor to provide high-quality meals for breakfast, lunch, and after school snacks that meet or exceed all requirements of the National School Lunch Program (NSLP). The contracting process will comply with all applicable federal (U.S.D.A.) and state regulations. Healthy nutritional standards are important to Friendship and the school will use grants and partnerships to provide additional health education and high quality food standards. Page 37 of 4521. Describe how the parents or guardians of the enrolled students and other members of the community will be involved with the school to positively impact the charter school's educational programs. Applicant Response: Parental Involvement Parents will have a voice working with the board and principal through the school Parent Action Committee (PAC). The committee will help bring parents into the fold by fostering formal and informal opportunities to engage with school staff, other parents and other community members on school programming. The Parent Action Committee will provide opportunities for all parents to be an active part of the school's culture and model the core values. There will also be leadership opportunities within the PAC. In addition to PAC participation, parents sign a pledge committing to responsibilities as a member of our school community. Similarly, all parents will be encouraged to participate as volunteers within the school. The input we receive from the various stakeholders of our school will drive the success of the academic program, as students, parents, and community members alike will need to support our mission if we are to be successful as a school. Students will spend over seven hours a day in school; but once they leave our campus, it will be up to the community and their parents/guardians to reinforce the academic program and the core values that we have worked hard to instill during the school day. If we want to count on the school's stakeholders to work with us to instill these values in our children, we must measure the extent to which those people believe we are succeeding. As this school will be a school of choice, parents and students who choose the school will be aware of our mission and what we hope to accomplish; therefore, it will be up to us to follow through on that promise. Friendship will keep potential parents and other community members abreast of the school's development through local community meetings, parent meetings and regular communication with community stakeholders. In order to engage and mobilize the school's community, Friendship will openly discuss and disseminate the mission and design of the school. Feedback from these community members will support the development of the programming as well as support student and staff recruitment efforts. Friendship Aspire will forge strong relationships between the home, school, and the community as a means of reducing barriers to student achievement. Research has shown that when parents are involved in their children's education, the attitudes, behaviors, and achievement of students are positively enhanced. Having a campus that is inviting and practicing consistent inclusion of parents in practical and tangible ways will be key to maintaining strong partnerships that ultimately benefit students. Friendship Aspire will implement two major parent engagement strategies. Parent Advisory Board: The Parent Advisory Board will be an organization that will bring parents and teachers together to promote the education and welfare of our children. The organization will raise funds for school supplies, educate parents, and help teachers to ensure that every child gets a high-quality education. Through the council, parents will have an avenue to organize and support the school in meaningful ways while also having a voice in the development of certain school-wide policies. The board will have officers, elections, and is open to all parents, guardians, and care-takers of students enrolled in our school. Parent Workshops: The goal of parent workshops is to educate and empower parents as partners, advocates and lifelong teachers in their child's education through educational courses and leadership opportunities. Through these offerings, parents will have the opportunity to learn about various strategies to support the academic success of their children. Friendship will also intertwine elements of personal and professional growth for parents including topics such as financial literacy and health & wellness. In addition to those strategies, we will implement the following positive engagement practices: Mobile Parent App Annual Open House and Back to School Night Quarterly Learning Contract Days Honors/Core Values Awards Assemblies Quarterly Parent Newsletter Page 38 of 45 Data Nights Parent Volunteer Program Annual Parent Surveys 22. Describe the potential impact of the proposed public charter school on the efforts of affected public school district(s) to comply with court orders and statutory obligations to create and maintain a unitary system of desegregated public schools. Applicant Response: Friendship Aspire will locate its open-enrollment charter school in Little Rock, Arkansas within the boundaries of the Little Rock School District. Friendship Aspire expects to obtain most of its students from within the boundaries of the Little Rock School District with the remaining students coming from North Little Rock and Pulaski County. Friendship Aspire is required by Ark, Code Ann. Section 6-23-106 to carefully review the potential impacts its opening would have upon the efforts of the school district to comply with court orders and statutory obligations to create and maintain a unitary system of desegregated public schools. In conducting its review, Friendship Aspire has substantiated that the Little Rock School District (LRSD) and North Little Rock School District (NLRSD) have been found by the Federal District to be unitary in all respects to their school operations. The Pulaski County Special School District (PCSSD) has been determined by the Federal District Court to be unitary in all respects concerning inter-district student assignment. The importance of the attainment of unitary status of the LRSD and NLRSD and the status of PCCSD as unitary in the area of inter-district student assignment is that those school districts have no further obligations to comply with court orders in these areas. Therefore, the granting of an open-enrollment public charter for Friendship Aspire cannot be said to have a negative impact on the LRSD, NLRSD, and PCCSD's ability to comply with the districts court orders or statutory obligations to create and maintain a unitary system of desegregated public schools. Friendship Aspire is requesting an enrollment cap f 450 students. According to the 2014-2015 school year enrollment figures (the latest school year for which official enrollment figures are available) as maintained by the ADE Data Center, the PCSSD had a student population of 16,592 students, the NLRSD had a student population of 8,576 students; and the LRSD had a student population of 23,363 students. Ark Code Ann. Section 6-23-106 requires that Friendship Aspire must be race-neutral and non-discriminatory in its student selection and admission processes, so it is not possible to accurately project racial composition. Ark. Code Ann. Section 6-23-106 also requires that Friendship Aspire's operation not serve to hamper, delay or in any manner negatively affect the desegregation efforts of a public school district or districts within the state. Friendship Aspires careful review of the relevant statutes and court orders affecting the 3 Pulaski County School districts and the student populations of such shows that such negative effect is not present here. In January 2014 Federal District Judge D. P. Marshall Jr. accepted a Settlement Agreement which effectively concluded the desegregation case (Little Rock School District et al. v. North Little Rock School District et al., Lorene Joshua et al., Arkansas Virtual Academy, et al. Case NO. 4:82-CV-866-DPM, U.S. District Court Eastern Division of Arkansas Western Division) involving the three (3) Pulaski County School Districts. One of the provisions of the Settlement Agreement was the voluntary dismissal with prejudice of its appeal to the Eighth District Court of Appeals concerning charter school issues. In conclusion, Friendship Aspire submits that upon the basis of its review, neither any existing federal District Court desegregation order affecting the NLRSD, LRSD, or PCSSD, nor the Settlement Agreement prohibit the State's charter school authorizer from granting a new charter for an open-enrollment public charter school in LRSD/ Pulaski County. Page 39 of 4523. Explain what the charter founders and other leaders are doing or will do to ensure the success of the charter school in perpetuity. Applicant Response: The Friendship Arkansas board will enter into a management agreement with Friendship Education Foundation. The agreement is performance-based, sand the management organization will be required to ensure the Friendship Aspire students make substantial academic progress and the school otherwise operates in compliance with applicable rules and regulations. The management organization will be represented at monthly meetings of the Friendship Arkansas board. At those meetings it will report on the school's academic, financial and operational performance, and solicit feedback for performance improvements. The board will evaluate the school leader as well as the management organization (and any back-office subcontractors) on an annual basis, using an established set of rubrics and evaluation instruments. An important factor in Friendship's long term success is human capital development, including the development of a school leadership pipeline that will ensure long-term school leadership stability within Friendship Arkansas. Friendship will tap into its multi-state network of schools to attract the highest potential leaders to Friendship Aspire, and will invest significantly in the professional development of the teachers and leaders at Friendship Aspire. This training will include attendance at Friendship's leadership development programs in Washington DC as well as attendance in the Relay Graduate School of Education's school leader training programs. Friendship Education Foundation's roots in the Friendship Public Charter School organization are deep. Its 15 year track record of delivering outstanding student achievement performance serving the lowest-income, most at-risk populations is one of stability, commitment to excellence, and long-term organizational success.

Friendship Lead seeks to fulfill this mission by providing students a high quality, li beral arts education focused on preparing students wi th the academic and life skills needed to be successful in college and beyond. Friendship Arkansas will the charter holder for the school operating under the name Friendship Lead. Through a management agreement with the Friendship Education Foundation, Fr iendship Arkansas will replicate the program of the Washington, DC -based Friendship Public Charter School - a program that has spawned three high performing elementary/middle schools, been recognized by the DC State Education Officer for preparing students to graduate high school on time (greater than 90% cohort rate) and enroll in college (100% college acceptance rate for graduates), and helped to turnaround two of the lowest performing elementary/middle schools in Baltimore. The Friendship program was des igned to instill an appreciation for education, high aspirations and personal standards that prepare students to become responsible contributors to their communities and world. We seek to serve children from kindergarten to eighth grade in elementary and middle school classes. At capacity we will enroll approximately 450 students. The student population targeted will be predominantly low income, minority children with a moderate to high incidence of special needs. Independent studies show that at-risk children are a population that most benefits from Friendship's model of instruction, intervention and co - curricular programs. 2 Information on the School District in Which the Charter Would Be Located Little Rock 74.9 % free and reduced -price lunch (2014-2015) Needs Improvement District (ESEA 2014) - Literacy and Mathematics Documentation Provided in Support of the Charter Petition of Support Included in Application Three names on the petition Issues that Remain Unresolved as Determined by the Charter Internal Review Committee : C7: EDUCATIONAL PROGRAM It is unclear why grade five will not be served in 2018 -2019. C9: STUDENT SERVICES The use of a manifestation determination team seems to be misused since, a manifestation team meets when a student with a disability has been suspended for 10 days and must meet to determine if the behavior is a manifestation of the student's disability. The applicant needs to confirm an understanding that all federal and state laws related to Special Educatio n Services are applicable. The applicant did not respond to the following comment: \"Revise the response to section H based on ADE Rules Governing Gifted and Talented Program.\" C18: FACILITIES A location for the charter school has not been determined . C20: FOOD SERVICES The applicant needs to confirm that the charter school will follow federal and state procurement regulations when procuring a food service m anagement company. Other: The calendar provided by the applicant is a list of events and does not show the number of student or staff days. CHARTER INTERNAL REVIEW COMMITTEE REVIEW AND APPLICANT RESPONSES1 Friendship Lead Academy PRE-APPLICATION MATERIALS The Arkansas Department of Education requires that all applicants submit a Letter of Intent, outlining a general description of the proposed charter school. Evaluation Criteria: A Letter of Intent filed with Arkansas Department of Education on time and including all the necessary information Fully Responsive PART B EXECUTIVE SUMMARY The Arkansas Department of Education requires all applicants to include an executive summary. Evaluation Criteria: A mission statement (with content to be evaluated for Prompt #3 of Part C); and The key programmatic features of the proposed charter school Fully Responsive PART C NARRATIVE DESCRIPTION OF THE PROPOSED CHARTER C1: PUBLIC HEARING RESULTS All proposed school design teams must conduct a public hearing before applying for an open - enrollment charter school, to assess support for the school's establishment. Applicants are asked both to document the logistics of the hearing and to incl ude a narrative of the hearing results. Evaluation Criteria: A thorough description of the results of the public hearing; Evidence of public support exhibited at the hearing; Documentation of required notices published to garner public attention to the he aring; and Documentation of required notices of the public hearing to superintendents of districts from which the proposed school is likely to draw students and to superintendents of districts that are contiguous to the district in which the charter school would be located 2 Fully Responsive Concerns and Additional Questions Provide the third notice of public hearing for Friendship Lead as only two notices for Lead, published on July 10 and July 17, were included. Explain why two applications for the same address and grade levels were submitted. Explain the discrepancies between the date of proposed opening on page 2 and the inclusion of a 2016 -2017 school calendar with the 2017-2018 school opening indicated in the business operations and facilities section s and the personnel summary, included as an attachment. Share the information provided at the public meeting about opening date and location of the charter. Applicant Response: The 3rd Notice was published on July 17, 2015 in the Arkansas Democratic Gaze tte. An affidavit of publication is included along with the copy of the Tear Sheet from the application. Friendship Education Foundation seeks to develop a cluster of three schools serving grades K - 12 over time. In order to support a high school in the f uture, two K -8 feeder schools are needed, so there are separate applications for Friendship Aspire and Friendship Lead. The initial application contained an error. Friendship Lead will not open until the 2017 -2018 school year. During the public meeting general information regarding the Friendship program was provided. It was noted that the school would not open until 2017 and its location was to be determine. C2: GOVERNING STRUCTURE The Governing Structure section should ex plain how the school will be governed. It should present a clear picture of the school's governance processes and composition, what responsibilities various groups and people will have and the relationships among the groups.

All finance and purchasing dec isions are pre -approved by the finance team to ensure compliance with the adopted budget. Final decision making authority for hiring and firing of staff rests with the school director, to ensure their accountability for the school's academic performance. Final decision making authority for hiring and firing of the school director is the joint responsibility of the school board and the Friendship Education Foundation's Executive Director. In practice, both parties must approve the hiring and either one c an recommend the termination of the School Director or superintendent.

Teachers in schools supported by Friendship are trained to apply the cur rent research on instruction to best meet the needs of the students in their classrooms. Teachers use the \"gradual release of responsibility\" model of instruction: I do, We do, You do. The cognitive load is passed from the teacher-as-model to the student for maximum learning (Fisher, Frey, 2008). The learning process starts in a structured manner, generally with a mini -lesson (I do), and becomes less structured as the responsibility transfers from the teacher to the student. The teacher facilitates the guided practice (We do) then re leases the responsibility to the students through collaborative and independent work (You do). Teachers are expected to differentiate instruction at every phase based on the needs of their students. Friendship's training program reinforces the idea that p roficient teachers use a variety of appropriate instructional strategies based on the standards, lessons, and needs of their students. Friendship supports teachers in making the cognitive shift to become diagnosticians who skillfully determine the appropr iate instructional \"prescription\" to ensure that students meet the standards and gradually release responsibility to students for ownership of their learning. Intense professional development is provided to ensure that teachers are equipped with the knowl edge and skills to ensure that this happens effectively in each and every classroom. 11 Friendship trains teachers to review the available curriculum resources and develop high -quality learning experiences that ensure that each student will learn as efficient ly and effectively as possible. Friendship provides teachers with research -based, common core -aligned program materials form Houghton Mifflin Harcourt so that teachers will have at hand a plethora of resources to support the learning of their individual s tudents. Through differentiated instruction, teachers enable students to achieve outcomes in ways that work best for each learner (Tomlinson, Wiggins, and McTighe, 2004). Friendship -trained teachers are always focused on learning for students at every le vel. Teachers continually ask the following key questions: How do we know our students are learning? What do we do when students are not learning? What do we do when students have learned? C9: STUDENT SERVICES The Student Services section should describe how the school will address specific services for its student body. Evaluation Criteria: A description of the ways in which the following services will be provided to students even in each area for which a waiver is requested : A guidance program that will serve all students; A health services program that will serve all students; A plan for a media center for use by all students; Sound plans for educating special education students that reflect the full range of programs and services required to p rovide such students with a high quality education; A transportation plan that will serve all eligible students; An alternative education plan for eligible students, including those determined to be at -risk and to offer access to one or more approved Alter native Learning Environments; A plan to serve students who are English language learners; and Plans for a gifted and talented program for eligible students Partially Responsive Concerns and Additional Questions Explain why a counselor will be hired mid -year in the first year of operation instead of before school begins. Confirm that a \"full continuum\" of services will be provided to special education students . Remove, \"In the event that the team does not feel that the student's current setting is adequately meeting his or her needs, the student, either by parent or school request, can appeal to the board to have the student placed into a more restrictive, out -of-general education setting\" and confirm that placement decisions for students with disabilities will be made by the IEP team, including the parent , in an appropriately called IEP conference. Verify that all state and federal laws pertaining to Special Education w ill be followed . Revise the response to section H based on ADE Rules Governing Gifted and Talented Program. 12 Explain how and when \"The nurse may also teach some health education.\" Applicant Response: Because of the initial grade configuration of K-3 Friendship does not feel the need to employ the guidance counselor until January of the year preceding year 2 when the middle grade will be added. Friendship Lead shall provide a full continuum of services for special education students. When a student ha s been referred for special education services, the special education department must first review all current data on the student including, but not limited to, medical history (including hearing and vision reports), parent and teacher input, outcomes of prior response to intervention initiatives, attendance, formal and informal school -based assessments, and student observations/input when deemed appropriate. Upon review of all documentation, the team, consisting of the parent, general and special educati on teacher, related service provider(s), SSST and Special Education Coordinator, nurse, guidance counselor, and building administrator, must determine if evaluations are warranted, and denote which areas of concern are to be assessed (reading, writing, beh avior, speech and language etc.). After the evaluations are completed, the Manifestation Determination Team. must convene to review the findings of the evaluation and determine, with the assistance of the disability criteria checklist found in the specia l education data system, if the student meets the criteria of the suspected disability. Each student's Individualized Education Plan (IEP) at a glance is provided to each general educator at the beginning of the school year and securely stored in the cla ssroom for collaborative planning. All teachers working with students who have disabilities are expected to use the IEPs to incorporate accommodations, modifications, and instructional strategies necessary to meet student needs. Furthermore, general and special educators have access to resources that guide instructional decisions in an inclusive setting and address challenging behaviors. These resources include curriculum guides and intervention materials intended to \"fill in gaps\" for struggling student s. The ongoing collaboration among general and special educators is the foundation for effective co -teaching strategies that foster growth for all students. As teachers work with one another, they also leverage parents, community organizations, and relat ed service providers to accomplish short and long -term positive outcomes in academic a nd social -emotional areas. Friendship 's goal is to maximize new partnerships to increase accountability, share resources/strategies, analyze data, and meet agreed-upon student goals. All student accommodations are reviewed on an individual basis. For example, some students transition before or after their peers in alignment with a Behavior Intervention Plan to ensure that they are not distracted by the environment. In other situations, such as enrollment in an intervention program, a special educator will work with the schedule to ensure the appropriate hours and services are provided. Friendship Lead removes from the initial application \" In the event that the team doe s not feel that the student's current setting is adequately meeting his or her needs, the student, either by parent or school request, can appeal to the board to have the student placed into a more restrictive, out -of-general education setting .\" Placement decisions for all students with 13 disabilities will be made by the IEP team, including the parent, in an appropriately called IEP meeting. Friendship will comply with all applicable federal and state laws related to Special Education Services. The nurse w ill work with health educati on teachers (PE and Science) in a team approach to provide additional resources to health lessons. Remaining issues: The use of a manifestation determination team seems to be misused since, a manifestation team meets when a student with a disability has been suspended for 10 days and must meet to determine if the behavior is a manifestation of the student's disability . The applicant needs to confirm an understanding that all federal and state laws related to Special Education Services are applicable. The applicant did not respond to the following comment: \"Revise the response to section H based on ADE Rules Governing Gifted and Talented Program.\" C10: GEOGRAPHICAL SERVICE AREA The Geographical Service Area section must outline the impact of a new school opening within the current public education system. Evaluation Criteria: The specific geographical area that would be served by the charter school; and Information on the school districts likely to be affected by the cha rter school, including data on the expected number of students to transfer to the charter school Fully Responsive C11: ANNUAL PROGRESS REPORTS The Annual Progress Reports section should define how the academic progress of individual students and the school as a whole will be measured, analyzed, and reported. Evaluation Criteria: A timeline for data compilation and completion of an annual report to parents, the community and the authorizer that outlines the school's progress; and A plan for disseminat ion of the annual report to appropriate stakeholders Fully Responsive Concerns and Additional Questions Confirm that the charter school shall provide and publish, in a newspaper with general circulation in the district before November 15 of each school year, a report to the public 14 detailing progress toward accomplishing program goals, accreditation standards , and proposals to correct deficiencies, and if there is no paper media with general circulation, notification shall be mailed to parents, as required in section 7.02.2 of the Standards for Accreditation. Applicant Response: Friendship will report annual school -wide progress on high stakes, state -mandated assessments to the school community each year. This report will detail progress towards accomplishing program goals, accreditation standards and proposals to correct deficie ncies. This report will be made available to parents during open houses and back -to-school nights, on the school website, and also to any parent or community member requesting the information. It will also be mailed out to parents when and if necessary. Fr iendship shall annually publish in a newspaper in the district before November 15 of each school year this annual report. C12: ENROLLMENT CRITERIA AND PROCEDURES The Enrollment Criteria and Procedures section should describe how the school will attract and enroll its student body, including any criteria for admission and enrollment. Applicants must also describe the random, anonymous lottery selection process. Evaluation Criteria: A student recruitment plan that will provide equal opportunity for all pa rents and students to learn about and apply to the school; An enrollment and admissions process that is open, fair, and in accordance with applicable law; A clear and transparent to the public process for, and a guarantee of, an annual random, anonymous lottery process should there be more student applications than can be accommodated under the terms of the charter; and The method by which parents will be notified of each child's selection for the school or placement on the waiting list. Fully Responsive Concerns and Additional Questions Explain how the charter will ensure that the lottery process is transparent to the public. Explain in more detail what is meant by \"a marketing plan .\" Applicant Response: If the number of students seeking admission to the school exceeds the school's capacity, students will be selected on the basis of an open lottery. Applications will be accepted throughout the spring. The schools will continue to accept applications until seven days prior to the lottery, and the lottery will take place in the spring before the school opens. The lottery will also be supervised by an independent local CPA firm. An additional admissions lottery will be conducted each subsequent year for the entering class of the lowest grade. In addition, 15 spaces open in existing grades will also be filled by lottery in subsequent years. The lottery may be conducted by using specialized computer software or publicly at a scheduled event. The lottery proced ures will be as follows: o All students who apply have equal chance for admission. A drawing will be held and each child will have his or her name entered. o A sibling preference will apply to families seeking to enroll more than one child in the school. o The lottery drawing will rotate through the grade levels, beginning with the lowest grade. The first student will be selected from the school's lowest grade; the next student will be selected from the next lowest grade, and so on through every grade level. The process will then repeat until all spaces have been filled. o Once spaces in a given grade have been filled, the names of the remaining applicants for that grade will be drawn and their names will be placed on the school's waiting list, ranked with resp ect to the order in which they were drawn. Children whose parents or guardians submit applications after the lottery will have their names placed at the bottom of the wait list in the order in which their applications are received. Friendship will employ the following marketing plan . Upon final approval of our charter, we will immediately: o Produce all relevant marketing m aterials (in multiple languages ), including A letter from the CEO outlining the new school, its mission, philosophy on education, curriculum highlights, location, student eligibility, and registration information. Posters outlining the new school, its mission, philosophy on education, curriculum highlights, location, student eligibility, and registration information. Fliers outlining the new school, its mission, philosophy on education, curriculum highlights, location, student eligibility, and registration information. o Disseminate marketing materials by Canvassing homes in the surrounding neighborhoods with fliers . Placing posters and leaving fliers at local businesses, libraries, doctor offices, social service agencies, etc. Mailing letters to local residents . Communicate with local residents and their children at parent meetings and community events hosted by a variety of community g roups In addition , the following strateg ies will also be selectively employed : o Press Releases and Marketing Communications : Key information will be shaped into messages that can be communicated in all subsequent media operations. 16 o Radio Advertising : Radio has proven to be one of the most effective ways of advertising local school enrollment. The school may use radio ads when holding a social event, open house, registration week, and any other special events. o Newspaper Advertising : In conjunction with other efforts, newspaper advertising can also be effective. We will determine if newspaper advertising is needed depending on the number of students that have enrolled and how much time is left to recruit students as we approach opening day. o TV Advertising : This form of advertising is expensive, so we will determine if TV advertising is necessary depending on the number of students that have enrolled and how much time is left to recruit students as we approach opening day. o Q & A Session w ith Parents and Students : The principal will hold a Q & A session with parents and students to address any questions or concerns parents may have. Grassroots marketing is the best and the least expensive of all form of recruitment, especially when dealin g with a local audience. Below are the strategies we will employ to maximize the impact of grassroots marketing. o Door-to-Door Campaign : We will organize teams consisting of two or more people to go door-to-door in the neighborhood or attendance zone, to inform parents and potential students of the new school. We will ensure that each team is well stocked with applications, a fact sheet, information about the new campus, handouts, and giveaways. Samples of door -to-door scripts will be made available prior to the campaign to ensure that the teams are well informed and can address all questions. o Information Sessions : As with every new school, an abundance of questions and concerns will emerge from parents' minds. It is very important to respond to those immediately. For that reason , information sessions are necessary. This gives us the opportunity to immediately inform parents, students, and other members of the community about the change before any concerns surface. o Distribution of Marketing Material : We will blanket surrounding n eighborhoods and nearby community organizations with flyers, door hangers, brochures and as much marketing materials to advertise the new school. Specifically, we will distribute those materials in local businesses, preschool s, day care centers, libraries , grocery stores, beauty salons, churches, and laundromats in the area. o Community Events and Education Fairs : A very effective way to recruit families is to participate in education -related community events and fairs. We will create teams of at least two people to be present at booths during such community events. We will create a schedule well in advance to cover different shifts during each event. It is important that there are enough materials to distribute during the event. Each booth will have a sc hool fact sheet, literature about Fr iendship, sign -in sheets, student applications, materials that showcase the school and giveaways for parents and potential students. o Principal Meet and Greet with Parents : The principal will schedule a \"meet and greet\" event for parents and potential students. Ideally, this will take place at the school so that parents can see where their child will be attending and also become familiar with 17 the school's surroundings. Allowing parents the opportunity to ask questions directly to the principal is essential.

Electronically signed, Sandra Ward On the Second day of July 2015. 121 East Capitol Avenue l Little Rock, AR 72201 Gunman chases family into home Police were seeking an armed robber who chased a man and two children in- to their Little Rock home Wednesday. Isaias Trujillo, 36, said he was outside his home at 5616 Baseline Road when a man pulled up in a white Cadillac sedan just before midnight, according to a police report. The man walked toward Tru- jillo and two boys, ages 14 and 15, and demanded mon- ey. Trujillo said he and the boys ran inside and blocked the door. The robber ran after the three and damaged the door trying to get inside, but even- tually fled empty-handed, ac- cording to the report. No injuries were reported. Police searched the area but made no arrests. The robber is described only as black and between the ages of 30 and 45. He wore a white T -shirt. 2 rob LR eatery's workers, rifle safe Two armed men robbed Gus's Fried Chicken on W ednesday night, taking cash and cellphones from employ- ees and money from the safe, police said. The men jumped a priva- cy fence about 10 p.m. and approached a female em- ployee sitting on the patio of the restaurant at 400 N. Bowman Road. They pointed black handguns at the woman and one of the men told her to \"Give me all your money,\" according to the report. The men took the wom- an's cellphone and money and then ordered her back into the restaurant where the men demanded money from the safe, took the restaurant's phones and the cellphone of another employee before running from the restaurant, the report said. The men also reportedly fired one shot into the air while they were running from the business. Officers searched the area but made no arrests. Employee arrested in theft of laptops A part-time employee at Metropolitan Career-Techni- cal Center is accused of tak- ing four laptop computers, according to a report from Little Rock police. Robert Callicott, 39, was arrested Wednesday on a theft of property charge after a school official told police that Callicott took 10 Apple MacBook laptop computers and did not return them. The report said Callicott claimed he did not take the computers, but video footage showed him taking the com- puters out of the classroom May 28. Callicott returned six of the computers after the school said it would press charges, but four are still missing, the report said. Callicott was not listed on the Pulaski County jail roster Thursday.about child sexual abuse. The network is working with the Rape, Abuse and Incest National Network and Darkness to Light \u2014 along with the Duggar family \u2014 in creating a one-hour, com- mercial-free documentary that will air later this summer. In Touch Weekly magazine reported May 21 that Josh Dug- gar had been the subject of a criminal investigation in 2006 involving actions in 2002 and 2003. He resigned as a lobbyist for the conservative Family Re- search Council after the report appeared. In March 2002, then-14-year- old Josh Duggar told his parents that he had run his hands over young girls in the Duggar house- hold as they slept, his parents said in a June 3 Fox News in- terview with Megyn Kelly . Josh Duggar was disciplined and pre- cautions were taken, his parents said, but they didn't seek outside assistance for him or his victims. Josh Duggar then admitted to his parents in July 2002 that he took similar advantage of girls who had fallen asleep on the family couch and was again punished, Jim Bob and Michelle Duggar told Fox News. The Duggars said they sought out- side help after a third admission in March 2003 by Josh Duggar that he touched two girls while they were awake. Josh Duggar was then sent to Little Rock for four months. The Springdale Police De- partment began an investigation in 2006, after an anonymous tip was forwarded to state authori- ties. The investigation conclud- ed that the statute of limitations had passed for any charges. Duggar sisters Jill Dillard, 24, and Jessa Seewald, 22, ap- peared on Fox News' The Kelly File on June 5 and acknowledged that they were inappropriately touched by their brother. But the two sisters said the problem had been taken care of years ago, and Josh Duggar had been forgiven and is a changed person. Two of the other girls fon- dled by Josh Duggar as a teen were also his sisters, the Dug- gars told Fox News. The fifth victim was a family friend. \"With God's grace and help, Josh, our daughters and our en- tire family overcame a terrible situation, found healing and a way forward,\" the Duggar fam- ily said in a statement released Thursday. \"It is our prayer that the painful situation our family went through many years ago can point people toward faith in God and help others who also have lived through similar dark situations to find help, hope and healing as well. \"W e look forward to working with TLC on this upcoming spe- cial documentary and hope that it is an encouragement to many.\"Shannon Llanes, senior di- rector of publicity for TLC parent company Discovery Communications, said neither the network nor the family had any further comment beyond its statements. The show 19 Kids and Count- ing started in September 2008 and lasted for 10 seasons. The series' final episode, which aired May 19, drew about 1.7 million viewers.

His next court appearance is to be Aug. 24, about two weeks after he turns 37 , for a progress report on the evaluation process. Trial dates cannot be set until the question of his mental health is resolved. Taylor has been jailed with- out bail since his court hearing on May 29 in which the judge learned that T aylor was going to be arrested on the beating allegations. Condon was found uncon- scious the evening of May 13 on the floor of a cabin at the Oa- sis Renewal Center on Cooper Orbit Road in Little Rock. After he regained consciousness, he could not initially tell investiga- tors what had happened to him. No one at the center reported seeing what had gone on be- tween the men, although at least two witnesses heard something, according to Pulaski County sheriff's office reports.Also, Taylor told a center worker that something had oc- curred between Condon and himself, but the reports don't say what he said beyond a quote from T aylor: \"I told dude to stop f****** with me.\" It was not until the next day that a hospitalized Con- don reportedly described being punched in the face by T aylor, who he said got angry when he greeted the boxer and attempt- ed to high-five him. An arrest affidavit states that Condon suf- fered five fractures in his face around his eyes and nose, inju- ries that required reconstructive surgery. The second-degree battery charge against T aylor carries a maximum of six years in pris- on, but that penalty can be dou- bled if he is deemed a habitual offender by being convicted of the other charges against him. The judge had agreed to al- low Taylor to enter rehabilita- tion in March, after the boxer had spent about six weeks in jail after his arrest over accusations that he'd fired a gun at a family with three children after Little Rock's Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Day parade in January. Taylor had been in rehabili- tation for less than three months when he was arrested on Con- don's accusations. Taylor's other charges are: m First-degree battery and ter- roristic threatening in the Au- gust shooting of his 42-year-old cousin, Tyrone DaWayne Hin- ton of Jacksonville, and allega- tions that he threatened the life of another man, Aharon Coley , 20, of Little Rock. Hinton re- portedly required surgery for treatment of his injuries. Tay- lor's lawyers have suggested that T aylor acted in self-defense. The charges together carry a poten- tial of 26 years in prison. m Five counts of aggravated assault, and single charges o f terroristic threatening and mis- demeanor marijuana posses- sion stemming from his Martin Luther King Day arrest. The charges together carry a poten- tial 36-year maximum and are based on accusations that he threatened a family of five by firing a gun at them and threat- ened to kill the father, 42-year- old Thelton Smith of Little Rock, outside a gym owned by Taylor.Taylor v Continued from Page 1B Duggars v Continued from Page 1B News For story ideas and news tips: (501) 378-3485 news@arkansasonline.com City Editor Danny Shameer (501) 378-3568 dshameer@arkansasonline.com State Editor Heidi White (501) 378-3483 hwhite@arkansasonline.com Chief Photographer John Sykes Jr. (501) 918-4529 jsykes@arkansasonline.com Mail Arkansas Democrat-Gazette P.O.

As part of that transition, district offi- cials are trying to obtain up- to-date, correct information on all students, Stewart said. District officials said more information about registra- tion will be made available to district parents in the next few days through the news media, recorded \"robo-calls\" to homes and on the district's website and Facebook page.Parents seeking to regis- ter their children must pro- vide proof of their address by showing a current utility bill or a lease or mortgage agreement. The parents al- so must provide a working telephone number, and they will be asked for an email address, although that is not required. Parents of students new to the district must also show a birth certificate for their child, the child's immuniza- tion record, Social Security number and information from the child's previous school.NLRSD v Continued from Page 1B Police beat More information on the Web arkansasonline.com/right2knowRight2Know crime databaseSCOTT CARROLL AND EMILY NITCHER ARKANSAS DEMOCRAT -GAZETTE Today's radar speed checks Little Rock and North Little Rock police and the Pulaski County sheriff's ofce will use radar to detect speeding at these locations.

Since, as a charter school, we bear the additional cost of rent and up fit for a facility, we must be quite conservative in budgeting. Legal Comments: Rationale should be provided to explain how this waiver will help the Applicant meet its goals. The Applicant should explain the duties of each of its projected classified employees. Applicant Response: See job descriptions attached to review response and application section. Maintaining a balanced budget and quality operation along with ensuring the ability to hire andretain quality classified personnel is necessary to ensure that the bet teacher is in every classroom. Remaining Issues: The descriptions referenced in the ini tial Legal Comments were not found in the attached list of job descriptions. The job descriptions that were found in the attached list were very brief. 5. Class Size and Teaching Load Standards for Accreditation 10.02 Class Size and Teaching Load We believe that the research on the benefits of reducing class size is mixed. While there are studies that suggest class sizes of less than 20 do improve student achievement, other studies question the validity of this data. Total enrollment will not exceed 4 50 for grades K -8. Class size at Friendship Lead will not exceed 20 in K and 25 in all other grades except that the school may adjust the class size by 10% without exceeding the charter if circumstances require. Legal Comments: Rationale should be provide d to explain how this waiver will help the Applicant meet its goals. Applicant Response: In order to ensure that Friendship meets the goals (For example) a minimum of 1.5 years growth on NWEA MAPP it is necessary that we have the flexibility of class sizing. In certain instances smaller classes help with student performance but there is other research to the contrary. We request the ability to make the right decision on class size to meet the needs of the students served. Remaining Issues: None Page 5 6. Superintendent ARK. CODE ANN. \u00a7 6 -13-609 ARK.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Provide the mission statement of the proposed school. Briefly describe the key programmatic features that the school will implement in order to accomplish the mission. The mission of Friendship Lead is to provide a world-class education that motivates students to achieve high academic standards, enjoy learning and develop as ethical, literate, well-rounded and self-sufficient citizens. Friendship Lead seeks to fulfill this mission by providing students a high quality, liberal arts education focused on preparing students with the academic and life skills needed to be successful in college and beyond. Friendship Arkansas will the charter holder for the school operating under the name Friendship Lead. Through a management agreement with the Friendship Education Foundation, Friendship Arkansas will replicate the program of the Washington, DC-based Friendship Public Charter School - a program that has spawned three high performing elementary/middle schools, been recognized by the DC State Education Officer for preparing students to graduate high school on time (greater than 90% cohort rate) and enroll in college (100% college acceptance rate for graduates), and helped to turnaround two of the lowest performing elementary/middle schools in Baltimore. The Friendship program was designed to instill an appreciation for education, high aspirations and personal standards that prepare students to become responsible contributors to their communities and world. We seek to serve children from kindergarten to eighth grade in elementary and middle school classes. At capacity we will enroll approximately 450 students. The student population targeted will be predominantly low income, minority children with a moderate to high incidence of special needs. Independent studies show that at- risk children are a population that most benefits from Friendship's model of instruction, intervention and co- curricular programs. Friendship's model draws on three tenets of Friendship's culture of achievement: strong leadership, a consistent message of achievement from all of the school's stakeholders, and an organizational structure conducive to fostering achievement. Friendship does not bring a simple program or philosophy to its mission; rather, it delivers a comprehensive educational package that uses research based, Common Core-aligned curricular resource materials to lead students to meet and surpass rigorous standards as measured by their post- assessments. The curriculum framework of Friendship has three primary components: 1) a solid foundation of core academic subjects, 2) exposure-to-the-world to prepare students for both extended learning and global citizenship, and 3) college level coursework connected to career study (in the high school grades). To instill students with a strong fundamental education, research-based, core curriculum materials are used in conjunction with deep training for teachers in a standards-based curriculum implementation process. Friendship's \"backwards design\" model trains teachers to plan with the end in mind. Friendship's theory of change starts with the creation of a positive learning environment and does not sacrifice the need for long-term transformation in order to realize short-term gains. Friendship's commitment puts an emphasis on having the infrastructure in place so that a performance and results-oriented culture flourishes and school leadership acts in ways that are fully supportive of, and responsive to, academic and instructional needs.

NARRATIVE DESCRIPTION OF THE PROPOSED CHARTER SCHOOL The applicant for the proposed charter school, if approved by the authorizer, agrees to operate the educational program described below in accordance with the provisions described within this document, Arkansas Code Annotated \u00a76-23-101 et seq., the State Board of Education Rules Governing Public Charter Schools, and the attached assurances. Provide a narrative description of the various components of the proposed charter school by responding to the following prompts: 1. Describe the results of the public hearing, which was held for the purpose of assessing support for the establishment of this public charter school. Provide copies of supporting evidence. Applicant Response: A public hearing was held on July 24, 2015 at 6:00 P.M. at the Dee Brown Library located at 6235 Baseline Road in Little Rock. The meeting was presided over by Ms. Kimberly Williams, Executive Director of Friendship Education Foundation. It included a 45 minute presentation on the Friendship national model and success serving similar student populations in DC, Baltimore and Louisiana. The presentation focused on the Friendship School Model and included a question and answer session. No further information was requested and no one present spoke in opposition to the proposed school. The notice of public hearing was posted in the Arkansas Democrat Gazette on July 3, July 10 and July 17 in the news section. See Attachment B for ad copies reflecting publication dates. Emails were sent to superintendents of affected school districts notifying them of the hearing. Copies of these emails are included in Attachment B. Additional supporting documentation is also included in Attachment B. Attach documentation to demonstrate that each of the following requirements of Arkansas Code Annotated \u00a76-23-302 was met: A. B. C. D. The notice of the public hearing was published on a weekly basis for at least three (3) consecutive weeks prior to the date of the hearing in a newspaper having general circulation in the school district in which the school will likely be located. The notice of the public hearing was not published in the classified or legal notice section of the newspaper. The last publication date of the notice was no less than seven days prior to the public meeting. Within seven calendar days following the first publication of the notice of the public hearing, emails announcing the public hearing were sent to the superintendent of each of the school districts from which the open- enrollment public charter school is likely to draw students for the purpose of enrollment and the superintendent of any district that is contiguous to the district in which the open-enrollment public charter school will be located. Page 6 of 452. Describe the governing structure of the open-enrollment charter school, including board composition, selection process, and responsibilities. Also describe the role of the administrators, faculty, parents, students, and community members in the leadership and decision-making of the school. As part of your response, answer the following specific questions: A. Identify what individual, job position(s), or entity(s) will have final decision- making authority for the school in the areas of (1) finance and purchasing; (2) student discipline; (3) hiring and firing of staff; and (4) hiring and firing of the school director or superintendent. B. Specify how the final decision-maker(s) identified in response to (A)(3) will be selected or elected, including (1) length of term, (2) method of selection or election, and (3) who will have the authority to participate in the selection or election process. C. Explain how and to what extent the school's leadership will be accountable to parents. Applicant Response: Friendship Arkansas will be incorporated as an Arkansas nonprofit organization. The existing non-profit management organization, Friendship Education Foundation, has submitted its application for 501(c)3 status to the Internal Revenue Service. See Attachment A. Board Composition A Board of Directors will govern the school. Board members are being recruited. Friendship is seeking civic or educational local leaders who are involved in educational reform or have experience evaluating senior executives, and are, therefore, highly qualified to evaluate the school leader. The Friendship Arkansas board members will be representative of the community in which the school is located. They will have a diverse set of professional skills and practical work experience in the areas of education, public/ non-profit and/or for-profit administration or operations, community development, finance, and law. Parents who meet or supplement these criteria will be considered for board membership. Responsibilities of the Board of Directors Governance: The board is responsible for: Formulation and supervision of overall school policy Approval of and monitoring the school's annual budget Supporting the school's mission and purposes Monitoring, evaluating and holding management accountable for school performance Approval of the school leadership teams and assessment of their performance Ensuring effective organizational planning and sound board policy Ensuring adequate resources Management of resources effectively Enhancing public standing Ensuring legal and ethical integrity and maintaining accountability Recruitment and orientation of new board members and assessing board performance. Board Committees: Friendship plans to form the following committee structure: Discipline Committee to oversee the handling of matters relating to student discipline. The Discipline Committee may recommend Codes of Conduct for adoption by the Board of Trustees and may, by majority vote of the members of the Discipline Committee, approve on behalf of the Board of Trustees expulsions of students from Friendship Philadelphia. Page 7 of 45 Finance Committee to oversee the financial management of Friendship Lead. The Finance Committee shall recommend an annual budget for adoption by the Board of Trustees and may, by majority vote of the members of the Finance Committee, accept the annual audit of financial statements on behalf of the Board of Trustees. Personnel Committee, which may include persons who are not Trustees but shall not include any person who is also an employee of Friendship Lead to make recommendations to the Board of Trustees with respect to the hiring, retention, eventual retirement, and compensation of school leaders. Oversight The board will have login access to Friendship's performance management dashboard system. The system provides real-time input on enrollment, attendance, discipline, interim assessment results, and summative assessment results. As a national leader in the development of performance management systems, Friendship has a highly developed performance management system that the board will find user-friendly. The Friendship Lead school will use all of the performance management tools employed by Friendship elsewhere. The board will also receive a standard monthly financial reporting package that includes a statement of budget vs. actual results, a revised forecast for the balance of the year, a balance sheet and monthly cash flow projection. This financial package will be reviewed in detail by the board treasurer or finance committee prior to each monthly board meeting. Meetings of Board of Directors The board will meet monthly throughout the year, usually at the school. Date, time, and place of all board meetings will be included in the school calendar that parents receive. The calendar will also be on the school website. Meetings of the Board shall be open to the pubic to ensure members of the community are able to communicate their concerns to the Board. Any person may speak at an open meeting of the Board. To the fullest extent allowed by law, all such discussions shall take place in an open meeting. Friendship Education Foundation (FEF) Friendship opened two elementary schools in 1998 and now operates six public charter schools serving grades preK-12 in the lowest income wards of the District of Columbia, and two turnaround schools serving grades K-12 in partnership with the school district of Baltimore City. Its charter and turnaround schools consistently outperform traditional public schools serving similar populations. Friendship also plans to work with 4th Sector Solutions, a provider of back-office services including financial management and reporting, school operations, and human resources management services that has served charter schools since 2004. Friendship has references from its current operation sites: Michelle Rhee, Founder and CEO of StudentsFirst and former Chancellor of DC Public Schools. Kaya Henderson, current Chancellor of DC Public Schools. Andres Alonso, CEO of Baltimore City Public Schools. Friendship is considered one of the most effective educational providers by the Baltimore City Public Schools district leadership. Its schools serve disproportionately low-income and special education populations. All of its DC charter schools serving grades preK-8 significantly outperform the DC Public Schools serving the most disadvantaged students (Wards 5-8), by 12-15%. Four of Friendship's six schools are larger than any of the comparable DCPS schools in total enrollment. Friendship Collegiate Academy in DC, which enrolls 900 students, consistently achieves proficiency levels that are two to three times the levels of DCPS high schools serving similar populations. Friendship's performance implementing a turnaround at Anacostia High School - for which it was originally hired by then DCPS Superintendent Michelle Rhee - was remarkable. A Washington Examiner article on October 14, 2012 noted, \"Anacostia's high school graduation rate last year was 78 percent, up from only 56 percent only three years ago. Before our partnership began, no record was even kept of how many students were accepted to college -- a sign of where that aspiration fell in the scheme of priorities. Last year, half of our graduating students were accepted to college.\" Page 8 of 45 Unlike many other high-performing CMO networks, Friendship operates large schools (more than 500 students) effectively. Friendship's network includes the largest high school and four of the seven largest elementary schools out of over 80 charter and traditional public schools in Wards 5-8. Because of this scale, over the past 12 years, Friendship has improved the academic achievement of the largest number of high-needs students in DC. Role of Administration The Friendship Lead leadership team has not yet been selected. Job descriptions are attached. When selected, the team will include the principal and two deans/assistant principals (one of which starts in year two, and the other at full enrollment). Deans are instructional leaders of the school and act in concert with the principal to ensure that instructional goals are met. They are responsible for driving the school's mission and guiding principles to ensure a positive achievement focus and school culture among teachers, staff and students. Deans are assigned a cohort of teachers for observation, evaluation, and development. They guide staff top achieve high performance through data analysis, goal setting, providing meaningful feedback, and constructive evaluations. Friendship also provides an instructional performance coach to support new and veteran teachers in becoming highly effective educators. Coaches support teachers to organize, set up, and manage a classroom by emphasizing the delivery of quality data-driven instruction using formative and interim assessments; leading data talks across grade levels or content; modeling excellent delivery of content; planning differentiated lessons; helping develop quality unit plans using the Understanding by Design (UBD) framework; observing and reviewing teachers' daily lesson unit plans; and providing feedback. Additionally, deans are responsible for implementing the school-wide positive behavior plan to ensure an effective discipline system with high standards that is consistent with the philosophy, values, and mission of the school and district, in accordance with due process and other laws and regulations. Deans advise Academic Advisors in creating a positive culture of behavior in the school and team with teachers, staff, social workers, the parent, curriculum, and professional development coordinators in the plan's development and implementation. Parental Involvement Parents will have a voice working with the board and principal through the school Parent Action Committee (PAC). The committee will help bring parents into the fold by fostering formal and informal opportunities to engage with school staff, other parents and other community members on school programming. The Parent Action Committee will provide opportunities for all parents to be an active part of the school's culture and model the core values. There will also be leadership opportunities within the PAC. In addition to PAC participation, parents sign a pledge committing to responsibilities as a member of our school community. Page 12 of 45If the performance of students at schools and or/districts not noted in the previous charts demonstrate the need for the charter, provide the student performance data and its source and explain. Applicant Response: The North Little Rock, Bryant and Pulaski County School Districts are adjacent to the home district of the proposed charter. According to the data provided by the Arkansas Department of Education all of these were in Needs Improvement Status on 2014. All 3 districts missed their AMOs in both math and literacy. None of the districts met their Growth AMOs in either Math or Literacy. All 3 districts are also dealing with significant achievement gaps. In North Little Rock, Caucasian students graduate at rates almost 20% higher than students of color. Proficient and Advanced rates for Caucasian students for Math and Literacy are greater than 25% higher than the Proficient and Advanced rates for students of color. Additional less than 30% of students with disabilities are proficient in Math or Literacy. Similarly in Pulaski County the district shows the same gaps to a smaller degree. Caucasian students score Proficient or Advanced at rates between 15% and 23% higher than African American students in both Math and Literacy. Students with disabilities are performing at less than 30% proficient as well. In Bryant County where the proficients level is a 83.7% Caucasian students still out perform students of color at a rate of 12% in Literacy. This gap is more distinguished in Math with a 20% gap between Caucasian and students of color scoring proficient and advanced, Describe three (3) innovations that will distinguish the charter from other schools. Applicant Response: Smaller Learning Communities (House/ Career Academies) The purpose of the house/career academy structure is to give each student a smaller community within which s/ he can grow and learn throughout his/her tenure in the academy. Smaller learning communities allow for differentiated instruction and the creation of individual learning plans so that each student will have a defined program of scholarship that allows him or her to excel. The organizational structure of Friendship schools is unique and conducive to delivering a message of achievement, in that it will create smaller clusters of students within the larger school community. These smaller learning communities group students that are in similar positions with respect to academic and personal development. Using this structure, the school leadership is able to target students effectively using the best practices, teaching, and disciplinary techniques that have been proven to be most effective for students of a given age group. The school may have many grade levels, students still feel like they are in a small community of like-minded students. Friendship's theory of change starts with the creation of a positive learning environment and does not sacrifice the need for long-term transformation in order to realize short-term gains. Friendship's school design puts an emphasis on having the infrastructure in place so that a performance and results-oriented culture flourishes and school leadership acts in ways that are fully supportive of, and responsive to, academic and instructional needs. Friendship anticipates effecting measurable change immediately, leading to a doubling of the number of students rated \"proficient\" in math and reading, a 50% increase in graduation rates (for high schools), and a 75% reduction in truancy within three to five years. Friendship welcomes the responsibility of playing a leadership role to raise the quality of education citywide. It maintains a ten-year vision of seeing high-performing organizations Page 13 of 45across the board, believing that a widespread culture of achievement has positive effects on the capabilities of every individual student, teacher, and leader in every individual school. Curriculum and Education Program The Understanding by Design framework ensures that teacher teams make informed decisions about the specific texts, performance tasks, and other resources that will be included within a unit in order to provide cultural relevancy. The curriculum resource materials are reviewed carefully by the Friendship Curriculum Committee to ensure cultural relevancy in content, and equity of access for second-language learners. Opportunities for targeted differentiation for English Language Learners (and the supporting resources) are embedded in the resource materials and teacher lesson plans. The curriculum framework of Friendship has three primary components: 1) a solid foundation of core academic subjects, 2) exposure-to-the-world to prepare students for both extended learning and global citizenship, and eventually 3) college level coursework connected to career study (for high school students). To instill students with a strong fundamental education, research-based, core curriculum materials are used in conjunction with deep training for teachers in a standards-based curriculum implementation process. Friendship's \"backwards design\" model trains teachers to plan with the end in mind. Through implementation of Understanding by Design, teachers use backwards design to plan units that address the six facets of understanding (explanation, interpretation, application, perspective, empathy, and self-knowledge). Understanding by Design facilitates the planning process by enabling teachers to clarify learning goals, assess student understanding, and craft engaging learning activities. Friendship Honors and Supports the Whole Child Integral to the Friendship model is support of the whole child. Teachers receive intensive training in using \"differentiated learning\" that is designing variations in lesson plans for children with different learning styles and diverse capabilities. Each campus has access to a school nurse and a mental health counselor in addition to the school guidance counselor. Each campus has regularly scheduled School and Student Staff Support Team (SSST) meetings to support individual students. Meeting typically in common teacher planning periods, SSST teams include: classroom teacher, school counselor, parent/guardian, school leader, mental health counselor and nurse. Support for individual students is reinforced by the Friendship Design mandate to share individual academic data with students. Teacher's work with students to choose how they would show they have mastered an academic standard based on their interests, creativity and their learning styles. Friendship Lead will offer Saturday School for any child who needs extra help. The school will also offer Friendship Cares and other opportunities after school for students to challenge themselves in activities such as athletics, chess, band, and journalism. On the following table, list the specific measurable goals in reading, reading comprehension, and mathematics, based on the state mandated assessments, and any other assessment tools if used, for improving student academic achievement for each year of the public charter school's initial five-year period. For each goal, include the following: The tool to be used to measure the academic performance; The level of performance that will demonstrate success; and The timeframe for the achievement of the goal.5. Page 15 of 45elementary school. The educational need identified in the data presented above for local non-magnet schools shows a consistent achievement gap and steady decline in proficiency from elementary through middle and high school. By addressing academic deficits early in elementary school and exceeding district average academic performance with a more at-risk student population, Friendship Lead will set its students on the path to high school success when they complete their K-8 experience. 6. For elementary charter schools, provide a daily schedule for all grade levels indicating the classes that will be provided for a one week time period. For secondary schools, provide required and elective courses for every grade level. If the school plans to phase in grade levels, include expansion grade levels by year with courses to be offered. Applicant Response: Please see schedule included in Attachment D. 7. Provide a description of curriculum, programs, and instructional methods used to support core classes. Include all associated costs in the proposed budget. Applicant Response: Educational Philosophy: The Culture Intensive is a concentrated and focused course of study in which the whole school and all students participate, including special needs students, those receiving special education services, English Language Learners (ELL), and any students at risk of academic failure. The focus of the Culture Intensive is to instill the culture of achievement across the school. During the first weeks of school, in addition to the curriculum, every class devotes a significant amount of time to lessons devoted to teaching the school Code of Conduct and practicing the expected behaviors for each area of the school. The lesson plans in the Intensive do not assume students know appropriate behavior and, therefore, explicitly teach what is Page 16 of 45expected. The goals of the Intensive are to be sure students can articulate and demonstrate the code and that they are motivated to follow it. The lessons created for teaching the code are not unlike those in any other curriculum area. Just telling students is not enough. Students will need quality and engaging instruction including discussion, guided practice, and feedback in order to learn the expected behaviors. They need to be actively involved in understanding, practicing, and internalizing the code. These lesson plans also use fun activities to increase student enthusiasm and use positive reinforcement and incentives to engage their cooperation. Instructional Techniques: Teachers are given state-of -the-art classroom technology tools and a multitude of resources to engage, motivate, and push students to high levels of academic achievement. Friendship provides extensive professional development and coaching to help teachers make the shift from a teacher-centered to a student-centered classroom. Teachers are trained to use the three-step \"Gradual Release Model\" as the foundation for differentiating instruction: I Do: The Gradual Release Model begins with a focus on teacher modeling. Students need plenty of opportunities to see an expert - the teacher - at work, interacting with texts and showcasing the thinking that undergirds doing a task well. We Do: Much of classroom instruction takes place in the central area of the Gradual Release Model - The Zone of Proximal Development. \"Teaching in the zone\" relies on scaffolding, support that is integrated into a lesson that guides student learning and prompts effective thinking. You Do: The rationale of the Gradual Release model is the constant attention to ceding increasing responsibility to the students for directing their own learning. Students need regular reminders that the focal point of instruction is to empower them to be able to accomplish important and sophisticated tasks without the support of the teacher and their classmates (Pearson and Gallagher). Pedagogy Used to Support the Friendship Mission: A key feature of the differentiated classroom is that it is student-centered. Shifting the emphasis from the \"teacher and instruction\" focus to the \"student and learning\" focus means redefining the role of the teacher (Tomlinson, Wiggins, and McTighe, 2004). Friendship's professional development program supports teachers in making the shift to managing classrooms that exemplify this set of behaviors. Differentiated classrooms observe the following characteristics: Teachers and students accept and respect one another's similarities and differences. Assessment is an ongoing diagnostic activity that guides instruction. Learning tasks are planned and adjusted based on assessment data. All students participate in respectful work -- work that is challenging, meaningful, interesting, and engaging. The teacher is primarily a coordinator of time, space, and activities, rather than a provider of information. The aim is to help students become self-reliant learners. Students and teachers collaborate in setting class and individual goals. Students work in a variety of group configurations, as well as independently. Flexible grouping is evident. Time is used flexibly in the sense that pacing is varied based on student needs. Students often have choices about topics they wish to study, ways they want to work, and how they want to demonstrate their learning. The teacher uses a variety of strategies to target instruction to student needs. Curriculum Map and Summary The curriculum of Friendship Arkansas has three primary components: 1) a solid foundation of core academic subjects, 2) a world exposure program to prepare students for both extended learning and participation in the global community, and 3) college level coursework connected to career study (for high school students). Instilling students with a strong core education is considered crucial so use of research-based core curriculum materials is partnered with deep training for teachers in a standards-based curriculum implementation process. Objectives, Content for Each Grade, and Rational for Curriculum Selection: Attached Rationale Teachers in schools supported by Friendship are trained to apply the current research on instruction to best meet the needs of the students in their classrooms. Teachers use the \"gradual release of responsibility\" model Page 17 of 45of instruction: I do, We do, You do. The cognitive load is passed from the teacher-as-model to the student for maximum learning (Fisher, Frey, 2008). The learning process starts in a structured manner, generally with a mini-lesson (I do), and becomes less structured as the responsibility transfers from the teacher to the student. The teacher facilitates the guided practice (We do) then releases the responsibility to the students through collaborative and independent work (You do). Teachers are expected to differentiate instruction at every phase based on the needs of their students. Friendship's training program reinforces the idea that proficient teachers use a variety of appropriate instructional strategies based on the standards, lessons, and needs of their students. Friendship supports teachers in making the cognitive shift to become diagnosticians who skillfully determine the appropriate instructional \"prescription\" to ensure that students meet the standards and gradually release responsibility to students for ownership of their learning. Intense professional development is provided to ensure that teachers are equipped with the knowledge and skills to ensure that this happens effectively in each and every classroom. Friendship trains teachers to review the available curriculum resources and develop high-quality learning experiences that ensure that each student will learn as efficiently and effectively as possible. Friendship provides teachers with research-based, common core-aligned program materials form Houghton Mifflin Harcourt so that teachers will have at hand a plethora of resources to support the learning of their individual students. Through differentiated instruction, teachers enable students to achieve outcomes in ways that work best for each learner (Tomlinson, Wiggins, and McTighe, 2004). Friendship-trained teachers are always focused on learning for students at every level. Teachers continually ask the following key questions: How do we know our students are learning? What do we do when students are not learning? What do we do when students have learned? Research The Understanding by Design framework is known to be rigorous, engaging, and effective for the anticipated student population. Some specific research-based components required for the selection of curricular resource materials include: Explicit Strategy Instruction - Students must know, access, and apply specific strategies when reading texts and solving mathematics problems. Research shows that reading comprehension instruction must support students, directly and explicitly, to use the strategies needed to comprehend a text (Cantrell, Almasi, Carter, Rintamaa & Madden, 2010; National Reading Panel, 2000; Hollingsworth and Woodward, 1993). In mathematics, in order to become proficient and fluent with problem-solving, students must efficiently track what they know and how well or poorly an attempt at problem-solving is proceeding (Reyes, Suydam, Lindquist, & Smith, 1998). Writing Across the Content Areas - Students must have the ability to think and write across subject areas to meet the 21st century demands and the college-readiness standards of Common Core. In order to teach these skills, teachers must focus on both process and product (Chapman, 2006), providing students opportunities across the curriculum to process new information and make sense of complex ideas through writing (Knipper & Duggan, 2006). Explicit Strategies for Differentiation and Intervention - It is critical that all students receive access to grade-level content and strategies, while receiving the necessary support and scaffolding through intensive skills-instruction to \"close the gap\" for struggling learners (Au, 2002; Allington & Walmsley, 1995). 8. Describe the process that will be used to ensure all curriculum materials used in the educational program are aligned with the Arkansas Curriculum Frameworks and the state standards as adopted, and periodically revised, by the State Board of Education. Applicant Response: The Friendship Lead curriculum is aligned with national standards. The curriculum will be aligned to the Arkansas Common Core Standards and Arkansas Curriculum Frameworks. Our national team will work to align Page 18 of 45with the standards as required by the state similar to what has been done in DC, Baltimore and Louisiana. The Common Core alignment process links grade level mastery objectives to state standards so that as students master specific course objectives, they are mastering state standards. The steps in the alignment process are as follows: Common Core and Arkansas Frameworks crosswalks are reviewed and studied to understand the shifts. These crosswalks are used as part of the pre-opening professional development where teachers `unpack' the standards to gain a complete picture of the learning expectations for their students. Teachers then work in teams using Curriculum guides to complete their grade level crosswalks as a means of learning what they will teach. Specific training on the instructional program is then provided. Demonstration lessons taught by members of the staff and the Leadership Team help put it all together. Ongoing professional development and coaching by leadership is used to support teachers in the implementation of the education program. 9. Describe the manner in which the school will make provisions for the following student services, even in each area for which a waiver is requested: A) Guidance program; Applicant Response: Friendship Lead will have a guidance counselor (mid-year hire in year one) and access to two community resource specialists/psychologists. They will be devoted to students with mental health and social/emotional challenges and oversee Student Support Services and parent relations. They are supported by classroom teachers and school administrators who will provide input regarding the needs and progress of students needing mental, emotional, and social support. Initial information from enrollment and attendance prompts guidance counselors and mental health providers to talk to the students individually about personal and family needs. Confidential student records are maintained by school counselors and psychologists. Case management includes outreach to parents and extended family members and linkages to community resources and service providers. B) Health services; Applicant Response: The school will comply with all state laws regarding staffing in this area. A nurse will manage all distribution of medication, train staff as needed to keep students safe (food allergies, etc.), manage student medical information in full compliance with all relevant privacy statutes, and advise the principal in the creation of necessary medical policies. The school nurse will work daily and will coordinates delivery of health services and will contribute to the professional development of school personnel as colleagues. The school's health service program shall insure administrative and office staff members will be trained in emergency procedures, first aid, CPR and administration of medicine. The nurse may also teach some health education. He or she will coordinate with local agencies, hospitals, physicians, and organizations that have as their missions to improve children's or community health in order to make sure that all students have access to the care that they need. Page 19 of 45C) Media center; Applicant Response: The school will not have a media center when it opens, and we have applied for a waiver from the staffing requirement. Instead, the school will open a computer lab so that students have access to the Internet for basic research. Additionally the school will use Scholastic Read 180 as a reading intervention software and provide classroom libraries in all classes. D) Special education; Applicant Response: The special education programs at Friendship are well-aligned with the Least Restrictive Environment (LRE) requirements under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Improvement Act (IDEA: Section 300.114- 300.117 and 300.320). Specifically, during the 2016-2017 school year, each campus will provide a continuum of services (inclusion and resource), which is the cornerstone of IDEA. Friendship offers a program that includes both instructional support and related services that are determined by the team to ensure that students meet academic and social goals. For instance, visually impaired students receive Orientation & Mobility (O&M) services and students with autism receive Applied Behavioral Analysis (ABA) support. Finally, specialized self- contained programs are available within the LEA to students who have disabilities that require a more restrictive setting. Except in rare instances when it is not in the best interest of the student, s/he is given opportunities to be successful with appropriate supports starting with an inclusion setting and moving only to a more restrictive educational setting when data and input from the Special Education team members require it. The final decision about a student's ability to make progress within the school-based setting is the responsibility of the team. There are multiple methods for making a determination about the student's location and placement of services. The IEP can be enhanced to include additional supports or supplemental services, or the IEP team can request support from the Academic Affairs Office to conduct a panel review of the student's file and provide additional programming ideas. In the event that the team does not feel that the student's current setting is adequately meeting his or her needs, the student, either by parent or school request, can appeal to the board to have the student placed into a more restrictive, out-of-general education setting. The final decision about the student's next continuum of placement is made by the IEP team in conjunction with members of the Office of Academic Affairs SPED Leadership Team. E) Transportation; Applicant Response: Friendship will provide transportation for students as required. Inspired by models of successful community- based schools nationwide, Friendship will encourage students and families to carpool as much as possible through such means as an online carpool \"board\" for students and families to connect. Friendship will initiate discussions with the appropriate officials to negotiate transportation options, including transportation for students with special needs. Friendship may also contract with a third-party vendor, such as First Student, to manage daily transportation for all students. F) Alternative education, including Alternative Learning Environments; Applicant Response: It is the intention and commitment of the founders of Friendship Lead to educate all students who choose our school. We will make necessary accommodations for students who need support beyond that provided by the general curriculum accommodation program. The guidance program, our devotion to parallel cultures of respect Page 20 of 45and achievement, and our arts infusion all help us connect with students who are struggling and make them successful. We will seek to meet individual needs with individual plans as needed. At times, this may include steps such as providing students with an aide, making space available for small groups, or offering extra help. If a student's needs are such that his or her special education team recommends an out-of-district placement, we will follow all laws to ensure that the student's rights are always protected. A waiver is being requested. G) English Language Learner (ELL) instruction Applicant Response: Friendship is accustomed to accommodating students with multiple levels of ability and multiple learning styles in one classroom. The curriculum supports teachers in internalizing and gaining ownership over its content by guiding their thinking as they make instructional decisions about how best to lead the full range of students in their classrooms to achieve the rigor of the standards as measured by their post-assessments. To support the development of their units and daily lesson plans, Friendship adopts curricular resource materials that are aligned to Common Core State Standards. H) Gifted and Talented Program. Applicant Response: The environment that meets the needs of high needs students also provides appropriate learning opportunities for gifted students. The curriculum and culture of Friendship promote student success and reward teachers for results. Friendship believes that academic success starts with adults who commit to changing the school and its uses a performance-based compensation system. Tracking the behavior and outcome metrics of teachers and administrators is an integral part of Friendship's performance management system which uses a data tracking system as a platform for administrator and teacher accountability. Per extensive research conducted by Perna in 2002, programs targeting low income students for academic success must contain the following critical components to be successful: creation of a culture with college completion expected of all, rigorous academic experiences, parental involvement in the education and college preparation process, early facilitation of course selection and career planning, and, eventually, college visits. the Gifted and Talented Program at Friendship contains all five elements. 10. Describe the geographical area to be served by the charter. List all school districts within the geographical area likely to be affected by the open-enrollment public charter school. Applicant Response: Friendship Lead will be an open-enrollment public charter school; therefore, we could draw students from anywhere in the state. The school will be located within the city limits of Little Rock, and will be located within the boundaries of the Little Rock School District. It is anticipated that Friendship Lead will receive most of its students from the Little Rock, North Little Rock and Pulaski County Special School Districts; some students may also be received from the Benton and Bryant School Districts. The maximum enrollment in the first five (5) years of the charter will be 450 students. According to the 2014-2015 enrollment information housed on the Department of Education Data Center's website, there were 23,363 students enrolled in the Little Rock School District; 8,576 students enrolled in the North Little Rock School District; 16,592 students enrolled in the Pulaski County Special School District; 5,000 students enrolled in the Benton School District, and 9,017 students enrolled in the Bryant School District. At its five (5) year maximum enrollment, it is estimated that up to 300 students would come to Friendship Lead Academy from the Little Rock School District; up to 75 students from the Pulaski County Special School District; up to 55 students from the North Little Rock School District, and up to 20 students from the Benton and Bryant School Districts combined. Page 21 of 45 It is possible that Friendship Lead will enroll students who currently attend private schools or who are home schooled students, thus further reducing the impact to the named school districts. 11. Describe the plan for the school officials to provide an annual report to parents, the community, and the authorizer that demonstrates the progress made by the charter school during any previous academic year in meeting its academic performance objectives. ( See ADE Rules Governing Standards for Accreditation of Arkansas Public Schools and School Districts.) Applicant Response: Friendship will report annual school-wide progress on high stakes, state-mandated assessments to the school community each year. This report will be made available to parents during open houses and back-to-school nights, on the school website, and also to any parent or community member requesting the information. Promotion and graduation criteria will be communicated regularly to parents and students. At the beginning of the school year, they will receive information regarding promotion and graduation requirements during orientation and open house sessions. In addition, parents will learn about student progress toward promotion throughout the school year by way of report cards and parent-teacher conferences. Shorter reports on the school's progress will reach parents and the community through school newsletters, which will include general progress reports as well as the NCLB-mandated school report card. Moreover, the school will post its performance in common areas of the school, including the main office and front hallways for parents and community members to see. The school will publish an Annual Report in compliance with ADE Rules reflecting academic progress for the previous year and progress towards meeting network goals. 12. Describe the enrollment criteria and recruitment processes, that will provide an equal opportunity for all parents and students to learn about and apply for admission to the proposed public charter school. Applicant Response: Friendship Lead will enroll students based on preference and lottery status. The lottery will be held on or about April 1, each year. In accordance with federal laws, no student will be denied admission based on race, ethnicity, national origin, gender, disability, aptitude, or athletic ability. The school shall be open to any child who is eligible under the laws of the state of Arkansas. New students will be admitted each year without regard to prior measures of achievement or aptitude, athletic ability, disability, ethnicity, race, creed, gender. national origin, religion or ancestry. Enrollment Process The School will accept applications for enrollment up until the deadline, approximately April 1. All applicants will be included in the lottery. The following preferences will be honored in the enrollment process: a. Siblings of current students - Students who share a common parent, either biologically or legally through Page 23 of 45Describe procedures for conducting the an annual single lottery enrollment process, including the timeline for enrolling, the date of the lottery, and the way in which students will be placed on waiting lists, and the process for notifying parents about each child's selection or order on the waiting list. Explain how the charter will ensure that the lottery process is transparent to the public. Applicant Response: If a school receives more enrollment forms than available seats, the school will conduct a randomized lottery, as required by law, in early April. This lottery must be observed or conducted by an outside third party. Students who meet the previously stated preference criteria are exempted from this lottery. These exempted students are then taken out of the lottery and are then enrolled in their grade, thus lowering the target lottery enrollment number for that grade. All other students who have applied to enroll in the grade for which there is to be a lottery are assigned a lottery number. Lottery numbers will be randomly pulled and assigned seats. Student names are then matched back to their lottery numbers. This process is repeated for all applicable grades. All students whose lottery number fall within the target number are enrolled. All other students are placed, in order, onto a waitlist. In the event that applications exceed open seats and a lottery process is necessary to determine enrollment, all names will be drawn in order to create a priority-ranked waiting list to be used for future enrollment in the same school year. If and when there are openings at Friendship Lead, students will be pulled first from the waiting list based on priority order until all seats are filled. Following the lottery, letters will be mailed to all the families in the lottery confirming they received a seat and to enroll or to notify of their waitlist status. Students on the waitlist are contacted as a seat in their grade becomes available. Enrollment is by blind lottery with no pre-screening and no post-lottery interviews. All students are welcome to apply to the school. Friendship Lead maintains a sibling policy for siblings of currently enrolled students. Siblings are eligible for preferential status, which permits the student to pre-empt other students from the general lottery based on available seats. All families will attend a school orientation prior to the beginning of the school year. Because we have a non-exclusive, open enrollment lottery, and blind admissions policy, with no pre-screening interview process, the majority of our students will be a direct reflection of the socio and economic demographics of the neighborhood. Friendship Lead shall admit students of any race, color, national origin, and ethnic origin and every student shall enjoy all rights, privileges, programs, and activities generally accorded or made available to students at the school. It shall not discriminate on the basis of race, color, national origin, gender, disability and ethnic origin in administration of its educational policies, admission policies, and all other school-administered programs. We will employ various methods to publicly announce the application/enrollment period and will communicate our desire to serve both English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The application form along with all dates and deadlines for the submission of new applicants for available grades will be posted on our school website. Hard copies of the application will be available at the school or by mail upon request. Community-outreach is an important element of our marketing and mission. We will distribute informational materials to the Head Start locations and day cares throughout Little Rock and surrounding areas, local businesses including libraries, community centers, and faith-based organizations. During the entire year, including the application and enrollment period, our offices will be open from 7 a.m. to 5 p.m. where we accept both phone calls and in-person inquiries from interested parents. Once a student has been accepted to the school, a registration packet is given to the parents for completion. The packet consist of a student directory form (which collects emergency contact information in addition to demographic information), health assessment form, release of records from previous school, transportation request/information, media release, birth certificate, social security card, immunization records, parent/guardian identification, Free and Reduced lunch application, and any other required documentation by the State of Arkansas. Families have several weeks to accept their admission to the school. Any unfilled spots will be given to students on the waitlist. Page 24 of 45If it is believed that the use of a weighted lottery is required by federal court or administrative order, explain and furnish a copy of the order. Applicant Response: A weighted lottery is not necessary. Applicant Response:13. Name any founders or board members of the proposed charter's sponsoring entity, management company staff, and/or leaders of the proposed charter who have any prior involvement in the operation of one or more other charter schools and complete a Prior Charter Involvement template for each individual listed. The Prior Charter Involvement template includes Donald Hense, Patricia Brantley, and Kimberly Williams of Friendship Education Foundation. Page 28 of 45assumptions consistent with past practice. After the budget is adopted, the finance team will meet monthly with the school leader to review actual accounting data, any revenue and expense changes that have occurred, and update its forecast model for the balance of the year. In the event the forecast is worse than the budget, the finance team will work with the principal to identify expense reductions (e.g., non-personnel expense reductions that are least critical to academic performance, non-replacement of any open positions, staff reductions, and use of contingency) that would re-balance the forecast. As part of this process, school educational priorities are always taken into account to minimize any negative educational effects from a budget shortfall. In the event that the forecast is better than budget, the finance team will work with the school leader to determine if the additional resources should be re-deployed on current year priorities or saved for future year. 4th Sector's finance team has extensive experience supporting school leaders in this process, having conducted hundreds of such monthly budget reviews over 15+ years. The board will then receive a standard monthly financial reporting package that will include a financial dashboard (that included income statement, balance sheet, enrollment and staffing indicators), a contextual narrative summary of the school's finances, a year to date budget vs. actual comparison, a revised forecast for the balance of the year, a balance sheet and monthly cash flow projection. This financial package will be reviewed in detail by the board treasurer or finance committee prior to each monthly board meeting. Any proposed actions to re-balance the operating budget will be reviewed and discussed with the board finance committee. Complete the budget template showing a balanced budget with realistic expectations of revenue and expenditures. Provide the minimum number of students who must attend the charter in order for the school to be financially viable. Describe the method used to calculate this number. Tell who made the calculations and describe the financial expertise of the individuals who assisted in this assessment. Describe the contingency plan if fewer students than necessary for financial viability enroll before the first day of school. Provide a detailed explanation of the ways in which the charter leaders will provide the education program outlined in the application to fewer students that determined necessary for financial viability or a date certain by which charter leaders will notify the parents, leaders of surrounding districts and open-enrollment charters, and staff at the Arkansas Department of Education that the school will not open as anticipated. Explain how charter leaders will provide the education program outlined in the application if enough students for financial viability enroll and are admitted but fail to arrive when school begins. Describe preparations to pay for any unexpected, but necessary and possibly urgent expenses. Applicant Response: The budget template is included as Attachment E. In the experience of Friendship Education Foundation - whose team has managed charter schools in several states over 15+ years -- a minimum of 100 students is necessary to operate a financially viable school. This level of enrollment enables the school to have a full-time administrator who is not also a teacher, pay for the facility expenses, and have a base of enrollment from which to expand additional grades in the future. Friendship has a detailed, 300+ line start-up plan that will be implemented commencing in January 2016. Its Page 29 of 45components include teacher recruiting and professional development, curriculum and FF&E purchasing, human resources policies and employee benefits, financial systems and insurance, and most importantly, student recruiting. Friendship Arkansas's student recruiting efforts will be tracked daily, and during weekly calls the start-up team will update its projection for opening day enrollment so that the appropriate number of teaching positions will be filled. Friendship Arkansas would seek to confirm its decision to open, based on projected enrollment, prior to the end of the previous school year. In the event of a budget shortfall attributable to lower than expected student enrollment, Friendship Arkansas would seek to reduce non-mission critical non-personnel expenses, and adjust its staffing level to match the actual enrollment experienced. The Friendship Education Foundation would also consider deferring its management fee until a time when enrollment had stabilized, or even advancing a working capital loan to Friendship Arkansas to maintain academic program integrity. This flexibility also would enable Friendship Arkansas to handle any unexpected or urgent expenses. 16. Describe the manner in which an annual audit of the financial and programmatic operations of the school will be conducted. If the school wishes to request that the authorizer allow a licensed accountant or licensed certified public accountant, rather than the Legislative Auditor, to perform the first-year audit, identify the accountant by name, firm, address, and phone number. The named accountant must meet the requirements of ADE Rules Governing Publicly Funded Educational Institution Audit Requirements, including the prohibition on auditors providing non-audit services (such as accounting or consulting services) to auditees. A school's preference as stated in this application may not be changed without prior approval of the authorizer. Applicant Response: Friendship Arkansas will use the Arkansas Public School Computer Network. In addition, the 4th Sector finance team has extensive experience complying with generally accepted accounting principles and providing financial information to authorizers and other government authorities in the proper format. Friendship Arkansas plans to have the Legislative Auditor perform is first-year audit, and thereafter retain a third party audit firm experienced in independent charter school audits to review the school's financial information and adherence to the school's financial policies, and express an opinion on the financial statements. The independent audit report shall also include a report to management detailing any issues and corrective action needed. The board of directors will exercise its oversight responsibilities by reviewing the periodic financial reports, requesting additional information as needed to understand the school's financial position fully and question any procedures or items on the financial statements. The board will select a treasurer with knowledge of finance or accounting, and that person will lead the Board's finance committee. The treasurer and finance committee will ensure that the board monitors the school's finances. The school will perform a series of reconciliations, including monthly bank account reconciliations, throughout the year to ensure that employees are being paid their agreed upon amounts, that amounts paid are consistent with forecasted expenditures, that all payments to vendors are fully recorded in the school's accounting system and that all cash receipts are both recorded and consistent with amounts owed to it by state, federal, and local sources. The school will keep track of expenditures that meet its capitalization thresholds, and will perform periodic inventories to ensure that the school has proper control over these physical assets. The finance team will also conduct a mid-year internal audit to ensure accurate accounting and adherence to the school's adopted fiscal policies. The board will utilize the following fiscal controls and financial management policies to remain informed and oversee the school's financial position: Page 31 of 4518. Describe the facilities to be used. Give the present use of the facility. If the facility to be used for the school is a facility of a school district, describe the terms established by the local school board of the district stipulating the relationship between the proposed public charter school and the district pertaining to the use of the facility. Attach a copy of the agreement, signed by the president of the local school board, the chair or president of the governing body of the proposed open-enrollment public charter school, and the chief operating officer of the proposed charter. If the facility is not operated by a school district, attach a copy of the Facilities Utilization Agreement, signed by the entity owning or operating the facility and the chief operating officer of the proposed charter. A proposed lease may also be submitted but is not required. Please note that any lease or other debt must be approved by the Commissioner of Education. Applicant Response: Friendship Lead will seek to open a school in the 2017-18 school year, and the appropriate facilities agreements will be completed prior to July 1, 2016.Page 33 of 45(A) Any other individual specifically identified by name in Section A of the application; (B) Any individual or entity with whom the sponsoring entity or charter school has contracted, or intends to contract, to provide any services or products for the proposed charter school; and/or (C) The owner(s) of the facilities to be used. For the purpose of this prompt, an individual has a financial relationship with another individual or entity if he or she: (1) Receives compensation or benefits directly or indirectly from the entity or individual; (2) Is an officer, director, partner, employee, or owner of more than 5% of the shares of an entity that is a corporation, partnership, sole proprietorship, or LLC; and/or (3) Has a family member (spouse, sibling, parent or child, or the spouse employee, or owner of more than 5% of the shares of an entity that is a corporation, partnership, sole proprietorship, or LLC. 19. For each and every individual specifically identified by name in Section A of the application (the contact person, chief operating officer, board members, and other individuals), identify any family or financial relationship which may exist between that individual and: Applicant Response: None.Page 34 of 45Explain the procedures to be followed if a conflict of interest is identified. The procedures must ensure that all actions are in the best interest of the school and the students at the school. Applicant Response: Friendship Arkansas plans to adopt the following Conflict of Interest Policy. 1. Purpose. The purpose of the conflict of interest policy is to protect the Corporation's interest when it is contemplating entering into a transaction or arrangement that might benefit the private interest of an officer or director of the Corporation. This policy is intended to supplement but not replace any applicable state and federal laws governing conflict of interest applicable to nonprofit and charitable organizations or to charter schools. 2. Definitions. (a) Interested Person: Any director, executive officer, or member of a committee with Board of Directors delegated powers, who has a direct or indirect financial interest, as defined below, is an interested person. (b) Financial Interest: A person has a financial interest if the person has, directly or indirectly, through business, investment, or family: i. An ownership or investment interest in any entity with which the Corporation has a transaction or arrangement, ii. A compensation arrangement with any entity or individual with which the Corporation has a transaction or arrangement, or iii. A potential ownership or investment interest, other than de minimis, in, or compensation arrangement with, any entity or individual with which the Corporation is negotiating a transaction or arrangement. Compensation includes direct and indirect remuneration as well as gifts or favors that are not insubstantial. 3. Procedures. (a) Duty to Disclose. In connection with any actual or possible conflict of interest, an interested person must disclose the existence of a financial interest and be given the opportunity to disclose all material facts to the directors and members of committees with Board delegated powers considering the proposed transaction or arrangement (b) Determining Whether a Conflict of Interest Exists. A financial interest is not necessarily a conflict of interest. A person who has a financial interest may have a conflict of interest only if the Board or committee decides that a conflict of interest exists. After disclosure of the financial interest and all material facts, and after any discussion with the interested person, he/she shall leave the Board or committee meeting while the determination of a conflict of interest is discussed and voted upon. The remaining Board or committee members shall decide if a conflict of interest exists. (c) Procedures for Addressing a Conflict of Interest. i. An interested person may make a presentation at the Board or committee meeting, but after the presentation, he/she shall leave the meeting during the discussion of, and the vote on, the transaction or arrangement involving the possible conflict of interest, ii. The chairperson of the Board or committee shall, if appropriate, appoint a disinterested person or committee to investigate alternatives to the proposed transaction or arrangement, iii. After exercising due diligence, the Board or committee shall determine whether the Corporation can obtain with reasonable efforts a more advantageous transaction or arrangement from a person or entity that would not give rise to a conflict of interest. Page 35 of 45iv. If a more advantageous transaction or arrangement is not reasonably possible under circumstances not producing a conflict of interest, the Board or committee shall determine by a majority vote of the disinterested directors whether the transaction or arrangement is in the Corporation's best interest, for its own benefit, and whether it is fair and reasonable. In conformity with the above determination it shall make its decision as to whether to enter into the transaction or arrangement. v. All such transactions or arrangements shall be reviewed by the Board every six months for the duration of the transaction/arrangement. 4. Violations of the Conflicts of Interest Policy. (a) If the Board or committee has reasonable cause to believe a director has failed to disclose actual or possible conflicts of interest, it shall inform the director of the basis for such belief and afford the director an opportunity to explain the alleged failure to disclose. (b) If, after hearing the director's response and after making further investigation as warranted by the circumstances, the Board or committee determines the director has failed to disclose an actual or possible conflict of interest, it shall take appropriate disciplinary and corrective action. 5. Records of Proceedings. The minutes of the Board and all committees with board delegated powers shall contain: (a) The names of the persons who disclosed or otherwise were found to have a financial interest in connection with an actual or possible conflict of interest, the nature of the financial interest, any action taken to determine whether a conflict of interest was present, and the Board's or committee's decision as to whether a conflict of interest in fact existed. (b) The names of the persons who were present for discussions and votes relating to the transaction or arrangement, the content of the discussion, including any alternatives to the proposed transaction or arrangement, and a record of any votes taken in connection with the proceedings. 6. Compensation. (a) A voting director of the Board who receives compensation, directly or indirectly, from the Corporation for goods or services is precluded from voting on matters pertaining to that member's compensation. (b) A voting director of any committee whose jurisdiction includes compensation matters and who receives compensation, directly or indirectly, from the Corporation for goods or services is precluded from voting on matters pertaining to that member's compensation. 7. Annual Statements. Each director, executive officer and member of a committee with Board delegated powers shall annually sign a statement which affirms such person: (a) Has received a copy of the conflicts of interest policy, (b) Has read and understands the policy, (c) Has agreed to comply with the policy, and (d) Understands the Corporation is charitable and in order to maintain its federal tax exemption it must engage primarily in activities which accomplish one or more of its tax-exempt purposes. Page 36 of 458. Periodic Reviews. To ensure the Corporation operates in a manner consistent with charitable purposes and does not engage in activities that could jeopardize its tax-exempt status, periodic reviews shall be conducted. The periodic reviews shall, at a minimum, include the following subjects: (a) Whether compensation arrangements and benefits are reasonable, based on competent survey information, and the result of arm's length bargaining. (b) Whether partnerships, joint ventures, and arrangements with management organizations conform to the Corporation's written policies, are properly recorded, reflect reasonable investment or payments for goods and services, further charitable purposes and do not result in inurement, impermissible private benefit or in an excess benefit transaction. 9. Use of Outside Experts. When conducting the periodic reviews as provided for in Article 8, the Corporation may, but need not, use outside advisors. If outside experts are used, their use shall not relieve the Board of its responsibility for ensuring periodic reviews are conducted. 20. Describe the manner in which the school will make provisions for food services. State whether the proposed charter school will apply to participate in the federal National School Lunch program or other federal nutrition programs. Applicant Response: Friendship Arkansas will contract with a qualified foodservice vendor to provide high-quality meals for breakfast, lunch, and after school snacks that meet or exceed all requirements of the National School Lunch Program (NSLP). The contracting process will comply with all applicable federal (U.S.D.A.) and state regulations. Healthy nutritional standards are important to Friendship and the school will use grants and partnerships to provide additional health education and high quality food standards. Page 37 of 4521. Describe how the parents or guardians of the enrolled students and other members of the community will be involved with the school to positively impact the charter school's educational programs. Applicant Response: Parental Involvement Parents will have a voice working with the board and principal through the school Parent Action Committee (PAC). The committee will help bring parents into the fold by fostering formal and informal opportunities to engage with school staff, other parents and other community members on school programming. The Parent Action Committee will provide opportunities for all parents to be an active part of the school's culture and model the core values. There will also be leadership opportunities within the PAC. In addition to PAC participation, parents sign a pledge committing to responsibilities as a member of our school community. Similarly, all parents will be encouraged to participate as volunteers within the school. The input we receive from the various stakeholders of our school will drive the success of the academic program, as students, parents, and community members alike will need to support our mission if we are to be successful as a school. Students will spend over seven hours a day in school; but once they leave our campus, it will be up to the community and their parents/guardians to reinforce the academic program and the core values that we have worked hard to instill during the school day. If we want to count on the school's stakeholders to work with us to instill these values in our children, we must measure the extent to which those people believe we are succeeding. As this school will be a school of choice, parents and students who choose the school will be aware of our mission and what we hope to accomplish; therefore, it will be up to us to follow through on that promise. Friendship will keep potential parents and other community members abreast of the school's development through local community meetings, parent meetings and regular communication with community stakeholders. In order to engage and mobilize the school's community, Friendship will openly discuss and disseminate the mission and design of the school. Feedback from these community members will support the development of the programming as well as support student and staff recruitment efforts. Friendship Lead will forge strong relationships between the home, school, and the community as a means of reducing barriers to student achievement. Research has shown that when parents are involved in their children's education, the attitudes, behaviors, and achievement of students are positively enhanced. Having a campus that is inviting and practicing consistent inclusion of parents in practical and tangible ways will be key to maintaining strong partnerships that ultimately benefit students. Friendship Lead will implement two major parent engagement strategies. Parent Advisory Board: The Parent Advisory Board will be an organization that will bring parents and teachers together to promote the education and welfare of our children. The organization will raise funds for school supplies, educate parents, and help teachers to ensure that every child gets a high-quality education. Through the council, parents will have an avenue to organize and support the school in meaningful ways while also having a voice in the development of certain school-wide policies. The board will have officers, elections, and is open to all parents, guardians, and care-takers of students enrolled in our school. Parent Workshops: The goal of parent workshops is to educate and empower parents as partners, advocates and lifelong teachers in their child's education through educational courses and leadership opportunities. Through these offerings, parents will have the opportunity to learn about various strategies to support the academic success of their children. Friendship will also intertwine elements of personal and professional growth for parents including topics such as financial literacy and health & wellness. In addition to those strategies, we will implement the following positive engagement practices: Mobile Parent App Annual Open House and Back to School Night Quarterly Learning Contract Days Honors/Core Values Awards Assemblies Quarterly Parent Newsletter Page 38 of 45 Data Nights Parent Volunteer Program Annual Parent Surveys 22. Describe the potential impact of the proposed public charter school on the efforts of affected public school district(s) to comply with court orders and statutory obligations to create and maintain a unitary system of desegregated public schools. Applicant Response: Friendship Lead will locate its open-enrollment charter school in Little Rock, Arkansas within the boundaries of the Little Rock School District. Friendship Lead expects to obtain most of its students from within the boundaries of the Little Rock School District with the remaining students coming from North Little Rock and Pulaski County. Friendship Lead is required by Ark, Code Ann. Section 6-23-106 to carefully review the potential impacts its opening would have upon the efforts of the school district to comply with court orders and statutory obligations to create and maintain a unitary system of desegregated public schools. In conducting its review, Friendship Lead has substantiated that the Little Rock School District (LRSD) and North Little Rock School District (NLRSD) have been found by the Federal District to be unitary in all respects to their school operations. The Pulaski County Special School District (PCSSD) has been determined by the Federal District Court to be unitary in all respects concerning inter-district student assignment. The importance of the attainment of unitary status of the LRSD and NLRSD and the status of PCCSD as unitary in the area of inter-district student assignment is that those school districts have no further obligations to comply with court orders in these areas. Therefore, the granting of an open-enrollment public charter for Friendship Lead cannot be said to have a negative impact on the LRSD, NLRSD, and PCCSD's ability to comply with the districts court orders or statutory obligations to create and maintain a unitary system of desegregated public schools. Friendship Lead is requesting an enrollment cap f 450 students. According to the 2014-2015 school year enrollment figures (the latest school year for which official enrollment figures are available) as maintained by the ADE Data Center, the PCSSD had a student population of 16,592 students, the NLRSD had a student population of 8,576 students; and the LRSD had a student population of 23,363 students. Ark Code Ann. Section 6-23-106 requires that Friendship Lead must be race-neutral and non-discriminatory in its student selection and admission processes, so it is not possible to accurately project racial composition. Ark. Code Ann. Section 6-23-106 also requires that Friendship Lead's operation not serve to hamper, delay or in any manner negatively affect the desegregation efforts of a public school district or districts within the state. Friendship Lead's careful review of the relevant statutes and court orders affecting the 3 Pulaski County School districts and the student populations of such shows that such negative effect is not present here. In January 2014 Federal District Judge D. P. Marshall Jr. accepted a Settlement Agreement which effectively concluded the desegregation case (Little Rock School District et al. v. North Little Rock School District et al., Lorene Joshua et al., Arkansas Virtual Academy, et al. Case NO. 4:82-CV-866-DPM, U.S. District Court Eastern Division of Arkansas Western Division) involving the three (3) Pulaski County School Districts. One of the provisions of the Settlement Agreement was the voluntary dismissal with prejudice of its appeal to the Eighth District Court of Appeals concerning charter school issues. In conclusion, Friendship Lead submits that upon the basis of its review, neither any existing federal District Court desegregation order affecting the NLRSD, LRSD, or PCSSD, nor the Settlement Agreement prohibit the State's charter school authorizer from granting a new charter for an open-enrollment public charter school in LRSD/ Pulaski County.

Applicant Response: The Friendship Arkansas board will enter into a management agreement with Friendship Education Foundation. The agreement is performance-based, sand the management organization will be required to ensure the Friendship Lead students make substantial academic progress and the school otherwise operates in compliance with applicable rules and regulations. The management organization will be represented at monthly meetings of the Friendship Arkansas board. At those meetings it will report on the school's academic, financial and operational performance, and solicit feedback for performance improvements. The board will evaluate the school leader as well as the management organization (and any back-office subcontractors) on an annual basis, using an established set of rubrics and evaluation instruments. An important factor in Friendship's long term success is human capital development, including the development of a school leadership pipeline that will ensure long-term school leadership stability within Friendship Arkansas. Friendship will tap into its multi-state network of schools to attract the highest potential leaders to Friendship Lead, and will invest significantly in the professional development of the teachers and leaders at Friendship Lead. This training will include attendance at Friendship's leadership development programs in Washington DC as well as attendance in the Relay Graduate School of Education's school leader training programs. Friendship Education Foundation's roots in the Friendship Public Charter School organization are deep. Its 15 year track record of delivering outstanding student achievement performance serving the lowest-income, most at-risk populations is one of stability, commitment to excellence, and long-term organizational success.

CHARTER INTERNAL REVIEW COMMITTEE REVIEW AND APPLICANT RESPONSES1 Future School of Fort Smith PRE-APPLICATION MATERIALS The Arkansas Department of Education requires that all applicants submit a Letter of Intent, outlining a general description of the proposed charter school. Evaluation Criteria: A Letter of Intent filed with Arkansas Department of Education on time and including all the necessary information Fully Responsive PART B EXECUTIVE SUMMARY The Arkansas Department of Education requires all applicants to include an executive summary. Evaluation Criteria: A mission statement (with content to be evaluated for Prompt #3 of Part C); and The key programmatic features of the proposed charter school Fully Responsive Concerns and Additional Questions Explain in detail how personalized learning plan s will be developed using appropriate assessment tools . Applicant Response: Each student will have a personal learning plan that addresses his/her interests and academic, career, and personal (including social -emotional) competencies, simultaneously aligning with the Common Core State Standards (CCSS) , Arkansas Curriculum Frameworks and graduation requirements. At the beginning of a student's career at Future School, his/her learning team, led by an advisor from intake to graduation, assesses the stud ent's current aptitudes, interests and mastery level of academic, c areer and personal objectives, t hrough assessments such as the Myer's Briggs personality test, the NWEA subject-level MAP test and the College and Work Readiness Assessment (CCRA) designed by the Council for Financial Aid to Education. To support the development and implementation of personalized learning plans for Future School students, school leaders and advisors will receive support from educational partner, Big Picture Learning. (See at tached document ) The learning team, including the student, advisor, parent and other instructors, utilize the assessment data and input from the student and parents to design the learning plan which includes a description of the learning opportunities students pursue, including projects , workshops, courses (face -to-face, 2 online and concurrent ), internships, and lectures; a detailed specification of tasks to be accomplished; and a plan for documenting learning. Responding to questions like ' What are my goals this semester? For the year? By graduation? After graduation?' and 'How can my core/elective coursework help me reach my goals?' the team helps the student set learning goals for the semester. With the end goals for the student in mind, the team designs a plan for the student to identify activities, resources, deadlines and partnerships needed to accomplish their goals. Assignments and objectives from all courses (core and electives) are integrated into the learning plan in addition to objectives and deliverables from the student's internship project. To develop student portfolios, advisors consult with students on a weekly basis, parents and mentors provide feedback monthly and the learning team meets at the end of each semester to gauge and celebrat e student progress , which is illustrated in semester grades on each student's transcript . By integrating all the student's learning activities, the learning plan allows the student to create a personalized plan for learning and value coursework as an oppor tunity to reinforce and develop relevant skills and understanding. Students will build and own their learning plans, becoming responsible and accountable for their learning, personal growth and post -high school planning with the support of their advisors , parents, and mentors. Students will monitor their progress towards academic and real -world learning goals through their personalized learning plan that culminates in a final student portfolio. Designed by the learning team (student, advisor, parents and mentor), the portfolio is a collection of student work that is updated and showcased each semester and during the final exhibition in 12th grade , complementing the student's final transcript . The learning plan is also a tool that supports the implement ation of students requiring an Individualized Education Plan (IEP). During the real -world lab time, advisors meet with students and members of learning team to evaluate progress and refine the plan on an on -going basis.

Discuss growth expectations for students performing below grade level who need accelerated instruction and growth to get on pace to graduate. Confirm that alternative assessments that will be used to assess students with disabilities, as outlined in Individualized Education Programs (IEPs). Applicant Response: To clarify, Future School students will meet or exceed the state averages in mathematics, science and English language arts achievement. Students below grade level will be supported in multiple ways. Through the use of a personalized learning plan, which includes monitoring growth in real world performance indicators, students will be challenged and m otivated to increase their below grade level performance. Through their internships and time with advisors, the amount of individualized time spent with meaningful adults will assure an increase in their achievemen t. As mentioned previously, the real world lab will be critical to the supportive role of the advisor for all academic deficiencies and difficulties. As well, the increased application of knowledg e as documented in student port folios will assure the increase of support to make sure growth is accelerated and sustained. Through an emphasis on personalization, including any intervention such as additional class time, tutoring outside of school, etc ., Future School will meet the nee ds of any students with disabilities including the utilization of alternative assessments, modifications and accommodations. Finally, our real world learning approach also focuses on other highly valued competencies that are often not addressed systematic ally in traditional high schools.

Led by First National Bank of Fort Smith Presi- dent Sam Sicard, the group cited concerns of addition- al costs and \"the further division of our commu- nity\" in a letter to the su- perintendent. The group's suggested alternative was \"expansion and reinvest- ment in our two existing high schools.\" \"I guess the push-back we had from certain mem- bers of the community put the potential high school on the back burner,\" Wade s a i d .\" B u ti fw ed ot h a to n a permanent basis, we've got to do something with our existing facilities.\" Wade referred to the latest proposal as a \"large group of projects that are going to cost significant sums of money.\" \" I nt h i sc a s ei fw e ' r eg o - ing to follow the lead of some of these members of this community to try to expand existing facili- ties,\" he said, \"we're going to have to have significant financial help from the community by way of a millage increase.\"In other business, the school board voted 4-2 supporting the first read- ing of an updated policy governing the community use of school facilities that adds a \"viewpoint neutral\" stance on nonschool-relat- ed events. The policy states, \"The use of Fort Smith Public School facilities by non- school organizations shall be viewpoint neutral\" and \"in no way imply endorse- ment of the beliefs or goals of the organization.\" School Board President Deanie Mehl and board member Susan McFerran voted against the mea- sure. In the past Mehl has suggested prohibiting partisan rallies on school grounds.NEWSTIMES RECORD 3A TUESDAY, JUNE 23, 2015 ARKANSAS GLASS & MIRROR CO.

Se- bastian County Emergen- cy Man- agement Director Jeff Turn- er said the county's Search and Rescue Unit, along with other local authori- ties are looking for Wil- liam Darrell Buchanan of Fort Smith, who was re- ported missing June 16. Buchanan is described as a white male with black hair and brown eyes in his early 50s, possibly 51, Turnersaid.Heisabout 5 feet, 11 inches tall and weighs about 180 pounds. He was last seen walk- ing in the Fianna Hills area, Turner said. Turner said crews are searching the wooded ar- eas near Fianna Hills and the surrounding areas be- tween Arkansas 253 and U.S. 271. Turner said it was un- sure if the man has a his- tory of mental illness or is in need of medication. A missing persons re- port was filed with the Fort Smith Police Depart- ment, he said, adding he encouraged those with any knowledge about Bu- chanan to call the police at 709-5116. Buchanan INDUCTEES : First Group Honored Formed After Faubus Closed High Schools H a t t i eC a r a w a y ,t h ef i r s t woman elected to the U.S. Senate. Hester Davis, a leader in the development of cultural resources management leg- islation and programs who blazed a trail for women in archaeology. Roberta Fulbright, a for- mer publisher of the North- west Arkansas Times who championed the University of Arkansas, fought cor- ruption and advocated for women's equality. The first organization to be inducted is: Women's Emergency Committee to Open Our Schools, or WEC, whichwas formed in Little Rock in 1958 in response to Gov. Orval Faubus' closing of the city's four public high schools to prevent further desegregation. A selection committee chose the inductees from 73 nominations submitted by the public. The inductees will be honored in an Aug. 27 ceremony at the State- house Convention Center in Little Rock. Ticket in- formation and information about the inductees are available at www.arwom- enshalloffame.com. \"It certainly is long over- due that we recognize the extraordinary history of women in Arkansas' history,its leadership and its prob- lem solving,\" Hutchinson said during Monday's news conference. \"Whether you look at the incredible history of women in Arkansas from the political arena of Hattie Caraway, our first woman elected in her own right in the United States Senate, to Daisy Bates, the civil rights leader, our entire history of Arkansas is filled with extraordinary women who have provided leadership,\" he said. Nan Snow of Little Rock, board president of the Women's Hall of Fame, said the inductees \"have made a major impact on the livesof others and helped el- evate the status of women in our state, the nation and, in some cases, around the world.\" The organization intends to induct a new group each year. Information about the first inductees will be in- cluded in a traveling exhib- it, but eventually the orga- nization hopes to establish a fixed location, Snow said. Snow told reporters Clinton was chosen \"on her merit\" and not be- cause of her presidential bid. She said Clinton and the other living induct- ees have been invited to the ceremony but said she had not heard whetherClinton would attend. The Women's Hall of Fame began as a partner- ship between the North Little Rock Chamber of Commerce and Arkansas Business Publishing Group of Little Rock. Terry Hart- wick, the chamber's presi- dent and CEO, said he got the idea after noticing that Arkansas Business Hall of Fame includes mostly men. Hartwick said he thought about the many women who have had a positive impact on the state's histo- ry and asked himself, \"How are the young women in Ar- kansas going to remember them if we don't start cele- brating what they've done?\"CONTINUED FROM PAGE 1A COTTON : Hutchinson Says Confederate Flag 'Part Of History' He also said, \"The C o f C Ci sh a r d l y responsible for the actions of this deranged individual merely because he gleaned accurate information from our website.\" On Monday, South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley called for removal of the Confederate flag, a symbol that Roof has posed with in several photos, from that state's Capitol. The flag's removal would require an act of the South Carolina Legislature.Hutchinson was asked Monday about his thoughts on the Confederate flag and Arkansas' state flag, which includes a star over the word \" Arkansas\" that is meant to represent the Confederacy, according to the secretary of state's website. \"It's part of history,\" Hutchinson said. \"It should not be utilized as a symbol for current events. It is history, and obviously we understand that history more deeply in the South than anywhere else.\"Hutchinson was on a European economic- development mission whentheshooting occurred. On Sunday night, he attended a vigil in North Little Rock for theshootingvictims. \"I think what we've g o tt oc o n c e n t r a t eo ni s not the politics of those decisionsnow,butaswe remembered yesterday at the Bethel AME Church, we really remembered theninefamiliesand really celebrated the lives of those that madea difference every day t h a tl o s tt h e i rl i f ei nt h a t tragedy,\" he said. Hutchinson said the demonstrations of faith by South Carolinians in a difficult time have been an example for the nation. \"I just hope Arkansas never has such a tragedy that happens here, but I think we've learned a lot from how South Carolina has handled it in terms of forgiveness, in terms of unity, in terms of working together in the community,\" he said.CONTINUED FROM PAGE 1A Large pottery planters are also available, and Brett designs customized pieces for clients like arecent one of a life-sized duck hunter with ducks.

In a letter to Education Commissioner Johnny Key, Hutchinson said that under the state's memo- randum of understanding with PARCC, if the gov- ernor is succeeded by an- other person, the successor \"shall affirm in writing to the governor's board chair the state's continued com- mitment to participate in the consortium and to thebindingcommitments made by that official's predecessor within fivemonths of office.\" inson took office Jan. 13, suc- ceeding Mike Bee- be, who was pre- vented by term limits from seeking a third term. \"Since I took office, there has been no action by the governororthecommis- sioner of education to re- affirm the state's continued commitment and partici- pation in the PARCC con- sortium,\" Hutchinson said Monday in his letter. \"On the contrary, I have pub- licly expressed my sup- port for withdrawing from PARCC.\" For the first time this spring, Arkansas schools administered standardized tests developed by PARCC and aligned with the Com- mon Core State Standards.During this year's legisla- tivesession,theHouseap- proved a bill by Rep. Mark Lowery, R-Maumelle, to withdraw from PARCC, but the Senate amended the bill, which became law, so that it only prohibited the state from contracting with PARCC for more than ay e a ra tat i m e . Earlier this month, a task force created by Hutchin- son to review Common Core and PARCC recom- mended that the state not renew its contract with PARCC, which expires June 30, and that it instead seek a contract to admin- ister ACT Aspire tests. Among other things, the task force said ACT Aspire tests can be completed in about half the time that students need to complete the PARCC tests. The task force has not yet made a recommenda- tion on whether the state should keep Common Core.Hutchinson accepted the task force's recom- mendation and asked the Education Board to end the PARCC contract, but on June 11 the board voted 7-1 to renew the contract, rejecting the governor's request. The decision re- quires legislative approval. The governor said Mon- day in his letter, \"Based on actions during the regular session, it is clear that leg- islators want to move away from PARCC. It should also be noted that the number of other states participating in PARCC has dropped sub- stantially, a trend that could make the prospect of cross-state comparabil- ity difficult in the future.\" Since 2010, the number of states in the PARCC consortium has dwindled from 26 to 12. Hutchinsonacknowl- edged that the decision as to what should replace PARCC is not his alone to make.\"In my judgment, ACT and ACT Aspire are the right assessment tools to accomplish the goal of national comparison of student achievement and long-term stabil- ity,\" he said in the letter to Key. \"I recognize the role of the state Board of Education in assessment selection and that cer- tain steps are required to make a change. Please coordinatewiththestate Board of Education to select a new assessment provider.\" Jay Barth, who was among the Education Board members who v o t e dt or e n e wt h ec o n - tract with PARCC, said Monday he had not read the language Hutchinson cited from the memoran- dum of understanding and had not previously been aware of the memoran- dum. Barth said he would need to look into the mat- ter before commenting.

NARRATIVE DESCRIPTION OF THE PROPOSED CHARTER SCHOOL The applicant for the proposed charter school, if approved by the authorizer, agrees to operate the educational program described below in accordance with the provisions described within this document, Arkansas Code Annotated \u00a76-23-101 et seq., the State Board of Education Rules Governing Public Charter Schools, and the attached assurances. Provide a narrative description of the various components of the proposed charter school by responding to the following prompts: 1. Describe the results of the public hearing, which was held for the purpose of assessing support for the establishment of this public charter school. Provide copies of supporting evidence. Applicant Response: To fulfill and exceed public hearing requirements, Future School of Fort Smith (or Future School) held three community conversations with students, parents, educators and community members during the month of July 2015. These meetings were held at strategic community centers at various parks throughout Fort Smith, culminating in over 60 participants supporting plans to open Future School. In meeting and exceeding the requirement to publicly announce the event in a locally circulated newspaper, a notice of hearing was included in the main section of the Times Record on June 23, June 30, July 7 and July 14. In addition to the newspaper notices, invitations (in Spanish & English) to encourage diverse public participation were distributed amongst local businesses, restaurants, youth centers, public libraries and other public spaces utilized by the community. Spanish translation was offered at all meetings. The first meeting was held at the Creekmore Park Community Center on June 10. Over nine guests, including a majority of Hispanic parents and local educators, learned about Future School through a presentation made by school representatives. Participants continued in a 30-minute conversation including small group discussions (3-5 people) in order to generate feedback about the school that was then shared in a whole group closing conversation. The following questions were posed to this intimate group of stakeholders; What brought you to this meeting? What questions do you have about Future School?' A summary of responses is recorded below: I have a granddaughter who is not engaged. Her self-esteem is low and I want to help her. I think this program will really help her. She's going into the 9th grade. That's why I'm involved, I want to help her. I have a daughter, she's grown and gone, but she has done so many things I never expected her to do, but I think if she had a program like this it would really help her to do more. I'd like to be involved. I work at a local business and was encouraged to get involved. My boss thought that my opinion would be valuable to the community. I work in the school district. I'm a paraprofessional. They invited me through Facebook. I said, sure, I'll be there to support, whatever is good for the kids. Just reading this, this sounds really good, and I'm here to support. I'm a little jealous; I wanted to go to a school like this. I was in a traditional school as well. I'm here because I believe in what Future School is doing. I wonder how can we prepare our youth for their future? There are a lot of people who want to help you. This could be an answer for those kids, just like mine, who just don't fit in that box, they just don't thrive in it, and I've been excited about it ever since. I work with students in alternative education, so that's why I'm here, just looking for other alternatives. The fact that it's student-led is huge and amazing. Page 6 of 55 What about students who struggle being self-directed? It sounds like they have a lot of independence, which I like, but for students who struggle, I worry about them. The city is moving in the direction of revitalizing downtown. How will parents respond to a downtown school? Bilingual staff is essential for communicating with students' families. How will transportation work with students getting to their internships? How are at-risk students identified and supported? What can lower-schools do to prepare students to be successful in this kind of model when they reach high school? After receiving feedback from the first meeting, the 2nd (June 10) and 3rd (official public hearing date, July 16) meetings were held on Thursdays to accommodate stakeholder schedules. The venue also changed to a community center in the heart of the north side of Fort Smith, where Future School will be located and will draw students. (20) Fort Smith community members attended the meeting on July 9th and (31) interested stakeholders joined the official public hearing on July 16. The meetings attracted a diverse group of participants including local district leadership, paraprofessionals, Special Education teachers, retired teachers, parents, high school students, family members, news media, and business and community leaders. Following the same presentation made during the first meeting, the group posed questions to Future School leaders. There was a diverse array of questions and feedback, including general questions about the structure of an open-enrollment charter. The following is a summary of further questions asked by stakeholders. How many students do you anticipate in the first year? How are you recruiting? Will Future School also have Common Core? How soon can students be placed on the list to attend? Based on the teachers teaching in this new type of setting, how will you go about recruiting teachers? Who are your partners in Fort Smith? Will you still have the same accountability as regular public schools? Will there be a time that the community will be able to see the application? Will you have any private funding? Will it be only open enrollment for only Fort Smith or our surrounding areas? What can we do to help!! Are there going to be extracurricular activities/programs offered at Future School? Will you consider partnering with University of Arkansas to offer discounts to graduates of Future School? In addition, to receiving invitations to present to other community groups, we received emails from those who participated. A local educator shared following feedback, via email, from the public hearing. 'I just wanted to take a minute and tell you 'thank-you' for your commitment to education and our community. It was so refreshing to hear what students in our area may have a chance to do. Your transparency and honesty was remarkable and I can't wait to see what the future holds for our community and students!' Future School believes these conversations were highly successful in informing the public on the plans for the school, generating feedback and support as well as providing accurate information to stakeholders. We are following up with many of these questions via an email of Frequently Asked Questions document. Page 7 of 55Attach documentation to demonstrate that each of the following requirements of Arkansas Code Annotated \u00a76-23-302 was met: A. B. C. D.The notice of the public hearing was published on a weekly basis for at least three (3) consecutive weeks prior to the date of the hearing in a newspaper having general circulation in the school district in which the school will likely be located. The notice of the public hearing was not published in the classified or legal notice section of the newspaper. The last publication date of the notice was no less than seven days prior to the public meeting. Within seven calendar days following the first publication of the notice of the public hearing, emails announcing the public hearing were sent to the superintendent of each of the school districts from which the open- enrollment public charter school is likely to draw students for the purpose of enrollment and the superintendent of any district that is contiguous to the district in which the open-enrollment public charter school will be located. 2. Describe the governing structure of the open-enrollment charter school, including board composition, selection process, and responsibilities. Also describe the role of the administrators, faculty, parents, students, and community members in the leadership and decision-making of the school. As part of your response, answer the following specific questions: A. Identify what individual, job position(s), or entity(s) will have final decision- making authority for the school in the areas of (1) finance and purchasing; (2) student discipline; (3) hiring and firing of staff; and (4) hiring and firing of the school director or superintendent. B. Specify how the final decision-maker(s) identified in response to (A)(3) will be selected or elected, including (1) length of term, (2) method of selection or election, and (3) who will have the authority to participate in the selection or election process. C. Explain how and to what extent the school's leadership will be accountable to parents. Applicant Response: Future School governance is designed to support the mission of the school while strengthening partnerships at every level to best serve students. To this end, Future School will be governed by a board of directors, the same entity that governs the non-profit Future School 501(c)(3) organization. To clarify governance procedures in this section, Future School will be referred to as Future School and the sponsoring entity as the FS board. As the sponsoring entity, the FS board will recruit and hire a school principal. As the school leader and superintendent, the principal will be responsible to recruit, recommend and train the Future School staff in addition to other start- up operational activities. The first new hire, in year two, will be the assistant principal followed by instructors and staff. The assistant principal will assist the principal in recruiting and training the Future School staff in addition to managing and leading other on-going operational, instructional, management, and fiscal activities. Future School's governance structure is designed to promote transparency and open communication. The FS Page 8 of 55board will be responsible for final hiring decisions and will receive monthly communication about school community activities from principal and advisory council. The principal oversees and supports the assistant principal who provides the same support and supervision to instructors. Instructors and students communicate concerns and feedback to the FS board through the advisory council, composed of parents, instructors, students and community members. Rules governing the FS board are excerpted below from the Future School by-laws. The FS board consists of at least four and no more than 12 directors with diverse backgrounds and interests. Within these limits, the board may increase or decrease the number of directors serving on the board, including for the purpose of staggering the terms of directors. All corporate powers will be exercised by or under the authority of the FS board and the affairs of the Future School (including financial and personnel decisions) will be managed under the direction of the FS board, except as otherwise provided by law. The FS board will appoint a nominating committee, which will present a slate of potential directors and officers for election by the board of directors. This slate will be presented at the annual meeting of the FS board. Directors will serve a term of three years, with the possibility of a reappointment for additional three-year terms, for a total of no more than nine years. After election, the term of a director may not be reduced, except for cause as specified in these by-laws. Directors will serve staggered terms to be determined at the first board meeting. After serving three full three-year terms, a director will not be eligible for re-election to the board of directors until he or she has been off of the board for at least one year. A director may resign at any time by filing a written resignation with the chair of the board. Directors will receive annual training on best practices in school board leadership and school management. Directors will receive no compensation for carrying out their duties as directors. The board may adopt policies providing for reasonable reimbursement of directors for expenses incurred in conjunction with carrying out board responsibilities, such as travel expenses to attend board meetings. Directors are not restricted from being remunerated for professional services provided to the corporation. Such remuneration will be reasonable and fair to the corporation and must be reviewed and approved in accordance with the board Conflict of Interest policy and state law. Future School Board of Directors: Brandon Cox, President Qualifications: See biography in following pages; Average hours worked: 6 hours per month Duties: Attend and participate in all board meetings, preside over all meetings of the Board of Directors, see that all orders and resolutions are placed into effect, assist in representing the School within the community and in recruiting potential board members, instructors and students.

Page 9 of 55 Advisory Council In addition to the board, the advisory council will play a fundamental role in the governance of the school by ensuring that all voices in the school community are heard and addressed and that communication is open and transparent. The advisory council will examine the success criteria of the school against regular metrics of its performance and will vote on suggestions for operational improvements that do not require board approval to continually move Future School nearer its mission. The advisory council will consist of instructors/staff, students, parents, and community members who support the mission of Future School. The council will consist of ten members (at least two students and one instructor) who are elected for year-long terms that are renewable for a maximum of two years in total service. Each member will have full voting privileges. Members are appointed through a school-wide nomination and voting process conducted on an annual basis. Anyone may nominate a prospective council member. Any student/instructor may nominate himself/herself or another student/instructor for inclusion on the council. To strengthen the efficacy of the council in developing a strong school community, each Future School instructor will be allotted $1000 annually to fund parental involvement activities, such as parental engagement training, birthday celebrations, cultural events and other school-based community gatherings. The two student representatives are the voice for the student body and represent its interests and concerns to the council and FS board. To facilitate positive educational outcomes, students must be thought of as participants in, not merely recipients of, the educational process. To improve the quality of the educational program, the student representatives are encouraged to provide timely opinions, ideas, proposals, suggested guidelines, and other student concerns to the council and board. Council elections will be conducted in the fall and the nominees with the highest percentage of votes will serve on the council. Members selected for the council shall appoint a chairperson, secretary, and treasurer to oversee council service and business operations. The advisory council may elect a representative to attend FS board meetings and may be considered as a potential candidate for board membership. The advisory council is required to meet at least once per academic semester. All members shall have the following duties: To attend any and all meetings called by the chairperson of the advisory council. To notify the chair when unable to attend a meeting. To serve on committees as appointed by the chair. All members will serve on at least one of the standing committees. To vote on any and all motions presented to the council. Two students will serve on the advisory council and have full voting privileges. Page 10 of 553. Give the mission statement for the proposed charter school. Future School of Fort Smith envisions a global community where all young adults demonstrate limitless self- actualization as innovative and compassionate 21st century leaders. Our mission is to embolden students to identify their interests, cultivate relevant skills, and connect to authentic learning; graduating with three years of real-world work, volunteer and collegiate experience . To achieve our mission, we are a partner in a cross-sector collaboration between local K-12 educators, higher education and industry. Through our real-world learning model, Future School of Fort Smith guides students to develop their strengths and passions while also preparing for in-demand employment opportunities. To accomplish our mission, we prioritize building, maintaining and growing relationships with our students, families, community partners and instructors at school and through community outreach. As a center of educational innovation, we partner with local schools to build and test new instructional approaches like project-based classrooms and integrated and ubiquitous technology to offer a diverse range of options for students and families. Upon graduation, students will be well positioned to continue their studies through our collegiate partnership within the University of Arkansas system at the University of Arkansas at Fort Smith or a higher education institution of their choice. Applicant Response: 4. Describe the educational need for the school by responding to the following prompts. Complete the following charts to include 2014 literacy and mathematics performance assessment data and graduation rates for the district in which the charter would be located and the schools closest to the proposed charter.

Be certain to include the source for information presented. Applicant Response: To develop the student's potential for self-actualization as an adult, Future School adds to the educational options for public school students and works to close the academic achievement gap. District-wide there is a significant gap in academic success between subgroups and the total student population. The two traditional public high schools in Fort Smith, Arkansas, Northside High School and Southside High School, serve a population of nearly 3,000 students between them in grades 10-12. In 2014, both campuses were marked as Needs Improvement campuses based on academic performance. The Targeted Achievement Gap Group (TAGG) students and Economically Disadvantaged students particularly fell below their peer group in academic performance. The percentage of all students in the district achieving proficiency or above in mathematics is (72.40%), Yet with the exception of Caucasian students (79.83%) proficient or above, all subgroups scored significantly lower: TAGG (66.08%), African American (57.56%), Hispanic (65.60%), Economically Disadvantaged (66.76%), English Language Learners (ELL, 60.64%), Students with Disabilities (36.21%). The same trend is followed in district's literacy proficiency levels. All students at proficient or above in literacy is 76.67% across the district. With the exception of Caucasian students, 82.94% proficient or above, all subgroups scored significantly lower; TAGG (70.51%), African American (68.87%), Hispanic (68.88%), Economically Disadvantaged (71.11%), English Language Learners (ELL, 63.29%), Students with Disabilities (32.47%). Additionally, the adjusted cohort graduation rate for all students including subgroups (77.28%), is lower than 2012-2013 national and state averages, 81% and 85% respectively (National Center for Education Statistics, 2015). Traditional district schools serving students from lower socioeconomic backgrounds see an even greater gap in academic achievement. At Northside High School, the poverty rate among students is 81.40%, with only 57.6% of students achieving combined math and literacy proficiency (Arkansas Department of Education, 2015). Comparatively, the poverty rate at Southside High School is 37.49% and 79.4% of students are proficient or above in math and literacy (Arkansas Department of Education, 2015). As partners with the local school district, Future School is determined to support their efforts, like many across the nation, facing this tremendous Page 13 of 55challenge of academic inequity. If the performance of students at schools and or/districts not noted in the previous charts demonstrate the need for the charter, provide the student performance data and its source and explain. Applicant Response: To ensure on-time graduation and to offer a personalized education plan, student learning is supported through a diverse range of course options including face-to-face classroom instruction, on-line courses, concurrent courses and internship projects. We are determined to help students build a skills and aptitudes 'toolbox' during high school. Not only will students earn an average of 18 credits in the 10-12th grades, graduating with a Smart Core designated diploma, they will have the opportunity to develop technical and professional skill sets in addition to earning college credit. We seek to increase college and career preparedness for our students and reduce the percentage of high school graduates in need of remediation in college. 47.8% of college students required remedial coursework in Arkansas in 2012 (Arkansas Department of Higher Education, 2013). Through our close collaboration with the University of Arkansas at Fort Smith in curriculum design and concurrent courses, as well as Common Core aligned curricula and personalized learning plans, students will be robustly prepared for college-level work upon graduation. The Fort Smith School District strives to provide relevant and engaging learning opportunities for students. Elementary and junior high students at Morrison, Sunnymede, and Ramsey use technology to access learning through a school-wide digital conversion program. At Northside and Southside High Schools, students choose from a range of career and college preparatory courses, predominantly Advanced Placement courses, entrepreneurship courses, and technological skill development opportunities (such as the EAST Initiative). They can also earn concurrent college credit through the Western Arkansas Technical Center (WATC) program or participate in an energetic Future Business Leaders of America (FBLA) chapter at either campus. Most of these programs, however, are auxiliary and reach only a small percentage of all students. Future School serves to introduce innovation to these offerings not only in the method of instructional delivery and school culture, but also by introducing career focus courses, technological skill development and real-world learning through internship to all students as core requirements for graduation. While schools are using AP and pre-AP courses as their primary means of college preparation, half of the students in these schools do not participate in AP National Board testing (51% at Northside High School, 48% at Southside High School). Of those who do participate, a significant number are not passing their AP exams and therefore receive no college credit (66% at Northside and 40% at Southside). All told, 83% of students at Northside and 71% of students at Southside are not receiving the benefit of college credit from the schools' focus on AP and pre-AP courses. To ensure rigor and earned college credit for students, we will focus on placing students in the diverse concurrent offerings at UAFS. Additionally, according to three-years of senior exit surveys from Fort Smith, students reported an urgent need to better prepare them for future careers and increase the relevance of their high school experience. In 2014, 672 of 796 (in district) graduating seniors (84%) reported the following review of their educational experience (Fort Smith Public Schools, 2014). The majority of respondents attended Ramsey Junior High (29%) and Chaffin Junior High (26%). Total percentages represent 'sometimes' or 'never' responses to survey questions (see Appendices for survey data): 55% felt inadequately prepared to use technology 44% needed more career planning help from their counselors 28% were unprepared for the transition to college/work 30% were not encouraged to continue their education 33% regularly felt unchallenged/disengaged in class In light of this data, Future School is uniquely designed to respond. Future School will model a proven approach to increasing student engagement and success. Since 1995, 75 schools in the U.S. and abroad have Page 14 of 55transformed the learning environment through internships and student portfolios as a part of the Big Picture Learning network (BPL) and their internship model. Future School will incorporate best practices from BPL schools. The following data illustrate the success of this model when compared to the Fort Smith School District (BPL Alumni Report, 2012 and National Student Clearing House, 2012). Increased college enrollment: 74% of BPL graduates enrolled in college within a year of graduation, compared to 65% in Fort Smith. Increased college persistence: Average freshmen -to-sophomore persistence rate is 89% in BPL schools, compared to 62% in Fort Smith. College graduation: 50% of BPL graduates in 2006 completed college in four years, compared to 30% who graduated in six years in Fort Smith. Increased employment: 74% of BPL respondents who are working and not in school reported securing a job through a high school internship contact. Continued community engagement: Nearly half of respondents from BPL schools (47%) reported that they currently perform some form of community service. The most common sectors for involvement are fundraising (16%) and tutoring or other education activities with youth (16%). Future School will provide a model that fully engages students in their education by honoring student voice and choice through our real-world learning model incorporating student-designed internships. Students will be uniquely prepared to build their professional toolboxes as they consider careers that appeal to them and will have developed 21st century mindsets, skills, and professional networks during their high school experience. 69% of last year's graduating Fort Smith students plan to continue their studies at an Arkansas institution. In response to this need, Our students will be well positioned upon graduation to continue their studies through our partnerships within the University of Arkansas system, including the University of Arkansas at Fort Smith or any other institution of higher education. Describe three (3) innovations that will distinguish the charter from other schools. Applicant Response: A (2006) Gates' Foundation study, \"The Silent Epidemic: Perspectives of High School Dropouts,\" (Bridgeland, et al., 2006) found that 47% of high school dropouts left school because classes were uninteresting. In 2013 the Gallup Student Poll found that nearly half of 5th-12th grade students in the U.S. felt stuck or discouraged at school. This disinterest is symptomatic of the disconnect between antiquated education models and the lives of students today. We know that students thrive when education is personally engaging, delivers relevant skills and training, and offers authentic, real-world application. By trusting and enlisting students as our partners, our educational model increases access to quality educational innovations for all students: project-based instruction, integrated technology, real-world internships, and an personalized learning plan which connects it all to a student's interests and skills. Project-Based Instruction Project-based instruction (PBI) reconfigures the classroom into a problem-solving space where students drive their learning through self-directed, team-based strategies. This inquiry-based, collaborative instruction is proven to increase student engagement, thereby increasing daily attendance, graduation rates and academic performance. Future School is aligning with project-based instruction as a model proven to be successful for Arkansas students. By aligning our classroom instruction with project-based methods, students will be well positioned for academic success and relevant learning. In our project-based environment, instructors facilitate learning by introducing learning objectives and students work on standards-based team projects to develop problem-solving and communication skills as well as social aptitudes such as empathy and determination (Belland, et al., 2006). When personalized, student-driven focus is applied to this concept, learning is accelerated. Instructors at Future School will receive access to professional development and curriculum resources to help them execute an effective PBI model. All classes at Future School will strive to incorporate PBI and metrics of teacher effectiveness will include PBI objectives such as problem-solving, collaboration, and exhibition. In a self-directed learning environment, students draw on their Page 15 of 55natural strengths as artists, engineers, leaders, and strategists. And as they work in collaboration they are able to learn from their teammates. With experience from across sectors, our instructors create a student-centered learning environment where students problem-solve, teach and lead others. In PBI: 'Teachers coach students with suggestions for further study or inquiry but do not assign predetermined learning activities. Instead, students pursue their own problem solutions by clarifying a problem, posing necessary questions, researching these questions, and producing a product that displays their thinking. These activities are generally conducted in collaborative learning groups that often solve the same problem in different ways and arrive at different answers (Bellisimo, Maxwell, & Mergendoller, 2006)'. Integrated Technology Technology literacy is an absolute necessity in university classrooms and career environments today. The ability to efficiently utilize basic platforms like word processing and email are no longer required only for students with particular interest in technology and computers. These skills and many others such as cloud computing, design, and coding, is foundational for career success in the 21st century. According to the 2014 Nation's Report Card: Technology and Engineering Literacy Framework , eighth grade students should be able to use 'digital and network tools' efficiently as well as analyze on-line information for credibility and usefulness. High school graduates should be proficient in advanced search methods, digital tools and on-line resources (NAGB, 2014). Secretary of Education, Arne Duncan, insists future generations need fluency in 21st century tools and skills. 'Innovation in education isn't about the latest gadget or app, or about how adept a student is at using a smartphone to consume the latest Internet meme. It's about how technological tools can empower students to become who they want to be, and who we need them to be \u2014the kind of children and young people who ask, \"What can I improve? How can I help? What can I build?\" (Duncan, 2015)'. To meet these and future needs that we cannot yet anticipate, Future School students will occupy a digital classroom where they will learn innovative programming to design and build the world of the future. Integrated into core courses as well through specific electives, students will learn drafting and graphic design, photo and video editing, website design and coding, and the basic presentation platforms and tech maintenance necessary to live in this digital age. With integrated technology, Future School is responding to over half (55%) of Fort Smith's graduating seniors who reported that they 'sometimes or never' felt their school taught them how to use new technology (Fort Smith Public Schools, 2014). Aligning with the 1:1 computing device goal set by Arkansas State Chief Technical Officer (CTO) Mark Meyers, every Future School student will work from their own laptop to complete coursework and communicate with instructors, classmates and industry mentors (Wood, 2015). Students will be able to work outside of class via an on-line learning management system such as Google Classroom, to gain competency utilizing such communication and educational tools typical in a college and career environment. To meet diverse learning styles and schedules, we will offer various courses at no cost to students, including self-paced online and concurrent credit courses at our partnering university. Our internship model and core curriculum will be informed through our collaboration with mentors, incorporating in-demand programs such as Adobe InDesign and Illustrator, CAD, and coding languages such as JavaScript and Python for students interested in diving deeper into computer science education. Real-World Internships Through real-world internships students identify their interests and connect with learning opportunities in their community. The internship model builds on strategies proven in the international Big Picture Learning (BPL) network and the Kansas City-based Center for Advanced Professional Studies (CAPS). Many educators believe that internships are the future of high school as students reach beyond project-based learning in the classroom to build knowledge, understanding and skills in the context of authentic work. Students work with their advisor to identify their interests and design an internship with local businesses and community organizations to explore potential careers and build relationships with mentors. Collaborating with industry partners, we incorporate current and future workforce demands into the internship design. Through a personalized learning plan, each internship is unique and offers value in real world learning for students as well as community outreach and recruitment for industry partners. A high-quality internship is one that the student is Page 16 of 55interested in, where the mentor is a good match for the student and where there is the potential for real, rigorous project work. Design, implementation and monitoring of internships are provided by the advisor, during Real- World Lab periods, who works with the mentor throughout the course of the internship. On the following table, list the specific measurable goals in reading, reading comprehension, and mathematics, based on the state mandated assessments, and any other assessment tools if used, for improving student academic achievement for each year of the public charter school's initial five-year period. For each goal, include the following: The tool to be used to measure the academic performance; The level of performance that will demonstrate success; and The timeframe for the achievement of the goal.5.Page 17 of 55GOALAssessment Instrument for Measuring PerformancePerformance Level that Demonstrates Achievement When Attainment of the Goal Will Be Assessed MathematicsState mandated assessments, the ACT Aspire assessment in 10th grade & the ACT in 11th Meet or exceed local district performanceAnnual review beginning in the Summer of 2017 English Language Arts State mandated assessments, the ACT Aspire assessment in 10th grade & the ACT in 11th Meet or exceed local district performanceAnnual review beginning in the Summer of 2017 ScienceState mandated assessments, the ACT Aspire assessment in 10th grade & the ACT in 11th Meet or exceed local district performanceAnnual review beginning in the Summer of 2017 College & Work Readiness Council for Financial Aid to Education's- College and Work Readiness Assessment80% of students demonstrate 5% growth each yearAnnual review beginning in the Summer of 2017 GraduationCalculation of Future School Graduation Rate by the ADE on the District Report CardMeet or exceed local district performanceAnnual review beginning in the Summer of 2017 Post-secondary education/ employmentStudent Portfolios100% of students apply to college or post-secondary career trainingAnnual review beginning in the Summer of 2019 Community/Parent InvolvementAdvisory Council Community Engagement Report90% of parents attend a school sponsored eventAnnual review beginning in the Summer of 2017 Applicant Response:Explain how the attainment of the goals will demonstrate that the charter is meeting the identified educational need for the school and fulfilling its mission . Attainment of the goals outlined on the table above is a strong indication that Future School is achieving its mission. For the purpose of measuring and demonstrating accountability to the state of Arkansas, Future School aims to meet the above academic goals based on data-driven test scores and credits earned. The measurements included above capture a snapshot of students' academic performance across a spectrum of academic assessments and will demonstrate that the hands-on, project-based model with integrated technology and internships results in academic success in addition to other career and college preparation- focused Page 18 of 55outcomes for students. Beyond academic assessments, we will also measure real-world preparation based on reaching defined college and career objectives. Through the nationally recognized College and Work Readiness Assessment (CCRA) designed by the Council for Financial Aid to Education, our students and their learning teams will be able to evaluate progress towards becoming prepared for a 21st century workforce and post-secondary education. Although not mandated by the state, we believe monitoring and evaluating student performance for preparation for life after high school to be a priority. Students and their parents have demonstrated interest in this level of self-evaluation so as to graduate with confidence and preparation to succeed in college and career. As well, our industry and community partners have indicated that closing not only the academic achievement gap, but the readiness gap for recent graduates in college and career is paramount to 21st century success. Future School ensures that 100% of students participate in authentic internships or internship projects, energizing student motivation and building life long learners with a personalized connection and eagerness to learn about the world around them. Future School will also connect with families and aim to reach the goal of 90% of Future School families participating in family engagement events each year. A key component to our plan for supporting students in attaining rigorous academic and career preparation goals is consistency. The goals we have set above will be met through our relentless pursuit of increasing relevancy and community support in our students' lives. We believe reaching these goals will demonstrate our commitment to ensuring that innovation in public education is successful when coupled with community collaboration and reliable educational and operational strategies. The first \"constant\" in the school day is that the school will start later and stay longer. We might be overstepping here, but our observations are that teenagers prefer to sleep in and start their day a little later. Research into adolescent brains confirms this. It has consistently shown that students' \"clocks\" are set for a later wake time, and they tend to go later into the night. Further, research has shown that sleep is an integral part of cognition, as sleeping minds process recent learning into long-term memory. Thus our school acknowledges that teenagers' sleep cycles are different than adults, and thus Future School will start at 9:00 am so that we might accommodate their real need of sleep. We will begin later with them, when they are refreshed and ready. Future School will also go later in the day until 4:30 pm, since teenagers' sleep cycles make them more cognitively aware later in the day and into the early evening. Thus, the adults at Future School will work when students are the most willing and equipped to work well. Second, students' weekly schedules will be determined by their internship's days and times, yet generally they will be at their internship location once a week and on campus the remaining four. Most internships will be held on Tuesdays, reserving the rest of the week for academic instruction. Our observations are that teenagers are often drawn to the novel, the new, yet they need stability in their schedules. The block schedule serves to provide students with diversity of academic and professional learning situations. The variations of their school week offers them consistency without monotony. Third, all proposed internships will be thoroughly researched by an employee of Future School to assure the safety of the student as well as the presence of a genuine learning opportunity. Student safety is our first priority in any internship. And this is not just physical safety. We will preview each work site and then further monitor students for their emotional and mental safety as well. We will also monitor for learning, constantly seeking to know if the internship mentor is actively teaching what he or she knows or does to the student. Future School will interview potential mentors and require a background check. We will go on site before and during the student's internship to reassure the safety and learning of the student. Advisors will regularly conference with each student, reviewing their journals or blogs about their internships and asking questions to assure their safety and learning. Dr. Judith Smetana's research has shown that adolescents actually believe and further expect that the adults in their lives \"have an obligation to be involved with their safety and a responsibility to teach them how to interact with society\"(Ginsburg, 2014). Thus advisory conferences will assure students that their safety, well being, and learning are constantly at the center of our school, even when they are not physically present there. Fourth, all project-based learning and all personalized curricula will be approved and further monitored by course teachers and advisors. Grades are given by the teacher of record based on student performance of pre- established project objectives and mastery of skills. The mentor at the internship is invited to contribute to the evaluation process, but school grades are determined solely by the teachers who know the students the best. We will establish the concept of \"teacher of record\" early with students so that they know who their \"boss\" is and Page 19 of 55understand that the internships are for their education, rather than the other way around. Fifth, all students will finish their day with an advisory block, which is a structured and guided period to develop components of their work portfolios. They will work on all real-world projects, including one-to-one and small group advising meetings on internships, professional/personal skill development and team collaboration. This time will organized by their advisor, by the adult who has committed to working with them their entire high school career. Advisors will structure the time so that students might journal, blog or hold a teacher-student conference concerning their internships, or they might receive tutoring and homework help in core subjects. Students requiring remediation or advanced coursework will have the opportunity to work on coursework in the Learning Center. Given that our model consists of multiple 'real-world' learning components, we wanted to elaborate on the ways in which students will be supported in meeting rigorous goals. In addition to the formal assessments listed above, Future School will participate in an annual review process and utilize surveys of graduating seniors to assess their Future School experience and track their post-secondary plans and activities to continue to measure the success of our mission. 6.For elementary charter schools, provide a daily schedule for all grade levels indicating the classes that will be provided for a one week time period. For secondary schools, provide required and elective courses for every grade level. If the school plans to phase in grade levels, include expansion grade levels by year with courses to be offered. Applicant Response: Simulating the real world, students will have a diverse range of options to both learn and demonstrate academic success. Each school day, students will complete coursework in three topical areas: core coursework, career focus courses and Real-World Lab. In the core courses, students will earn credits that count toward graduation in English, Social Studies, Mathematics and Science. In career focus courses, students will earn credits for a variety of electives including: Business Education, CTE, EAST, Family & Consumer Sciences, Marketing Education, Skilled & Technical Sciences, Television Production, Debate, Journalism & Yearbook, WATC, Health Careers as well as technology specific classes in design, coding, and specific programs, platforms, and skills. In Real-World Lab, students will design and implement their learning plan with their advisor and earn elective credit for specific courses such as, Jobs for Arkansas Graduates and Internship, thus growing their real-world ready toolboxes. Future School has committed funding for a limited amount of concurrent courses per grade for students who are prepared and seeking college level coursework. A typical classroom at Future School will be a dynamic, student-centered, project-based learning space. All instructors will attend trainings as a team in order to refine their teaching talents in the areas of project-based instruction and real-world learning. Courses are designed by instructors who work collaboratively to integrate Common Core State Standards, Next Generation Science Standards and Arkansas Frameworks into relevant and engaging lessons. For example, during a 90-minute shared planning period, our Social Studies and English instructors will plan units in tandem to maximize deeper learning opportunities for students. They would be able to plan a unit/lesson around Arkansas current events and incorporate writing/literacy objectives into student learning activities and projects such as a simulated 5 o'clock television news report created by students. In this way, students can creatively master learning objectives of both subjects. Instructors will work with support staff from our educational partners during the school year and summer trainings to design customized and Common Core aligned curricula. By backwards planning for the school year, instructors will create curricula including scope and sequences, unit plans, and daily lesson plans. Various professional development opportunities will be available at no cost to a limited number of our education partners. To support the demanding work of instructors, they will have ample planning time during the school week to prepare and further develop curriculum throughout the school year. Instructors will have time while students are off campus at internships to lesson plan, engage in professional development and build relationships with parents and community partners. On-line and concurrent courses will be available in specific instances where a student requires a specialized Page 20 of 55course. For example, credit recovery will be available for students needing to make-up credits through digital coursework approved by the Arkansas Department of Education. If there is no instructor with fluency in reading and writing in a foreign language, students interested in foreign languages will be able to take either on-line or concurrent courses. Courses requiring unique facility or materials needs such as a gymnasium, art studio or manufacturing equipment will be coordinated with local partners such as the Boys and Girls' Club of Fort Smith and the University of Arkansas at Fort Smith. Course of Study The attached sample course of study is designed for a student entering 10th grade who has earned at least 4 credits that count toward graduation, earning an average of 18 credits in 10-12th grades and fulfilling the 22 credit Smart Core requirement. In year one, this student will earn 6 credits; (4 core courses) Geometry, Biology, English 10 and World History, (1 advisory elective) Office Management & Internship, (1 career focus elective) Computer Applications I & II. It is assumed that for most students, they have already completed the Oral Communications requirement. For students who have not completed this course, additional work will be assigned through either English or Real-World Lab courses in order to earn an embedded Oral Communications credit as it is a crucial skill in college and career. In addition, although most 10th graders will have completed most of their Physical Education and Health & Safety requirements, as embedded courses, we will work to incorporate health and wellness education and activities into curricula. Likewise, we plan to integrate arts education into core courses where applicable. Core courses will be taught in 90-minute blocks 4 times per 2-week period. In addition to face-to-face classroom time where students work directly with their instructor and teammates, students will work on coursework that will be integrated into their learning plan during their 90-minute advisory block during the school day. With 1:1 devices students will also be able to continue their learning and schoolwork remotely. This offers flexibility for the student and helps them put into practice methods of time management and team collaboration just as they will in college and career. A blended learning environment of this type allows students to gather relevant information and instruction directly through contact with their instructor and synthesis and demonstrate learning at various other locations both during the school day and after school. In order to meet the needs of our diverse student population, Internet access at home will not be necessary and creative planning on the part of the learning team will ensure the student is able to work on school projects in a way that is integrated into their home life. To creatively utilize our limited staffing resources, our instructors will teach a core course in their area of expertise and chose one of the electives approved by the Arkansas Department of Education in the following areas: Business Education, CTE, EAST, Family & Consumer Sciences, Marketing Education, Skilled & Technical Sciences, Television Production, Debate, Journalism & Yearbook, WATC, Health Careers. Electives offered at Future School will be determined by area of instructor expertise/interest and student interest. For example, if an instructor has experience starting a small business and a sizable number of students are interested in that course, we would offer Small Business Operations as an elective. Learning Plan & Internships To support the internship component, our instructors also serve as an advisor to a cohort of 20 students. In Arkansas, high school instructors can be required to teach up to 150 students each day. This makes it incredibly challenging to build meaningful relationships with students. To resolve this, most schools hire support staff like counselors, social workers and other specialists who are again responsible for supporting an entire student body. This is expensive and inefficient. In our model, we have requested waivers that would allow each advisor to carry out these support roles, including organizing home visits. Students meet in their advisory group an average of 6 hours per week of instruction and earn elective credit for this instructional time. For continuity, each advisor loops to the next grade with their students, creating lasting, meaningful relationships. Students will monitor their progress towards academic and real-world learning goals through their personalized learning plan that culminates in a final student portfolio. Designed by the learning team (student, advisor, parents and mentor), the portfolio is a collection of student work that is updated and showcased each semester and during the final exhibition in 12th grade. The student and advisor begin the process of designing the learning plan at the beginning of the school year by identifying student interests and aptitudes in technological fluency, professional communication, leadership and personal development. Responding to questions like ' What are my goals this semester? For the year? By graduation? After graduation? ' and 'How can my core/elective coursewor k Page 21 of 55help me reach my goals?' the team helps the student set learning goals for the semester. With the end goals for the student in mind, the team designs a plan for the student to identify activities, resources, deadlines and partnerships needed to accomplish their goals. Assignments and objectives from all courses (core and electives) are integrated into the learning plan in addition to objectives and deliverables from the student's internship project. To develop student portfolios, advisors consult with students on a weekly basis, parents and mentors provide feedback monthly and the learning team meets at the end of each semester to gauge and celebrate student progress. By integrating all the student's learning activities, the learning plan allows the student to create a personalized plan for learning and value coursework as an opportunity to reinforce and develop relevant skills and understanding. The learning plan is also a tool that supports the implementation of students requiring an Individualized Education Plan (IEP). The internship is an integral component of the student's real-world learning and is the tool for applying what is learned in the classroom in a real setting with adults. To succeed in college and career, internships reinforce and allow for practice of competencies described in the learning plan; leadership, personal development, technological fluency and professional communication. Starting their spring semester of 10th grade, all students will complete an internship. No one internship will be the same. Because they are designed by students and their learning teams, internships may be completed on the Future School campus, off-site, as an individual or in a group and for a semester, a year or multiple years. To prepare for a professional workplace and job responsibility, students will spend their fall semester of 10th grade on campus, building skills and content knowledge around professional communication, leadership, and other skills necessary for local business environments. Students will spend a minimum of 8 hours per week at their internship sites in order to apply what they are learning in class. On Tuesday, during the designated internship times, advisors will be able to develop relationships with parents and industry mentors while on home/office visits in the field. They will also use this time to collaborate with other instructors, provide one-on-one student support and engage in professional growth activities. Organizing and maintaining internships for students is time-intensive, so to ensure instructors are able to prepare for other classes and responsibilities, there will be additional planning periods (90-270 minutes) allocated throughout the school week. Unique Programming Future School sets out to fulfill a calling from President Obama who praised the Big Picture Learning Network, a model of real-world learning we incorporate, in a speech in 2010, saying, \"...[BPL] gives students that individual attention, while also preparing them through real-world, hands-on training [for] the possibility of succeeding in a career\" (Big Picture Learning, 2015). In a traditional public high school, classes are divided into content-specific, hour-long chunks with little context, relevance, or interaction. As a result, students most often feel disconnected from their education, even those who are able to be successful in this format. Employers often find, even after a student completes a university program, that they require further preparation to step up to a challenge, think critically, work collaboratively, and complete projects successfully. At Future School, we give students real, authentic work that is hands-on, intentionally cross-curricular and connects with partners in industry to create networks whenever possible. To make this connection authentic, we provide a unique, student-designed internship for each student in every semester that complements their classroom experience and builds mindsets, skills, and networks towards a meaningful and productive future. We build partnerships with experts and leaders in industry to bring these individuals into the school setting and further connect the educational experience of the students with their future career while honing those highly desired skills that employers expect in their team. Finally, Future School offers a unique partnership with the University of Arkansas at Fort Smith that will allow students to earn concurrent credit in a university setting. The day at Future School will begin later and end later than a traditional school. We are requesting a waiver for a late start day each week in order to create remediation and enrichment opportunities for our students. During this late-start time, we will have opportunities for individual conferences, remediation, and enrichment programming. We are also requesting a waiver for an extended school day that will allow our students to earn the required credit hours during instructional days while putting time into their internship on non-instructional days. Our schedule will also follow that of a more typical work-day, with instruction or internship work taking place from 9:00AM-4:30pm, allowing our students the most opportunity to be successful in their internships at their internship sites and maximizing instructional time during the day. Page 22 of 55Students will attend their classes on a block schedule Monday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday and work on their internship on Tuesdays. Real-World Lab time will be built into class days for small group focus on language and literacy skills, career skills, and health or art. This crucial time will allow advisors to work with our students in much needed activities such as developing specific literacy skills, understanding the importance of professionalism, creating a resume, thinking through long-term goals or creating visuals to compliment or comment on their learning plan. Starting in the 10th grade, assuming students enter with at least 4 credits from 9th grade, they will earn on average six credits per year towards the completion of their high school graduation plan and/or their Associate's or other transferable credit. After being granted charter status and having the waivers within this application approved, Future School will be able to employ highly qualified personnel based upon their content knowledge without regard to whether they hold licensure as a teacher and advisor. All instructors meet the requirements of the ADE Rules Governing Highly Qualified Teachers Pursuant to the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001, but Future School instructors may not meet be hired with the same licensure requirements as district counterparts. Future School requests a waiver to section 6-15-1004 regarding determinations for qualified instructors in every public school classroom (each teacher in a core area must have bachelor's degree and meet content knowledge requirements) and section 6-17-401 regarding teacher's licensure requirement (each teacher in a core area must have bachelor's degree and meet content knowledge requirements). This will give Future School flexibility to employ the most engaging and relevant instructors and those who are eager to create and implement real-world curriculum and focus on technology integration in addition to developing and nurturing partnerships with industry mentors. Values Future School integrates our four core values of relevance, perseverance, engagement and opportunity into our educational philosophy and day-to-day student experience. Relevance To engage students and prepare them for the world outside of the classroom, we merge the old with the new by incorporating proven instructional best practices with new strategies and technology. For centuries, the heart of the learning process has been a meaningful connection with ideas and instructors. In our career-oriented classrooms, students develop lifelong relationships with their instructors and internship mentors as apprentices. Perseverance Through project-based learning, students work in teams with instructors and classmates to develop multi-faceted solutions to given challenges. By constantly developing the highest level thinking skills of analysis, creation and invention, students also simultaneously master state-mandated learning objectives (Common Core State Standards Initiative, 2014). Our rigorous expectations embolden students to earn a high school diploma and persevere in college and career. Engagement In a rapidly changing global society, many job seekers are searching for careers infused with purpose and are no longer solely satisfied with earning high salaries (Szeltner & Zukin, 2012). Future School champions meaningful engagement in service and community collaboration because it promotes social development and increases motivation by engaging students as leaders working with adult community and business leaders to solve real-world challenges. Opportunity In the 21st century workforce, productivity now involves the ability to problem solve, innovate and create value, (Time Magazine, 2012). To meet this demand, Future School fosters an entrepreneurial mindset: creative thinking, problem solving and navigating obscurity and risk. Through professionally focused projects with community service partners and businesses, students learn to see problems as opportunities to create solutions and develop partnerships. They become leaders by innovating solutions to real-world challenges and simultaneously creating value in their professional careers. Page 23 of 55 7.Provide a description of curriculum, programs, and instructional methods used to support core classes. Include all associated costs in the proposed budget. Applicant Response: When a school commits to real-world learning, it inherently also commits to building a changing, vibrant, and responsive school culture. Real-world learning requires real world scheduling of internships that must merge students' academics, their daily schedules, as well as a school's overall educational program with the adult world of work. This is not a simple task, easily handled in a traditional setting of high school, but rather it is a complex pedagogical process, which requires us to rethink how high school is done. Future School has done this rethinking. Our multi-faceted approach to education allows for the essential element of student choice. Much has been said about choice theory, but the simple way to explain it is that when individuals are allowed to choose between a few worthy options, they tend to engage longer and with better results. And what is true for most people is equally true for independent-minded adolescents. At Future School, students will be given choices, of academic concentrations, of internships, of how they might fulfill the rigorous academic requirements for each course, each grade. Through a robust and effective staff of 6 full-time instructors in the areas of Math, Science, English Language Arts, Social Studies, Career, Technology, students at Future School will engage in meaningful class instruction and on-line courses. Each student will play a significant role in the decision-making process of his or her own education. In every choice a student makes, his will is engaged; her determination is set, and their learning will come because they have chosen to learn. Concerned adults might ask about the wisdom of allowing teenagers to make their own educational choices. Indeed, this might be a problem, if adolescents were not guided by their instructors and advisors. Project-based instruction is a process of negotiation in which both student and teacher work together to determine what constitutes a complex final work and what academic concepts and skills must be obtained in order to complete the project. Personalized curricula goes beyond the project itself, as the teacher understands the student's academic interest, abilities, and needs and matches the student's level to the expectations of the course. Thus both teacher and student hold responsibilities toward the student's education; the teacher must guide the student to a higher expectation, a greater work. The student must commit to complete the project's parts they can do independently and to learn the parts they have yet to understand. Thus when the concept of choice is introduced to the students, it will not be introduced in isolation, but rather like this: Students at Future School have the freedom of choice and the privilege of responsibility. Although our educational program consists of many programmatic features, like student choice, learning through internships, project-based learning, and personalized curricula, we want to reassure you that our students will receive as much academics as they will real world learning. In fact, most of their schedules will be days of academic instruction at school in their classrooms. So, are they going to read Shakespeare in English class? Yes. Are they going to learn about DNA in biology? Yes. Are they going to receive the academics required for Common Core Standards? Yes. Our students will receive all required academics that are a part of every Arkansas high school, yet this high school experience will be unique in how academics are integrated into their real life experiences at their internships and in their use of technology. How is this accomplished? By beginning with student choice. When students enroll at Future School, they will be invited to choose one of four academic concentrations that will allow them to design their internships and the academic work that accompanies them. There are four concentrations: Arts and Letters: this concentration includes internships in studio arts, museum studies, library studies, culinary arts, theater and dance, music, domestic arts (sowing, quilting, gardening, and interior decorating), fashion design, news journalism, magazine writing and editing, visual media and entertainment, as well as school-based publishing such as with the yearbook and the literary magazine. Technology and Industry: this concentration includes internships in computer science (programming, coding, web design, word press, database design, networking, and automation and control), business operations, data management and analysis, landscape design, manufacturing, agriculture, insurance, maintenance and repair, as well as working with electricians, plumbers, mechanics, and other contractors. Page 24 of 55 Education and Public Service: this concentration includes internships in elementary schools and after school programs (literacy programs, homework centers, instructors' aides, coaching in physical education, or refereeing for intramural sports), in medical facilities as candy stripers, in gyms and physical therapy clinics, in the federal courthouse as an assistant to a legal clerk, at the local university as a research assistant, as well as working in soup kitchens, charitable fundraising, assisted living facilities, day care programs, firehouses, and state parks. Entrepreneurship: this concentration allows for students to experience the process of designing and starting a project, community organization or even a company. We envision that the entrepreneurship concentration will be chosen primarily by upperclassmen who have already invested in an internship their first or second year at Future School and are now prepared to create an original internship that furthers their potential career path. Because student learning will be as varied as the students' interest, ability and maturity, project-based instruction and personalized curricula is the working solution to applying what they are learning at their internships to what they are learning in their classrooms. This is the true dynamic of Future School, as the students grow and change, so do we, so that we may accommodate their educational growth. What a School Day Looks Like The way that we believe we can show this is to walk you through what a day will be like at Future School. However we find this task difficult since the interplay of these three features (internships, project-based learning, and personalized curricula) creates this changing dynamic that will be a part of the school schedule, a part of each student's day. Because of this, we cannot show you just one schedule, one school day. Rather we want you to picture in your mind three students and we want to tell you how their story might unfold, how their educational path might follow. These two students are in two different internships in two different academic concentrations with two different advisors. Thus their school days are different, yet they are also the same. Let us show you how: Picture in your mind a tenth grade student named Sophia. As a child Sophia enjoyed growing vegetables in the garden with her grandmother, so on Tuesday she is trying out her green thumb with her internship in landscape design. She interns at the local landscape company that is contracted to create the outdoor space that will surround the new museum. Her mentor has given her a challenge: to identify every insect that might have an adverse or beneficial effect on the landscape they create. On Wednesday, her work in Biology class is aiding her already. She is learning plant cellular structure and plants' needs in order to enable photosynthesis and reproduction. Sophia has negotiated with her science instructor a standards-based project in which she will explain the biological environment that she and her mentor are designing for the museum, replete with full explanations of each plant species and animal life (insects, worms, etc.) that will become a part of this small ecosystem. The budgeting of plants and flowers has engaged her use of her Advanced Spreadsheet Applications elective so that she can calculate overall landscape costs. But mostly work in her Geometry class is finding an application here, as she must explain her landscape design according to the principles of plane geometry. Her Geometry instructor has further challenged her to consider the depth of soil as part of her geometric space in which she must account, thus she needs help in thinking of the new concepts available in three-dimensional geometry, where mass and volume become additional factors in their landscape calculations. Her project has further led her to a more personalized curricula in which she is understanding the classification of native Arkansas plants and flowers and their specific needs for sunlight, water, and soil. Sophia is still collaborating with her instructor how she will disseminate her final project. Her instructor is challenging her to create a computer-based model of the landscaped area, so Sophia considers extending her internship into the next semester where she can work with her Computer Applications I instructor to create a digital product. Joey is a junior at Future School. He is a student who has struggled in self-monitoring and completion of independent work. Because of this, he must remain on campus with the adult support he needs at this time. However, this has not been much of an issue for Joey ever since his teacher has noticed that Joey has an \"eye\" for pictures. His internship is within the Arts and Letters concentration as he serves as the school's Page 25 of 55photographer for the newspaper and yearbook. His work is primarily on campus, mentored by his English instructor, yet advised by a photographer at the Fort Smith's local newspaper, The Times Record . His internship requires extensive knowledge of digital photography, camera technology, and digital design, as most of this intern days are in the \"digital dark room,\" photo shopping pictures, designing layout, and making sure his work is compatible with the local printer. Joey is able to utilize the tools in digital photography as a lens into cultural and historical contexts that he's learning in his on-line Survey of Fine Arts course. When his services are needed off campus, he is driven and therefore accompanied by a school employee, which give him the one-on-one support that he needs. Later, when Joey has gained greater responsibility and therefore greater freedom in his internship, he can be assigned to the local paper that currently advises him. But at this point, Joey takes pictures and focuses on his academics, which has taken an interesting turn. Joey is currently enrolled in American History. Because he shoots pictures in various sites around Fort Smith, he has become interested in the local history of the sites to which he sets his camera. Specifically, when his history class studied local Fort Smith history, Joey became curious in researching Judge Parker, Fort Smith's notorious \"hanging judge\". Because Common Core Standards require the critical reading of original historical documents and other nonfiction texts, Joey's research project contains original court documents as well as his original pictures of the historical sites and the new Marshall's Museum under construction. His instructor has further challenged him to reflect on his research, considering the legacy that we create and how he might want to be remembered. Thus, his internship has created an academic concentration where his particular academic interest in local history is applied to his real world learning as well as his technological skill development. 8. Describe the process that will be used to ensure all curriculum materials used in the educational program are aligned with the Arkansas Curriculum Frameworks and the state standards as adopted, and periodically revised, by the State Board of Education. Applicant Response: We believe our project-based instruction, integrated technology and real world internships are fully compatible with the requirements of the Arkansas Curriculum Frameworks and the Common Core State Standards (CCSS). Through this 3-tiered approach, culminating with a student portfolio, state approved learning objectives are met as students demonstrate a heightened level of engagement and content and skill mastery. They become more involved in their school experience through collaborative problem-solving which addresses relevant, real-world scenarios. With extended class blocks, the skill-development underlying the CCSS can be explored more fully and students will be more engaged in their learning as they take lessons learned from the classroom into their internship experiences with internship mentors. Future School will ensure that this complimentary collaboration occurs through targeted and effective professional development for our instructors and support staff. We will develop projects that meet and exceed the instruction required under the CCSS and our unique schedule will allow our instructors additional collaboration time to allow instructors opportunities to align their projects vertically and share best practices. We are making significant investments in time (one full school day each week, 90-270 minutes of weekly prep time, 2 days of in-service each year and at least one summer all-team training in: designing internships, Real World Lab best practices and building a student-centered school culture. To ensure our goals of curriculum alignment and sustaining high quality learning environments, we are also investing thousands of dollars for each staff member to continually grow their mindsets and abilities as 21st century educators. In addition, we have built cash bonuses into our salary structure to reward each staff member for building their expertise in their craft and, in turn, strengthening the professional, learning culture at Future School. Like Future School, the CCSS heavily emphasize the importance of technology integration, both as a tool in instruction and through essential tech literacy skill-development for students. Future School prioritizes access to technology for all students with a one-to-one student to device ratio that allows our students to attend school in classrooms where technology is fully integrated in addition to studying how to code, design, build, and advance technology in the world they will encounter in the future. Page 26 of 55Additionally, we are working in partnership with local educators and plan to develop instructors' abilities in creating and implementing aligned curricula during our annual in-services. 9.

Describe the geographical area to be served by the charter. List all school districts within the geographical area likely to be affected by the open-enrollment public charter school. Applicant Response: Future School will be an open-enrollment public charter school; therefore, we could draw students from anywhere in the state. The school will be located within the city limits of Fort Smith, and will also be located within the boundaries of the Fort Smith School District. It is anticipated that the Future School will receive most of its students from the Fort Smith School District, with some students also coming from the Alma, Greenwood, Hackett, Mansfield and Van Buren School Districts. The maximum enrollment in the first five (5) years of the charter will be 450 students. According to the 2014-2015 enrollment information housed on the Department of Education Data Center's website, there were 14,317 students enrolled in the Fort Smith School District; 3,221 students enrolled in the Alma School District; 3,621 students enrolled in the Greenwood School District; 610 students enrolled in the Hackett School District; 839 students enrolled in the Mansfield School District, and 5,828 students enrolled in the Page 28 of 55Van Buren School District.

Each stakeholder group will evaluate school performance data annually against the performance measures described in this charter, including the annual assessment scores and specifically looking at performance among ELL students and TAGG students. Additionally, we will collect survey data from faculty and staff, students, and parents throughout the year to be considered in this annual meeting. These committees will meet late in the summer, before July 31st, with representatives from the Advisory Council and the FS board to determine the school's goals based on the previous year's data against the established goals and will plan specific and measurable action-steps for the upcoming year. An annual report of the school's performance data will be printed and made available to key stakeholders and will be available to the public on-line. 12.

Given our unique partnership with the district and ability to work with guidance counselors in the junior high schools, we believe we will be able to reach sufficient students through student information sessions in the schools and our additional participation in community events and media outreach throughout Fort Smith and anticipate receiving over 150 applications for our flagship class. Page 29 of 55 Student Outreach Future School's model is based on building life-long relationships, which is key to our student outreach practice. Students develop bonds with mentors in the community as well as their instructors. Instructors invest time in their relationships with students and their support networks of families and friends. From student outreach to graduation, school staff builds relationships with families where they spend time in the community, at school, at home, and at outside of school activities and internships. To support our intensive program of student and community outreach and relationship building, we are seeking to build a unique team of faculty and staff with industry and non-profit experience, new teachers and seasoned educators. We know that our team is critical to our ability to not only execute our education program successfully, but to reach students who may need extra encouragement and cultural understanding to succeed. We are actively working with local community partners to develop channels to the unique and culturally diverse staff needed to develop and maintain our school. Future School instructors will embody our 3 C's criteria ; Care about kids, Content expertise and Coachablity. Our team members will be innovative, energetic and up to the tremendous challenge of founding a public high school as well as building close relationships with numerous stakeholders, most expressly with our students.

The chairperson of the governing board or committee shall, if appropriate, appoint a disinterested person o r committee to investigate alternatives to the proposed transaction or arrangement. After exercising due diligence, the governing board or committee shall determine whether the Organization can obtain with reasonable efforts a more advantageous transaction or arrangement from a person or entity that would not give rise to a conflict o f interest. If a more advantageous transaction or arrangement is not reasonably possible under circumstances not producing a conflict of interest, the governing board or committee shall determine by a majority vote of the disinterested directors whether the transaction or arrangement is in the Organization's best interest, for its own benefit, and whether it is fair and reasonable. In conformity with the above determination it shall make its decision as to whether to enter into the transaction or arrangement. 4. Violations of the Conflicts of Interest Policy: If the governing board or committee has reasonable cause to believe a member has failed to disclose actual or possible conflicts of interest, it shall inform the member of the basis for such belief and afford the member an opportunity to explain the alleged failure to disclose. If, afte r hearing the member's response and after making further investigation as warranted by the circumstances, the governing board or committee determines the member has failed to disclose an actual or possible conflict o f interest, it shall take appropriate disciplinary and corrective action. 20.Describe the manner in which the school will make provisions for food services. State whether the proposed charter school will apply to participate in the federal National School Lunch program or other federal nutrition programs. Applicant Response: Future School will follow nutrition guidelines for reimbursable school meals as we anticipate as many as 70% of our students will be eligible for Free or Reduced Lunch. All reimbursable meals will follow federal regulations. All foods available on campus will be in accordance with state and federal nutrition policy, including the National School Lunch Program (NSLP). Healthy meals will be provided fresh daily through partnerships with local businesses and distributed on campus in compliance with NSLP. Future School will seek bids from interested vendors. We anticipate feeding between Page 41 of 5570-80% of our students lunch daily through these partnerships. Students who do not qualify for Free or Reduced Lunch will be able to purchase the student lunch daily for $3-4 if they purchase a daily meal plan in advance for $80 per month. Daily food services will be the responsibility of the School Nutrition Director who will manage the community partnerships with vendors, pick up the meals, ensure compliance with all guidelines, monitors students as they get lunch, report data to the School Office Director, manage clean-up and waste disposal, and run an efficient food service program. Students eligible for Free or Reduced Lunch will be identified via confidential federal application form which our School Office Director will be responsible for distributing and collecting. Lunch will be served during the designated period for eligible students. Daily lists of eligible students served will be kept and recorded as the state requires. These reports will match the reports of funding and reimbursement for the food services program. 21. Describe how the parents or guardians of the enrolled students and other members of the community will be involved with the school to positively impact the charter school's educational programs. Applicant Response: Future School recognizes that family and community engagement in school affairs is essential to positive outcomes for student achievement (Jordan, Snow & Porche (2000); Starkey & Klein (2000). Throughout year one, Future School's staff will jointly develop with the Advisory Council a school-family compact that outlines how parents, school staff, and students will share the responsibility for improved student academic achievement and school performance. The compact will, at a minimum, include the following components: 1.Two teacher/parent conferences related to the individual child's achievement; 2.Frequent reports (every six weeks and quarterly) to parents on their children's progress; 3.Monthly communication between school and home via each student's learning team. 4.A \"Welcome Back\" event for student and parents prior to the first day of school; 5.Provide parents with reasonable access to staff, opportunities to volunteer and participate in their child's class and observation of classroom activities; 6.Materials and training to help parents to work with their children to improve their children's achievement, such as literacy training and using technology to foster parental involvement; 7.Workshops to educate teachers, pupil services personnel, principals, and other staff, with the assistance of parents, in the value and utility of contributions of parents, and in how to reach out to, communicate with, and work with parents as equal partners, implement and coordinate parent programs, and build ties between parents and the school; 8.Assurances that information related to school and parent programs, meetings, and other activities is sent to the parents of participating children in a format and, to the extent practicable, in a language parents can understand; 9.Scheduling school meetings at a variety of times, or conduct in-home conferences between teachers or other educators, who work directly with participating children, with parents who are unable to attend such conferences at school, in order to maximize parental involvement and participation; 10. Establishment of celebratory school activities for the community/parents during Arkansas Public School Week. 11.Adoption of the Advisory Council to provide advice on all matters related to parental involvement, educational programming, and policy/procedure development going forward; 12.Establishment of a parent involvement center 13. Adoption of an annual meeting to which all parents will be invited and encouraged to attend. The meeting will: a. showcase Future School's policies, goals, programs, and annual report card. b. provide a description and explanation of the curriculum in use at the school, the forms of academic assessment used to measure student progress, and the proficiency levels students are expected to meet; Page 42 of 55 c. and request parental input regarding Future School's annual performance. Additionally families will be asked to participate in an annual family survey to collect feedback on Future School's performance and to inform other family, school, and community events to be responsive to this feedback. Families will be asked to respond to survey questions, like the examples included below, on a scale from 1-5 where 1 = strongly disagree, 2 = disagree, 3 = neutral/no opinion, 4 = agree, 5 = strongly agree. Surveys will be administered in English and Spanish and can be translated to other languages based on family language needs. Sample Family Survey Questions: 1. Teachers at this school provide lots of encouragement and support for students. 2. The teachers at this school truly care about my child. 3. My child is getting a good education at this school. 4. Teachers and administrators treat students with respect. 5. My child can get extra help at this school when he/she needs it. 6. I expect my child to graduate from high school. 7. I expect my child to graduate from college. 8. My child is receiving unique educational opportunities at this school. 9. The work and projects my child does in their internship support their learning. 10. My child enjoys attending this school. 22. Describe the potential impact of the proposed public charter school on the efforts of affected public school district(s) to comply with court orders and statutory obligations to create and maintain a unitary system of desegregated public schools. Applicant Response: The Future School will locate its open-enrollment public charter school within the boundaries of the Fort Smith School District, and as an open-enrollment public charter school unconfined by district boundaries, expects to maintain the majority of its students from the Fort Smith, Alma, Greenwood, Hackett, Mansfield and Van Buren School Districts. The Future School is required by Ark. Code Ann. \u00a7 6-23-106 to carefully review the potential impact its opening would have upon the efforts of school districts to comply with court orders and statutory obligations to create and maintain a unitary system of desegregated public schools. In conducting its review, the Future School finds that neither the Fort Smith School District, nor any of the other school districts listed above, is currently subject to any court orders or judicial decrees concerning the desegregation of its schools. The applicant would also note that none of the listed school districts have filed proof with the Department of Education claiming a conflict with the provisions of the Public School Choice Act of 2015. As an open-enrollment public charter school, the Future School must be race-neutral and non-discriminatory in its student selection and admission processes, and its operation will not serve to hamper, delay, or in any manner negatively affect the desegregation efforts of any public school district or districts within the state. 23. Explain what the charter founders and other leaders are doing or will do to ensure the success of the charter school in perpetuity. Applicant Response: It is certainly our belief, as the founders of Future School, that Future School is positioned to continue Page 43 of 55sustainably and to be replicated as a model throughout the country. Future School builds on a proven models of real-world learning, incorporating the tradition of internships, apprenticeships, into an individualized, relevant, and fun, hands-on high school experience. We see opportunities to develop lasting, applicable skills and real networks through work, innovation, collaboration, and problem-solving, as a universal value add. We and other project-based, real-world learning school sites across the country have come to see the life-changing potential inherent in the transformation of the traditional education model and in placing trust in our secondary students and future leaders. We are committed to bringing this change-catalyst to our hometown corner of the globe, Fort Smith, Arkansas. We believe Fort Smith students are well positioned to meet their futures head-on and pilot a new model for what it means to graduate college and career ready. Future School will continue and grow because it will be deeply embedded in the Fort Smith community and will add value to students and families, industry partners, and community members alike. To the playing field of traditional education, we bring a visionary approach. We bring expertise at networking and identifying opportunities. We bring educational vision for student engagement in hands-on, deeper learning projects that have relevance in their communities. From our student projects with local artists and community service organizations, to our students' individual learning plans that put high schoolers in internships with industry partners, Future School will be indispensably linked to the Fort Smith community however we can be for greater success. Our students will be creating a targeted social media presence for a community organization or identifying pathways for local food purchasing for local restaurants. Our students will be conducting efficiency studies on the river transportation sector and measuring changing weather patterns in Arkansas. All our efforts will be for student development towards future studies and careers and for partners who will use these projects to advance and grow towards greater sustainability, humanity, and efficacy. Trish Flanagan brings a deep understanding of the issues facing education systems and proven methodologies for guiding students and partners to greater success. Trish brings experience from her time as a Teach For America corps member in Brownsville, Texas on the US-Mexico border, her work as a school leader in Roatan, Honduras, and her experience developing successful education initiatives in Little Rock. Trish is interested in disruptive education models that turn our traditional compartmentalization of students upside down and instead follow the incorporate proven strategies to trust our students as citizens. Trish has been instrumental in the founding of Future School and has strategically designed the leadership model for the school to be sustainable- prioritizing the hiring of highly qualified, local educators from the local community, wherever possible. Trish has an undeniable talent and more than 15 years of experience building business and community partnerships in education and, after a year of on-the-ground work in Fort Smith, is perfectly equipped to guide the launch and establishment of Future School. Future School will owe much of its success to board tirelessly focused on constructive partnerships. Brandon Cox, our board president, is on the Fort Smith City Planning Commission and has been extremely active in his city and school system. His support for Future School is essential. Jason Green, our board vice president, is a committed business leader with extensive public service and leadership experience including executive service with the Boy Scouts of America. Steve Clark, our board treasurer, one of Arkansas' top business innovators, and the founder and Chairman of high school education initiative, Noble Impact, has long envisioned a real-world learning school that developed young entrepreneurs in his hometown. The Future School's board is the perfect team to position the school for long-term success and sustainability. Boyd Logan, our board secretary, brings decades of education experience as a National Board Certified Teacher and fully endorses the design and mission of Future School. The uniquely effective school founder and board have already formed Memorandums of Understanding (MOU's) with the University of Arkansas at Fort Smith and the Forth Smith School District. Support is clear and non-partisan. This model is in demand and this team is excited to implement it. Future School will recruit and train teachers, primarily from Fort Smith and the surrounding communities who are passionate about project-based learning and a sustainable and transformative school model. The principal and Trish, as the school founder, will provide guidance, curriculum resources, professional development, and instructional coaching to ensure we are supporting the best instructional force for relevant, deeper learning and connecting this at every imaginable opportunity with resources in the community. We have confidence that an effective, creative, collaborative, and sustainable teaching environment will draw and keep the best candidates around, creating a sustainable model for teacher recruitment. We will be a small but closely knit team of instructional leaders and visionaries as we work together at Future School to deliver on what's best for our students. Page 44 of 55We know the model will be effective when 450 Fort Smith high school students are receiving a world-class education featuring relevant, hands-on projects and internships with industry mentors in careers and pursuits that they chose themselves and where they extract and add great value. We know the model will also be effective when we have created a collaborative and joyful environment that extends deep into the community, well beyond the four walls of the classroom and the traditional school day. We also will know the model is effective when it is creating greater access points into post-secondary education and upwardly mobile career opportunities. We will know it's successful when our entrepreneurs have the skills and the vision to position themselves for success wherever they go. We will meet our academic goals and will continuously reach out to our students, families, industry partners, and community members to receive feedback and grow. We will celebrate annually in our academic and industry showcases and in three years at our flagship class' graduation where we will measure our effectiveness as our students go out into post-secondary opportunities they never would have dreamed of before their time at Future School.

In Future School's unique programmatic model, the idea that certain students receive instruction in an Alternative Learning Environment (ALE) or based on classification as \"gifted and talented\" is at odds with our approach of engaging each student in a career preparatory internship of his or her choice. We believe an environment that it appropriately student- centered, engaging, and rigorous, is best for all students.

Led by First National Bank of Fort Smith Presi- dent Sam Sicard, the group cited concerns of addition- al costs and \"the further division of our commu- nity\" in a letter to the su- perintendent. The group's suggested alternative was \"expansion and reinvest- ment in our two existing high schools.\" \"I guess the push-back we had from certain mem- bers of the community put the potential high school on the back burner,\" Wade s a i d .\" B u ti fw ed ot h a to n a permanent basis, we've got to do something with our existing facilities.\" Wade referred to the latest proposal as a \"large group of projects that are going to cost significant sums of money.\" \" I nt h i sc a s ei fw e ' r eg o - ing to follow the lead of some of these members of this community to try to expand existing facili- ties,\" he said, \"we're going to have to have significant financial help from the community by way of a millage increase.\"In other business, the school board voted 4-2 supporting the first read- ing of an updated policy governing the community use of school facilities that adds a \"viewpoint neutral\" stance on nonschool-relat- ed events. The policy states, \"The use of Fort Smith Public School facilities by non- school organizations shall be viewpoint neutral\" and \"in no way imply endorse- ment of the beliefs or goals of the organization.\" School Board President Deanie Mehl and board member Susan McFerran voted against the mea- sure. In the past Mehl has suggested prohibiting partisan rallies on school grounds.NEWSTIMES RECORD 3A TUESDAY, JUNE 23, 2015 ARKANSAS GLASS & MIRROR CO.

Se- bastian County Emergen- cy Man- agement Director Jeff Turn- er said the county's Search and Rescue Unit, along with other local authori- ties are looking for Wil- liam Darrell Buchanan of Fort Smith, who was re- ported missing June 16. Buchanan is described as a white male with black hair and brown eyes in his early 50s, possibly 51, Turnersaid.Heisabout 5 feet, 11 inches tall and weighs about 180 pounds. He was last seen walk- ing in the Fianna Hills area, Turner said. Turner said crews are searching the wooded ar- eas near Fianna Hills and the surrounding areas be- tween Arkansas 253 and U.S. 271. Turner said it was un- sure if the man has a his- tory of mental illness or is in need of medication. A missing persons re- port was filed with the Fort Smith Police Depart- ment, he said, adding he encouraged those with any knowledge about Bu- chanan to call the police at 709-5116. Buchanan INDUCTEES : First Group Honored Formed After Faubus Closed High Schools H a t t i eC a r a w a y ,t h ef i r s t woman elected to the U.S. Senate. Hester Davis, a leader in the development of cultural resources management leg- islation and programs who blazed a trail for women in archaeology. Roberta Fulbright, a for- mer publisher of the North- west Arkansas Times who championed the University of Arkansas, fought cor- ruption and advocated for women's equality. The first organization to be inducted is: Women's Emergency Committee to Open Our Schools, or WEC, whichwas formed in Little Rock in 1958 in response to Gov. Orval Faubus' closing of the city's four public high schools to prevent further desegregation. A selection committee chose the inductees from 73 nominations submitted by the public. The inductees will be honored in an Aug. 27 ceremony at the State- house Convention Center in Little Rock. Ticket in- formation and information about the inductees are available at www.arwom- enshalloffame.com. \"It certainly is long over- due that we recognize the extraordinary history of women in Arkansas' history,its leadership and its prob- lem solving,\" Hutchinson said during Monday's news conference. \"Whether you look at the incredible history of women in Arkansas from the political arena of Hattie Caraway, our first woman elected in her own right in the United States Senate, to Daisy Bates, the civil rights leader, our entire history of Arkansas is filled with extraordinary women who have provided leadership,\" he said. Nan Snow of Little Rock, board president of the Women's Hall of Fame, said the inductees \"have made a major impact on the livesof others and helped el- evate the status of women in our state, the nation and, in some cases, around the world.\" The organization intends to induct a new group each year. Information about the first inductees will be in- cluded in a traveling exhib- it, but eventually the orga- nization hopes to establish a fixed location, Snow said. Snow told reporters Clinton was chosen \"on her merit\" and not be- cause of her presidential bid. She said Clinton and the other living induct- ees have been invited to the ceremony but said she had not heard whetherClinton would attend. The Women's Hall of Fame began as a partner- ship between the North Little Rock Chamber of Commerce and Arkansas Business Publishing Group of Little Rock. Terry Hart- wick, the chamber's presi- dent and CEO, said he got the idea after noticing that Arkansas Business Hall of Fame includes mostly men. Hartwick said he thought about the many women who have had a positive impact on the state's histo- ry and asked himself, \"How are the young women in Ar- kansas going to remember them if we don't start cele- brating what they've done?\"CONTINUED FROM Flag 'Part Of History' He also said, \"The C o f C Ci sh a r d l y responsible for the actions of this deranged individual merely because he gleaned accurate information from our website.\" On Monday, South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley called for removal of the Confederate flag, a symbol that Roof has posed with in several photos, from that state's Capitol. The flag's removal would require an act of the South Carolina Legislature.Hutchinson was asked Monday about his thoughts on the Confederate flag and Arkansas' state flag, which includes a star over the word \" Arkansas\" that is meant to represent the Confederacy, according to the secretary of state's website. \"It's part of history,\" Hutchinson said. \"It should not be utilized as a symbol for current events. It is history, and obviously we understand that history more deeply in the South than anywhere else.\"Hutchinson was on a European economic- development mission whentheshooting occurred. On Sunday night, he attended a vigil in North Little Rock for theshootingvictims. \"I think what we've g o tt oc o n c e n t r a t eo ni s not the politics of those decisionsnow,butaswe remembered yesterday at the Bethel AME Church, we really remembered theninefamiliesand really celebrated the lives of those that madea difference every day t h a tl o s tt h e i rl i f ei nt h a t tragedy,\" he said. Hutchinson said the demonstrations of faith by South Carolinians in a difficult time have been an example for the nation. \"I just hope Arkansas never has such a tragedy that happens here, but I think we've learned a lot from how South Carolina has handled it in terms of forgiveness, in terms of unity, in terms of working together in the community,\" he said.CONTINUED FROM PAGE 1A Large pottery planters are also available, and Brett designs customized pieces for clients like arecent one of a life-sized duck hunter with ducks.

In a letter to Education Commissioner Johnny Key, Hutchinson said that under the state's memo- randum of understanding with PARCC, if the gov- ernor is succeeded by an- other person, the successor \"shall affirm in writing to the governor's board chair the state's continued com- mitment to participate in the consortium and to thebindingcommitments made by that official's predecessor within fivemonths of office.\" inson took office Jan. 13, suc- ceeding Mike Bee- be, who was pre- vented by term limits from seeking a third term. \"Since I took office, there has been no action by the governororthecommis- sioner of education to re- affirm the state's continued commitment and partici- pation in the PARCC con- sortium,\" Hutchinson said Monday in his letter. \"On the contrary, I have pub- licly expressed my sup- port for withdrawing from PARCC.\" For the first time this spring, Arkansas schools administered standardized tests developed by PARCC and aligned with the Com- mon Core State Standards.During this year's legisla- tivesession,theHouseap- proved a bill by Rep. Mark Lowery, R-Maumelle, to withdraw from PARCC, but the Senate amended the bill, which became law, so that it only prohibited the state from contracting with PARCC for more than ay e a ra tat i m e . Earlier this month, a task force created by Hutchin- son to review Common Core and PARCC recom- mended that the state not renew its contract with PARCC, which expires June 30, and that it instead seek a contract to admin- ister ACT Aspire tests. Among other things, the task force said ACT Aspire tests can be completed in about half the time that students need to complete the PARCC tests. The task force has not yet made a recommenda- tion on whether the state should keep Common Core.Hutchinson accepted the task force's recom- mendation and asked the Education Board to end the PARCC contract, but on June 11 the board voted 7-1 to renew the contract, rejecting the governor's request. The decision re- quires legislative approval. The governor said Mon- day in his letter, \"Based on actions during the regular session, it is clear that leg- islators want to move away from PARCC. It should also be noted that the number of other states participating in PARCC has dropped sub- stantially, a trend that could make the prospect of cross-state comparabil- ity difficult in the future.\" Since 2010, the number of states in the PARCC consortium has dwindled from 26 to 12. Hutchinsonacknowl- edged that the decision as to what should replace PARCC is not his alone to make.\"In my judgment, ACT and ACT Aspire are the right assessment tools to accomplish the goal of national comparison of student achievement and long-term stabil- ity,\" he said in the letter to Key. \"I recognize the role of the state Board of Education in assessment selection and that cer- tain steps are required to make a change. Please coordinatewiththestate Board of Education to select a new assessment provider.\" Jay Barth, who was among the Education Board members who v o t e dt or e n e wt h ec o n - tract with PARCC, said Monday he had not read the language Hutchinson cited from the memoran- dum of understanding and had not previously been aware of the memoran- dum. Barth said he would need to look into the mat- ter before commenting.

Explain the inconsistency of goals for charter student performance to meet the performance in literacy and mathematics of students at Fuller Middle School, Sheridan Middle School, and White Hall Middle School whe n using the performance levels at these three schools to demonstrate a need for the charter. Explain why the goal for students to show improvement at a rate at least equal to state growth goals was included on page 15, but not on the goals chart on page 14 . Explain how achieving state goals for the school as a whole ensures that individual students are \"learning and understanding at a pace to keep them on track to graduate from high school\" as many students may be performing below grade level. 4 Discuss growt h expectations for students performing below grade level who need accelerated Confirm that alternative assessments will be used to assess students with disabilities, as outlined in Individualized Education Programs (IEPs). Applicant Response: Confirm the understanding that comparisons on the ACT Aspire cannot be made until the end of the 2017 -2018 school year. RTCCS understand that the comparisons on the ACT Aspire cannot be made until the end of the 2017 -2018 school year. Explain the inconsistency of goals for charter student performance to meet the performance in literacy and mathematics of students at Fuller Middle School, Sheridan Middle School, and White Hall Middle School when using the performance levels at these three schools to demonstrate a need for the charter. RTCCS cannot locate where goals for our students were based on Fuller, Sheridan, or White Hall. Goals listed were to meet or exceed the state goals. Explain why the goal for students to show improvement at a rate at least equal to state growth goals was included on page 15, but not on the goals chart on page 14. It was an oversight by RTCCS not to include the goal for students to show improvement at a rate at least equal to state growth goals in the goals chart on page 14 . Explain how achieving state goals for the school as a whole ensures that individual students are \"learning and understanding at a pace to keep them on track to graduate from high school\" as many students may be performing below grade level. Students achieving or exceeding state goals will be learning and understanding at a pace to keep them on track to graduate from high school. Those students scoring below desired performance levels will require an individualized plan to overcome the gap between where they a re and where they need to be. RTCCS goal is for all students to be achieving state goals. Discuss growth expectations for students performing below grade level who need accelerated growth to be able to graduate with their cohorts. Student growth will be a priority for those students who have been performing below grade level. A plan will be put in place to give students individualized assistance. Tutoring in the morning, the use of their study hall period, along with the flex peri od at the end of the school day may be used to focus on their weaknesses and improve their performance. The ultimate goal for each student will be to perform at grade level and graduate. Growth expectations for each student will vary depending on their scores and their expected graduation date. 5 Confirm that alternative assessments will be used to assess students with disabilities, as outlined in Individualized Education Programs (IEPs).

This leaves $180,070 to fund items such as textbooks, desks, and food contract. The cost of the other items covered in the budget did not exceed the funds available and the budget resulted in a N et Revenue vs Expenditure of $136,697.50. C15: BUSINESS AND BUDGETING PLAN The Business and Budgeting Plan section should describe how the charter school will organize its business office and manage its fiscal responsibilities. Evaluation Criteria: An appropriate plan for managing procurement activities; A description of the personnel who will perform business duties, including the requisite qualifications of any proposed personnel; A realistic timeline and process by which the governance structure wil l review and adopt an annual budget; A balanced two -year budget estimate that accurately reflects the revenue currently available to the school and expenditures for program implementation and does not rely on one -time grants or other funds that are not pre sently guaranteed; A budget that includes costs for all personnel, programs, and expenses described in other sections of the application; An understanding of the minimum number of students required for financial viability and a contingency plan to provide the education program outlined in the program if fewer students 14 than necessary for viability enroll and/or attend; and Plans to pay for unexpected but necessary expenses Partially Responsive Concerns and Additional Questions Specify the components of the \"contingency plan that outlines what budget items will be reduced to absorb the impact of less than the target number of student s arriving at school.\" Provide documentation that the private donation of the $85,000 gift has been awarded . Confirm an unde rstanding that \"working with the ADE to restructure classes and staffing\" could mean deferring opening to amend the application . Applicant Response: Specify the components of the \"contingency plan that outlines what budget items will be reduced to absorb the impact of less than the target number of student s arriving at school.\" Applicant Response: The contingency plan will specify the budgeted items that can be reduced or eliminated until the target number of students are enrolled. It will contain different scenarios that cover specific actions to be taken under certain conditions (e.g. if 80% of targe t students have enrolled). The actions taken for the different scenarios may contain items such as increased manpower on recruitment or hold open house at the school to get the word out about the charter and its enrollment process. The contingency plan would ide ntify who would be on the team responsible for each action item and it would identify the leader of the team. Provide documentation that the private donation of the $85,000 gift has been awarded. Applicant Response: Letter indicating RTCCS will receive the private donation upon approval of the Charter Authorization Panel has been included as an attachment to our responses. Confirm an understanding that \"working with the ADE to restructure classes and staffing\" could mean deferring opening to amend the application. Applicant Response: RTCCS understands if we have to proceed with the worst case scenario of 58 students it could result in de ferring the opening to amend our application. Remaining issue : Specific components of the \"contingency plan that outlines what budget items will be reduced to absorb the impact of less than the target number of students arriving at school\" were not provided. 15 C16: FINANCIAL AND PROGRAMMATIC AUDIT PLAN The Financial and Programmatic Audit Plan section should provide the procedure and timeline by which an annual audit will be conducted. This section should also include an outline for the information that will need to be reported to Arkansas Department of Education and the community. Evaluation Criteria: A sound plan for annually auditing school's financial and programmatic operations; If the applica tion names an accountant other than the Division of Legislative Audit to perform the first-year audit, the named accountant meets the requirements of Arkansas Department of Education Rules Governing Publicly Funded Educational Institution Audit Requirement s and is not listed on any ineligibility list maintained by Arkansas Department of Education or the Division of Legislative Audit. Fully Responsiv e Concerns and Additional Questions Explain how the audit can be completed on or before June 30, if that is the date of closing for the financial year . Applicant Response: RTCCS was confused by the wording of 6 -23-505 (2014) where it states \"An open -enrollment public charter school shall prepare an annual certified audit of the financial condition and transactions of the open -enrollment public charter school as of June 30 of each year in accordance with generally accepted auditing procedures and containing any other data as determined by the State Board of E ducation for all public schools\". RTCCS erred in stating on or before June 30. The audit would be of the financial condition of the charter at the end of the fiscal year (June 30). The audit will be done in accordance with the ADE Rules Governing Publicly Funded Education Institution Audit Requirements.

School Year /School Day ARK. CODE ANN. \u00a7 6-10-106: Uniform Dates for Beginning and End of School Year RTCCS would like to have the flexibility to determine the beginning and ending date based on the educational needs of our students. We will comply with ACA 6 -10- 106(a)(1)(A) the first year of operations but may deviate starting in our second year of operation . Legal Comments: The applicant should explain what this means. Is it certain that there will be different dates for beginning and end of the school year starting with the 2017 -18 school year, and if so, what will those dates be? Will those beginning and end dates then continue for subsequent school years? Please clarify. Applicant Response: RTCCS is seeking this waiver to afford the opportunity of setting the beginning and ending dates of our school year based on the needs of our students. During the first year of operation we will comply with ACA 6 -10-106. Once our students are enrolled and school is in session, we will begin to know their strengths and weaknesses. We made need to alter our beginning and ending dates of future school year to allow more time to w ork on their weaknesses. We will not know if this is necessary for out years until we have the opportunity to get to know our students. The altered beginning and end dates may continue in subsequent school years depending on the performance of students o n state mandated test(s) that indicate their progress. ARK. CODE ANN. \u00a7 6-10-108: Student/Teacher Interaction Sections 10.0.1.1 and 10.0.1.2 of ADE Rules Governing Standards for Accreditation RTCCS has an extended school day and may accomplish the required student/teacher interaction time in less than 178 days. RTCCS is requesting this waiver to allow the flexibility needed to meet instructional requirements and to be fiscally responsible. The first year of operation will be 178 days of interactio n, but following years may be adjusted to best serve the students. Red =Waivers not previously requested, need additional discussion, or have remaining issues Green =Waivers pr eviously granted, no remaining issues Information provided by Applicant is in italics. 2 Legal Comments: The applicant should explain what this means. Explain under what circumstances the number of days will be shortened . What will be the minimum number of days required in any one year? Applicant seeks a waiver of 10.0.1.1 of the Standards of Accreditation; confirm that applicant means to seek a waiver of 10.01.1 and 10.01.2 because there is not a section 10.1.1.1 or 10.0. 1.2. Applicant Response: RTCCS was requesting a waiver for the 178 days of interaction requirement in case the extended school day RTCCS is implementing results in the students' performance improving to meet state goals. In this event, RTCCS could alter the number of days it is in session to be fiscally responsible. RTCCS school day averages no less than 7 hours of instructional time. A school day that averages 6 hours per day results in 1068 hours of instructional time in 178 days. RTCCS will be providing 1246 hours of instructional time in 178 days. We are seeking the flexibility to reduce the number of days if our students' performance improves. Based on the number of hours in an RTCCS school day, RTCCS could be in session as little as 153 da ys a year and still provide the minimum of 1068 hours of instruction specified in ADE Rules Governing Standards for Accreditation Section 10.01.4. An occasional day off as a reward for increased performance would be a great reward for students and teacher s plus it would help RTCCS control cost by eliminating cost such as transportation on those bonus reward days out of school. Based on legal comments, RTCCS should have listed section 10.01.1 and 10.01.2 in the waiver request. Remaining issues: In respon se to these two waiver requests appear inconsistent. In response to legal comments about the waiver requests, the applicant requests the ability to hold school for as few as 153 days per year with an extended day. It is stated that 153 days would have st udents receiving the same number of instructional hours as attending for 178 days and receiving six hours of instruction per day, and school days will be reduced \"in case the extended school day [applicant] is implementing results in the students' performa nce improving to meet state goals. \" Clarify. 2.

Instead, RTCCS will require a vote by \"classified employees\" (as defined in Section 6 -13-1302). Legal Comments: Because there is no \"Section G\" on the following page, please confirm that you are referring to RTCCS's request for teacher licensure waivers set forth in section six . Applicant Response: Red =Waivers not previously requested, need additional discussion, or have remaining issues Green =Waivers pr eviously granted, no remaining issues Information provided by Applicant is in italics. 4 The reference to Section \"G\" was mistakenly included.

NARRATIVE DESCRIPTION OF THE PROPOSED CHARTER SCHOOL The applicant for the proposed charter school, if approved by the authorizer, agrees to operate the educational program described below in accordance with the provisions described within this document, Arkansas Code Annotated \u00a76-23-101 et seq., the State Board of Education Rules Governing Public Charter Schools, and the attached assurances. Provide a narrative description of the various components of the proposed charter school by responding to the following prompts: 1. Describe the results of the public hearing, which was held for the purpose of assessing support for the establishment of this public charter school. Provide copies of supporting evidence. Applicant Response: RTCCS held a public hearing on 16 July 2015. The location for the public hearing was the Redfield Community Center. The meeting was requested to be published in the White Hall Journal three consecutive Wednesdays (24 June 2015, 01 July 2015, 08 July 2015) preceding the meeting held on Thursday, July 16. The last publication of the notice was no less than seven days prior to the public meeting held on Thursday, 16 July 2015. An email with the information for the public meeting was sent to the superintendents of each school district contiguous to the district the charter will be located in (White Hall, Sheridan, Pulaski County Special, Dollarway, Pine Bluff, and Watson Chapel) within seven calendar days following the first publication of the notice of the public hearing. Documentation for the public hearing date of publication, location of advertisement, and confirmation of payment are included in this application. The meeting was held on Thursday night, 16 July 2015, at 7:00 PM. After the presentation, the floor was opened up so that those in attendance could ask questions of the RTCCS Board of Directors. The advertisement was last published on Wednesday, 08 July 2015 which met the last publication date of the notice being no less than seven days prior to the public meeting. Attendees were supportive of RTCCS efforts to get a charter school authorized. Attendees were provided the RTCCS web site and email address in case questions arose at a later time. After the meeting was concluded, members of the RTCCS Board of Directors were available to talk with individuals one-on-one. No one present spoke in opposition to the charter school. Over eighty (80) signatures on petitions, letters from local businesses, letter from the President of the Redfield Chamber of Commerce, and a letter from Redfield mayor, Mayor Harmon Carter, have been collected in support of Redfield pursuin g a charter school. These documents are available for review.Page 6 of 51Attach documentation to demonstrate that each of the following requirements of Arkansas Code Annotated \u00a76-23-302 was met: A. B. C.

Be certain to include the source for information presented. Applicant Response: RTCCS asserts there are correlations between students from low-income families dropping out before achieving their high school diploma if they are attending large schools. For students from areas outside of cities in Arkansas, attending a large school usually means the students are being transported from outlying areas to the school. In an article titled \"High School Dropouts in the United States\" published on Wikipedia in February 2013, it is stated that high school dropouts are more likely to be unemployed, have low-paying jobs, be incarcerated, have children at early ages and/or become single parents. The article goes further and states \"School size has a very strong non-linear correlation with dropout rate.\" This claim was based on a study by Jacob Werblow in 2009. Werblow's found increases in school size can be \"associated with a 12% increase in average student dropout rate\". In an article found on wsws.org (World Socialist Web Site), statistics from a study by the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) indicate that low-income students fail to graduate at five times the rate of middle- income families and six times that of higher-income youth. The students in Redfield and the surrounding areas are financially disadvantaged. This is not to say that all low-income students attending larger schools will dropout, but they are at greater risk of dropping out. RTCCS will actively recruit students from low-income areas currently attending schools larger than the proposed size of RTCCS. RTCCS will focus on recruiting students who are from economically disadvantaged areas. Most, if not all, of these students will be currently attending schools larger than RTCCS proposed student population. Based on the 2014 ESEA reports from the White Hall School District from the Arkansas Department of Education web site (https://adedata.arkansas.gov/arc/), students classified as Economically Disadvantaged are not performing as well as the combined student population. The all students scoring Percentage in Literacy is 82.55 with a 2014 AMO of 83.27 while the Economically Disadvantaged students score was 73.81 with a 2014 AMO of 75.92. The all students scoring percentage in Mathematics is 79.69 while the Economically Disadvantaged students score Page 11 of 51was 69.24 with a 2014 AMO of 81.06. The gap between the Percentage (69.24) and the 2014 AMO in mathematics (81.06) for the Economically Disadvantage is larger than the gap between the Percentage (79.69) and the 2014 AMO in mathematics (87.49) for All Students. The graduation rate for the Combined Population at the White Hall High School is remaining steady around 85 to 86, but the Targeted Achievement Gap Group was 76.13 and the Economically Disadvantaged rate was 76.39 in 2014. RTCCS will strive to engage the students and provide them an educational environment where they feel connected to the school instead of being disenfranchised. In 2014, White Hall Middle School had 729 students enrolled and the High School had 944 students. RTCCS anticipates having 200 students in grades 5-8 its first year of operation and adding an additional 50 students each year while growing to become a 5-12 with 400 students. A small school setting will afford the teachers and staff the opportunity to get to know each student, allow for the forging of a relationship with each student, and the ability to determine each student's strengths, weaknesses, and learning style. It would also be beneficial for students that need to be able to participate in extracurricular activities for motivation to stay in school instead of dropping out. Based on the Poverty Rate data reported in the 2014 ESEA reports, the elementary schools and intermediate/ middle schools in the tri-county area (Hardin Elementary, East End Elementary, East End Intermediate, Bates Elementary, and Fuller Middle School) have a poverty rate of over 50%. The children living in these areas deserve to have a choice on where they attend school. These economically challenged students may be at greater risk for dropping out of high school if they attend a larger school. These students need a smaller school to allow them to build relationships with teachers and fellow students. Smaller schools provide a greater opportunity to participate in team sports or other extracurricular activities and provide them a feeling of belonging in the student body. Students in Arkansas are struggling. Many results from standardized tests are not where they need to be and are not meeting target growth goals. School consolidation may lead to increased curricular offerings, but those offerings only benefit a small percentage of students. There are many large schools in Arkansas whose student body is not scoring proficient in reading and mathematics. Howley (1994) argued the benefits of a wider range of courses being offered might be overstated. He stated that a small school with a strong core curriculum could enable students to achieve at high levels. Slate and Jones stated that a small percentage of students at larger schools enrolled in courses that were not taught at the smallest schools. The additional courses offered were not benefiting the majority of the students. Greene and Marcus (2006) concluded from their research that states could improve their graduation rates by decreasing the size of their districts and giving parents greater choice in the school systems that educate their children. One way of offering choice to families in Arkansas is by the authorization of charter schools. Low- income families in the areas around Redfield deserve to have the same choices and opportunities for their children as middle to upper-middle families in areas similar to Little Rock. Low-income families do not have the option of sending their children to private schools due to the financial constraints they experience and there is no charter school option in the area at this time. Education is not one-size fits all. The authorization of a charter school in Redfield would provide these families those choices and opportunities. References Greene, Jay P. and Winters, Marcus A.

If the performance of students at schools and or/districts not noted in the previous charts demonstrate the need for the charter, provide the student performance data and its source and explain. Applicant Response: Three public middle schools service the students in the area where Grant, Saline, Jefferson, and Pulaski meet. These schools are Fuller Middle School (Pulaski County Special School District), Sheridan Middle School (Sheridan School District), and White Hall Middle School (White Hall Middle School). Based on information from the 2014 ESEA reports downloaded from the ADE website ( https://adedata.arkansas.gov/arc ), none of the middle schools servicing the students in this area are classified as \"Achieving\" in Math and all but one are classified as Needs Improvement in Literacy. The scores of students classified as Economically Disadvantaged are not improving at the expected rate and are falling short of the 2014 AMO by over 12% in the Sheridan Middle School and over 20% in the Fuller Middle School. Economically Disadvantaged students at Fuller Middle School are also falling short in Literacy by over 8%. The scores for All Students at Fuller Middle School were over 19% below the 2014 AMO in Mathematics and over 12% below the 2014 AMO in Literacy while the scores for All Students at Sheridan Middle School were over 7% below the 2014 AMO in Mathematics but were just barely under the 2014 AMO in Literacy. Students in areas around Redfield do not have a choice on where to attend school. A charter school in Redfield would provide an option for them. Students living in other areas around Arkansas such as Little Rock, Jacksonville, North Little Rock, Fayetteville, and Bentonville are being provided options for their education while students in areas like the Redfield tri-county area are not afforded those same opportunities. Describe three (3) innovations that will distinguish the charter from other schools. Applicant Response: Three (3) innovations distinguishing RTCCS from other schools are our small school setting, extended school day with built in flex time, and our focus on character and community service. These innovations, along with the emphasis on STEM and college and career readiness, will allow our students to prepare themselves for exciting and productive futures. The students will be encouraged to participate in extra-curricular activities such as basketball and cheerleading and to participate in clubs and community services projects/events. Our small size is reminiscent of the one-room school that served as the foundation of American education. Students will be afforded the opportunity to participate in peer tutoring - either sharing knowledge with or gaining knowledge from their fellow students. This time will be monitored by staff members but led by students. Participation in the peer tutoring is optional. The RTCCS school day will consist of thirty (30) minutes of optional peer tutoring followed by three hundred ninety (390) minutes of required instruction compared to the required three hundred fifty (350) minutes. The last thirty (30) minutes of the day is flex time and can be used for activities such as club meetings, participation in community service projects, speakers focused on sharing career information, small group instruction, or additional instruction for students needing extra help. The RTCCS staff will be afforded the freedom to tailor the flex time to meet the needs of our students as well as enrich their instruction on character and career opportunities. Page 13 of 51 RTCCS students will have the opportunity to join and participate in EACH (Education and Community Heroes). The premise of EACH is that each person matters. Each person can make a difference. The focus of EACH is to empower students to help others and their communities. Parents and community members will also be encouraged to participate in EACH. RTCCS small school approach involving students in the education process which will focus on college and career readiness, extended school day, and student participation in EACH makes our school an innovative option for families. Our students will become members of our school family and will leave school with a life-long love for learning and an understanding of their potential to make a difference not only in their own lives but in the lives of others. On the following table, list the specific measurable goals in reading, reading comprehension, and mathematics, based on the state mandated assessments, and any other assessment tools if used, for improving student academic achievement for each year of the public charter school's initial five-year period. For each goal, include the following: The tool to be used to measure the academic performance; The level of performance that will demonstrate success; and The timeframe for the achievement of the goal.5.Page 14 of 51GOALAssessment Instrument for Measuring PerformancePerformance Level that Demonstrates Achievement When Attainment of the Goal Will Be Assessed Students to meet their individual target growth.Measures of Academic Progress (MAP)60% of returning students to meet their target growthBeginning of Year and End of Year Students' performance to improve each year.ACT Aspire Performance Based Assessment10% or more of returning students improve scores from previous year.After 75% of the school year and per ADE guidance Students' performance to improve each year.ACT Aspire Exam10% or more of returning students improve scores from previous year.After 90% of the school year and per ADE guidance Applicant Response:Explain how the attainment of the goals will demonstrate that the charter is meeting the identified educational need for the school and fulfilling its mission . It is difficult to determine goals for the charter's students at this time because we do not know who the students will be. During the first year of operation, the charter's annual measurable objectives (AMOs) will be based on the state AMOs, and in following years, the charter AMOs will be based on the academic performance of the students who attend the charter. RTCCS acknowledges the requirements for the state mandated assessments and our goals will be to work with each student to achieve gains toward moving our entire student population to proficient over time. The rate at which this happens will be dependent on the Page 15 of 51students attending the school. If the students are grossly behind, the amount of time to help them achieve proficiency will be longer. A significant challenge will be the implementation of the ACT Aspire exam which is replacing for the Partnership for Assessment of Readiness for College and Careers (PARCC). PARCC was implemented in 2014-2015 replacing the Arkansas Comprehensive Testing, Assessment and Accountability Program (ACTAAP) aka Benchmark. It will not be feasible to compare PARCC results from 2014-2015 to ACT Aspire results from 2015-2016 based on information found on the Office for Education Policy (OEP) University of Arkansas website. It will take time for the results of the assessments to lead to the development of attainable expectations for student scores. RTCCS is not sure at this time if the goals stated in this application on the ACT assessments are realistic or not because there is little to no data available to base them on. RTCCS will work with the ADE as ACT Aspire is implemented. As with any new assessment, it will take time for the students and schools to adjust. RTCCS goal for student scores is to show improvement at a rate at least equal to that of state growth goals. There will be multiple goals for the students the first year the charter is authorized. One of the goals for the students at the beginning of the initial school year will be to increase their knowledge and understanding of core curriculum material during the school year. The students will be asked to strive to become more involved in their education and to be interactive in the classroom with their teachers and fellow classmates. They will work diligently to become active members of the communities that the student body of RTCCS is comprised of. They will be challenged to become living examples of core character values such as responsibility and citizenship. These goals will result in the students being engaged with their teachers, classmates, and school staff. The students at RTCCS will endeavor to improve their test scores on state-mandated standardized test(s). After the initial year of operation, the students' goals will be set by state requirements. RTCCS will also utilize Measures of Academic Progress (MAP) to establish a target growth goal for each student during the initial year of operation. MAP will provide a means to develop and track individual growth goals for each student. RTCCS believes meeting the educational needs of our students is more than just scores on standardized tests, but results from standardized tests are the acceptable method of proving academic improvement. RTCCS wants to encourage each student and to build their confidence. Engaging the students in the classroom and forging relationships between students, teachers, staff, and the community will result in the students experiencing being a part of an educational and community family. RTCCS teachers and staff will be focused on each student's personal well-being as well as their academic growth. If RTCCS students are able to achieve the state growth goals, it will demonstrate the students are learning and understanding at a pace to keep them on track to graduate from high school. The achievement of goals may also indicate the students are engaged in school. 6.For elementary charter schools, provide a daily schedule for all grade levels indicating the classes that will be provided for a one week time period. For secondary schools, provide required and elective courses for every grade level. If the school plans to phase in grade levels, include expansion grade levels by year with courses to be offered.

Include all associated costs in the proposed budget. Applicant Response: The educational program of the Redfield Tri-County Charter School (RTCCS) shall consist of grade five (5) through grade eight (8) during year one (2016-2017). RTCCS plans to have fifty (50) students in each grade the first year of operation. One grade will be added annually until the campus is a grade 5 through grade 12 campus. RTCCS will focus on college and career readiness for all students. The educational program will be designed to specifically target career preparation. As students mature, they see themselves in a particular career in their future. The study of career pathways will be incorporated into the curriculum and students throughout all grade levels will be exposed to future possible career pathways. Career inventory assessments (e.g. Explore, Plan, or Kuder) will be given to each student at the beginning of the 2016-2017 school year. The principal will provide training for all instructional staff on how to prepare students for a career interest exam and how to administer the career interest exam. This training will be accomplished during professional development sessions before the beginning of the 2016-2017 school year. The results of these inventories will assist teachers with curriculum planning for the school year. At the end of the 2016-2017 school year, the students may be assessed again to allow teachers to prepare for the upcoming year. The assessments may be done at the end of each year for years following the 2016-2017 school year if they prove valuable to improving the curricula. New students may be assessed when enrolled. The school will use all resources available throughout the community as well as tri- county area wide to provide students the accurate knowledge base concerning the requirements of specific careers and the knowledge base needed to adequately pursue and be successful in a specific career area. Students will also participate in interview scenarios that will be incorporated into both the Language Arts and Career and Technical curricula. As students progress through the educational program, they will become exposed to various career interests. As Page 18 of 51the charter school grows, more in depth educational opportunities such as concurrent credit programs or apprenticeship programs will be added. As this happens, the students will not only be allowed, but encouraged to participate in post-secondary courses (both college and vocational). These may be taken through either distance learning opportunities provided at the charter school or at a post-secondary institution that the charter school has contracted with to provide such courses. The leadership and faculty will work closely with the Arkansas Department of Career Education (ACE) Career and Technical Education as well as colleges and vocational schools to establish programs of study that address the interests of the students. Students may be exposed to various learning and instructional strategies but the foundational base of instruction throughout all curricular areas in all grades will focus on a variety of learning strategies. The educational program will incorporate the use of technology into as many aspects of the curriculum as possible in order to prepare students for future college and career opportunities. Our school will foster an atmosphere where education is valued and students will be encouraged to build relationships with their fellow students and teachers. The use of groups during learning activities will encourage the development of these relationships and provide opportunities to strengthen communication and interpersonal skills. Cross-curricular instruction will allow teacher flexibility with instruction and allow multiple presentation opportunities of specific frameworks to ensure student mastery. Each day will provide an opportunity for students to participate in peer tutoring. This opportunity will reinforce the students' understanding of the information they are providing tutoring to their peers. Hours students spend tutoring their peers will be recorded as volunteer hours. Social development of our students will be enhanced by focusing on core character values. It is our intent to work with Charter Education Partnership (CEP) and to pursue becoming a National School of Character. CEP works to combine all facets - educators, students, parents, and community - to create safe, caring, and respectful schools where students flourish academically and do the right thing. Until the charter can go through the application process for CEP, we will focus on character values and select a \"Student of the Month\" from each grade that exhibits the character value being emphasized. Service of others will also be emphasized. Experience with community service will allow the students to realize the joy that comes from helping others and helping their community. It will allow them to realize the power they have as an individual to bring positive change to themselves and others. Teachers will meet to plan lessons across the curriculum in subject areas and grade levels. It is expected that teachers who teach the same grade level and those who teach the same subject will work together to collaborate on lessons, pacing guides, resources, and student expectations during planning time and professional development. Teachers are expected to use strategies in the class that will enhance the teaching and learning environment for scholars and the teachers. Teachers will be trained to conduct peer-observations during their planning time. Teachers will be expected to share effective teaching practices, techniques and systems. Teachers will participate in weekly grade level meetings and/or subject area meetings to reflect on teaching strategies, coaching, and peer observations. Teachers will lead staff training by sharing effective strategies and STEM activities implemented in the class. Teachers are expected to be flexible in classes and allow for differentiation of learning which means several teaching strategies can be used during a single class session. The goal of teaching the Common Core State Standards Curriculum and Arkansas Framework is for students to be active and engaged learners. Teachers are expected to be prepared with lessons and classroom resources. The Lesson Plan and Curriculum Map are tools teachers will have to guide instruction and student engagement. One way to keep students engaged is to have hands on activities, visual aids and technology integrated into lessons. Teachers will have an opportunity during professional development to establish systems and strategies to implement the STEM curriculum. Teaching Strategies that may be used during instructional time may include: Co-teaching/Team Teaching Whole group instruction One-on-one teacher instruction Experiential Learning Computer Activities Role-playing Project-based Learning Page 19 of 51Small group instruction Teachers are expected to be creative and reach each child in the classroom during instructional time. Teachers are expected to establish systems for classroom management and behavior management to optimize the amount of time available to teach during scheduled instructional time. Workshops and professional development will be ongoing and will address strategies for effective classroom teaching and behavior management and implementing the curriculum. All teachers will be expected to emphasize reading and listening skills as a part of students' daily learning habits. Lessons are expected to reflect the different learning styles and incorporate appropriate activities for the differences that might exist in levels of student engagement, achievement and skills set. The continuation or renewal of the RTCCS open-enrollment public charter is contingent on acceptable student performance on assessment instruments adopted by the State Board and on compliance with any accountability provision specified by the open-enrollment public charter. RTCCS will strive to improve student performance on assessment instruments adopted by the State Board. Our intent is for all students to become part of our school community. It will also be a priority for us to involve community members. Volunteers will be a part of our school community as well. We will work with local community service organizations to involve our students and staff in projects to help individuals, families, and organizations in our community. As a charter school, we will also be working closely with our parents to raise funds as needed, to tackle projects around the school, and to encourage parents to be actively involved in their child's education and extracurricular activities. Our immediate goal will be to improve the students' interest and involvement in their education. This will help reduce truancy and behavior issues for our students if they have a history of these issues. Our long-term goal is to instill the love of learning in each and every student. We realize that not every student will continue on to college. Their path may lead them to a technical school, a vocational school, or directly into the job market. Whatever their path, they will enjoy success if they are life-long learners. Teachers and staff will utilize professional development networks. These networks will allow our personnel to take part in free on-line professional development courses in project-based learning. It will also provide a means for our personnel to collaborate with other teachers instructing their students using the inquiry-based methods. One example of such a resource is Buck Institute for Education ( www.bie.org ). RTCCS will also apply to become a member of the Arkansas Public School Resource Center (APSRC) and work with the Arkansas Department of Education. These entities will provide consulting and guidance in areas such as law, finance, technology, teaching and learning and will be valuable assets and resources as the charter develops from a 5th through 8th campus to a 5th through 12h campus. 8. Describe the process that will be used to ensure all curriculum materials used in the educational program are aligned with the Arkansas Curriculum Frameworks and the state standards as adopted, and periodically revised, by the State Board of Education. Applicant Response: Upon receiving authorization for a charter school, the RTCCS Board of Directors will begin the process of hiring a Director for the Redfield Tri-County Charter School. The Director will also be serving as the principal during the first year of operation for the Redfield Tri-County Charter School. The Principal will be responsible for the process of aligning the curriculum to be utilized by the charter school with the Arkansas Curriculum Frameworks and the curriculum requirements of the Common Core State Standards as adopted by the State Board of Education. RTCCS plans on taking full advantage of any and all assistance available from the Arkansas Department of Education in this endeavor. Monies have been budgeted for submitting an application to become a member of the Arkansas Public School Resource Center (APSRC). APSRC could also be a valuable source of assistance aligning the charter's curriculum. RTCCS budgeted to be able to hire the services of a Curriculum Specialist to assist in this task as well. Aligning the curriculum will be the top priority for the newly hired Director/ Page 20 of 51Principal. The Principal will utilize the ADE, the APRSC, and the services of a curriculum specialist if necessary along with research and their experience to successfully complete this task as expeditiously as possible. RTCCS is estimating it will take approximately four (4) to six (6) weeks for the Principal to complete the alignment but the process will continue after the initial alignment. RTCCS will require the Principal to complete the alignment of the curriculum with the Arkansas Curriculum Frameworks and the Common Core State Standards before 01 June 2016. As teachers are hired, the principal will work with them to ensure the development of lesson content is consistent with the Arkansas Curriculum Frameworks and the Common Core State Standards. The Principal will be responsible for ensuring the curriculum materials used by RTCCS are reviewed annually to ensure continued alignment with the Arkansas Curriculum frameworks and the Common Core State Standards to address any revisions by the State Board of Education. 9. Describe the manner in which the school will make provisions for the following student services, even in each area for which a waiver is requested: A) Guidance program; Applicant Response: The charter will provide guidance to students on course selection, career counseling, and personal/ social developing counseling. The teachers will provide guidance program services such as advising students on course selection. This will be done as-needed due to the counselor position being a parttime position during the first year of operation. The part-time counselor will be focused on career counseling and providing opportunities for the students to be exposed to information on a variety of jobs and career fields. B) Health services; Applicant Response: A waiver will be requested for the requirements of Health Services. RTCCS will be contracting out the health services utilizing a part-time nurse. These services will include keeping medical records in accordance with privacy statutes, attending to students with minor illnesses, providing aid until emergency responders arrive on site for serious injuries, and the responsibility of creating and maintaining the campus health and safety policies. The charter will contract the screening, referral, and follow-up procedures for all students. The contractor will also be responsible for providing and maintaining current health appraisals records for all students according with guidelines developed by the Arkansas Department of Education. IAW Act 1565 of 1999, the contractor will also provide students with special care needs, including chronically ill, medically fragile, and technology dependent, and students with other health impairments will have an Individualized Health Care Plan. The contractor will also perform invasive medical procedures required by students and provided at school because they must be performed by trained, licensed personnel who are licensed to perform the task. The contractor will also provide custodial health care services required by students under an Individualized Health Care Plan. Daily responsibilities for student health issues not requiring a licensed person perform them will be performed by the Principal's administrative assistant. Daily responsibilities requiring a licensed person to perform them will be scheduled while the part-time nurse is on campus. C) Media center; Applicant Response: A waiver will be requested for the requirements of a Media Center. RTCCS will have a media center with a minimum of 3000 books. There will also be at least four (4) computers in the media center for students to use the first year of our school's operation. Computers will be added to the media center as the student population and need for computer access grows. Teachers, Counselor, and Administrative Assistant will be available the first year to assist students in the Media Center during the first year of operation. There will be a part-time media specialist available the second year of operation to instruct the students on the use of the computer and the development of research skills. The media specialist will become a full-time position in the third year of Page 21 of 51operation. There will be an additional Computer Lab area with a minimum of twenty-five (25) computers. This lab area will be used for computer classes and for completin g online assessments. D) Special education; Applicant Response: RTCCS will not request a waiver from the requirements of a special education program. The school will provide all necessary services and accommodations for students identified with special needs as outlined in their IEP. A special education teacher will be responsible for all aspects of the school's special education services program, work cooperatively with parents, teachers and others concerning identification and assessment of students, development and implementation of student individual education plans and compliance with all federal and state guidelines concerning the program. RTCCS will provide an Individual Education Program for each student with a disability. Our staff will diligently work to provide students with disability the accommodations and services they need to be successful in school. Parents, teachers, and school administrators will work together as a team to provide an optimum learnin g opportunit y for the students with disabilities. E) Transportation; Applicant Response: Once RTCCS receives authorization for a charter, two used school buses will be purchased. The buses will pass inspection and be maintained as mandated by the state of Arkansas. RTCCS bus routes will not be a traditional route. We plan on providing \"satellite pick-up\" for students using fully certified bus drivers. The drivers will be contracted and will meet all training requirements as specified by the State of Arkansas and hold a Commercial Driver's License. Bus drivers will also pass a physical examination given by a licensed physician or an advanced practice nurse at least every two (2) years. Satellite pick-up/drop off locations will be identified. The Director/Principal will map out bus routes for the area in an approximate twenty (20) mile radius of the charter school. RTCCS will provide a satellite pick-up for the students. Sites and times for pick up and drop off will be identified and published so parents and students are aware of the site(s) closest to them. The charter will either provide maintenance or secure a routine maintenance agreement with a qualified mechanic to ensure safe maintenance and operation of the buses. Over time as our student population grows, our transportation methodolo gy could transform into a more traditional bus route. F) Alternative education, including Alternative Learning Environments; Applicant Response: RTCCS has asked for a waiver for the exclusion of Alternate Learning Environments at this time. We will be using a variety of teaching methods and the small school setting will allow teachers and staff to know each student. The RTCCS educational approach will allow the teachers to identify each student's strengths and weaknesses and convey information accordingly. Our approach will provide additional instructional time each day to address any educational weaknesses. We will also have a strict disciplinary policy to control any behavior that might distract students. G) English Language Learner (ELL) instruction Applicant Response: RTCCS will administer the English Language Development Assessment (ELDA) as required by the ADE. The test administer will complete all necessary training before administering the ELDA and meet any other requirement specified by the ADE. The school will utilize the results of the ELDA to determine what type of English Language instruction is appropriate for the ELL student. The majority of the students are assisted through English immersion. In addition to immersion, the charter will also offer small-group interventions and high-quality vocabulary instruction during the day. Supplemental assignments and utilizing instructional Page 22 of 51activities that would present an opportunity for students with different English language proficiencies to work together in pairs in a structured environment may also be used to augment the charter's approach to English Language Learner Services. RTCCS did budget a stipend for the staff member responsible for ensuring the charter complies with federal and state ELL regulations, recordkeeping and confidentiality regulations, and knowledge of diagnostic testing. This staff member will be responsible for working with the teachers of students with ELL needs to ensure the instructional strategies that best fits the students are being used and for administering the annual ELDA testing requirements. RTCCS will work with the ADE to ensure all of the requirements for ELL are addressed and satisfied. If additional funding needs to be budgeted to cover travel or training expenses for the staff member responsible for ELL, RTCCS will work with the ADE to determine an appropriate amount to include in the budget. H) Gifted and Talented Program. Applicant Response: RTCCS intends to identify students who will benefit from an accelerated educational program and incorporate learning strategies into the student's individual instructional program to enhance the educational process for the students. Gifted and talented students could be nominated by teachers, staff, parents, community members, or by self-nomination. Students could also be identified for consideration as a gifted and talented based on academic performance on standardized tests. A consultant will be hired to oversee the Gifted and Talented program. Each of the gifted and talented student's teachers will work with the consultant to integrate opportunities in the classroom environment to enrich their learning experience. The social and emotional needs of the gifted child will be met through peer interaction on projects and other planned activities (e.g. field trips, guest speakers) as well as through content satisfying to the intellectual needs of the student. 10. Describe the geographical area to be served by the charter. List all school districts within the geographical area likely to be affected by the open-enrollment public charter school. Applicant Response: RTCCS will service the city of Redfield and its surrounding areas within an approximately twenty (20) mile radius. This will include the eastern portion of Grant County and a small area in Saline County which falls under the Sheridan School District. We will also serve areas in Jefferson County which are located in the White Hall School District. These areas include Redfield and Jefferson. To the north, we will serve the Hensley and Woodson Lateral areas in Pulaski County Special School District. We expect that approximately 60% of the students will be from the White Hall School District with the other students coming from the Sheridan School District, and the Pulaski County Special School District at varying percentages. These numbers are speculation because enrollment at RTCCS will be open to any student from Arkansas that wants to attend and will not be limited to the school districts identified in our response. Enrollment in RTCCS will be open to any Arkansas student who submits an application to attend.Page 23 of 5111. Describe the plan for the school officials to provide an annual report to parents, the community, and the authorizer that demonstrates the progress made by the charter school during any previous academic year in meeting its academic performance objectives. ( See ADE Rules Governing Standards for Accreditation of Arkansas Public Schools and School Districts.) Applicant Response: RTCCS will comply with annual progress report requirements as stated in the Arkansas Department of Education Rules of Governing Public Charter Schools, Section 6.03.1.4 and in the Standards for Accreditation, Standard II, Goals and Administration of Arkansas Public Schools and School Districts, if it applies to charters. Feedback from parents and the community will be used to annually develop a comprehensive progress report. This report will include updated data regarding student performance, program objectives, and accreditation standards. RTCCS will also create a School Improvement Plan annually to project campus needs and to identify any deficiencies so they can be corrected. All reports will be based on Arkansas Department of Education regulations and guidelines. Annual reports will be published in a newspaper with general circulation in the district where the charter school is located. The reports will also be published on the RTCCS web site. Current guidance mandates these reports will be published no later than November 15. Printed copies of the reports will be available for review at RTCCS. RTCCS will host an annual public gathering in order to provide information regarding the educational program and campus policies and goals. This public gathering will be publicized using flyers sent home with students and posted in the local area and on the RTCCS web site. This public gathering will allow for parents, students, and any interested parties to exchange ideas and suggestions regarding the educational program, the school campus, and the content of the annual report. The school will be in compliance with rules and regulations concerning annual reports to the parents through public meetings, board meetings and website requirements. As performance data becomes available for the school, the school will provide that information as required b y state code and rules and re gulations that appl y. 12. Describe the enrollment criteria and recruitment processes, that will provide an equal opportunity for all parents and students to learn about and apply for admission to the proposed public charter school. Applicant Response: All students are welcome at RTCCS. Students will be asked to provide a transcript from the school they are moving from to attend the RTCCS but the RTCCS administration and board members understand that transcripts from prior schools cannot be required for students to enroll and attend RTCCS. RTCCS will not discriminate in our admissions policy on the basis of gender, national origin, race, ethnicity, religion, disability, or academic or athletic eligibility. RTCCS may exclude a student who has been expelled from another public school district in accordance with Title 6 of the Arkansas Code. Students will be recruited from the city of Redfield and other surround communities like Jefferson, White Hall, as well as students in the eastern portion of Grant County and the portion of Saline County that are part of the Sheridan School District that are within an approximately 15 to 20 mile radius of Redfield. RTCCS will use methods such as our internet presence ( www.redfieldtricountycharterschool.org ), direct mailings, flyers, and newspaper advertisements to inform the public about our school.Page 25 of 51will have to apply the following year to be eligible for any openings. If there are more applications than openings the following year, another lottery will be announced and held. All applications submitted for the current school year will be in the lottery. The number of openings in the grade will determine how many will be accepted to enroll and how man y will be on the waitin g list. If it is believed that the use of a weighted lottery is required by federal court or administrative order, explain and furnish a copy of the order. Applicant Response: RTCCS does not believe the use of a weighted lottery is required by federal court or administrative order. Applicant Response:13.

Purchases greater than five hundred dollars and less than or equal to ten thousand dollars will require the signature of the director and bookkeeper. Purchases in excess of ten thousand will require board approval and the signature of the director and board president. A list of all purchases made since the last board meeting will be presented to the RTCCS Board of Directors at each of the monthly meetings. All legal and contractual agreements concerning loans and bonds, facilities (purchase or lease of land, buildings, equipment, etc.), investments, etc. will be approved by the board and signed by the director and board president no matter the cost. No lease will be entered into unless it is approved by the Commissioner of Education as long as the Commissioner of Education's approval is required by the Arkansas Department of Education. All lease agreements shall be evidenced by a lease or sublease agreement and be approved by the Board of Directors and signed by the Director after the lease has been approved by the Commissioner of Education. The lease agreement shall identif y all the terms and conditions of the lease.Page 29 of 51Complete the budget template showing a balanced budget with realistic expectations of revenue and expenditures. Provide the minimum number of students who must attend the charter in order for the school to be financially viable. Describe the method used to calculate this number. Tell who made the calculations and describe the financial expertise of the individuals who assisted in this assessment. Describe the contingency plan if fewer students than necessary for financial viability enroll before the first day of school. Provide a detailed explanation of the ways in which the charter leaders will provide the education program outlined in the application to fewer students that determined necessary for financial viability or a date certain by which charter leaders will notify the parents, leaders of surrounding districts and open-enrollment charters, and staff at the Arkansas Department of Education that the school will not open as anticipated. Explain how charter leaders will provide the education program outlined in the application if enough students for financial viability enroll and are admitted but fail to arrive when school begins. Describe preparations to pay for any unexpected, but necessary and possibly urgent expenses. Applicant Response: RTCCS completed the budget template. Several factors influenced the preparation of the budget. Keep Redfield Middle School (KRMS), a 501(c)(3) entity, owns the building where the proposed charter would be located. KRMS is willing to lease the facility along with the gym to RTCCS for $1000 a month. Since KRMS has gotten the facility, donations have also been coming in to the school. The facility has teachers' desks, computers, cafeteria tables, microwaves, printers, file cabinets, and office chairs already in the facility along with over 200 student desks. The cafeteria has been renovated and received approval by the Health Department. All of these donations are available to RTCCS for use in the charter school at no additional cost. This has greatly reduced the start-up cost for RTCCS for a grade 5 through grade 8 middle school. We understand that standing up a school is a challenge - especially financially. RTCCS considered two different scenarios. Both scenarios did not take into consideration any grants potentially awarded to RTCCS or any other sources of funding. These calculations were done by members of the board that have financial expertise. Mrs. Ann Tuck-Rowan has over 20 years of experience in corporate and government budget planning, procurement estimates, and analysis. Mr. Larry O'Briant has over 40 years of experience and has served as a middle school/high school principal, Assistant Superintendent/Chief Financial Officer and Superintendent. He is currently the Director/Financial Supervisor for the Adult Education Department under the School of Education Division at Southeast Arkansas College (SEARK) in Pine Bluff. The first scenario was based on applications to attend the school being relatively close to the maximum number of students during our first year of operation (200). RTCCS believes the minimum number of students who must attend the charter in order for the school to be financially viable as proposed in this application is 184. RTCCS asserts the school would be financially viable and prepared to address any unexpected, but necessary and possibly urgent expenses if 5% of the revenue remained after projected expenditures. RTCCS calculated 5% of the Total State Charter School Aid for 200 students which is $69,350. The budget shows Net Revenue over Expenditures of $179,250 for the first year of operation. We subtracted the $69,350 from the $179,250 resulting in $109,900 as the amount of revenue that could be lost but would leave RTCCS viable. To calculate the number of students, we divided $109,900 by $6,646 (State Foundation Funding per student) resulting in 16. RTCCS will focus heavily on recruiting beginning as soon as authorization is received. Our goal will be to Page 30 of 51surpass the 184 student count by 15 July. RTCCS will use a variety of methods for recruitment such as web site, advertisements, open house, public meetings in areas surrounding the charter school, and mailed and posted flyers. If the goal of 184 enrolled students is not met by 15 July, RTCCS will notify the parents, leaders of surrounding districts and open-enrollment charter schools, and staff at the Arkansas Department of Education that the school has not met its goal and the scheduled opening may be at risk on the first work day following the 15 July deadline. If fewer than 184 enroll before 01 August, RTCCS will notify the parents, leaders of surrounding districts and open-enrollment charters, and staff at the Arkansas Department of Education that the school will not open as anticipated. If RTCCS recruits between 184 students and 200 students but they do not arrive when school starts, RTCCS will use information from their enrollment forms to contact the students that are missing to determine their status. Charter leaders will make every attempt to get these students to attend the charter. In preparation for the potential outcome of having less than 184 students show up, charter leaders will develop a contingency plan that outlines what budget items will be reduced to absorb the impact of less than the target number of students arriving at school. These reductions will remain in place until enough students are attending to put the funding back on track. This contingency plan will be a priority and will be developed by the Director/Principal along with the RTCCS Board of Directors once authorization has been received and the Director/Principal has been hired. Funds that directly affect the schools ability to provide the education program outlined (e.g. books, assessments, salaries) in this application will be adjusted as a last resort. The second scenario was based on a low number of applications being submitted to attend the charter. RTCCS developed a second budget for this scenario based on twenty-eight (28) students in a combined 5th/6th grade class and thirty (30) students in a combined 7th/8th grade class. Many different areas of the budget were reworked to reduce the amount of expenditures (e.g. number of teaching staff, salaries for budgeted staff, not offering transportation). A copy of this budget has been included as part of the RTCCS application as the last document in the application package. Based on this scenario, RTCCS could operate with fifty-eight (58) students. RTCCS would need to work with the ADE to have the flexibility to restructure class structure and staffing. For this scenario, if fifty-eight (58) students are not enrolled by 01 May, RTCCS will notify the parents, leaders of surrounding districts and open-enrollment charter schools, and staff at the Arkansas Department of Education that the school is not on track to meet its goal and the scheduled opening may be at risk on the first work day following the 01 May deadline. RTCCS would begin working with the ADE to restructure classes and staffing. If fewer than fifty-eight (58) students enroll before 31 May, RTCCS will notify the parents, leaders of surrounding districts and open-enrollment charters, and staff at the Arkansas Department of Education that the school will not open as anticipated. 16. Describe the manner in which an annual audit of the financial and programmatic operations of the school will be conducted. If the school wishes to request that the authorizer allow a licensed accountant or licensed certified public accountant, rather than the Legislative Auditor, to perform the first-year audit, identify the accountant by name, firm, address, and phone number. The named accountant must meet the requirements of ADE Rules Governing Publicly Funded Educational Institution Audit Requirements, including the prohibition on auditors providing non-audit services (such as accounting or consulting services) to auditees. A school's preference as stated in this application may not be changed without prior approval of the authorizer. Applicant Response: RTCCS shall prepare an annual certified audit of the financial condition and transactions of our school on or before 30 June each year in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United State and Government Auditing Standards issued by the Comptroller General of the United States. The audit will also contain any other data as determined by the State Board for all public schools. RTCCS will work with the Division of Legislative Auditor to prepare the required annual financial audit for our school. The RTCCS Board of Directors will review the scope and results of the audit. Any identified Page 31 of 51consequential irregularities and any identified weaknesses will be reported to the Board of Directors. The Board of Directors will be responsible for developing a corrective action plan to address items noted by the auditor. RTCCS will adhere to the practices below to ensure programmatic quality: 1. Continuous in-house academic program assessment 2. Ensure appropriate action is taken as issues related to school programs arise 3. Annual creation of a School Improvement Plan to identify and address areas that may be lacking 4. Review of curriculum to ensure its alignment with Common Core state standards 17.It is affirmed that the public charter school will participate in the Arkansas Public School Computer Network, as required by state statute and by State Board of Education rule, for reporting both education data and financial data, including grant funds or private donations received directly by the charter school. Yes No 18.Describe the facilities to be used. Give the present use of the facility. If the facility to be used for the school is a facility of a school district, describe the terms established by the local school board of the district stipulating the relationship between the proposed public charter school and the district pertaining to the use of the facility. Attach a copy of the agreement, signed by the president of the local school board, the chair or president of the governing body of the proposed open-enrollment public charter school, and the chief operating officer of the proposed charter. If the facility is not operated by a school district, attach a copy of the Facilities Utilization Agreement, signed by the entity owning or operating the facility and the chief operating officer of the proposed charter. A proposed lease may also be submitted but is not required. Please note that any lease or other debt must be approved by the Commissioner of Education. Applicant Response: RTCCS will be located at 101 School Street in Redfield, AR. This facility was used as a school until June 2013. It was purchased by Keep Redfield Middle School and is currently serving as a community center for Redfield. The facility is being used for a General Equivalency Diploma (GED) class and by organizations such as Boy Scouts and the Redfield Athletic Association. A basketball camp was held in June 2015 and an Archery Class by the Arkansas Game and Fish Commission was held in July 2015. It has eight (8) large rooms that could be used as classrooms, a gym, a cafeteria, an auditorium with a stage, and several other rooms that could be used as a library, computer lab, and office spaces. Page 32 of 51 There are no known establishments within a half mile of the land that participate in the sale of alcohol. RTCCS will not allow students into the buildings until the school has obtained a certificate of occupancy issued by the local code official approved by the state fire marshal, a certificate of occupancy or other approval of the state fire marshal, or a certificate of substantial completion issued by a licensed architect. The occupancy limits of the facility will be determined by the local code official or state fire marshal. Identify the owner(s) of the proposed facility and describe their relationship, if any, with: (1) Members of the local board of the public school district where the proposed open- enrollment public charter school will be located, (2) Employees of the public school district where the proposed open-enrollment public charter school will be located, (3) The eligible entity sponsoring the open-enrollment public charter school, or (4) Employees/directors/administrators of the sponsoring entity or proposed open- enrollment public charter school. Applicant Response: Keep Redfield Middle School owns the proposed facility. (1) Currently there are no known relationships between the members of the entity that owns the land and the members of the local board of the public school district where the proposed open-enrollment public charter school will be located. (2) Currently there are no known relationships between the owners of the proposed facility and the employees of the public school district where the proposed open-enrollment public charter school will be located. (3) Currently there is one (1) member of the board of the entity that owns the facility that is a member of the RTCCS Board of Directors. Todd Dobbins serves on both boards. (4) Currently there is one (1) member of the board of the entity that owns the facility that is a member of the RTCCS Board of Directors. Todd Dobbins serves on both boards.Page 33 of 51The facility will be in compliance with all requirements for accessibility in accordance with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) and all other state and federal laws and local zoning ordinances. Yes No If the facility does not currently meet these requirements, provide a list of items that will need to be addressed to bring the facility into compliance. Also include a statement of permissible uses for the facility from the local zoning authority, and whether there are any alcohol sales within 1,000 feet of the facility. Applicant Response: The leased facility will need to have an ADA compliant bathroom built in the facility. The lessor will remodel and provide ADA compliant bathroom. No other issues with the facility are known at this time. There are no known establishments within a half mile of the land that participate in the sale of alcohol. No lease will be signed until it has been approved by the Commissioner of Education.Page 34 of 51(A) Any other individual specifically identified by name in Section A of the application; (B) Any individual or entity with whom the sponsoring entity or charter school has contracted, or intends to contract, to provide any services or products for the proposed charter school; and/or (C) The owner(s) of the facilities to be used. For the purpose of this prompt, an individual has a financial relationship with another individual or entity if he or she: (1) Receives compensation or benefits directly or indirectly from the entity or individual; (2) Is an officer, director, partner, employee, or owner of more than 5% of the shares of an entity that is a corporation, partnership, sole proprietorship, or LLC; and/or (3) Has a family member (spouse, sibling, parent or child, or the spouse employee, or owner of more than 5% of the shares of an entity that is a corporation, partnership, sole proprietorship, or LLC. 19.For each and every individual specifically identified by name in Section A of the application (the contact person, chief operating officer, board members, and other individuals), identify any family or financial relationship which may exist between that individual and: Applicant Response: James Kight, Vice-President of RTCCS Board of Directors is the father of member, Amanda Kight. Mr. Kight has no other family or financial relationships with any other RTCCS Board of Directors members, any individual or entity with whom the sponsoring entity or charter school has contracted, or intends to contract, to provide any services or products for the proposed charter school, or the owner(s) of the facilities (land) to be used. Larry O'Briant, Ann Tuck-Rowan, and Ken Shollmier have no known family or financial relationships with any other RTCCS Board of Directors members, any individual or entity with whom the sponsoring entity or charter school has contracted, or intends to contract, to provide any services or products for the proposed charter school, or the owner(s) of the facilities (land) to be used. Todd Dobbins, member of the RTCCS Board of Directors is the husband of Stacy Dobbins, owner of Dobbins Contracting. Dobbins Contracting may be a bidder on projects that RTCCS contracts out. Mr. Todd Dobbins is also the owner of Dobbins Trucking. Dobbins Trucking may be a bidder on projects that RTCCS contracts out if Arkansas code \u00a76-24-105 allows. If either of the Dobbins' companies are capable of performing the specified work, meet Arkansas code \u00a76-24-105 requirements, and are the lowest bid, they would be awarded the contract. Procedures will be put in place to get competitive bids on all projects and to ensure bids are confidential until being reviewed by the RTCCS Board of Directors.Page 35 of 51Explain the procedures to be followed if a conflict of interest is identified. The procedures must ensure that all actions are in the best interest of the school and the students at the school. Applicant Response: In connection with any actual or possible conflict of interest, an interested person must disclose the existence of the financial interest and be given the opportunity to disclose all material facts to the directors and members of the committees with governing board delegated powers considering the proposed transaction or arrangement. After disclosure of the financial interest and all material facts, and after any discussion with the interested person, he/she shall leave the governing board or committee meeting while the determination of a conflict of interest is discussed and voted upon. The remaining board or committee members shall decide if a conflict of interest exists. Procedures To Address The Conflict of Interest a. An interested person may make a presentation at the governing board or committee meeting, but after the presentation he/she shall leave the meeting during the discussion of, and the vote on, the transaction or arrangement involving the possible conflict of interest. b. The chairperson of the governing board or committee shall, if appropriate, appoint a disinterested person or committee to investigate alternatives to the proposed transaction or arrangement. c. After exercising due diligence, the governing board or committee shall determine whether the Organization can obtain with reasonable efforts a more advantageous transaction or arrangement from a person or entity that would not give rise to a conflict of interest. d. If a more advantageous transaction or arrangement is not reasonably possible under circumstances not producing a conflict of interest, the governing board or committee shall determine by a majority vote of the disinterested directors whether the transaction or arrangement is in the Organization's best interest, for its own benefit, and whether it is fair and reasonable. In conformity with the above determination it shall make its decision as to whether to enter into the transaction or arrangement. Violations of the Conflicts of Interest Policy a. If the governing board or committee has reasonable cause to believe a member has failed to disclose actual or possible conflicts of interest, it shall inform the member of the basis for such belief and afford the member an opportunity to explain the alleged failure to disclose. b. If, after hearing the member's response and after making further investigation as warranted by the circumstances, the governing board or committee determines the member has failed to disclose an actual or possible conflict of interest, it shall take appropriate disciplinary and corrective action. In the event board members have a direct or indirect interest in companies that do business with the charter, RTCCS will follow Ark. Code Ann. 6-24-105. 20.Describe the manner in which the school will make provisions for food services. State whether the proposed charter school will apply to participate in the federal National School Lunch program or other federal nutrition programs. Applicant Response: RTCCS will be participating in the Child Nutrition Program which includes the School Breakfast Program and the National School Lunch Program (NSLP). RTCCS plans on contracting out the preparation of the school meals. Measures will be taken to ensure meals meet the NSLP standards, guidance from the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), and any state requirements. RTCCS plans on providing catered meals that are already Page 36 of 51prepared from a company such as Preferred Meals, Aramark or Tisket A Tasket to our students. A Request for Proposal will be made in order that companies can bid on the food service. Companies such as these are capable of providing the students' healthy meals in the most nutritious and economical way. RTCCS plans on contracting two part-time cafeteria workers to serve the meals, clean up, and work with the RTCCS administrative assistant to maintain all required records for food service. 21. Describe how the parents or guardians of the enrolled students and other members of the community will be involved with the school to positively impact the charter school's educational programs. Applicant Response: Parents, guardians, and members of the community will have ample opportunities to be involved in the RTCCS. Parents, guardians and members of the community will become members of the RTCCS Board of Directors and actively participate in the governance of the school. There will also be a parent/teacher organization that parents and guardians can join to be more involved in the education of their children. RTCCS also plans on recruiting volunteers from the community to work with the students on projects and speak to them about different careers. When RTCCS is able to apply to Charter Education Partnership (CEP), parents will be involved in the application process and in the implementation if RTCCS becomes a member. 22. Describe the potential impact of the proposed public charter school on the efforts of affected public school district(s) to comply with court orders and statutory obligations to create and maintain a unitary system of desegregated public schools. Applicant Response: RTCCS will comply with all applicable federal and state statutory and regulatory requirements regarding the creation and maintenance of desegregated public schools. Based on information from other open-enrollment charter applications for open-enrollment charter schools affecting the Pulaski County Special School District (PCSSD), the federal District Court has determined the PCSSD is unitary in all respects concerning inter-district student assignment. PCSSD would therefore have no existing obligations to comply with court orders or statutory obligations to create and maintain a unitary system Page 37 of 51of desegregated public schools. A motion was filed by the Little Rock School District in 2010 to enforce the 1989 Settlement Agreement in the PCSSD Desegregation case. The motion contended that an open-enrollment charter school within Pulaski County would interfere with M-M Stipulation and the Magnet Stipulation. US District Judge D.P. Marshall, Jr. denied the motion and stated \"The cumulative effect of open enrollment charter schools in Pulaski County on the stipulation magnet schools and M-to-M transfers has not, as a matter of law, substantially defeated the relevant purposes of the 1989 Settlement Agreement, the magnet stipulation, or the M-to-M stipulation.\" Little Rock School District, et al. v. North Little Rock School District et al., Lorene Joshua et al., Arkansas Virtual Academy, et al., Case No. 4:82-cv-00866-DPM, US District Court-Eastern Division of Arkansas Western Division, Document 4809. Based on this information, the 1989 Settlement Agreement does not contain any restrictions nor does there appear to be any existing federal District Court desegregation order that would prohibit the authorization of an open-enrollment charter school in Redfield due to it potentially enrolling students from the Pulaski County Special School District. 23. Explain what the charter founders and other leaders are doing or will do to ensure the success of the charter school in perpetuity. Applicant Response: The charter founders are citizens with a vested interest in the success of the charter school in Redfield. The efforts of RTCCS to obtain an authorization for a charter school are a grass roots movement driven by the desire of the people in the area to have a school. The families in the area are not affluent but they do value education. Once authorized, the charter school in Redfield will not only provide a choice for these families for their children's education but will also be a hub of activity for all members of the communities in the area. RTCCS will cultivate a strong relationship between its students and the members of the surrounding communities by providing community support opportunities for the students. Nurturing a strong bond between the communities in the area and the students will create even stronger support for the school. RTCCS has only been able to get as far as we are in the authorization process due to citizens in the area willing to donate their time, money, and support to the pursuit of obtaining a charter school. The RTCCS Board of Directors has developed procedures and policies to ensure accountability for managing the finances of the school. Our purchasing policy is outlined earlier in this application. We are and will be fiscally responsible. RTCCS will work with the ADE and the Arkansas Public School Resource Center (APSRC) to ensure we leverage their knowledge and expertise. RTCCS also has members with years of experience developing and managing a budget as well as experience in dealing with unexpected expenses and budget cuts. Given the opportunity, RTCCS will prove to be successful and sustainable charter school.Page 38 of 5124. Complete the following table showing all sections of Title 6 of the Arkansas Code Annotated (Education Code) and State Board of Education rules, including the Standards for Accreditation of Arkansas Public Schools and School Districts , from which the public charter school seeks to be exempted in order to meet the goals of the school.

We also would like to request a waiver of Section 15.01 of the Standard for Accreditation. This request along with ou r existing request for waiver from Arkansas Code Ann. \u00a7 6-13-109 would allow us the ability to meet the unique demands of hiring a superintendent of an open enrollment charter school.

The waiver from the duty-free lunch statute will give RTCCS added flexibility in the utilization of its teacher staff.Page 41 of 51TopicStatute/ADE Rule/Standard to be WaivedRationaleTool to be Used to Measure Impact on AchievementLevel of Achievement that will Show Positive Impact Non-instructional DutiesSubtitle 2, Chapter 17, Subchapter 1, Section 6-17-117RTCCS seeks exemption from this portion of the Education Code to the extent that it requires teachers to be contracted if they are assigned to more than sixty (60) minutes of non- instructional duties per week. Instead, RTCCS requests that the time be increased to two hundred forty (240) minutes. Such a revision recognizes that open-enrollment charter schools are often required to operate on a more limited budget than their traditional public school counterparts, requiring teachers to perform both instructional and non-instructional duties to achieve efficient and economical operation of the school. SalariesSubtitle 2, Chapter 17, Subchapter 2, Section 6-17-201(c)(2), 6-17-2203, and 6-17-2403:RTCCS intends to pay certified and classified staff salaries and hourly rates based on their experience which are similar to and competitive with the salaries and rates of schools of similar size.
