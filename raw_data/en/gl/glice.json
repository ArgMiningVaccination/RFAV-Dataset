If you're not convinced, keep reading and we'll show you the research that backs these claims up. But first, let's take a look at the reasons behind bouts of restlessness and fatigue. 10 Main Causes of Low Energy 1. Sleep Issues: Over 60 million Americans struggle with sleep disorders ( [1](https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2016/p0215-enough-sleep.html)) each year, and this number is on the rise thanks to our busier lives and our reliance on distracting technology and side-effect riddled medication. 2. Poor Diet: Processed food is loaded with refined sugars, giving you an instant energy boost but sapping your energy for the rest of the day. 3. Caffeine: It may help you to wake up in the morning, but it could also be the reason you're struggling to stay awake by midday. 4. Depression: Your mental health can have a significant impact on your physical health. 5. Blood Sugar Imbalances: Diabetes is a leading cause of low energy levels. 6. Deficiencies: The body needs key vitamins and minerals to function optimally, without these nutrients conditions like anaemia (caused by a lack of iron) can develop. 7. Dehydration: By the time you feel thirsty, you may already be dehydrated and suffering the consequences. 8. Heart Disease: Chronic tiredness could stem from a serious heart condition as blockages may be stopping your blood from carrying essential oxygen around your body. 9. Alcohol: Alcohol may help you to get to sleep, but it doesn't help you to stay there. Alcohol consumption leads to low quality sleep ( [2](https://pubs.niaaa.nih.gov/publications/arh25-2/101-109.htm)). It's also a depressant that drains your energy. 10. Medications: A number of medications, from antidepressants to blood pressure meds, can lead to low energy levels. HOW TO NATURALLY IMPROVE ENERGY LEVELS You really are what you eat. A diet of processed foods and refined sugars can drastically reduce energy levels. Excessive sugar can cause liver damage and energy crashes; excessive sodium can lead to water retention and bloating; and consumption of food additives can cause hormone imbalances, weight gain and organ damage. A diet that is rich in organic whole foods, however, ensures your body is properly fueled with the nutrients it needs to thrive**.
