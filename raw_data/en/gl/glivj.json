Science has shown that healthy touch has many biological and psychological benefits\u2014healthy physical touch increases levels of our \"feel good\" neurotransmitters; it is known to boost immune function and lower blood pressure levels; and, it can lower stress and anxiety and inspire positive thinking. Ayurveda has long-incorporated the benefits of massage into its self-care philosophy with abhyanga, or self-massage, as a significant component of a daily routine. While there certainly are therapeutic applications to massage, Ayurvedic massage is largely concerned with nourishment, self-love, and calming the nervous system. Warm herbal oil is one of the avenues through which Ayurveda achieves these objectives. In Sanskrit, the word sneha means oil or unctuousness. It also means love. When we wrap ourselves in warm oil, we can imagine we are also wrapping ourselves in love. As the saying goes, you can't pour from an empty cup. Self-massage is one way to fill your love cup. Herbal Oils Banyan Botanicals is your one-stop shop for some of the finest natural and organic massage oils. What makes our oils unique is the fact that they are prepared in small batches in the traditional Ayurvedic method of cooking the raw herbs into the oil itself. This is done using low heat over a period of several days, allowing the herbal properties to be infused into the oil, making the use of these oils as a daily body oil especially beneficial as they nourish the tissues from the outside-in. Also unique to our line of oils is dosha-specific massage oils. With ashwagandha and bala, Vata Massage Oil is distinctively warming and grounding for cold vata dosha; Pitta Massage Oil offers the cooling and soothing properties of brahmi/gotu kola, guduchi, and shatavari; and Kapha Massage Oil is warming and stimulating with punarnava, chitrak, and calamus. Our Daily Massage Oil provides a tridoshic option; and Mahanarayan Oil is a wonderful choice for those with occasional sore muscles and joints.
