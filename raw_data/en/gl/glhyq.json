Divided into eight main chapters, each relating to a specific area of your life (Your Body, Your Mind, Your Heart, Your Soul, Your Emotions, Your Relationships, Your Obstacles and Your World), this book is inspired by ancient apothecaries of days gone by, which formulated medicines and dispensed healing herbs, while offering a wealth of advice and services to soothe their customers' ailments. An illuminating reminder of the healing power of crystals, The Crystal Apothecary is a book that you will return to again and again for many years to come. About the Author Gemma Petherbridge set out on her spiritual path as a small child, prophesizing in her dreams. Seeing spirits, naturally intuiting situations and gaining insight into the destinies of others came as second nature, and after losing her parents at a young age she turned to spirituality for answers. Her journey into the world of wellness and holistic therapies began in earnest when, aged twenty-three, she studied hypnotherapy. Fifteen years on, Gemma is a Certified Crystal Healer, Intuition Teacher and Soul Purpose Coach. Having transitioned from healer to teacher, she has now taught and inspired thousands of people worldwide. In 2017 she founded Conscience Crystals, which offers workshops, courses and an online shop. With her growing following, Gemma is now regularly asked to lead workshops and speak at holistic events and festivals, and major international businesses seek her guidance in incorporating crystals into office environments and products. She also presents the spiritual and holistic wellbeing podcast Soul Students. "}
