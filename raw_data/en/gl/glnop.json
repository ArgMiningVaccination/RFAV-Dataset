Although shamans' [repertoires](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/repertoires) vary from one [culture](https://www.britannica.com/topic/culture) to the next, they are typically thought to have the ability to heal the sick, to communicate with the otherworld, and often to escort the [souls](https://www.britannica.com/topic/soul-religion-and-philosophy) of the dead to that otherworld. The term shamanism comes from the [Manchu-Tungus](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Manchu-Tungus-languages) word aman. The noun is formed from the verb a- 'to know'; thus, a shaman is literally \"one who knows.\" The shamans recorded in historical [ethnographies](https://www.britannica.com/science/ethnography) have included women, men, and transgender individuals of every age from middle childhood onward. As its [etymology](https://www.britannica.com/topic/etymology) implies, the term applies in the strictest sense only to the religious systems and phenomena of the peoples of [northern](https://www.britannica.com/place/North-Asia) [Asia](https://www.britannica.com/place/Asia) and the Ural- and [Koryak](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Koryak-people). is also used more generally to describe [indigenous](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/indigenous) groups in which roles such as healer, religious leader, [counselor](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/counselor), and councillor are combined. In this sense, shamans are common among other [Arctic peoples](https://www.britannica.com/place/Arctic/The-people#ref57856), [American Indians](https://www.britannica.com/topic/American-Indian), [Australian Aborigines](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Australian-Aboriginal), and those African groups, such as the [San](https://www.britannica.com/topic/San), that retained their traditional [cultures](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/cultures) well into the 20th century. It is [generally agreed that shamanism originated](https://www.britannica.com/topic/prehistoric-religion) among [hunting-and-gathering cultures](https://www.britannica.com/topic/hunter-gatherer), and that it persisted within some herding and farming societies after the [origins of agriculture](https://www.britannica.com/topic/agriculture). It is often found in conjunction with [animism](https://www.britannica.com/topic/animism), a belief system in which the world is home to a [plethora](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/plethora) of spirit-beings that may help or hinder human endeavours. Opinions differ as to whether the term shamanism may be applied to all religious systems in which a central personage is believed to have direct intercourse with the [transcendent](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/transcendent) world that permits him to act as healer, diviner, and the like. Since such interaction is generally reached through an [ecstatic](https://www.britannica.com/topic/ecstasy-religion) or trance state, and because these are [psychosomatic](https://www.britannica.com/science/psychosomatic-disorder) phenomena that may be brought about at any time by persons with the ability to do so, the essence of shamanism lies not in the general phenomenon but in specific notions, actions, and objects connected with trance (see also [hallucination](https://www.britannica.com/science/hallucination)). Classic shamanism Shamanism as practiced in northern Asia is distinguished by its special clothing, accessories, and [rites](https://www.britannica.com/topic/ritual) as well as by the specific worldview connected with them. North Asiatic shamanism in the 19th century, which is generally taken as the classical form, was characterized by the following traits: - A society accepts that there are specialists who are able to communicate directly with the [transcendent world](https://www.britannica.com/topic/medium-occultism)and who are thereby also possessed of the ability to heal and to divine; such individuals, or shamans, are held to be of great use to society in dealing with the [spirit](https://www.britannica.com/topic/spirit-religious-being)world. - Shamans are believed to be assisted by an active spirit-being or group thereof; they may also have a passive [guardian spirit](https://www.britannica.com/topic/guardian-spirit)present in the form of an animal or a person of another sex\u2014possibly as a sexual partner. - The exceptional abilities and the consequent social role of the shaman are believed to result from a choice made by one or more supernatural beings. The one who is chosen\u2014often an adolescent\u2014may resist this calling, sometimes for years. [Torture](https://www.britannica.com/topic/torture)by the spirits, appearing in the form of physical or [mental illness](https://www.britannica.com/science/mental-disorder), breaks the resistance of the shaman candidate and he (or she) has to accept the [vocation](https://www.britannica.com/dictionary/vocation). - The [initiation](https://www.britannica.com/topic/initiation-rite)of the shaman, depending on the belief system, may happen on a transcendent level or on a realistic level\u2014or sometimes on both, one after the other. While the candidate lies as if dead, in a trance state, the body is cut into pieces by the spirits of the Yonder World or is submitted to a similar trial. The spirits' reason for cutting up the shaman's body is to see whether it has more bones than the average person. After awakening, a [rite](https://www.britannica.com/topic/ritual)of symbolic initiation, such as climbing the [World Tree](https://www.britannica.com/topic/world-tree), is occasionally performed. - One of the distinguishing traits of shamanism is the combat of two shamans in the form of animals, often reindeer or horned cattle. The combat rarely has a stated purpose but is a deed the shaman is compelled to do. The outcome of the combat means well-being for the victor and destruction for the loser. - In going into [trance](https://www.britannica.com/dictionary/trance), as well as in mystical combat and healing ceremonies, the shaman uses certain [objects](https://www.britannica.com/topic/ceremonial-object)such as a [drum](https://www.britannica.com/art/drum-musical-instrument), drumstick, headgear, gown, metal rattler, mirror, and staff. The specific materials and shapes of these instruments are useful for identifying the types and species of shamanism and following their development. - Characteristic [folklore](https://www.britannica.com/topic/folklore-academic-discipline)(oral and textual) and shaman songs have come into being as [improvisations](https://www.britannica.com/art/improvisation-music)on traditional formulas used to lure or imitate animals. Some selection of these or similar traits may be found among traditional cultures everywhere in the world. Such detached traits, however, do not necessarily indicate that a [culture](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/culture) is shamanistic, as the central personalities in such systems\u2014 [sorcerers](https://www.britannica.com/topic/sorcery), [medicine men](https://www.britannica.com/topic/medicine-man) or healers, and the like\u2014may, unlike the shaman, have attained their position through deliberate study and the application of rational knowledge. Although they perform ceremonies, hold positions of authority, and possess [magical](https://www.britannica.com/topic/magic-supernatural-phenomenon) abilities, the structure and quality of their transcendental activities are entirely different from that "}
