I've written about this Time of Transition and its implications in light of the evolution of consciousness in my article [How To Navigate This Time Of Transition And The Birth Of A New Era](https://veilofreality.com/2022/03/09/how-to-navigate-this-time-of-transition-and-the-birth-of-a-new-era/). There are impending food shortages, the threat of economic collapse, inflation, recession, as well as new \"diseases\" and \"pandemics\" announced by the \"elite,\" all of which push people more into fear and animalistic survival instinct. Over the past 2.5 years, billions of people have become traumatized because of the Corona/Covid psy-op plandemic, pushing them to get injected with an experimental mRNA vaccine for their \"health\" and \"protection\" under the pretense to get their \"normal\" life back and \"to do the right thing\". Yet, there is no normal to get back to. We are witnessing a global mental health crisis due to the lockdowns, masking, surveillance, and loss of freedom. The repercussions will affect many future generations if people don't take care of their emotional, psychological, and spiritual well-being besides their physical health. A few months ago, I came across a 100-page pdf document, [\"Corona Vaccines from the Spiritual Perspective. Consequences on Soul and Spirit and the Life after Death,\"](https://veilofreality.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Thomas-Mayer-Corona-Vaccines-from-the-Spiritual-Perspective-2.pdf) by Thomas Mayer. It contains some excerpts that were translated from the 491-page book originally published in German titled [\"Corona-Impfungen aus Spiritueller Auswirkung auf nachtodliche Leben\"](https://www.amazon.com/Corona-Impfungen-aus-spiritueller-Sicht-Auswirkungen/dp/3890608108/ref=sr_1_1?crid=6SN1A9LBJTWF&keywords=Corona-Impfungen+aus+Spiritueller+Sicht%3A+Auswirkung+auf+Seele+und+Geist+und+das+nachtodliche+Leben&qid=1651959108&sprefix=corona-impfungen+aus+spiritueller+sicht+auswirkung+auf+seele+und+geist+und+das+nachtodliche+leben%2Caps%2C136&sr=8-1). According to Thoma Mayer, a complete English translation will be available sometime in late summer 2022 based on what he told me in our correspondence. I'm very grateful and impressed with Mayer's in-depth research, careful analysis, and presentation of a topic that most people may reject right away or find \"too far out there\" as it may offend their materialistic worldview and beliefs about reality. It's certainly not a book for everyone, nor is everyone ready for it, similar to the topics covered on my website. However, in my humble opinion, it's one of the most important books written in this day and age in light of the times we're in, especially for anyone engaged in any spiritual work. The book's content is deeply revealing, confirming, and disturbing at the same time. Thomas Mayer and his team of \"supersensible\" practitioners and researchers verify my research and insights into the adverse spiritual/metaphysical consequences of the COVID vaxx [and the long-range matrix agenda] as I wrote about in other articles over the past few years: [The Long Range Matrix Agenda and What We Can Do About It](https://veilofreality.com/2021/03/04/the-long-range-matrix-agenda-and-what-we-can-do-about-it/) [The Metaphysical Consequences of the COVID Jab In Light of the Occult Matrix and The Way Out](https://veilofreality.com/2021/08/30/the-metaphysical-consequences-of-the-covid-jab-in-light-of-the-occult-matrix-and-the-way-out/) For any readers new to my work, I recommend looking into the articles in these two categories for context: For the bigger picture context, keep in mind the ultimate goal of the matrix agenda, which has been building up for thousands of years (as I've written in more depth in my essay [Timeline-Reality Split, Frequency Vibration, and the Hidden Forces of Life)](https://veilofreality.com/2016/08/02/timeline-reality-split-frequency-vibration-and-the-hidden-forces-of-life/). It is about a complete take-over of the physical vehicle [body] by the occult anti-divine forces, priming and genetically bodies for opportunities.\" In short, full-on body-snatching and possession via dislodging the spirit/essence from This \" hybridization program\" is priming humanity's transmutation into shell vessels for hyperdimensional possession. That's why the war is THROUGH us and always has been. And that's also why the solution and antidote are within us: Soul Embodiment via the Great Work and finding the Kingdom within - our true Divine Essence, which cannot be harmed. There more the soul is anchored in the body, the more we bring forth essence, dismantle the false self and connect to the Divine, and the less any adverse forces can get to us or have any negative effect on us. This article will mostly contain excerpts and case studies from Mayer's book to summarize his work along with my comments and additional insights from other teachings and modalities I've studied and practiced myself. As I mentioned before, the spiritual/metaphysical consequences of the COVID vaccines are far more detrimental and far-reaching than the physical adverse effects, for they affect the afterlife and interfere with soul evolution. Before we start, it is imperative to emphasize a crucial point as a disclaimer before getting into this material: The following information is not an easy read and can be perceived as very dark and horrifying. However, we need to be careful of paranoia, overly negative thinking (doom & gloom fear frequency), and generalizations. While the situation may look dire, disturbing, and even \"hopeless,\" we need to stay non-reactive and objective as best as possible. I see a tendency in today's \"truth movement\" and \"conspiracy world\" of over-exaggerated fear and negative sentiments filled with shadow projections and superiority complexes, looking down on the \"sleeping\" masses to the point of projecting hate and pathological anger. This information can also easily be abused and distorted by anyone without a grounded psychological and spiritual foundation and self-awareness. As Thomas Mayer wrote in his book, everyone is affected by the vaccine differently on an individual basis, so we cannot make generalizations. Many known and unknown factors come in: how many doses/boosters a person received, the person's level of being, soul development, spiritual strength, karmic and spiritual lessons, and much more that is impossible for the mind to grasp. \"It is important for me to emphasize that this is not about ideology, but about empirical perception and truth-seeking. Science and spiritual research are always an open process of the search for truth. It must not be driven by personal preferences. ...The aim is not to stimulate negative emotions, but to present research results in a sober and comprehensible way and to point out ways out of the impasse. But ways out can only be found through understanding. That is why there is no way around taking a detailed look at vaccines and their effects, even if the results are unpleasant..... It is not about a \"harmless jab\", but about a powerful impulse to initiate a change in the human body, so that it is damaged in its basic evolutionary function as the vehicle for the soul-spiritual being of Man. This impulse can also block human being's existence after death. In this respect it really is about the fundamental question of the future of mankind: Do we want to become a kind of \"human- machine\" or do we want to remain soul-spiritual beings? It transpires that the four main Corona vaccines [Pfizer BioNTech, Moderna, AstraZeneca, and Johnson&Johnson] in the Western countries, taken as a whole, are a strong attack on the physical body and the energy body. Through this attack, these bodies can become unreachable (blocked) for the higher members of the supersensible human being. Likewise, the angel and the body-elemental-being can be pushed aside. As a result, in the afterlife, this can lead to the condition of being chained to Earth and a very long suffering for the deceased. Of course, the effect varies from person to person. There are people who can cope with the side effects of these vaccines and even transform them to a great extent. I say this already here, to make clear from the beginning that certain fundamental questions remain open: - - In how many people do such effects occur? This, among others, seems to depend on the soul-spiritual \"defense mechanism\" a person can deploy against the vaccination. - To what extent are the soul-spiritual consequences of vaccination naturally processed (neutralized) in the course of time? - How strong are the consequences for the future incarnations? - With which therapeutic means can a processing (neutralization) be supported? - It is important for me to emphasize that this is not about ideology, but about empirical perception and truth-seeking. Science and spiritual research are always an open process of the search for truth. It must not be driven by personal preferences. The situation is not hopeless. I experience again and again that lofty spiritual beings look at the Corona crisis and vaccinations with calmness and confidence. It is a trial from which in the long run much good can come, even if today it is overwhelming for most people. We can yet grow from the corona inoculations, only we must approach this spiritual confrontation with sufficient activity. This is equally true for the unvaccinated as well as for the vaccinated.\" - Thomas Mayer Rudolf Steiner, Anthroposophy, and Supersensible Research The material and research presented in Mayer's book are based on Rudolf Steiner's work and Anthroposophy. The effects of the vaccine on the astral/energy body, soul, and the afterlife are based on Steiner's cosmology and interpretation of supersensible worlds. Mayer has contacted 50 people (practitioners and bodyworkers) with extrasensory perception and collected their reports. Most practitioners are also trained in Steiner's work/healing modalities, and this is important to keep in mind when reading the information. \"The Goethean researcher Rudolf Steiner (1861-1925) became a pioneer of modern supersensible investigation. His 354 books with writings and lectures contain infinite depths. He attempted to create a broad foundation for the science of the spiritual world on which humanity can to further build. The term \"anthroposophy\" was coined by Rudolf Steiner with a similar meaning as \"natural science\" or \"social science\". It is about the fully conscious perception and exploration of the supersensible world in all its ramifications and beings. The natural science is divided into physics, chemistry, geology, biology etc. Anthroposophy is subdivided into science of ethers, angelic science, science of elemental beings, science of the dead, karmic science, etc. Just as natural science is based on a theory of knowledge and scientific methodology, in anthroposophy the training in meditative way and the methodology of supersensible perception is elaborated in many ways.... The essential methods of perception of extrasensory research - Imagination, Inspiration, and Intuition - were described in detail by Rudolf Steiner, for example in the book The Stages of Higher Knowledge.... It takes years of practice, meditation, working with one's own inner shadows, and study of anthroposophy and other sciences of the soul and spiritual world. It is important that the research rests on a broad background of experience. \" - Thomas Mayer I see many similarities between Steiner's work to other esoteric occult teachings that interpret the \"supersensible\" worlds through their own words and symbolism. For example, there are similarities between Sri Aurbobind's cosmology based on Integral Yoga and Steiner's Anthroposophy as explored in [this paper.](https://veilofreality.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Steiner_and_Aurobindo.pdf) Mayer also acknowledged that it is not easy to describe or interpret the non-physical reams in words: \"It is not easy to find words for the supersensible perceptions simply because there are no words that could describe them. This is often only possible by means of reference to the physical world. For example, when we speak of \"holes in the aura\", we are not referring to holes that are visible to the senses, but to areas of the soul that are not penetrated by the I, and into which foreign feelings and beings can enter and persist. Also, the \"hole\" can be the region through which the spiritual and etheric-life force is lost.\" In his book, Mayer gives a general overview of the main concepts of Steiner's Spiritual Science and cosmology, including the various types of members of the human, beings, and entities. In the context of this article, I will briefly outline some of them quoted from his book: \"I would like to emphasize that this is not a theory or a belief system. In the supersensible perceptions, one constantly encounters these beings. It is a condition of a healthy spiritual path of knowledge that one learns to deal with these dark entities as well. The adversarial Spirits Lucifer, Ahriman, Asuras: Besides the angelic hierarchies, which are oriented toward the divine love, there are also \"fallen angels\". Without their resistance, the world could not develop. They also constitute us human beings. Among them are the Luciferic, Ahrimanic, and Asuric \"dark\" angelic beings described in detail in Anthroposophy. The ahrimanic beings are the spirits of materialism, coldness, and darkness; the luciferic beings are the spiritless ones of arrogance, egomania and blinding light, the asuric beings are the spirits of fragmentation and dissolution of the \"I\". In Sanskrit, the term \"asuras\" is used as an \"evil spirit\" or opponent of the gods, as a generic term. Rudolf Steiner, on the other hand, uses it to refer to a special kind of fallen angelic beings. Soratic spirits: These are the fourth group of the adversary spirits, which originate from spirit realms in distant cosmic times and expanses outside of our planetary system. They have no business in the spiritual space of the earth, but they are pushing their way in, nevertheless. They seduce people because they promise great power. People addicted to power easily fall for soratic beings, who are the inspirers of all evil. They are described in the Bible - in the Revelation of John, the Apocalypse, - as the two-horned beast. In the Gnosis the term Archons refers to them. Soratic Transhumanism spirits: A special group of soratic beings are called here transhumanism spirits because they seem to inspire transhumanism. These are central to the understanding of Covid19 and the vaccines. Since these beings are associated with the very highest adversarial powers, it can be assumed that all processes emanating from them are extremely harmful to humans. This will become more understandable in the course of this book. Vaccine-Beings: Every vaccine has a being in the spiritual world, a kind of living original idea (one could also say \"group soul\" and \"group spirit\"). This is not an abstract idea, but a multiform spirit space filled with consciousness; a being-structure. With the vaccination those enter the human aura and work within it. In such case, there is the \"great\" vaccine being in the lower layers of the spiritual world and at the same time \"smaller\" replicas - one could also say \"descendants\" - working in the human aura. The vaccine-being is connected with other spirit beings, which give it a special character. For example, if it is connected with certain ahrimanic beings, they work through the vaccine- being in the vaccinated person. If it is connected with soratic spirits, then soratic spirits gain access into the members of the human being. Disease-Beings (Beings of Illness): Every disease also has a being in the spiritual world, which connects with the human being when needed.\" Some of these beings/entities listed above have been interpreted and given different names according to various occult esoteric teachings. For example, Sri Aurobindo's name of Disease-Beings is Forces of Illness. Supersensory Observations On Vaccinated People [case studies] Many of us know already about the detrimental physical effects of the COVID jabs on the body as more and more data and facts are coming out (even though it is denied, ridiculed, or censored by the mainstream consensus). However, as Mayer notes, \"the adverse effects of Corona vaccinations on the body are only the tip of the iceberg.\" Let's look at some of the case studies presented in Mayer's book and how the Corona vaccines adversely affect the \"members\" of the human being. \"Members\" are the different \"bodies,\" both physical and non-physical, that constitute a human being. For example, in Steiner's cosmology, there is the Material body, Astral body, Etheric body, Soul, The \"I\", the Angel, the Double, etc. For a brief description of each \"member\" see Mayer's book (in German) or the pdf except [both are linked at the beginning of this article.] \"The human being lives also in all areas of the supersensible world and consists of many higher members (bodies), which together form the human aura in its complexity. In former times, these members - often under different names - were part of a cognitive inquiry and spiritual traditions. Today the best-known entity among these members is the material body.\" Before sharing these case studies, Mayer makes an important disclaimer again not to fall into the trap of making generalizations since the vaccines affect everyone differently as mentioned before \"The following research and reports show that the corona vaccinations can have strong disturbing effects on the members of the human being. Of course, this varies from individual to individual. ...Each individual case must be observed anew. I write this in order to warn against generalizations. It is all about sharpening the attention and the power of perception.\" Let's start with two reports from 2 different CranioSacral therapists who have worked on clients that have taken the COVID vaxx. These cases fascinated me since I had also learned, got certified in, and practiced CranioSacral (CS) therapy on many clients when I worked as a professional bodyworker for over 15 years. In my past work as a bodyworker, an entity sometimes also revealed itself during a CS session [not related to any vaccines], but the client was able to purge it out. Yet, more work needed to be done to close/heal the entry point, and the client was required to take self-responsibility for her psychological, emotional, mental, and spiritual health. Based on experience, just \"removing entities\" is not enough. In my experience, it is extremely rare not to feel/perceive the CS pulse at all. The CS pulse/rhythm occurs about 6 - 12 cycles a minute based on the spinal fluid expanding/retracting between the cranium and the sacrum. It is also called the \"breath of life.\" The stronger the pulse, the healthier the organism - body/mind/spirit. These reports also verify my insights/research that these vaccines create entry points for hostile entities to take over the body and \"eject\" the soul. Report 1: I Have Not Experienced This In Any Treatment In The Last 20 Years A rhythmical massage and craniosacral therapist from Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, Germany, wrote in May 2021: \"I have been working as a rhythmical masseuse since the 80s and as a craniosacral therapist for about 20 years. During my many years of therapeutic work, I have treated adults and children with very different issues. During a craniosacral treatment, a well-trained therapist with clairvoyant hands can sense changes within the body structure of the client. The therapist takes the client's feet or head in their hands. During such treatments, I can very specifically perceive pain points and blockages in the whole body of the client. I can also perceive the condition of various organs of the client. One of the basic skills of craniosacral therapists is the perception of craniosacral rhythms. Since the beginning of the Corona vaccination campaign in Germany, I have treated two vaccinated clients. The experience of these two vaccinated with mRNA vaccines was new to me and at first frightening. In five craniosacral treatments performed so far, holding the head with both hands repeated the perception of holding a completely hollow, empty head. The etheric brain and the pineal gland felt dried up and shriveled. Also, the otherwise perceptible surficial craniosacral rhythm was not perceptible. With none of my other clients, after more than 20 years of experience, have I ever had such experiences.\" She continued to do four more sessions on her patient and noticed some healing progress: \"With the third treatment, a clear improvement was experienced. The etheric body and the craniosacral rhythms were more clearly felt. After the third treatment, the client performed a liver cleanse according to Andreas Moritz, followed by a colon hydro-cleansing....During the fourth craniosacral treatment, the pineal gland was again more perceptible, and the client spoke of no longer being just functional, but of being more in tune with herself, more able to concentrate and perceive herself....\" This is definitely good news as Thomas Mayer noted: \"This pleasant report shows that it is possible to overcome the blocking supersensory effects of the vaccination. Corona vaccination can be a kind of test. We are now challenged to become strong enough to cope with these massive attacks. This was true for the client as well as for the therapist.\" Report 2: As If A Dark Being Were Lying On Top Of Her Another differentiated report from a craniosacral therapist from Baden Wurttemberg in April 2021: \"Since I do bodywork, because of the vaccinations, I am now confronted with energies and entities which are partly shocking. I have the feeling that I must protect myself and now I even doubt whether I can continue to treat vaccinated people in the future without leaving the work exhausted. Especially in craniosacral therapy, where I am in direct contact with the etheric body and the other members of the patient's being, I deal with more and more unsightly and frightening images and perceptions and protect myself. I am deeply shocked by what these vaccinations do to people, without them noticing anything. As an example, I would like to tell you about the craniosacral therapy sessions with a 70-year-old patient, whom I know very well and who has been in therapy with me for many years. The first session took place five days after the first mRNA vaccination with the BioNTech Pfizer vaccine. I wondered about her CS rhythm, which I could not perceive. When she told me that she was now vaccinated, it became clear to me. I had the feeling that there was a dark being on top of her, inhibiting all functions. Stagnation and rigidity. The tissue was as if held, could not breathe and could not move, and was no longer able to pulsate. In the second session, it was even worse than in the first. There was practically no rhythm at all, complete rigidity. Like a thick, sticky mass inside the patient. At the feet, I could not feel anything, completely broken rhythm. Also, in this second session, I experienced again a formless being, dark, black, which laid itself around the upper part as if around it, holding on, as if in a kind of strangulation movement at the etheric larynx and whirring around. Next sessions: Furthermore, no normal craniosacral rhythm was perceptible. Everything was still stuck and no movement, no inspiration and expiration was perceptible. Also, on the bone level no movement. At the end of the treatment once again I saw a strange, first gruesome- black, rather gray being. At the feet was not noticeable at all, completely broken rhythm. Also, in this second session, I experienced again a formless being, dark, black, which laid itself around the upper part as if around it, holding on, like a kind of strangulation movement at the etheric larynx and whirring around. As a therapist, I had to be very careful. As soon as I worked with light, that is, with Christ light, the being had to give way. The patient did not notice it, no change in the cranio-rhythm, for her it was normal as always. Next sessions: Furthermore, no normal craniosacral rhythm was perceptible. Everything was still as if \"glued\" and no movement, no inspiration and expiration were perceptible in the living. Also, on the bone level no movement. At the end of the treatment, I saw again a strange, first grayish-black, later gray being. Maybe the vaccination being? Through the treatment, especially at the end of the treatment, there was in each case a calming down of the being, which before was buzzing around restlessly and irritated. It nestled as if around the shoulders, as if folded over and crawling into the body. I felt as if it had not yet crawled all the way in but was in the process of joining and blending with the body. Unfortunately, after many weeks of therapy, there is no real progress, no movement. The patient cannot experience or comprehend these observations in any way. She has no perception of the being and changes in her vital functions and craniosacral rhythms.\" Report 3: The Tissue Is As If Solidified And No Longer Able To Pulsate A rhythmic masseuse from Switzerland described other phenomena in June 2021: \"I had the opportunity to share observations with some other therapists who have similar perceptions. In addition, I have known many patients for a long time and can clearly perceive the difference between their state then and now. Often the patients themselves do not notice these changes. On the contrary, they feel really good now, they are relieved and happy and \"free\"[after they received the vaccine]. Some, of course, display initial flu symptoms in the first few days after the shot. Only very few suffer and perceive more deeply. In most of the vaccinated people, I experience condensation in the tissues, especially after the second vaccination (often already after the first one). The tissue is as if solidified, no longer mobile, and no longer able to pulsate. Also, a palpable cooling (coldness) shows up in many. With one patient I had the experience of massaging a \"corpse\". Even less than before, people have sensations of their coldness. There are visible changes in the face. The gaze often becomes rigid, the contours firmer or the people get a rather turgid face. The face becomes like a mask, transformed. That which wants to shine through is missing. Often, the old weaknesses and symptoms, which were already improved, reappear on all levels due to vaccination: For example, pain, joint blockages, muscle cramps and stiffness (for example in Parkinson's disease), hardening of the spine, tinnitus etc. In the soul life, I often perceive a strikingly sharp-chiseled gesture, all the way to (latent) aggressiveness. In the soul-spiritual sphere, I observed a phenomenon that I would describe like this: The abilities acquired over many months and years through the work of the \"I\" are once again pushed into the background. For example, old, basic fears, illusions, rigid ideas, patterns, etc. reappear suddenly. In some, this went as far as clearly perceptible (temporary?) changes in their core being. The effect on me as a therapist is in a modified form like that of the vaccinated people themselves - if I am not vigilant and do not protect myself sufficiently. Above all, I experience that sometimes, out of the blue, the forces are suddenly pulled away from me. It happens completely unexpectedly, even if I have a good day. If I am not completely in myself and especially in my hands, they become more immobile including borderline rigidity and pain. It is also necessary to guide the thought activity well; it is also in danger of being taken over by disturbing thoughts.\" Report 4: Hardening In The Soul A psychotherapist from Hesse, Germany, in April 2021: \"About one-third of my clients are vaccinated, ten in total. I am no longer able to reach and experience them directly as I used to, but now have to do much more and take longer to get in touch with their \"I\". It feels like they are behind a concrete wall. The concrete wall feeling is with AstraZeneca; with BioNTech and Moderna, it is more as if the \"I\" is choked with lumps. Since the vaccination, I have experienced an increased influence of the dark layers, something has opened up. As a therapist, I have to be more careful not to be drawn into something dark myself and I have to connect more consciously with the light. With the dark layers that are stored individually and collectively in the spiritual earth. I often feel alone in my work now. I know these clients well, but somehow, they are no longer there. In the aftermath of a session, I no longer feel the person, even though they were physically there. There is one exception. With a woman who meditates and has also thought for a long time whether she should be vaccinated, it is not like that. With her, I do not experience any separation. Obviously, she was able to transform the soul-spiritual effects of the vaccination\". The Baden working group had similar perceptions in May 2021: \"While observing vaccinated people (with AstraZeneca and BioNTech) we perceived the process of increasing hardening in the soul-element\". We can see from these reports so far that one person was able to recover slowly from the vaccine, but only after repeating treatments; but with others, the effects stayed, hardened the soul, and also attracted some dark, hostile occult forces that attached to the [astral] body. Some of these entities could also be \"vaccine beings,\" which we will discuss later. Another critical observation is that the therapists and practitioners were also affected negatively when working on their vaccinated clients. They had to be very careful not to take on any dark energy or get drained, especially when working on a supersensible level. More Reports From Around The World Thomas Mayer also lists reports from therapists and alternative practitioners that weren't from his personal network (as in the cases above) but found in his research on online forums of therapists and alternative practitioners, confirming what he and his colleagues discovered when treating vaccinated clients. Here's a short selection from 10 different therapists and practitioners: - \"I do Healing Massage. I have a client who has been coming to me for a long time. Today she had an appointment scheduled a long time ago. My dogs did not greet her as they always do. I thought it was because she was not here for a while. I started my usual treatment, but it was different from usual. I just could not get into the depth. After half an hour I asked her if she was vaccinated because I kept hitting a wall. 'Yes', she said, 'a week ago'\". - \"We had the same experience in our practice for body therapy. You can't get into the tissue and the system of some vaccinated people.\" - \"I work as a naturopath and many patients, unfortunately, get vaccinated. I find some of them repulsive: the strange color of their faces, aura field torn as if they were disembodied. Some of them I cannot test bio-energetically at first, because there is an energetic shock on the kidney in the sense of a cybernetic blockade\". - \"I also notice with some vaccinated people that the aura, which was previously strong and colorful, collapses and becomes gray. Yet this is not the case with all of them. When I do chakra balancing, some feel like after chemotherapy, rigid, metallic, and almost not permeable. I would like to emphasize that this is not the case with everyone, with some I don't feel any difference\". - \"Since early childhood, I have been able to see people's aura colors. I am sensitive. I \"see\" aura mostly as a basic color with different colored speckles. When I meet with vaccinated people, my eyes often \"search\" for the aura, but all I can see is a smooth gray surface, like concrete. This confuses me, no other color appears.\" - \"The aura of vaccinated people often changes. It becomes cracked, broken and unprotected from foreign energies. The energies of the vaccinated flow out unfiltered and foreign energies flow in\". - \"I have a naturopathic practice where I also work osteopathically (i.e., on the patient, with contact). Three weeks ago, I had a patient who was vaccinated with J&J five days earlier, although he did not tell me about it until afterward. During the treatment, I noticed several energy tentacles that were docked. In addition, the general life energy was very low. I removed tentacles, stabilized his energies, and tried to reconnect him (grounding and upward). He was better the next day\". - \"I am highly sensitive and can see people's aura. With some vaccinated people, the aura is not colorful as with others, but gray, and I can smell vaccinated people. The smell is sweetish and penetratingly unpleasant\". - \"My husband and I do bodywork. It is frightening to see how the vaccinated clients degrade. Their skin color changes, they seem to have aged for years, lymph nodes are swollen for a long time, the aura is \"tattered\" and many of them smell very unpleasant.\" - \"I am an alternative practitioner; I also do energetic treatments and sometimes I can't find the energy field of people who have been vaccinated. This can be found next to the body of the vaccinated\". These reports remind me also of the information I shared in my article [The Metaphysical Consequences of the COVID Jab In Light of the Occult Matrix and The Way Ou](https://veilofreality.com/2021/08/30/the-metaphysical-consequences-of-the-covid-jab-in-light-of-the-occult-matrix-and-the-way-out/)t of a supersensible energy healer describing a similar diagnosis or experience when working on a vaccinated client. Here's an abridged version of the report: \"I held a session with a person who had received the first and second dose of the vaccine. I had already treated this person energetically, but I did not know that she had taken the vaccine. When I started the treatment, I immediately noticed the change, very heavy energy coming from their subtle bodies. The scariest thing was when I worked on the heart chakra, I connected with her soul, so she was detached from the physical body, she had no contact and it was as if she was floating in a state of total confusion.... I continued the treatment by sending light to the heart chakra, the soul of the person, but it seemed that the soul could not receive any more light, frequency, or energy. It was a very powerful experience for me. Then I understood that this substance is in fact used to detach the consciousness so that this consciousness can no longer interact through this body that it has in life, where there is no more contact, no more frequency, no more light, no more energetic balance or spirit.... I realized that it is not only polluting the subtle bodies or the physical body, but it is something to do with our soul.The purpose is to damage and try to destroy the contact with consciousness. What Rudolf Steiner said is exactly that. It is not just about damaging the immune system...\" The Schism In The Wellness And Alternative Health Community Before we continue with more case studies and go deeper into the more detailed effects of vaccines on the metaphysical constitution of human beings as shared in Mayer's book, I want to reiterate an important point I made in a [previous article](https://veilofreality.com/2021/08/30/the-metaphysical-consequences-of-the-covid-jab-in-light-of-the-occult-matrix-and-the-way-out/). There is a very obvious schism and \"splitting\" within the wellness, yoga, alternative health, bodywork/energy healer community regarding the vaccine. Many practitioners and therapists fully support the vaccine, believe all the propaganda, and lies around the so-called \"pandemic\" and corrupted modern allopathic medicine, and have even taken it themselves. As a longtime professional bodyworker, yoga practitioner, and embodiment coach myself, I've been surprised and shocked by how many people in the wellness and alternative health community went along with it, received the jab, and even asked their clients and student to take it. Otherwise, they would not offer their services to them. In my view and [inner] experience, if you are genuinely in tune with your body and essence/soul, i.e., embodied (in the true meaning of the word), you will naturally reject the COVID jab as you will reject any other poison/toxin. You will holistically take care of your health on ALL levels: physical, emotional, psychological, and spiritual. Then you will also hold the somatic intelligence and intuitive capabilities to see through the lies of this faux pandemic. Intelligence in that sense has nothing to do with degrees or education [which most often clouds real intelligence due to social/educational programming and mostly only gives one a sense of intellectual superiority] but is tied to the intelligence of the body as an expression of essence, connected to the Divine and your true Self. But it also requires lots of inner work to connect to the real part of ourselves. In light of this understanding, here's a big oxymoron: Yoga teachers, spiritual leaders/teachers/authors, somatic/embodiment therapists/teachers/authors, healers, energy workers, bodyworkers/massage therapists, naturopaths, nutritionists, and anyone in the \"wellness industry\" taking and promoting the jab. It couldn't be more of a testimony of being out of touch with their body, spirit, and essence/soul. This \"pandemic\" and how people react to it also reveal the true colors, especially within the spiritual, yoga, and wellness community. It's the ultimate litmus test for anyone who claims to have embodied [self] awareness. Years from now, people will see what they have done, and the truth will reveal itself more and more [as it already is]\u2014and it is not going to be a pretty picture. It's a heavy karmic burden to carry. For now, they laugh at us, gaslight us, ridicule and attack us with their ad hominem \"conspiracy theorist\" attacks and socially conditioned virtue signaling, not realizing how they have become vessels for occult hostile forces themselves. Case in point: I've studied a lot of the popular channels over the past twenty years, including Abraham-Hicks. Truth is mixed with lies, but most channels are New Age deceptions in light of the hyperdimensional matrix, occult laws, and the hidden [non-physical] forces of life, manipulating humanity from unseen realms. Most often, hostile forces pose as positive ones, targeting wishful thinking and emotional bias where many \"New Agers\" mistake their emotional attachments to particular views, unconscious trauma responses, and wishful thinking for \"truth,\" \"intuition,\" and \"resonating.\" There is no deeper psychic discernment, critical thinking, and certainly no awareness of the hyperdimensional matrix with its occult laws, traps, and deceptions. Channeled material is a rabbit hole that I referenced and wrote about over a decade ago. Tom Montalk gave a good overview of the standards of channeling [HERE.](https://montalk.net/metaphys/127/standards-of-channeling) Here's an excellent example of this clever deception. In this video below, Esther Hicks is channeling the \"non-physical energies of doctors and scientists,\" promoting the vaccine as \"standing in their non-physical beingness reveling in the brilliance of these vaccines.\" Looking at some of the responses of this video going around, many New Age type people already swallow it, hook, line, and sinker, believing that the vaccines are now not just not harmful at all but good for them. I've seen other channeled material claiming that \"the COVID vaccines help to upgrade our DNA for the nest stage of our evolution.\" The courageous therapists and practitioners who speak out against the vaccines and expose the COVID psy-op are often met with ridicule and attacks. Some of them even lost their jobs and were \"canceled\" because they refused to get vaccinated or simply for questioning the official narrative and \"consensus science.\" Thomas Mayer encountered that issue in his research as well, and he had to change the names of all the practitioners and therapists who sent him the reports to protect them. \"For confidentiality reasons, all names [of the patients] have been changed in the descriptions of specific cases. This is normal. However, it is not normal that all authors are also named only with pseudonyms. I know them personally, and they do not want to be the target of a defamation campaign. Many of them have normal professions and do not want to lose their jobs. Unfortunately, such fears are justified today, we know many cases of sanctions and dismissals due to non-conformist views.[...] I had to accept this bitter reality. Only anonymization of the authors creates the necessary protection that enabled the publication of this book. What forces are at work here spiritually behind the scenes, will become transparent in the course of this book.\" - Thomas Mayer At the same time, it's also important to understand that anyone who is along with the jab and the COVID Psy-Op is deeply brainwashed and mind-controlled by the media, government, and church of scientism [pseudo-science], reacting out of primal fear and trauma for they \"do not know what they do.\" Once we understand that, we can see them with more empathy and compassion instead of projecting our anger onto them. There is no getting through with facts and logic, and the cognitive dissonance is too strong. They are not only disconnected from their own bodies but also from their inner guidance and hence have become authoritarian followers. Having said that, I have my boundary, and I choose not to receive any treatment from any practitioner or therapist who has received the jab. It is my personal choice. Thankfully, many professional wellness practitioners have refused the jab and speak out actively against it. I won't go so far as to avoid the inoculated population altogether. That attitude would be way too paranoid and fear-based and virtually impossible unless you isolate yourself from society altogether. I trust my own spiritual constitution (taking care of my health holistically on all levels) that I won't just take anything on or be negatively affected. However, I make that boundary when someone is working on me hands-on, physically, or energetically. Detailed Effects Of Corona Vaccinations On The Constitution Of Human Beings Thomas Mayer also shared very detailed supersensible observations of the human constitution by his research group. The terms used in these reports are very specific to Rudolf Steiner's work and his definition of the supersensible members of the human being. I refer to the book or pdf for an explanation of these terms in the chapter on Supersensible Research. Here is one of the cases the research group reported: \"The members of the Working Group Hessen are experienced and accomplished spiritual researchers who work together on a regular basis. From them comes the following three case studies. May 20, 2021: A woman had received her first vaccination with AstraZeneca. After that, she felt bad and did not want to work anymore. She is a psychotherapist and became grumpy with her patients. The investigation revealed: - In her aura, there was the Vaccine-Being of AstraZeneca, which influenced all members of her constitution - The spiritual members of her being (Spirit-Man, Life-Spirit and Spirit-Self) had a connection to the 9th subterranean region of the earth; they were influenced by it and blocked. - Through this relationship, the door to beings of transhumanism was opened, which began forming a spiritual metal-line in her spinal cord. - Her angel appeared in the imaginative perception gray and somewhat unsound. - On the level of the Intellectual Soul, we experienced a blockage between the forehead and the crown chakra. We interpreted this as a separation of the Intellectual Soul from the higher self. - The effects of the Vaccine-Being also went into the astral and etheric bodies. In the etheric body, we perceived many small demons moving chaotically and dissonantly, bubbling like champagne. - The Body Elemental Being was subdued in its activity. - In all chakras, we felt blockages These difficult effects must have come from the vaccination, because before that Elke was in a good condition. She also experienced these effects in the joint examination. She was shocked by the results and wanted to neutralize the Vaccine-Being and harmonize her bodies through spiritual healing work. This happened, and after that she felt a great relief. Gradually the will to work came back\". This example shows how profoundly Corona vaccination interferes with all members of the human being. Everything was taken over and impaired. However, the description also shows that such spiritual vaccine damage can be neutralized if they are approached accordingly. It is important to emphasize this so that the descriptions collected here are understood in the right way. It is a matter of looking at reality soberly to learn and develop the necessary steps. If these reports frighten one, one should not suppress it, but let oneself be touched by it. It must be digested.\" Mayer and his research group identified a common thread and basic pattern of spiritual vaccine damage in people: \"We were able to observe 20 vaccinated individuals on a regular basis during the last months. Even if the effects of the Corona vaccinations are individually different and change over time, there are some basic patterns that often repeat: Vaccination often causes shifting of the members of the human being. The etheric body becomes smaller. The sentient body with the soul members (Sentient, - Intellectual - and Consciousness Soul) shift and lose the connection with the physical human being. The I-organization slips backwards and shows itself diminished; this same with the spirit core or the higher SeIf. Thus, the human being becomes more strongly bound to matter. The body-elemental-being should take care of the human being, now it leaves, and remains only in the proximity. Also, a separation from the angel occurs - angel and man can no longer feel each other. These are very painful conditions for these etheric and spiritual entities which carry and support the human being. Instead of them, the double of the person (the shadow, or the unresolved old karma) connects itself more strongly with the human being. From the spiritual dark subterranean layers of the earth come forces that affect the \"I\"- organization, the higher self, and the angel. We had the impression that the stronger effect of the Double relates to a strengthening of the ego, the lower \"I\" hardened in egoism. This sometimes manifested itself in a more self-confident appearance of the person, which, however, had the source in self-centeredness. In such encounters one did not meet the real human being as before, instead, the ego and the \"primitive man\" were more pronounced[...] We experience that with the vaccine, Ahrimanic, hardening elemental beings entered the organs. The astral body and the 'I\"-organization of the organs were clearly quenched and contracted. Also, the etheric body became weaker and connected more strongly with the material body; it became more physical in this respect[...] This distortion within the spiritual constitution of the organs is caused by dark beings, which enter the human being through the vaccination.\" Three Types Of Beings/Entities Gaining Access Through The COVID Vaccine According to the research group, there are three groups of Beings [based on Steiner's work] that appeared in vaccinated people. Mayer outlines them below: - The Vaccine-Being: These are spirit beings of the lower level of the spiritual world. They have a determining and intervening effect on almost all bodies of the human being and resemble various Illness-Beings. In the aura, one can experience these Vaccine-Beings as a taproot that goes down through the physical human being into all members of the human constitution. They are descendants and local representatives of the group souls or group spirits of specific vaccines. - The Soratic Spirits of Transhumanism: The vaccine beings are related to soratic spirits of transhumanism, which through them gain access to the layers of human aura. There they appear as black, sharp, sucking formations or spots, especially in the radius of about three feet and more, in the whole aura as well as in the highest members of the human being (I, Spirit-Self, Life-Spirit, Spirit-Self). - Small Ahrimanized Elemental Beings: These occupy especially the etheric body and the organs. These three groups of beings seem to be the main causes of the described displacements and blockages within the human constitution. Spiritual Healing And How To Counteract The Adverse Effects of the Vaccination The question arises, how can vaccinated people heal from and process the COVID vaccines? We know about physical detox methods that may work and help the heal physical constitution of the body. But removing these adverse beings requires deeper spiritual work. Mayer writes: \"The purpose of spiritual healing is to remove these three groups of beings from the human aura. This should proceed out of the activity of the [real] \"I\" of the vaccinated person, who ideally develops strength that makes it difficult for these beings to enter again. Based on my own observations I have the following picture: - - If a vaccinated person does not engage in an active process, the spirits of transhumanism work in the whole aura; in such a case, they also strongly radiate into the environment. - If a vaccinated person has engaged in the process - consciously or unconsciously - then many spirits of transhumanism leave. Only deposits remain, as well as the Vaccine-Being, which is then more subdued in its effectiveness. At least this is how I have observed it on people who at first glance do not look like they have been vaccinated at all. - With increasingly active work, the Vaccine-Being moves further and further away from the human being, up to about six feet away. In such a case, it no longer has a determining influence. - The small Ahrimanic elemental beings give way for the most part when the spiritual levels are cleared. However, this should be controlled; often they still need specific complementary treatment.\" Mayer also addresses a crucial factor that determines the healing process. It varies from person to person, and a big part of it is under what circumstances an individual received the vaccine.. \"One's own decision to vaccinate: If one gets vaccinated out of fear or ideological conviction, there is a danger that the associated entities can penetrate deeper than in people with more composed motivations. Motivation of the doctor: The spiritual attitude of the doctor (or a person; trans.), who administers the vaccine also plays a role. The soul-spiritual atmosphere during the vaccination can invite or discourage hostile spirits. The patient can also influence this, for example, by praying during the vaccination. Awareness of the problem: If one is aware that vaccination may cause soul-spiritual damage and that one must take care of it - such awareness is priceless. This will become a starting point in the soul for a - conscious or unconscious - confrontation with the being of the vaccine. Without awareness of the problem, there is a danger for the soul of blindly falling into it and not finding a way to understand what is happening. Medicinal support: There are various possibilities with natural remedies and homeopathic medicines. For this, please consult a health practitioner or a doctor. Therapeutic support: All therapies that have a special effect on the higher members of the human constitution can help, for example, therapeutic eurythmy, rhythmical massage, craniosacral therapy, art therapy, etc. Basic spiritual strengthening: The more one regularly strengthens the spiritual connection through meditation, prayer, religious ritual, singing or reading spiritual literature, the less one is accessible for spiritual attacks. Spiritual-healing intervention: It seems to me very important to directly confront the beings connected with the inoculation in meditation or prayer; to meet them with the power of Christ, Archangel Michael (assertiveness), Archangel Raphael (healing power), healing Buddha or other higher spirit beings. Through this these adversarial beings can be removed from the aura and their effects can be transformed. Everything that is done in this direction has an effect, even if one is not able to discern this personally. For support, it may be useful to seek the help of an experienced spiritual healer. The processing of the vaccination should not be underestimated, as should have become clear from the previous descriptions. One is dealing with a class of adversary spirits that can quickly overwhelm one. Even if the processing needs only a few weeks with some people, others must work on it for many months.\" As disturbing as some of these reports and findings may be concerning the adverse spiritual effects of the COVID vaccines, the situation is not hopeless. As we've seen in these reports, people who have been inoculated can be treated and helped in their healing process. If you have received the vaccine and made it that far into the article, don't despair but seek help. I've received emails from people asking how to counter-act the metaphysical consequences of the jab. Thomas Maye's work and research give us clues and shine a light into the darkness despite the overall seemingly dire situation. We must not give in to fear or negative thinking but face it as it is. Since many people ask me and email me about it, I also would like to clarify that I do not offer that kind of supersensible body and energy work as Mayer and his team of supersensible therapists. I currently don't work as [a bodyworker, or [Holographic Kinetics (HK) practitioner](https://veilofreality.com/holographic-kinetics/) anymore. Both modalities could help vaccinated people in their healing process, but my work has shifted, and I focus more on group work, online courses, and other work I'm called to do by Spirit. I currently also do not know anyone who does the kind of treatments that Mayer and his practitioners offer based on Rudolf Steiner's work. Mayer is based in Germany, and you could contact him directly to inquire (see his book for contact information). How To Choose A Healer And Practitioner I advise common-sense caution [without paranoia] when choosing a therapist and practitioner. Many people are claiming to do this kind of work, and it's a jungle out there in the alternative healing community. There are also charlatans and all sorts of questionable New Age \"healing modalities\" and \"shamans\" that promise to remove entities, balance your chakras [or even worse, \"remove chakras\"], etc. The critical point to understand with this kind of supersensible spiritual work is what Mayer mentioned at the beginning of his book, and I highlit it in red for a reason: \"It takes years of practice, meditation, work with one's own inner shadows, and study of anthroposophy and other sciences of the soul and spiritual world. It is important that the research rests on a broad background of experience. The processing of the vaccination should not be underestimated, as should have become clear from the previous descriptions. One is dealing with a class of adversary spirits that can quickly overwhelm one. Even if the processing needs only a few weeks with some people, others must work on it for many months.\" Many self-proclaimed healers and \"shamans\" promise all kinds of \"magic\" healing, but they lack these prerequisites. If you are looking for a practitioner, I suggest keeping these three things below in mind and asking them. Your intuition will tell you if they are honest or lie: - Are they engaged in ongoing self-care and sincere inner work, in particular, shadow work and esoteric/spiritual self-work so they don't confuse their own thought projections, unconscious shadow, and unconscious trauma with \"entities\" or \"psychic insights\"? - Are they well versed in various modalities or at the very least have a broad background of experience? - Do they have at least 10 years of experience and are doing this work full-time with a track record? Many of us have friends and family members who got vaccinated. Naturally, we want to help them, but we must understand the number one rule in healing work: You cannot help anyone unwilling to help themselves. In other words, we need to respect their free will and don't push them into any treatment or therapy, nor make an appointment with a practitioner for them without asking them for permission. They need to seek it out themselves. Only a person who is willing to heal themselves and takes self-responsibility has the potential to be healed. It is also a long journey and won't be done in just one session, as Mayer pointed out. Moreover, a vaccinated person, or anyone for that matter, who is seeking help from a therapist/practitioner also needs to engage in their own inner work and spiritual work and not expect a \"healer\" to do everything for them. Supersensible Study Of The Vaccines Thomas Mayer and his research team examined the various COVID vaccines via \"tuning into them\" [the \"information field\" of the vaccine substance] with extra-sensory/supersensible perception. Different techniques were used, but a common one was to take the ampule with vaccine residue in one hand during a \"self-testing\" experiment by a qualified practitioner and psychically tune in to the \"information field\" of the vaccine substance itself [i.e., \"resonate\" with it.] The findings were remarkable and very similar to the information gathered when working with vaccinated people. Here are some selected case studies: I feel cut off from the spiritual world The W\u00fcrttemberg working group met on May 5, 2021, with two observers: Here are my notes on the two vaccines, Pfizer BioNTech and AstraZeneca. We resonated with them and experienced this in our ether and astral bodies. For both of us, they caused very negative sensations. The spiritual observation showed beings who have connected with the highest adversary powers and carry these powers up to the astral and etheric. My perceptions: Pfizer BioNTech: - Heaviness spreads on the ground, like fog, hanging shoulders, dark. - Qualities like depression. - Sink into heaviness, the whole body becomes heavy and loses \"I\"- signature and uprightness. - I feel cut off from the spiritual world. - Like a dark blanket, waiting, impenetrable is above me and in the entire room. - Creative-spiritual impulses (for example, making music, meditating, social contacts, etc.): It takes a lot of effort to get up for it. Afterward, I feel better. AstraZeneca: - Headache in the forehead, tightening. - Attack more directly on the \"I\" level, like shots. - Feels insidious, more invested, spiky (not that heaviness), more unpredictable. - After about five minutes the effect was too strong on me, that I ended the examination and left the room. An important result of the studies by the various research groups showed that the effects of Pfizer BioNTech, Moderna, AstraZeneca, and Johnson&Johnson are similar. Soul and social life: How does the vaccine affect my needs, feeling life, work, and life planning? Here are a few more impressions of various supersensible practitioners conducting this investigation: \"I no longer felt the need to think and decide for myself, I became content to follow instructions, no questions asked. I became totally gray, everything doesn't matter, everything is ok. My mucous membranes became dry, I felt like a reptile.\" \"I experience distance, no connection, no feeling, no social contacts, I feel lost, my emotional life is cold.\" \"Everything should be strictly organized, I wish for order, I am resigned, on the run, only registering. In my emotional life, I experience shame, malice, and maliciousness.\" \"Contacts do not interest me, I find the distance to other people good. I am grateful for instructions and guidance. I do not have direction in life. In my emotional life, there is no empathy, no interest. In my professional life, I just want to function. In an attempted meditation I bump into a wall and am pushed back.\" The video below is a testimony of a Greek Priest-Monk, who received the Pfizer Vaccine. Father Savvas Agioritis is reading his confession. The Priest-Monk started to feel himself more and more cut off from the spiritual world. He also came face-to-face with a demonic entity which may be the soratic vaccine being: You can also read the transcript [HERE](https://greenpass.news/covid-inoculation-also-attacks-the-spirit-testimony-of-a-priest-monk-the-white-rose/). On the Supersensible Structure of the Corona Vaccines Maye and his research team also asked the question: What can be discovered if we look not at the effects of the vaccines, but supersensibly consider the vaccines themselves? Here's what they discovered: \"Often there were the following impressions: Biting, dark spherical formations are visible in the vaccine aura. These are aggressive and attacking and they seem to be occupied by the Soratic beings. The working group East Germany described in April 2021: \"When looking at corona vaccines, regardless of variety, we found an etheric aura of about 8 inches around the ampule. Within it are countless water elementals that take care of the liquid of the vaccine. These are strongly ahrimanized, that is, associated with Ahrimanic spirit beings. The second type of entities are earth elementals, gnomes, who were also strongly ahrimanized, probably during the production of the vaccine. These are most likely responsible for the construction of the genetic information on the material plane. Elemental beings have the task to constitute the matter according to spiritual laws. The ones connected with the Corona vaccines, which we are dealing with here, relate to beings from the adversary spheres (Ahrimanic spirits). Thus, these elemental beings lose their positive attitude towards man and become aggressive. They can cause harm to man's etheric body, which consequently has a negative effect on other members of the human being.\" Authoritarian Followers And The Zombification Of Humanity These reports are very telling in light of the more extensive matrix agenda. Keep in mind that the only way the occult anti-divine forces and their WEF \"Great Reset\" Neo-Marxist-Fascist hybrid New World Order puppets can ensure the enslavement of humanity is with the consent and [manipulated] \"free will\" of the people. They need obedient citizens and authoritarian order followers. There are several ways to turn human beings into robotic authoritarian followers without a single thought on their own. One way is via the \"matrix trauma installment program,\" as I've called it. People who are traumatized are easier to control. It's the foundation of the nefarious MK-Ultra mind control program, only in this case it is a global MK-Ultra experiment. Billions of people have already become traumatized over the past 3 years since the \"pandemic\" started with all the fear, lockdowns, economic, emotional, and psychological hardship as well as the masking [especially children], gaslighting, shaming, and virtue signaling by the corporate media and consensus \"Agent Smith\" citizens. Most people don't even know that they are traumatized, but they have a trauma response: checking out (out-of-body), disassociating, in denial, addictive behavior, or falling into a deep depression [suicides have skyrocked]. Over the past three years, we've seen a military-level MK-Ultra type of collective mind control operation to destroy the human spirit. Keep in mind that has already happened without the vaccine. Only people who have a solid spiritual and psychological foundation can withstand this psychological warfare. The easiest way to control people is via traumatizing them, instilling fear and then appearing as the savior, or giving them something that promises them \"safety\" and going back to \"normal,\" i.e., the vaccine. It ties into the classical Hegelian Dialect of Problem-Reaction-Solution. Trauma alone already creates entry points for hostile forces to come in and take over body and mind. As we can see from the reports above, the effects of the vaccine itself re-enforce people to become numb authoritarian followers: \"I no longer felt the need to think and decide for myself, I became content to follow instructions, no questions asked. asked....Everything should be strictly organized, I wish for order...I find the distance to other people good. I am grateful for instructions and guidance.\" It is essential to understand that the reposts above were conducted by professional supersensible practitioners \"tuning into the vaccine\" and hence gave a report of how they felt. The vast majority of people who received the vaccine don't have the self-awareness that they all of a sudden \"no longer feel the need to and decide for themselves, content to follow instructions\" or that they have \"become emotionally numb, experiencing distance, no connection, no feeling.\" In fact, most vaccinated people will deny it and claim that they \"think for themselves\" and don't notice any changes. It takes a certain level of being and spiritual strength in a vaccinated person to become conscious and aware of these internal changes. Remember the reports at the beginning of this article by some of the practitioners who worked on vaccinated people stating that: - \"The patient cannot experience or comprehend these observations in any way. She has no perception of the being and changes in her vital functions...\" - \"Often the patients themselves do not notice these changes. On the contrary, they feel really good now, they are relieved and happy and \"free\"[after they received the vaccine].\" Mind-controlled people do not know that they are mind-controlled. It's the ultimate Stockholm Syndrome and a disturbing situation - the attempted zombification of humanity. It also relates to the topic of [\"Organic Portals - Soulless Humans\"](https://veilofreality.com/2011/04/18/organic-portals-soulless-humans/). Soul Snatching And The \"Alien\" Invasion Through Our Bodies At the time of publishing this article (May 24, 2022), officially: - 65.7% of the world population has been fully vaccinated with any of the COVID vaccines. That's 5.19 billion people. - 11.77 billion doses have been administered [many people are double, triple, or quadruple vaxxed] - 5.85 million doses are continued to be administered each day. - In the US, 220 million people have been fully vaccinated (66.8% of the population) and 580 million doses have been administered.[ [Source](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-vaccinations)] In light of what we have explored and discovered so far regarding the adverse spiritual effects of the Corona vaccines on humans, these are alarming numbers. It confirms the hyperdimensional occult matrix agenda I've written about for many years, and others have hinted at as well. The \"alien invasion through our bodies\" via genetic modification and the attempted separation of the soul from the body, priming the body for occult anti-divine forces/beings to take over the vessel. As I wrote in 2016: From a hyperdimensional perspective, the end-game/goal of their agenda is to completely take-over/'body-snatch' our physical/emotional/mental selves in order to lock us into a frequency prison - all of their various chessboard-level 'triggers' are designed to prime our bodies so as to facilitate the hosting of their vibrational essence within our human 'mainframe'. Hence the push for dis-embodiment [dislodging the soul] in all of its various guises: increasing the body-mind split via increased mental activity/distraction through technology/A.I., as well as poisoning the individual through GMOs, EMF radiation, vaccinations, chemtrails, etc. - all of which are environmental factors that collude with the original series of genetic modification experiments conducted by \"the Predator from beyond the stars\" in order to disconnect us more and more from our original DNA blueprint. This is a program of Hybridization that is priming humanity's transmutation into shell-vessels for hyperdimensional possession. - From [Timeline-Reality Split, Frequency Vibration, and the Hidden Forces of Life] Rudolf Steiner was correct. In light of these revelations and research so far, we can see that these vaccines attempt to expel the soul from mankind, and people are inoculated against their disposition towards spiritual ideas. Based on Mayer's research outlined in this article so far, we can see 4 distinctive effects of the COVID vaccine on people: - The Soul [real \"I\"] is being separated from the body - The vaccine creates \"holes\" in the astral/energy body - The human being becomes more strongly bound to matter, hardened in materialism and egoism, hence making the human reject spirituality and the Divine/God - It creates authoritarian followers who want to be told what to do [losing the guidance within] The first two conditions create entry points for asuric, Soratic/Asuric occult hostile forces to attach and take over the body. The vaccine also seems to have a \"vaccine being,\" an entity that attaches to the vaccinated person takes once the inoculation occurs. These beings/entities then also emphasize the effects of points 3 and 4, and all points/effects are interrelated. The more a human being is disconnected from his real \"I\"/essence/soul, the less they can access their inner guidance and intuition and look for guidance and authority outside themselves. The Soratic Spirits of Transhumanism: The Consciousness Trap The COVID vaccine agenda and its detrimental spiritual effects on the human being tie into the Transhumanism agenda as well. I've written a note on this topic in 2016 titled [Transhumanism - The Consciousness Trap.](https://veilofreality.com/transhumanism-the-consciousness-trap/) Laura and I also released a podcast episode called [How Eliminating The Soul Paves The Way For Transhumanism](https://veilofreality.com/2022/05/04/how-eliminating-the-soul-paves-the-way-for-transhumanism-tcm-83-part-1/) where we discuss some of the topics shared in this article. What is the Transhumanism agenda from an occult multi-dimensional level? Lisa Renee summarises well [many years before the COVID \"pandemic\" started]: \"Transhumanism is an international, cultural and intellectual movement with an eventual goal of fundamentally transforming the human condition, by making available technologies that greatly enhance human intellectual, physical, and psychological capacities. ... Transhumanism is a school of thought that seeks to guide us towards a posthuman condition. Essentially, this is about creating artificially intelligent hybrids or cyborgs to replace the organic spiritual consciousness of humans.... Some of the proposed biological enhancements are using some combination of technologies such as genetic engineering, psychopharmacology, life extension therapies, neural interfaces, brain mapping, wearable or implanted computers, and entrainment of cognitive techniques....this has potentially extremely destructive consequences for human consciousness and the electromagnetic functions of the Lightbody. Most of these options are designed to disconnect the human soul from the human body and prepare the body to be used as a shell for a new host. Effectively, this is integrating technological and pharmaceutical hybridization to damage human DNA, as preparation for body snatching. A primary goal of many transhumanists is to convince the public that embracing radical technology and science is in the human species' best interest. The grand deception of Transhumanism is widely promoted as humans having control over their own evolution when what they are really doing is selling their soul and losing access to organic human consciousness. Transhumanism stresses the evolutionary perspective, yet it completely ignores the electromagnetic function of human DNA and the consciousness reality of the multidimensional human soul-spirit....The Transhumanism movement is another level of the Negative Alien satanic agenda to gain full control over the biological-neurological and brain networks of human beings, thus controlling the human collective consciousness.\" - Lisa Renee We need to understand that we are in the \"end game.\" The Transhumanist agenda, the merging of man and machine, the expelling of the soul, and the invasion of hostile \"alien\" beings through our bodies are the end stages of a negative agenda by the matrix overlords to enslave humanity that has been building up for thousands of years. These hyperdimensional occult forces have been manipulating humanity from unseen realms for eons and interfered with humanity's \"harmonious\" evolution. The wetiko \"alien\" has infected humanity from within the human psyche. The Soratic beings in Steiner's work are the \"hostile occult forces\" and \"Powers of Darkness\" Sri Aurobindo refers to. They have been given many names over time based on various occult traditions. \"....For according to all occult teaching the evolutionary creation could have been [more harmonious] but for the intervention of the Powers of Darkness\u2014all traditions including that of the Veda and Upanishads point under different figures to the same thing. In the Upanishads, it is the Daityas that smite with evil all that the gods create, in the Zoroastrian tradition it is Ahriman coming across the work of Ahura Mazda, the Chaldean tradition uses a different figure. But the significance is the same; it is the perception of something that has struck across the harmonious development of creation and brought in the principle of darkness and disorder. As a result instead of a world of integral truth and divine harmony created in the light of the divine Gnosis, we have a world founded on the part truths of an inferior cosmic Intelligence in which all is half truth, half error. These are the forces and beings that are interested in maintaining the falsehoods they have created in the world of the Ignorance and in putting them forward as the Truth which men must follow. The word \"Appearances\" refers to the forms they take in order to rule the world, forms often false and always incarnating falsehood, sometimes pseudo-divine. It [the adverse force] is the Power that keeps up ignorance and darkness in the world\u2014it can only be destroyed when mankind is no longer in love with ignorance and darkness. These bad conditions are due to the fact that the Ignorance is in possession and the hostile Powers an established authority, as it were, who do not care to give up their hold and there is no full force of Light established in the earth consciousness which would not only meet but outweigh their full force of darkness.\" - Sri Aurobindo, The Life Divine Rudolf Steiner also hinted at these powers of darkness overtaking and possessing human bodies: \"...In ancient Greece the whole body was filled with the whole soul, and they were in agreement. Today this is not the case, for the bodies are partly empty. I am not saying anything derogatory about empty heads; they will stay empty as part of evolution. In reality, however, nothing stays empty in this world. The heads are merely empty of something which was destined to fill them at another time. Nothing is ever completely empty. With the human soul withdrawing more and more from the body, the body is increasingly in danger of being filled with something else. And if human beings are not prepared to take up impulses which can only come from spiritual knowledge, the body will be filled with demonic powers. Humanity is facing a destiny where the body may be filled with ahrimanic demonic powers. So we have to add to what I said yesterday about future development: there will be people in future who are Tom, Dick and Harry in ordinary life, which is something determined by social circumstances, but their bodies will be empty to such an extent that a powerful ahrimanic spirit can live in them. One will be meeting ahrimanic demons. human beings will not be what they appear to be. The individual person will be deep down inside, and outwardly one will get a totally different picture. This shows the complexity of life to come. It is reasonable to say that there will be situations in future when it will be difficult to know who one is dealing with. Ricarda Huch's longing for the devil really arises from what will be coming in the future. The institutions and ideas, especially the social ideas people have today, are abstract and crude; they are clumsy in the face of the complexities that are lying ahead. And because people are not able to have ideas or concepts about the true nature of things, they are sliding more and more deeply into chaos. ...There will be vast numbers of people in future...[whose] concepts, ideas and actions will be based on the outside world around them and on the fact that their bodies are being filled with the ahrimanic [demonic] spirit which wants them to form such ideas. We should not fool ourselves, for we are faced with a quite specific movement. At the Council of Constantinople it was decreed that the spirit did not exist; it was dogmatically stated that the human being consisted only of body and soul, and it was heresy to speak of a human spirit. In the same way attempts will be made to decree the soul, the inner life, as nonexistent.\" - Rudolf Steiner, \"Fall of the Spirits of Darkness - Changes in Humanity's Spiritual Make-up\", Dornach 7 October Vortr\u00e4ge in Dornach, 1917, Band 177\"] When we zoom out and look at the bigger picture of the matrix agenda and what the real purpose is of the global push to vaccinate the entire world population [as Bill Gates and WEF's Klaus Schwab repeatedly stated they want to see happening], we can see two major goals in play: - Depopulation: A massive reduction of the world population over time due to vaccine damage (destroys the immune system, infertility, increased cancer risk, heart disease, etc.). More and more people are already dying from the vaccine shot. - Soul snatching, possession, and take-over of the human body: Established via the vaccine and injected \"vaccine being\" and/or \"Soratic Beings of Transhumanism\". It creates zombified authoritarian followers that become matrix \"agents\" possessed by asuric demonic occult forces. The second aim is also a precursor for the Transhumanist agenda to fully expel the soul and merge man with machine. Seeing it from that perspective and in light of the Hegelian Dialect, the entire COVID psy-op has been artificially created as the \"Problem,\" which created a \"Reaction\" in the population, demanding a cure/vaccine. \"The powers that be\" then present the \"Solution\": the vaccine they had already planned. Thoms Mayer and his research team made more disturbing discoveries when looking deeper into the effects of the four major COVID vaccines, verifying what Lisa Renee, Sri Aurobindo, Rudolf Steiner, and other esoteric occult teachings have conveyed. It has been called \"the topic of all topics\": The alien invasion through our bodies. Transhumanism is inspired by these forces of darkness injected via the vaccine: \"It took many attempts before we understood the powerful effects of BioNTech, Modern, AstraZeneca, and Johnson&Johnson. Important thing is that - spiritually speaking - at the core, these [vaccines] are filled with Soratic beings. Of course, all other groups of adversarial spirits are also involved. At first glance, one can experience Ahrimanic beings, perhaps also Asuric beings. However, inside of them, the Soratic beings are at work, setting the tone. These beings do not originate from the development of our solar system and in this respect must be considered as outer-planetary spirits. Unlike the Luciferic and Ahrimanic fallen angelic beings, they are not part of the development of our spiritual planetary system, described in detail in Rudolf Steiner's \"Occult Science\". Through human unconscious attraction or conscious invitation, they gain access and can thus influence our life on earth. The Soratic beings are known for thousands of years; they inspire oppression, abuse, hatred, war, black magic, etc. But today a new kind is also emerging. Some people within my research network are skilled in perceiving the Soratic beings. Yet, this new species was at first incomprehensible and unclassifiable to us. There is also no established terminology for this species. We have chosen the term \"Spirits of Transhumanism\" because these beings seem to be at the spiritual core of transhumanism. Transhumanism wants to merge human being with machines and thus to abolish our soul-spiritual being forever. Supersensibly, the transhumanist spirits do exactly that. The spiritual effects are already here even if the brain is not yet connected to a computer - a dream of the transhumanists. They reach for the human being, and if they gain access, human beings lose - partially or completely - their spiritual connection. For this purpose, these beings possess especially the Phantom body (physical spirit body) and the etheric body. They \"glue\" them together and shut them off from soul and spirit and the soul-spiritual surroundings. In this respect these beings want to turn the human being into a \"Machine-Man\", cut off from the spirit. We found that all group spirits of the four examined vaccines are occupied by the spirits of transhumanism. Moreover, we found them in individual ampules, through which they enter the human being by means of vaccination. To spiritual experience, they appear as \"devoid of the \"I\" metallic\", \"brute\" and threatening. A colleague encountered a leading group spirit of one of the vaccines. Its intention came clearly to light: 'I saw a high spirit being of the vaccine, a narrow, rugged, sinister figure, extremely evil, with a will of annihilation of everything that is human: The angel is as if cut off, the etheric pulverized, the soul subjugated, the Self extinguished. What remains are devoid of I, empty shelled automaton people; scrawny, rickety, metallic; they are to be held like puppets on a long string.'\" - Thomas Mayer In Their Own Words Looking at everything we've uncovered so far in light of the matrix agenda of the hostile forces, listen to these short videos of [Yuval Noah Harari](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuval_Noah_Harari): 1. Humans Are Now Hackable Animals 2. Freedom And Freewill Are A Myth Some highlights from the clips by Yuval Noah Harari: \"Covid is critical because it convinces people to accept total biometric surveillance. If we want to stop this epidemic we not only need to monitor people, we need to monitor what is happening under their skin. Humans are now hackable animals. The whole idea that humans have this soul, spirit, and they have free will and nobody knows what's happening inside me....that's over! There is no such thing as free will. There are only deterministic processes and random processes in science and a combination of the two but none of this is freedom. Freedom is just another myth that humans have invented just like humans have invented God. Feelings are just biochemical algorithms and most importantly, what scientists and engineers are telling us more and more is that if we only have enough data and enough computing power, we can create external algorithms that understand humans and their feelings much better than humans can understand themselves. And once you have an algorithm that understands you and your feelings better than you understand yourself, that's when authority shifts away from humans to algorithms.\" - Yuval Noah Harari Yuval may already be a vessel for ahrimanic [demonic] spirits and an \" [Organic Portal.](https://veilofreality.com/2011/04/18/organic-portals-soulless-humans/)\" There is no soul, just a mechanical, materialistic worldview. His words give insights into the mindset of many people in positions of high power and specifically the elite of the World Economic Forum WEF around Klaus Schwab. They deny the soul, spirituality, and the Divine, and they want to play God themselves. In fact, they already see themselves as \"Gods,\" determining how many people are supposed to live on this planet and creating human beings in tubes. Klaus Schwab of the WEF and proponent of \"The Great Reset\" mentioned in his book \"The Fourth Industrial Revolution\" the birth of \"silicon-based man\" and the end of \"carbon-based ma Rudolf Steiner was correct in his vision over 100 years ago: \"The time will come \u2014 and it may not be far off \u2014 when quite different tendencies will come up...and people will say: It is pathological for people to even think in terms of spirit and soul. 'Sound' people will speak of nothing but the body. It will be considered a sign of illness for anyone to arrive at the idea of any such thing as a spirit or a soul. People who think like that will be considered to be sick and \u2014 you can be quite sure of it \u2014 a medicine will be found for this. The soul will be made non-existent with the aid of a drug. Taking a 'sound point of view', people will invent a vaccine to influence the organism as early as possible, preferably as soon as it is born, so that this human body never even gets the idea that there is a soul and a spirit....Materialistic physicians will be asked to drive the souls out of humanity.\" - Rudolf Steiner, \"Fall of the Spirits of Darkness - Changes in Humanity's Spiritual Make-up\", Dornach, Germany, 7 October 1917 Is It Possible To Absorb These Intrusive Spirits Without Actual Physical Vaccinations? A big question is if unvaccinated people are being affected by the ones who have received the vaccine. Many non-vaccinated women have had irregular menstruation cycles when in closer proximity to vaccinated people. There also seem to be other physical effects related to the spike protein that negatively affect some unvaccinated people. But what about the adversary spirits of the vaccine? Thomas Mayer asked this question in the next chapter of his book: \"The Corona vaccines are filled with aggressive adversary spirits, which through vaccination anchor within the bodies of the human being. But is it possible to absorb these intrusive spirits without actual physical vaccinations?\" Mayer received this remarkable report of a few cases dated May 20, 2021, from the Hesse Working Group in Germany: - Heidrun is a nurse and was always totally exhausted on the days she had to vaccinate. She vaccinates with AstraZeneca and Pfizer BioNTech. The exhaustion was definitely related to the vaccination because on the days she wasn't involved in it, she was not exhausted. Heidrun described that after the day of vaccinating people, she felt constricted in her own skin, and as if her body was no longer her own.[...]It was striking that in addition to that, she also developed a relationship to the Pfizer BioNTech group soul as well as to the soratic spirits of transhumanism - even though she was not vaccinated. Normally such spiritual connection is not possible without physical inoculation. That is, these beings must have \"jumped\" over to her. The AstraZeneca beings did not jump over. After the spiritual cleansing from the relation to BioNTech and the beings of transhumanism, she felt better again. - [Another] friend wanted to speak to me urgently. She reported that she had been beside herself for a week, had hardly any energy, had lost her goals in life and many bad feelings were coming up in her. She did not know what had happened to her. It had been like this since Sunday.In the supersensible investigation, she looked as if she had received a Corona vaccination. A part of her soul constitution and I-organization were removed for about 15 inches to the right; there was a blockage between the angel and her; in her aura there were dark beings, sparlings of soratic beings, and spirits of transhumanism.She is a spiritually developed person, experienced in the healing work she does with clients. And yet, she got caught. Nobody is perfect - in every aura, there are holes of unresolved old karma. Through these holes beings connected to the corona vaccines may enter - even without the syringe. We discussed the impressions, turned with concentrated healing power towards those beings and after an hour she felt centered again and restored. - A week later I had a similar experience, a friend of mine was down and didn't know what was wrong with her. In meditative diagnosis, it turned out that in her \"I\" she was possessed by soratic spirits of transhumanism. Here again, the problem could be solved....Thus, it is possible to absorb spirits that work in the corona vaccine into the soul without being physically vaccinated. This is not at all surprising. This is also the case with the supersensible perceptions of these beings, but in a controlled and protected way.\" The implications of these reports can be shocking and fear-inducing to many people. Do the ones who have not been vaccinated need to keep their distance from the vaccinated part of the population to not take on any of these hostile spirits? I don't take this extreme [paranoid] view, as I mentioned before. Yes, there may need to be caution and common sense, and every situation is different and specific. For example, having sex or intimate physical contact with a vaccinated person if you are unvaccinated could end up in taking on soratic adversary spirits. A lot is happening on unseen levels, even without any vaccinations, when engaging sexually, as explored in this article: [Sexual Vampirism - Sex and Entity Attachments.](https://veilofreality.com/2019/03/05/sexual-vampirism-sex-and-entity-attachments/) Regarding relationships where one partner got the vax, and the other didn't get it, this may cause some issues. I'm not here to tell anyone what to do, and I am just sharing this research, insights, and personal views. You need to decide what is right for you. As I said before, personally, I won't receive any treatment from a bodyworker, therapist, or practitioner who has been inoculated. Does this imply that you may have taken on a \"vaccine entity\" when you received treatment from a vaxxed practitioner? No, not necessarily so. Once again, I warn of fear and paranoia. Most importantly, take care of your health on all levels, boost your spiritual immune system with spiritual practices, psychological self-work [to close off any entry points], and live a spiritual life in sincere aspiration and [surrender to the Divine](https://veilofreality.com/2019/10/09/the-necessity-to-surrender-to-the-divine-and-spiritualize-the-being/). As we can see based on Mayer's research and case studies, bodyworkers, therapists, and practitioners in the healing arts also need to be aware of the possibility of \"taking something on'\" from a vaccinated person they treat. Protection and Clearing measures are imperative for anyone in the healing/therapist space, even without the vaccine issue. If you stay in the body, grounded in the Self, and work with sincere prayer [not mechanical reciting] to receive Divine projection, you can also mitigate any negative effects or intrusions and not take anything on if you work on someone who received the vaccine even if you receive a treatment from a vaccinated person. Mayer also stresses that physical inoculation is far more dangerous because the vaccine itself contains a soratic being and, therefore, is more challenging to harmonize and clear. An unvaccinated person who has possibly absorbed an entity from a vaccinated person is easier to remove and could even clear themselves. How To Protect Yourself From Intrusive Adversary Spirits The most important part to understand is what Thomas Mayer noted above: \"In every aura, there are holes of unresolved old karma. Through these holes beings connected to the corona vaccines may enter - even without the syringe.\" In other words, there needs to be an \"entry point\" for soratic beings to come in. These entry points and holes in the aura of unresolved karma, Mayer is talking about, are related to unresolved [unconscious] trauma [including past life trauma], childhood wounds, and shadow aspects [relating to shadow work] which are all stored in the body just like \" [karma\" [past experiences we have not processed and pushed into the unconscious] is stored in the body](https://veilofreality.com/2019/04/24/soul-evolution-universal-laws-and-karma-in-the-body/). Holes in the aura can be created by trauma, and everyone carries trauma to varying degrees back to the \"original wound\" of [illusory] separation from God. Ego-identification can be seen as a trauma response itself. I've addressed this topic many times over the years in my [writings](https://veilofreality.com/articles/), [videos](https://veilofreality.com/videofilm/), [webinars](https://veilofreality.com/occult-forces-of-hyper-dimensions-entity-attachments-and-interferences-discernment-clearing-and-protection/), and [podcasts](https://veilofreality.com/the-cosmic-matrix-podcast/) [with my wife Laura]. Anyone can be subjected to these occult forces with or without a vaccine. Just because someone is \"red-pilled,\" i.e., has some intellectual awareness of the matrix, or hasn't taken the jab doesn't imply they are immune [no pun intended] from any interference and attachments from soratic/asuric beings or any other form of occult hostile forces. Mayer's work is based on the cosmology of Rudolf Steiner, and many other esoteric traditions and occult teachings have talked about similar beings in their own words. Your/our ego blindspots, wounds, traumas, shadow aspects, lower nature desires, etc., serve as \"entry points.\" In addition, overuse of cannabis, medicine plants, pharmaceuticals, etc., also damages the astral body. It creates entry points, so does everyday stress, etc. ... anytime we have no self-awareness, i.e., don't \"remember ourselves\" [as Gurdjieff would say], we can be subjected to occult interferences. Living a head-centric existence, cut off from the body as most people do in our computerized world also creates a split [holes in the aura] for occult forces to come in. Many red-pilled \"truthers\" are driven and influenced by these forces, especially tempting them to externalize evil, shadow-project, fall into doom&gloom blame/victim consciousness, identify with thoughts that are not their own, etc., mostly people who are not engaged in any form of sincere self-work. Seeking truth and fighting evil only \"out there\" is not enough and in fact, can make things worse if we don't apply shadow work and take back our projections. Augmented via occult forces, the temptation to externalize all evil and see oneself as \"better\" keeps people trapped in the matrix of their own minds and puppets in the hands of occult forces. Shadow work has become more popularized over the past few years, with many distortions and over-simplifications. Anyone who claims who has no triggers doesn't project and is \"done with shadow work\" is severely lying to themselves. It would be the same to claim that one is fully Self-Realized and enlightened. You can also waste years and decades of just intellectualizing the process of shadow work without progressing one bit (I've fallen into this trap for some years in the beginning). It needs to happen somatically on all levels, and the body stores everything. Before applying and doing shadow work correctly, which is highly uncomfortable, messy, and painful, one must know HOW to do it and WHAT it implies. It also requires a certain level of self-awareness, the witness within, and the ability to observe the projections, transference, projection identification, triggers, etc., without justifying, externalizing, or attaching a story to any of it. That is easier said than done, and I'm not taking myself out of the equation. This process also requires years of study and practice, so it becomes \"second nature\"- applied embodied knowledge and not merely intellectual theoretical. It is the gateway to the Divine, which needs to be brought down. No shortcuts. It's the law of ascent and descent and an ongoing process for any of us engaged in The Work. \"In shadow projecting, we split-off from and try to get rid of a part of ourselves, which is a self-mutilation that is actually an act of violence. In the act of shadow projecting, we disassociate from a part of ourselves and \"split\" (in two), turning away in revulsion from and severing our association with our darker half, as if we have never met it before in our entire life. We throw our own darkness outside of ourselves and see it as if it exists only in others. We then react violently when we encounter an embodied reflection of our shadow in the outer world, wanting to destroy it, as it reminds us of something dark within ourselves that we'd rather have nothing to do with. In the act of shadow projecting, we perpetrate violence (both psychic and/or physical) not only on ourselves, but on the \"other\" who is the recipient of our shadow projection. This act of external violence is nothing other than our inner process of doing violence to a part of ourselves changing channels and expressing itself in, as and through the external world. In trying to destroy our projected shadow in the outer world, however, we act out, become possessed by and incarnate the very shadow we are trying to destroy. Paradoxically, in descending into the depths of the unconscious in order to deal with the prima materia of the shadow, we are simultaneously on the path of ascending to the truly real, as we become introduced to the higher-dimensional light worlds of spirit.\" - Paul Levy, Dispelling Wetiko I've addressed some of the major misconceptions about \"The Topic of All Topics\" in my article [Occulted Knowledge, Spiritual Bypassing, and The Necessity of Holistic Integral Self-Work.](https://veilofreality.com/2021/11/01/occulted-knowledge-spiritual-bypassing-and-the-necessity-of-holistic-integral-self-work/) The solution and remedy? As always, it's The Great Work as it's been called towards a true awakening, engaging in the process of soul embodiment. This work entails grounded fundamental psychological work, shadow work, and spiritual work. But that's the work most people shy away from because it's not easy and confronting. It entails conscious suffering and struggles, for the war is within and through us. Anyone who claims to be \"free\" from any interference is the same as claiming to be fully soul embodied, spiritualized, and enlightened. To believe that only others are affected by entities is a matrix trap in itself, overestimating one's level of being and most likely engaging in some sort of bypassing. The path gets very narrow. At the same time, these forces serve as a teaching function in light of the evolution of consciousness and can be \"utilized as teachers,\" They highlight what needs to be healed, integrated, and rejected. Everyone is affected differently by these forces, even the inoculated, and Mayer stresses that point in his book not to make generalizations. One's level of being, karmic lessons, and many unknown factors [to the mind] come into the equation. We are in the dark age and all and everything needs or be revealed within and without during this Time of Transition. This is why we're here, and it couldn't be any other way. The Effects Of Allopathic Medicine And Psychiatric Drugs In The Afterlife The Afterlife and Earthbound Spirits \"If there is an evolution of consciousness in an evolutionary body and a soul inhabiting the body, a real and conscious individual, then it is evident that it is the progressive experience of that soul in Nature which takes the form of this evolution of consciousness: rebirth is self-evidently a necessary part, the sole possible machinery of such an evolution. It is as necessary as birth itself; for without it birth would be an initial step without a sequel, the starting of a journey without its farther steps and arrival. It is rebirth that gives to the birth of an incomplete being in a body its promise of completeness and its spiritual significance.\" - Sri Aurobindo, The Philosophy of Rebirth In light of soul evolution, the evolution of consciousness implies that the soul progresses and \"grows\" over many lifetimes, reincarnations, and rebirths. The body is the vehicle for the soul. After death, the soul leaves the body and goes through various stages before incarnating into a new body. Millions of reported NDEs (Near Death Experiences) share the same experiences of leaving the physical body, \"going towards the Light,\" experiencing a \"life review,\" etc. Many ancient esoteric traditions, including anthroposophy, describe the laws that govern the afterlife. The Tibetan Book of the Dead is a classical manual helping the soul make the passage to the Light and the various after-death stages, so the soul doesn't get stuck in the Bardo, the transitional state between death and rebirth. [Note: The idea that reincarnation and the tunnel of light is a trap of the alien hyperdimensional matrix to recycle souls to keep us entrapped in the matrix is paranoid disinformation [in my view] that seems to be circling around in \"fringe conspiracy\" circles. I've addressed this topic in this article: [Soul Evolution, Universal Laws, and Karma in The Body.]](https://veilofreality.com/2019/04/24/soul-evolution-universal-laws-and-karma-in-the-body/) The level of being and the state of soul integration/individualization determines the death experience and what happens after death. The whole point of inner esoteric work and consciously engaging on the path towards awakening in this physical body is soul individuation, working through Karma and lessons from lifetime to lifetime. The more embodied you are (soul integration) - the more you are sincerely engaged in the inner work to anchor the Divine (which implies working through traumas/wounds/issues that we all have to vary degrees) - the higher your Level of Being rises, the more Free Will you actually gain/earn and the more awareness/consciousness you will have - all of which will determine what you experience after death. The state of consciousness a person is in at the moment of death also profoundly impacts the afterlife experience. There are traps, dead-ends, and blockages in the afterlife that can prevent a soul from reaching the Light, getting stuck in the lower realm, and bound to earth as an earthbound spirit. Thomas Mayer describes some of these afterlife blockages: ...There are many blockades and dead ends in the afterlife. Soul's Earth-bondage is a very big problem today. ...I have been working on this topic for many years and have published a long working paper on helping the dead. After-death blockages can have etheric, soul, and spiritual causes. For example, the shock of a very sudden accidental death can lead to an after-death binding. Unsolved and suppressed soul traumas collected during a lifetime often become an insurmountable blockade that the soul cannot get past after death. A too deep willful immersion in a materialistic way of thinking can lead to a darkening of consciousness in the afterlife. In consequence, the soul does not perceive its spiritual environment....\" Dr. Willam Baldwin's work and \"Spirit Releasement Therapy\" go deeper into this topic. An earthbound spirit/soul is the surviving consciousness of a deceased human. It can attach to another living human being as a discarnate entity. It is the most common form of possession. Earthbound spirit possession of the deceased is a big topic on its own. Here is a short article: [Spirit Possession Syndrome](https://veilofreality.com/spirit-possession-syndrome/) based on Dr. Baldwins' work. I also recommend his books \"Spirit Realeasnemnt Therapy\" and \"Healing Lost Edith Fiore's classic \"The Unquiet Dead - A Psychologist, Treats Spirit Possession.\" Their work describes many case studies on how to release unwanted spirits from your body and help confused earthbound spirits cross over to the Light. Poisoning the body with drugs causes blockages in the afterlife However, as Mayer said, \"not only the state of soul and spirit affects the life after death; there are also blockages caused by a poisoning of the body.\" Excessive use of allopathic medicine and psychiatric drugs/pharmaceuticals [including \"illegal\" druges] can negatively affect the afterlife experience and keep the soul earthbound. Dr. Baldwin has made the same discoveries in his work, and so has Steve Richards in his work with Holographic Kineticsics. Thomas Mayer describes such a case [based on asthroposophy] of someone who died of cancer after having received heavy doses of chemotherapy: Cemented ether body after chemotherapy \"During a meditation class, Martin was taken by a deep sadness, which surprised him, and kept him occupied throughout the day. We took a closer look and it turned out that his twin brother, Stefan, died of cancer six years ago....Before his death, he was receiving strong chemotherapy and had a bloated face. The sadness that overtook Martin was not his own feelings, but the feelings of his brother. He was in despair because he was not able to let go - he felt as if he was bound with iron chains by an external power. I didn't understand it at first, because in his soul Stefan was jovial, happy, and free; I couldn't find any bond at all. Only when I looked at his etheric body (life body) did I understand that it was solidified like black glue, compacted like asphalt. These were the consequences of chemotherapy. Stefan's astral body (soul body) could not separate from the ether body; his astral body was not able to leave his earthly life behind and enter the Kamaloka, that is, into the so-called Moon Sphere. This was not possible for Stefan, although he urgently longed for it. I found soratic-ahrimanic beings in his etheric body, which were obviously connected with the substances used in chemotherapy and thus had gained access to Stefan's body. These were side effects of the chemotherapy, which are not described in the package insert. It is known, however, that cemeteries prolong the lying time of dead bodies with chemotherapy because these bodies do not decompose easily (Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung 199, a newspaper article from 9.5.1997, \"Chemotherapie verzoegert Verwesungsprozess\" - \"Chemotherapy delays process of decomposition\"). This is an earthly expression of what Stefan experienced in the spiritual world.\" In his book, Mayer describes more cases of the detrimental effects of [legal] Euthanasia, Antibody Therapy, Psychiatric Drugs, Morphine, and other Allopathic medicines on the astral/ether body during life and in the afterlife. They can keep the spirit stuck in the lower astral realm and vulnerable to the influence and attachment of soratic hostile forces. \"With these examples, it is not said that all orthodox [allopathic] medications work this way. Many do not, but some do. Such after-death consequences resemble torture. However, the after-death side effects of drugs are not investigated and considered at all. ...The problem has been known for a long time. Rudolf Steiner spoke a hundred years ago very clearly about how material substances can have an after-death effect.\" Here's another example of a case study of the effects of psychiatric drugs in the afterlife: \"A colleague studied Melperone, one of the most common drugs for agitation, anxiety, and depression. She let the drug act on her bodies and experienced that the \"I\" and the astral body were pushed into the etheric body and the physical body and held in them. As a result, the \"I\" activity was paralyzed, and the astral body became more agile; dullness and rigidity developed. It can be assumed that this has an effect on sleep and that the \"I\" and the astral body could no longer be regularly released from the etheric and the physical bodies at night but remained stuck in it. The soul could no longer be among spiritual beings during the time of sleep. With that, the consciousness of the spiritual world would be extinguished, and the soul would be put into an artificial immobility. Such was the experience of a woman whose mother was given Meloperon while living in the old people's home. The lady, who was over 90 years old and spiritually awake, put into something of this condition in desperate words: \"I am not anymore! I am no longer here!\" Looking at the daughter who visited her, she said: \"Here you come, and I should be happy, but I feel nothing\". - She could no longer rejoice or take part in anything. She also lost interest in anthroposophy, even in praying, which had been part of her life for decades. This condition did not stop with death. Years later it was observed that the soul of the old lady was still in isolation and could not enter a regular Kamalokoa process. It lacked the ability to deeply feel the consequences of one's own deeds in the souls of others. She had an awareness of herself, also memories of her life on Earth, but only from her own point of view. She was stuck in a certain immobility of the soul and could not directly perceive or feel the spiritual surroundings of the human souls belonging to her, or even sense them in the distance. She lived isolated and surrounded by darkness. She received light and warmth only through the loving care of the living - their requests, meditations, and spiritual thoughts. However, these attentions could not fundamentally change the state of isolation itself. This was only achieved through targeted extensive Healing Meditations. What is shocking about this case is that even people who had lived intensively with anthroposophy could be kept in a gray cocoon - in loneliness and without direct perception of their spiritual surroundings - caused by psychotropic drugs. Their process of development in the Kamaloka can be severely hindered by this for years.\" There are more cases of these detrimental effects of pharmaceuticals on the spiritual bodies of humans in Mayer's book. Corona Vaccination Damages In The Life After Death Thomas Mayer and his research team also discovered that the effects of the vaccines don't stop with death. While the physical body is discarded at death, the spiritual beings and forces of the COVID vaccines continue to work. Mayer shows some case studies of what this means for the deceased vaccinated people: \"On February 23, 2021, during a work meeting, I had the opportunity to perceive a deceased person, who had received a corona vaccination before leaving the body. The etheric body of the deceased was contracted, slanted, and tense, the soul was chained to it, sad, suffering, lonely and disoriented in darkness. Normally, after death, the etheric body expands and the tableau of life becomes free, in which the deceased experiences all the memories of his or her past life in simultaneity and greater clarity. This did not happen here, the life tableau was prevented, and the soul was stuck earthbound. No light of the spiritual world reached it. Normally, the deceased are received and enveloped by their angels. That was not the case here, the angel was without connection on the sidelines. From such blocked states souls cannot free themselves from their predicament in foreseeable time. They need an intervention from the outside. Spiritual interventions, which are stimulated by incarnated people, can help here. We did our best for this poor soul to help it in a process of development. Was this just an isolated case or is it common after corona vaccination? That is a burning question. If there is no one to take care of the earthbound deceased, it may take many centuries for their condition to change. \"It's just a jab and then you can travel again\", announce the vaccinations commercials. But in reality, it could mean that the soul cannot make its journey through the spiritual world for hundreds of years after death, stuck, suffering, and thus burdening living ones.\" Mayer also mentions that \"spiritually, the deceased are always close to the living connected with them. If the dead are in a bad condition, it radiates to the living.\" He is hinting at the possibility that these earthbound spirits of the deceased can result in spirit attachments to the living population, as Dr. William Baldwin described in his work mentioned before. Mayer is now asking the big question standing like the elephant in the living room, addressing the reality that over half of the global population has become fully vaccinated with at least one short. Many people have had two, three, or even four boosters. We also know that Klaus Schwab (WEF), Bill Gates, and the WHO want to see the entire world the population getting vaccinated. \"As shown in the previous chapters, some modern medicines are known to have similar after-death effects as we have noticed after the Covid vaccinations. Now, however, the whole of mankind is to be vaccinated. If the after-death renewal phase fails for billions of people, what will become of mankind? That would be just as with incarnate humans who are denied a deep sleep break. Can these earthbound dead people incarnate again at all? And what effects would that have on the next incarnations?\" In-Depth Insights Into Earth-Bounded Vaccinated People Mayer and his team observed supersensibly 11 deceased people who had been vaccinated. Their souls were earthbound, isolated, and became prey for occult hostile forces: \"We have looked supersensibly at eleven deceased who had been vaccinated. These eleven dead people were earthbound. Their higher bodies were so disjointed and devoid of the protection from the higher beings that they were easy prey for Adversarial Spirits. The I- organization, the higher \"I\" and the angel were also earthbound and suffered an attack by these beings. The souls were mostly in a dark spiritual space, filled with fear, despair, and pain. They had no contact with other souls and felt alone and abandoned. These negative feelings and thoughts have a destructive effect on the earth and are used purposefully by the Ahrimanic and Asuric beings.\" There are also deeper \"hell realms\" in the lower astral levels where souls of the vaccinated could be pulled down to: \"We are glad when souls are only earthbound because we also had cases when souls were pulled down into the so-called sixth spiritual dark inner layer of earth. This happens when an explosion of the etheric and astral body took place at death. But this had taken place only in some cases.\" More Cases Of Earth-Bounded Vaccinated People \"...There was a darkening, like small black dots, from the contact with the dark forces. The double is a little closer than normal and has a strong relation to these dark points of the astral body. The body elemental has been hardened; trauma has taken place. Also, the guardian angel had remnants of traumatization. The encounter with the dark beings that come with the vaccines seems to be a great challenge and leaves traces. This example also shows the profound effect of Corona vaccinations. This can be a traumatic, severely hurtful experience, which is why the deceased is often unable to free himself from it by his own efforts. Then help and influence from the outside are necessary. Without such intervention, the state of being earthbound and cut off from the spiritual world can last for a long time. A few hundred years seems possible....\" Another research group in Germany looked at 31 vaccinated deceased people: \"We have looked at a total of 31 vaccinated deceased people, all of whom were earthbound. These people died in March and April 2021 and were mostly over 80 years old. Earthbound means that the etheric body and phantom body (physical spirit body) are solidified and do not expand. The soul is chained to these bodies and therefore lives in darkness - it does not experience life-panorama or their spiritual environment and does not experience its angel. They neither can experience other light-filled dead around them nor the warming spiritual light of the Christ. Due to their bad condition, these earth-bound souls negatively influence the soul- and consciousness life of those incarnated on earth who were connected with them, and thus shape the collective atmosphere, without necessarily being aware of it themselves.[...]\" Another question that comes up in light of these observations is whether it makes a difference if someone dies years later after the vaccination. All the cases mentioned above were of deceased people who died within a few weeks of receiving the vaccine. The supersensible research team asked this question and stated that it is impossible to say since it could not be observed at the time of this research and the release of Mayer's book. After verifying these cases for himself, and realizing the \"horror of the situation\" with regards to the spiritual implications of billions of people who have been vaccinated, Mayer shares his thoughts: \"To verify these experiences, I have worked with these deceased myself and could confirm the earth-boundness and the described peculiarities. The extent of these after-death effects of vaccination is frightening for me. In the last years, I have dealt a lot with blockades in the after-death life and have seen so much, that I was able to develop a kind of professional sobriety, like emergency paramedics who drive from accident to accident. Nevertheless, the extent of this vaccination catastrophe gets under my skin. For my own spiritual hygiene, it is important that I give space to these feelings. That is why I am writing about it. Through that, they turn into the power that makes it possible to stay on the subject and write this book.\" More cases of earthbound spirits of vaccinated people are in Mayer's book, which you can read and study for yourself. For the purpose of this article, I just quote some selected cases to give an overview in light of the overall matrix agenda and the spiritual warfare we are in. As I said many times and as it is becoming even more evident, we are in the midst of a multi-dimensional war over our soul and, essentially, the future of humanity. But not all is lost. At the end of this article, we'll get to that part of \"what to do.\" It's nothing new and what I've addressed over and over again. We all have the power to overcome this frightening situation and reclaim our soul and divine nature, but it does require effort, sincerity, and self-responsibility. Earthbound Spirits Of the Vaccinated Dead As Feeding Ground For Dark Adversary Spirits Mayer made another disturbing discovery. In some cases, the trapped earthbound spirit of a deceased vaccinated person becomes prey on which adversary hostile forces were feeding off, i.e., sucking the life force out of them. Most often, other earthbound spirits become conduits of powerful adversary negative forces as described in this case: \"...During the spiritual intervention, I concentrated first on the soratic-transhumanism spirits in her etheric body. But this was not enough, there were other dark inclusions connected with a group of deceased, who were in a miserable state and had connected themselves with the highest adversarial spirits. These sucked power from the earthbound woman. Only after the possession by this group of the dead was removed, was the spiritual intervention felt to be bringing effects. This sucking out is not surprising; the enslavement of the deceased exists for eons in many variations and was often also brought about consciously. In this case, the vile group of dead souls simply used the \"good opportunity\" and occupied the defenseless woman to help themselves to her powers. Deceased, who are enwrapped by their angel, cannot be possessed, but this angel protection was prevented by the Corona inoculation. How often does it happen that earthbound vaccinated dead are used as feeding trough by spiritual predators? I am afraid, very often, because in the spiritual world there are innumerable miserable dead, who have no connection to the higher spiritual world and who therefore resort to feeding themselves from the powers of other dead.\" Keep in mind that the opposing occult hostile forces [feed on consciousness](https://veilofreality.com/the-positivenegative-realms-of-higher-densities-by-michael-topper/), the life force, and the projected emotional loosh of human beings - the primary \"modus operandi\" of the dark forces that have enslaved humanity and the ultimate \"purpose\" of the hyperdimensional matrix. I've written about this topic in depth over the years. For a selection of articles and essays on this topic, go [HERE](https://veilofreality.com/category/hyperdimensional-realities-occult-forces/) and check out my [free e-books.](https://veilofreality.com/get-free-ebooks/) I've also created an 8-hr webinar about these Occult Forces [HERE](https://veilofreality.com/occult-forces-of-hyper-dimensions-entity-attachments-and-interferences-discernment-clearing-and-protection/). The only way to fully protect yourself is via [The Great Work and spiritualizing your Being](https://veilofreality.com/category/spirituality-the-great-work/). The more you live from essence and have your soul fully embodied, the less these adverse forces can get to you, whether in this physical life or in the afterlife. Freeing Those Who Died Due To Vaccine Damage Can Be Very Difficult In the next chapter of the book, Mayer shares experiences of practitioners helping stuck earthbound spirits of deceased vaccinated people to transition towards the light, getting them out of the grip of dark, hostile forces, and reclaim their spiritual Selves. This work is not easy at all, and it requires a lot of occult knowledge, experience, and supersensible perception. Moreover, the practitioner needs to be careful not to take on an entity him/herself or be negatively affected in other ways. As mentioned before, the practitioners in Mayer's research team and cited in his book are all trained in anthroposophy based on Steiner's work with decades of experience. However, the same healing work of helping earthbound spirits transition and recover from the adverse effects of the vaccination could also be achieved, in my opinion - with Dr. William Baldwin's modality \"Spirit Releasement Therapy\" spirit releasement modalities can achieve the same [and there are also a lot of nonsense and pseudo-New Age-type modalities], but I can only comment on those I've studied or worked with myself. But whatever the modality may be, it is not easy work but requires many sessions and a lot of time and energy. Keep in mind that we're dealing with a new type of \"demonic\" entity [the \"vaccine being\" and/or \"soratic-transhumanism spirits\"] that is being injected directly into a person via the vaccine. Thomas Mayer writes about these challenges to spiritual healers helping the dead: \"However, the report reveals a big problem: even spiritual healers experienced in helping the dead can be overwhelmed with vaccinated dead, and the work takes a very long time. Who then is to take care of the immense number of vaccinated deceased? This is not manageable at all. There is an absolute shortage of personnel and training. Only in selected cases will the vaccinated dead be able to get the help they need.\" Realizing the impossibility to help all vaccinated dead, Mayer comes to the most important conclusion which I have continually pointed out as well: \"Those who get vaccinated must do it on their own spiritual responsibility. At present, it is unfortunately quite naive to hope for after-death help. If things go badly, the spiritual world can no longer reach the deceased, and the other incarnated people who have the necessary abilities and experience are hopelessly overloaded.\" I would add that this \"spiritual responsibility\" also needs to be applied by the non-vaccinated or anyone aware enough to engage in this inner [Great] Work on all levels: physical, emotional, psychological, and spiritual. This is the work of soul embodiment and sincere self-work to expel and reject any dark forces and reclaim your soul. How Many Are Earthbound? The ultimate question is how many of the vaccinated dead didn't transition to the lIght but became earthbound spirits stuck in the lower astral realm. Thomas Mayer and his research team of qualified and experienced supersensible practitioners found that out of 48 of the deceased vaccinated they worked with, only one of them was not earthbound. In that case, I would say that the person's soul development and spiritual constitution were strong enough to repel the soratic beings of the vaccine even though he took the vaccine. Here are Mayer's notes on that one particular case: \"A very special experience for me was the meeting with Raphael on 5.28.2021, a great soul. Raphael died in March 2021 at the age of 91, three days after the vaccination. He would have died in a foreseeable time even without vaccination. He was demented the few last years, but physically quite fit. He was very close to Anthroposophy.[...] ...What happened by the Corona vaccination before his death? I try to look at it, and I have the impression that his soul was aware of the deep-dark beings and forces that came with the vaccination. I can feel their quality well, he could probably feel it too. There was a stop, \"You will not enter in here!\" Thus, he remained untouched by them inwardly.\" However, 47 out of the 48 deceased become earthbound after death: \"The question arises: Can the cases described be generalized? Must it be expected that very many vaccinated deceased are earthbound? I think so because the tendency is clear. In our research, we have found almost none of the vaccinated dead were not earthbound. Of course, the number of examined cases is still small, but the result is clear. Of the 48 deceased mentioned in this chapter, 47 were earthbound and only one was not. Thus, we must assume that the Corona inoculations lead to earth-boundness after death to a great extent - if no processes of \"working through\" the vaccine have taken place before death. This condition is important because in all cases studied only a few weeks passed between vaccination and death, and the people were mostly already so old or presumably in such a bad condition that hardly any processes could take place. If a person is vaccinated in middle age, leads an active life, and then dies after 30 years, it is to be assumed that completely different preconditions for the afterlife prevail - at least if the Corona vaccinations are not repeated every year.\" There is more information in Mayer's book also with regards to CVOID-19, the \"illness\" itself, and other topics relating to it that are only available in the German edition of the complete book at the time of writing this article. As mentioned before, the English version of the complete book will come out in late Summer 2022. The Situation Is Not Hopeless - The Importance To Engage In The Great Work Despite this dire situation and disturbing revelations about the spiritual effects of the Corona vaccine, let's not forget an important point Mayer [and myself] made at the beginning: We need to be careful of paranoia, overly negative thinking (doom & gloom fear frequency), and especially careful of generalizations. While the situation may look indeed dire, disturbing, and even \"hopeless\" to some, we need to stay non-reactive and objective as best as we can. I see a tendency in today's \"truth movement\" and \"conspiracy world\" of over-exaggerated fear and negative sentiments filled with shadow projections. As Thomas Mayer wrote in his book as well, everyone is affected by the vaccine differently on an individual basis so we cannot make generalizations. Many known and unknown factors come in: how many doses/boosters did a person receive, the person's level of being, soul development, spiritual strength, karmic and spiritual lessons, and much more that is impossible for the mind to grasp. Mayer also stated that \" the situation is not hopeless,\" and there are lessons to be learned. I wholeheartedly agree with that statement. In fact, all there are, ARE lessons in light of the evolution of consciousness from the much bigger picture perspective in alignment with Divine Will. It's essential to [ENGAGE in the Great Work](https://www.thetimeoftransition.com) towards individuation and spiritualizing our being, i.e. soul embodiment, anchoring the soul, and bringing forth essence without identifying with our ego-personality. However, we must also be aware of the danger of spiritual bypassing. This work also includes deep psychological self-work to heal our wounds and traumas, mainly engaging in shadow work, becoming aware of your projections and triggers, and hence healing/closing the entry point for any hostile forces to come in. Over the years, I've written and talked about this necessary deeper [inner] work in depth. If you're new to my work, you can find many resources about it on [my website](https://veilofreality.com) and in the hyperlinks in this article. Laura and I have also talked about it on many episodes of the [Cosmic Matrix Podcast](https://veilofreality.com/the-cosmic-matrix-podcast/). This is not easy work by far. Many people say they want to \"awaken\" and engage in shadow work. Still, when the rubber hits the road, it gets messy and uncomfortable when all the suppressed unconscious psychic material comes up. The counter projections kick in with all the justifications and rationalizations, and many well-meaning people cannot cross the threshold at this point and go \"back to sleep.\" We are in the midst of the Kali Yuga [ruled by the demon Kali, not the goddess Kali as most people mistake], the darkest cycle where humanity is the most removed from the Divine and where the anti-divine forces of darkness reign the world, working through humans normalizing all kinds of pathologies. We've been in the Kali Yuga for thousands of years as we descend deeper into darkness. From a higher perspective, this is a natural process in light of the evolution of consciousness according to the Law of Ascent and Descent. Still, we also contribute to the darkness and feed the anti-divine occult forces, for we are not \"integrally sincere,\" as the Mother [Sri Aurobindo's partner] said. In other words, we have not fully surrendered all parts of our Being to the Divine. All of us, without exception, are still attached/addicted to and driven by conscious/unconscious desires stemming from the lower animal nature and hence contribute to the darkness \"out there.\" We all justify it in our own ways. Everyone, without exception, have trauma going back lifetimes and even just basic childhood wounding from growing up in a world where pathology has become normalized. We all have goals, needs, desires, and wants that stem from the wounded/conditioned false self, the fake desire soul [as Sri Aurobindo called it], mistaking it for your true Self. They are compensations and externalizations not to deal with the pain of not trying to fill a hole within that can never be filled that way. And that is also where the adverse occult forces tag into, feed upon, and even fuel it through temptation. We are not integrally sincere and have all kinds of excuses, rationalizations, and reasons not engaging in the Great [inner] Work. We project our pain externally onto others and justify our triggers and projections. Anyone who claims that they are not wounded/traumatized or has no shadow is even more traumatized than they are aware of. As I continue to dig deep into my own darkness, shining light [consciousness] on all the parts of myself that have been wounded and traumatized, neglected, shamed, and shunned, with all the pain, sadness, anger, and grief that comes up in the process, the more I see it in others who are dreaming of being awake and are checked out of their bodies, mechanically living along like programs. Their entire existence is just a trauma response, as they are puppets by forces they have no awareness of. I'm not just speaking of people who go along with the globalist agenda but also many who claim to be \"awake\" just because they see through the 3D matrix agenda. But they still externalize, and I don't know many people who actually engage sincerely in the inner work to clear the vessel to fully integrally surrender to the Divine. I'm not taking myself out of the equation, for I can see my lack of sincerity at times. The struggle of how my ego-personality interferes with all its attachments, how unconscious trauma/wounding still triggers specific reactions and behaviors in me, and how I can project my shadow onto others and the world at times. I would never claim to be fully \"awake\" in the word's TRUE meaning. So many people overestimate their level of being/awareness just because they maybe can see through the deception of the 3D matrix on an intellectual level. But that is not enough. As Adyashanti once said: \"The truth of the matter is that most people who say they want awakening don't actually \"want to awaken.\" They want their version of Awakening. What they actually want is to be really happy in their dream state. But the real, sincere impulse toward enlightenment is something that goes far beyond the desire to make our dream state better. It is an impulse that is willing to subject itself to whatever is needed in order to wake up. The authentic impulse toward enlightenment is that internal prayer asking for whatever it is that will bring us to a full awakening, no matter whether it turns out to be wonderful or terrible. It is an impulse that puts no conditions on what we have to go through.\" In other words, do you really want to awaken or just be happy? The answer to this question and how you act on it is a test of your sincerity, and ultimately the \"solution\" to the madness/darkness \"out there,\" for only your own sincere Awakening can help change the world. If your answer to that question is \"I want both\", you'll see the perfect example of why the world is still in darkness and your own struggle within with all the contradictions. We still have a long way to go, but make no mistake, a genuine awakening is a destructive process within yourself, not just out there. \"This yoga [Unition with the Divine] is a battle...no one can reach heaven who has not walked through hell,\" as Sri Aurobindo and many other masters of the past have pointed out this universal/divine Truth. No one can escape the Law of Ascent and Descent. It's about engaging in the Work. I'm putting that mirror right on myself too. \"There are two powers that alone can effect in their conjunction the great and difficult thing which is the aim of our endeavour, a fixed and unfailing aspiration that calls from below and a supreme Grace from above that answers. But the supreme Grace will act only in the conditions of the Light and the Truth; it will not act in conditions laid upon it by the Falsehood and the Ignorance. For if it were to yield to the demands of the Falsehood, it would defeat its own purpose. These are the conditions of the Light and Truth, the sole conditions under which the highest Force will descend; and it is only the very highest supramental Force descending from above and opening from below that can victoriously handle the physical Nature and annihilate its difficulties. There must be a total and sincere surrender; there must be an exclusive self-opening to the divine Power; there must be a constant and integral choice of the Truth that is descending, a constant and integral rejection of the falsehood of the mental, vital and physical Powers and Appearances that still rule the earth-Nature. The surrender must be total and seize all the parts of the being. It is not enough that the psychic (soul being) should respond and the higher mental accept or even the inner vital submit and the inner physical consciousness feel the influence. There must be in no part of the being, even the most external, anything that makes a reserve, anything that hides behind doubts, confusions and subterfuges, anything that revolts or refuses. If part of the being surrenders, but another part reserves itself, follows its own way or makes its own conditions, then each time that that happens, you are yourself pushing the divine Grace away from you. If behind your devotion and surrender you make a cover for your desires, egoistic demands and vital insistences, if you put these things in place of the true aspiration or mix them with it and try to impose them on the Divine Shakti, then it is idle to invoke the divine Grace to transform you. If you open yourself on one side or in one part to the Truth and on another side are constantly opening the gates to hostile forces, it is vain to expect that the divine Grace will abide with you. You must keep the temple clean if you wish to instal there the living Presence. If each time the Power intervenes and brings in the Truth, you turn your back on it and call in again the falsehood that has been expelled, it is not the divine Grace that you must blame for failing you, but the falsity of your own will and the imperfection of your own surrender. If you call for the Truth and yet something in you chooses what is false, ignorant and undivine or even simply is unwilling to reject it altogether, then always you will be open to attack and the Grace will recede from you. Detect first what is false or obscure in you and persistently reject it, then alone can you rightly call for the divine Power to transform you. Do not imagine that truth and falsehood, light and darkness, surrender and selfishness can be allowed to dwell together in the house consecrated to the Divine. The transformation must be integral, and integral therefore the rejection of all that withstands it. Reject the false notion that the divine Power will do and is bound to do everything for you at your demand and even though you do not satisfy the conditions laid down by the Supreme. Make your surrender true and complete, then only will all else be done for you. Reject too the false and indolent expectation that the divine Power will do even the surrender for you. The Supreme demands your surrender to her, but does not impose it: you are free at every moment, till the irrevocable transformation comes, to deny and to reject the Divine or to recall your self-giving, if you are willing to suffer the spiritual consequence. Your surrender must be self-made and free; it must be the surrender of a living being, not of an inert automaton or mechanical tool. An inert passivity is constantly confused with the real surrender, but out of an inert passivity nothing true and powerful can come. It is the inert passivity of physical Nature that leaves it at the mercy of every obscure or undivine influence. A glad and strong and helpful submission is demanded to the working of the Divine Force, the obedience of the illumined disciple of the Truth, of the inner Warrior who fights against obscurity and falsehood, of the faithful servant of the Divine. This is the true attitude and only those who can take and keep it, preserve a faith unshaken by disappointments and difficulties and shall pass through the ordeal to the supreme victory and the great transmutation.\" "}
