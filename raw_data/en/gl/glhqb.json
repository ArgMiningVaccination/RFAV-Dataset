This book presents all the publicly available questions from the PISA surveys. Some of these questions were used in the PISA 2000, 2003 and 2006 surveys and others were used in developing and trying out the assessment. After a brief introduction to the PISA assessment, the book presents three chapters, including PISA questions for the reading, mathematics and science tests, respectively. Each chapter presents an overview of what exactly the questions assess. The second section of each chapter presents questions which were used in the PISA 2000, 2003 and 2006 surveys, that is, the actual PISA tests for which results were published. The third section presents questions used in trying out the assessment. Although these questions were not used in the PISA 2000, 2003 and 2006 surveys, they are nevertheless illustrative of the kind of question PISA uses. The final section shows all the answers, along with brief comments on each question.

The OECD is also at the forefront of efforts to understand and to help governments respond to new developments andconcerns, such as corporate governance, the information economy and the challenges of anageing population. The Organisation provides a setting where governments can compare policyexperiences, seek answers to common problems, identify good practice and work to co-ordinatedomestic and international policies. The OECD member countries are: Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Korea,Luxembourg, Mexico, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Portugal, the Slovak Republic,Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, the United Kingdom and the United States. The Commission ofthe European Communities takes part in the work of the OECD.

A growing commitment by governments tomonitor the outcomes of education systems in terms of student achievement on a regular basis and within aninternationally agreed framework led to the launch of the OECD's Programme for International Assessment(PISA) in 1997. There have so far been three PISA surveys: in 2000, 2003 and 2006. The results from PISAprovide a new basis for policy dialogue and for collaboration in defining and implementing educationalgoals, in innovative ways that reflect judgements about the skills that are relevant to adult life. What does PISA actually assess? This report brings together all the publicly available questions in reading, mathematics and science and, together with the PISA assessment frameworks, gives a solid overview of thePISA test. Some of these questions were used in the PISA 2000, 2003 and 2006 surveys and others wereused in developing and trying out the assessment. For the questions used in the PISA 2000, 2003 and 2006surveys, country results are provided in Annex B to allow an overview of how well students did in eachcountry on different types of questions. Each chapter in this report has two distinct sections: the first presents the questions and the second presents the answers to these questions. This allows the reader to take the test! This report was compiled by Susanne Salz and Diana Toledo Figueroa, with editorial assistance from Elisabeth Villoutreix and Juliet Evans.TABLE OF CONTENTS 5 TAKE THE TEST: SAMPLE QUESTIONS FROM

ASSESSMENT (PISA) 121 TAKE THE TEST: SAMPLE QUESTIONS FROM OECD'S PISA \u00a9OECD 2009THE AIMS OF PISA PISA aims to measure how far students approaching the end of compulsory education have acquired some of the knowledge and skills essential for full participation in the knowledge society. PISA surveys are carriedout every three years in a large number of countries, that together make up close to 90% of the worldeconomy. The first PISA survey was carried out in 2000 in 43 countries, the second in 2003 in 41 countriesand the most recent survey was carried out in 2006 in 57 countries. The next assessments will take place in2009, 2012 and 2015. The primary objective is monitoring the outcomes of education systems in terms ofstudent achievement to provide empirically grounded information which will inform policy decisions. PISAis steered by representatives from participating countries through the PISA Governing Board. The Directoratefor Education at the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) manages PISA anddraws on the knowledge of a rich network of international experts.

The assessment focuses on young people'sability to use their knowledge and skills to meet real-life challenges, rather than merely on the extent towhich they have mastered a specific school curriculum. This approach is called 'literacy'. The definitions ofliteracy in reading, mathematics and science are explained in Chapters 2, 3 and 4 respectively. In order totest students' literacy in reading, mathematics and science, experts in different countries design assessmentframeworks and questions that represent these frameworks. These questions are then carefully piloted in allcountries before a final test is constructed that is appropriate and valid across the participating countries.Once the final booklets with test questions are created, they are given to students at a number of randomlyselected schools in each country. Tests are typically administered to between 4,500 and 40,000 studentsin each country. The questions in the booklet are grouped into units. A unit consists of stimulus materialsuch as texts, tables and/or graphs, followed by questions on various aspects of the text, table or graph. Thequestions use different formats: some are multiple choice, some require a short answer and some a longerconstructed response. Students have two hours to answers these questions. In addition students are givena separate questionnaire containing questions about their families and different aspects of their learning,including their attitudes, aspirations and learning strategies. THE PISA RESULTS Scorers look at the PISA tests and use a detailed scoring guide to give no credit, partial credit or fullcredit for each answer. The results obtained in this way are analysed to provide many interesting insights.In addition to the performance of students in different countries, results are also analysed with regardto other factors such as gender, socio-economic background and differences between schools. In thisway, PISA has produced an unprecedented comparative knowledge base of school systems and theiroutcomes, and allows these outcomes to be monitored over time. One of the key features of PISA is itspolicy orientation, with design and reporting methods determined by the need of governments to drawpolicy lessons. It is not possible to link the different information collected from students and schoolprincipals as the direct causes of PISA results, but it is possible to compare the degree of associationof various factors in different countries with educational outcomes. These policy lessons are publishedby the OECD in numerous reports which can be found on www.pisa.oecd.org. A list of OECD PISApublications can be found in Annex D. Many participating countries also produce national reports andin some cases regional reports. THE PISA QUESTIONS This book presents all the publicly available questions used in the PISA surveys, as well as questions usedin developing and trying out the surveys. Other questions have to remain confidential because they will beused in future PISA surveys to ensure comparability of the results over time. The next three chapters presentthe questions for the reading, mathematics and science tests respectively and Annex B provides countryresults for the different questions. Each chapter presents an overview of what exactly the questions assess.The second section of each chapter presents questions which were used in the PISA surveys, that is, theactual PISA tests for which results were published. The third section presents questions used in developingand trying out the surveys. These questions were not used in the actual surveys, but they are neverthelessillustrative of the kind of question PISA uses. The final section shows all the answers along with briefcomments on each question.

The PISAdefinition of reading literacy goes beyond the notion of decoding information and literal comprehensiontowards more applied tasks. Reading literacy in PISA is defined as: Understanding, using and reflecting on written texts, in order to achieve one's goals, to developone's knowledge and potential, and to participate in society. In the first PISA study in 2000, reading was the focus of the test and the majority of testing time was devotedto reading tasks. In the surveys in 2003 and 2006 reading was still assessed, but less comprehensively.Therefore the most detailed analysis was done in 2000. Reading will once again be the focus of the test inPISA 2009. Students performance in reading is assessed in relation to different text formats, reading processes and situations. The primary distinction in text formats is between continuous texts and non-continuous texts. The former refers to prose organised in sentences and paragraphs and includes descriptions, narrations and argumentations amongst others. Non-continuous texts include lists, maps, graphs and diagrams. PISAassesses three types of reading processes. Students are expected to demonstrate their proficiency in (a) retrieving information, (b) interpreting texts and forming a broad general understanding of the text and (c)reflecting and evaluating its contents, form and features. The third element of assessment is the contextorsituation of the text. Four situations are distinguished: personal use, public use, occupational use and educational use. For example, a novel, personal letter or biography is written for people's personal use;official documents or announcements for public use; a manual or report for occupational use; and a textbookor worksheet for educational use. Each question used in a PISA survey falls into one category of each of thethree aspects. Question 3.1 from the unit Graffiti, for example, assesses the process of interpreting texts,using a continuous text and a public situation. As the last two categorisations are generally fairly obvious,they will not be explicitly mentioned for the questions presented here. To report the results, PISA uses a scale. In 2000 a reading scale with an average of 500 was used. On this scale, two-thirds of students scored between 400 and 600. The higher the score the better the students'reading skills are. In PISA 2000, when reading was the focus of the test allowing more time for assessmentand more detailed results, separate scales were used for the three types of readings tasks and for the two typesof text format. These scales showed the student's reading performance specifically in retrieving information,interpreting texts, reflection and evaluation as well as for continuous texts and non-continuous texts. Moreinformation on PISA proficiency scales can be found in Annex A. This chapter presents 17 units. The first 11 units were used in PISA 2000, 2003 or 2006 surveys and internationally comparable results are published for these. Units 12 to 17 were used in developing andtesting out the surveys. While it was decided not to include these units in the PISA surveys, they arenevertheless illustrative of the kinds of questions asked in PISA. The questions presented in this chapter areall publicly released PISA reading questions. Following the section with questions, answers for all questionsare given. For units 1 to 11, a comment box includes score points, the percentage of students who answeredcorrectly across OECD countries and the question category. For country results, refer to Annex B. For units12 to 17, a comment box lists the question category. Because these units were not used in the PISA surveysthe information regarding score points and percentage of students who answered correctly is not known oris not sufficiently reliable to be presented here.READING SAMPLE TASKS 172 TAKE THE TEST: SAMPLE QUESTIONS FROM OECD'S PISA ASSESSMENTS - ISBN 978-92-64-05080-8 - \u00a9OECD 2009Figure 1 shows changing levels of Lake Chad, in Saharan North Africa.

It can leave its victims ill for weeks. The best way to fight the virus is to have a fit and healthy body. Daily exercise and a diet including plenty of fruit and vegetables are highly recommended to assist the immune system to fight this invading virus. ACOL has decided to offer staff the opportunity to be immunised against the flu as an additional way to prevent this insidious virus from spreading amongst us. ACOL has arranged for a nurse to administer the immunisations at ACOL, during a half-day session in work hours in the week of May 17. This program is free and available to all members of staff. Participation is voluntary. Staff taking up the option will be asked to sign a consent form indicating that they do not have any allergies, and that they understand they may experience minor side effects. Medical advice indicates that the immunisation does not produce influenza. However, it may cause some side effects such as fatigue, mild fever and tenderness of the arm. Who should be immunised? Anyone interested in being protected against the virus. This immunisation is especially recommended for people over the age of 65. But regardless of age, ANYONE who has a chronic debilitating disease, especially cardiac, pulmonary, bronchial or diabetic conditions. In an office environment ALL staff are at risk of catching the flu. Who should not be immunised? Individuals hypersensitive to eggs, people suffering from an acute feverish illness and pregnant women.Check with your doctor if you are taking any medication or have had a previous reaction to a flu injection.If you would like to be immunised in the week of May 17 please advise the personnel officer, Fiona McSweeney, by Friday May 7. The date and time will be set according to the availability of the nurse, the number of participants and the time convenient for most staff. If you would like to be immunised for this winter but cannot attend at the arranged time please let Fiona know. An alternative session may be arranged if there are sufficient numbers. For further information please contact Fiona on ext. 5577.

Creativity is admirable but people should find ways to express themselves that do not inflict extra costs upon society. Why do you spoil the reputation of young people by painting graffiti where it's forbidden? Professional artists do not hang their paintings in the streets, do they? Instead they seek funding and gain fame through legal exhibitions. In my opinion buildings, fences and park benches are works of art in themselves. It's really pathetic to spoil this architecture with graffiti and what's more, the method destroys the ozone layer. Really, I can't understand why these criminal artists bother as their \"artistic works\" are just removed from sight over and over again. HelgaThere is no accounting for taste. Society is full of communication and advertising. Company logos, shop names. Large intrusive posters on the streets. Are they acceptable? Yes, mostly. Is graffiti acceptable? Some people say yes, some no. Who pays the price for graffiti? Who is ultimately paying the price for advertisements? Correct. The consumer. Have the people who put up billboards asked your permission? No. Should graffiti painters do so then? Isn't it all just a question of communication - your own name, the names of gangs and large works of art in the street? Think about the striped and chequered clothes that appeared in the stores a few years ago. And ski wear. The patterns and colours were stolen directly from the flowery concrete walls. It's quite amusing that these patterns and colours are accepted and admired but that graffiti in the same style is considered dreadful. Times are hard for art. Sophia Source: Mari Hankala.

He claims not to know the victim. He says he never knew him, never went near him, never touched him... The police and the judge are convinced that he is not telling the truth. But how to prove it? At the crime scene, investigators have gathered every possibleshred of evidence imaginable:fibres from fabrics, hairs, fingermarks, cigarette ends...The fewhairs found on the victim's jacketare red. And they look strangelylike the suspect's. If it could beproved that these hairs are indeedhis, this would be evidence thathe had in fact met the victim. Every individual is unique Specialists set to work. Theyexamine some cells at the rootof these hairs and some of thesuspect's blood cells. In thenucleus of each cell in ourbodies there is DNA. What is it?DNA is like a necklace madeof two twisted strings of pearls.Imagine that these pearls comein four different colours and thatthousands of coloured pearls(which make up a gene) are strungin a very specific order. In eachindividual this order is exactly thesame in all the cells in the body:those of the hair roots as well asthose of the big toe, those of theliver and those of the stomach orblood. But the order of the pearlsvaries from one person to another.Given the number of pearls strungin this way, there is very littlechance of two people having thesame DNA, with the exception ofidentical twins. Unique to eachindividual, DNA is thus a sort ofgenetic identity card. Geneticists are therefore able to compare the suspect's geneticidentity card (determined from hisblood) with that of the person withthe red hair. If the genetic cardis the same, they will know thatthe suspect did in fact go near thevictim he said he'd never met. Just one piece of evidence More and more often in casesof sexual assault, murder, theftor other crimes, the police arehaving genetic analyses done.Why? To try to find evidence ofcontact between two people, twoobjects or a person and an object.Proving such contact is often veryuseful to the investigation. But itdoes not necessarily provide proofof a crime. It is just one piece ofevidence amongst many others. Anne Versailles We are made up of billions of cells Every living thing is made up of lots of cells. A cell is very small indeed. It can also be said to be microscopic because it can only be seen using a microscope which magnifies it many times. Each cell has an outer membrane and a nucleus in which the DNA is found. Genetic what? DNA is made up of a number of genes, each consisting of thousands of \"pearls\". Together these genes form the genetic identity card of a person. How is the genetic identity card revealed? The geneticist takes the few cells from the base of the hairs found on the victim, or from the saliva left on a cigarette end. He puts them into a product which destroys everything around the DNA of the cells. He then does the same thing with some cells from the suspect's blood. The DNA is then specially prepared for analysis. After this, it is placed in a special gel and an electric current is passed through the gel. After a few hours, this produces stripes similar to a bar code (like the ones on things we buy) which are visible under a special lamp. The bar code of the suspect's DNA is then compared with that of the hairs found on the victim.Scientific Police Weapons Source: Le Ligueur, 27th May 1998.READING SAMPLE TASKS 292 TAKE THE TEST: SAMPLE QUESTIONS FROM OECD'S PISA ASSESSMENTS - ISBN 978-92-64-05080-8 - \u00a9OECD 2009Refer to the magazine article on the opposite page to answer the questions below.

The study has established that the best course is prevention ... and good shoes. Knocks, falls, wearand tear... Eighteen per cent of sports players aged 8 to 12 already have heel injuries. The cartilage of a footballer's ankle does not respond well to shocks, and 25% of professionals have discovered for themselves that it is an especially weak point. The cartilage of the delicate knee joint can also be irreparably damaged and if care is not taken right from childhood (10-12 years of age), this can cause premature osteoarthritis. The hip does not escape damage either and, particularly when tired, players run the risk of fractures as a result of falls or collisions. According to the study, football- ers who have been playing for more than ten years have bonyoutgrowths either on the tibia or on the heel. This is what is known as \"footballer's foot\", a deformity caused by shoes with soles and ankle parts that are too flexible. Protect, support, stabilise, absorb If a shoe is too rigid, it restricts movement. If it is too flexible, it increases the risk of injuries and sprains. A good sports shoe should meet four criteria: Firstly, it must provide exterior protection: resisting knocks from the ball or another player, coping with unevenness in the ground, and keeping the foot warm and dry even when it is freezing cold and raining. It must support the foot, and in particular the ankle joint, to avoid sprains, swelling and otherproblems, which may even affect the knee. It must also provide players with good stability so that they do not slip on a wet ground or skid on a surface that is too dry. Finally, it must absorb shocks, especially those suffered by volleyball and basketball players who are constantly jumping. Dry feetTo avoid minor but painful conditions such as blisters or even splits or athlete's foot (fungal infections), the shoe must allow evaporation of perspiration and must prevent outside dampness from getting in. The ideal material for this is leather, which can be water-proofed to prevent the shoe from getting soaked the first time it rains. Source: Revue ID (16) 1-15 June 1997.

She could just faintly remember the beginning of the rain,driving in across the swamp from the south and beating against the shell of her house.Then the river itself started rising, slowly at first until at last it paused to turn back. Fromhour to hour it slithered up creeks and ditches and poured over low places. In the night,while she slept, it claimed the road and surrounded her so that she sat alone, her boatgone, the house like a piece of drift lodged on its bluff. Now even against the tarredplanks of the supports the waters touched. And still they rose. As far as she could see, to the treetops where the opposite banks had been, the swamp was an empty sea, awash with sheets of rain, the river lost somewhere in its vastness.Her house with its boat bottom had been built to ride just such a flood, if one evercame, but now it was old. Maybe the boards underneath were partly rotted away.Maybe the cable mooring the house to the great live oak would snap loose and let hergo turning downstream, the way her boat had gone. No one could come now. She could cry out but it would be no use, no one would hear. Down the length and breadth of the swamp others were fighting to save whatlittle they could, maybe even their lives. She had seen a whole house go floating by,so quiet she was reminded of sitting at a funeral. She thought when she saw it sheknew whose house it was. It had been bad seeing it drift by, but the owners musthave escaped to higher ground. Later, with the rain and darkness pressing in, she hadheard a panther scream upriver. Now the house seemed to shudder around her like something alive. She reached out to catch a lamp as it tilted off the table by her bed and put it between her feet tohold it steady. Then creaking and groaning with effort the house struggled up from theclay, floated free, bobbing like a cork and swung out slowly with the pull of the river.She gripped the edge of the bed. Swaying from side to side, the house moved to thelength of its mooring. There was a jolt and a complaining of old timbers and then apause. Slowly the current released it and let it swing back, rasping across its restingplace. She caught her breath and sat for a long time feeling the slow penduloussweeps. The dark sifted down through the incessant rain, and, head on arm, she sleptholding on to the bed. Sometime in the night the cry awoke her, a sound so anguished she was on her feet before she was awake. In the dark she stumbled against the bed. It came from outthere, from the river. She could hear something moving, something large that madea dredging, sweeping sound. It could be another house. Then it hit, not head on butglancing and sliding down the length of her house. It was a tree. She listened as thebranches and leaves cleared themselves and went on downstream, leaving only therain and the lappings of the flood, sounds so constant now that they seemed a part5 10 15 20 25 30 35READING SAMPLE TASKS 332 TAKE THE TEST: SAMPLE QUESTIONS PISA ASSESSMENTS - ISBN 978-92-64-05080-8 - \u00a9OECD 200940of the silence. Huddled on the bed, she was almost asleep again when another cry sounded, this time so close it could have been in the room. Staring into the dark,she eased back on the bed until her hand caught the cold shape of the rifle. Thencrouched on the pillow, she cradled the gun across her knees. \"Who's there?\" shecalled. The answer was a repeated cry, but less shrill, tired sounding, then the empty silence closing in. She drew back against the bed. Whatever was there she could hear itmoving about on the porch. Planks creaked and she could distinguish the sounds ofobjects being knocked over. There was a scratching on the wall as if it would tear itsway in. She knew now what it was, a big cat, deposited by the uprooted tree that hadpassed her. It had come with the flood, a gift. Unconsciously she pressed her hand against her face and along her tightened throat. The rifle rocked across her knees. She had never seen a panther in her life. She hadheard about them from others and heard their cries, like suffering, in the distance.The cat was scratching on the wall again, rattling the window by the door. As long asshe guarded the window and kept the cat hemmed in by the wall and water, caged,she would be all right. Outside, the animal paused to rake his claws across the rustedouter screen. Now and then, it whined and growled. When the light filtered down through the rain at last, coming like another kind of dark, she was still sitting on the bed, stiff and cold. Her arms, used to rowing on theriver, ached from the stillness of holding the rifle. She had hardly allowed herself tomove for fear any sound might give strength to the cat. Rigid, she swayed with themovement of the house. The rain still fell as if it would never stop. Through the greylight, finally, she could see the rain-pitted flood and far away the cloudy shape ofdrowned treetops. The cat was not moving now. Maybe he had gone away. Laying thegun aside she slipped off the bed and moved without a sound to the window. It wasstill there, crouched at the edge of the porch, staring up at the live oak, the mooringof her house, as if gauging its chances of leaping to an overhanging branch. It didnot seem so frightening now that she could see it, its coarse fur napped into twigs,its sides pinched and ribs showing. It would be easy to shoot it where it sat, its longtail whipping back and forth. She was moving back to get the gun when it turnedaround. With no warning, no crouch or tensing of muscles, it sprang at the window,shattering a pane of glass. She fell back, stifling a scream, and taking up the rifle, shefired through the window. She could not see the panther now, but she had missed. Itbegan to pace again. She could glimpse its head and the arch of its back as it passedthe window. Shivering, she pulled back on the bed and lay down. The lulling constant sound of the river and the rain, the penetrating chill, drained away her purpose. She watched thewindow and kept the gun ready. After waiting a long while she moved again to look.The panther had fallen asleep, its head on its paws, like a housecat. For the first timesince the rains began she wanted to cry, for herself, for all the people, for everything45 50 55 60 65 70 75READING SAMPLE TASKS 342 TAKE THE TEST: SAMPLE QUESTIONS FROM OECD'S PISA ASSESSMENTS - ISBN 978-92-64-05080-8 - \u00a9OECD 2009in the flood. Sliding down on the bed, she pulled the quilt around her shoulders. She should have got out when she could, while the roads were still open or before herboat was washed away. As she rocked back and forth with the sway of the house adeep ache in her stomach reminded her she hadn't eaten. She couldn't remember forhow long. Like the cat, she was starving. Easing into the kitchen, she made a fire withthe few remaining sticks of wood. If the flood lasted she would have to burn the chair,maybe even the table itself. Taking down the remains of a smoked ham from theceiling, she cut thick slices of the brownish red meat and placed them in a skillet. Thesmell of the frying meat made her dizzy. There were stale biscuits from the last timeshe had cooked and she could make some coffee. There was plenty of water. While she was cooking her food, she almost forgot about the cat until it whined. It was hungry too. \"Let me eat,\" she called to it, \"and then I'll see to you.\" And she laughed under her breath. As she hung the rest of the ham back on its nail the catgrowled a deep throaty rumble that made her hand shake. After she had eaten, she went to the bed again and took up the rifle. The house had risen so high now it no longer scraped across the bluff when it swung back from theriver. The food had warmed her. She could get rid of the cat while light still hung inthe rain. She crept slowly to the window. It was still there, mewling, beginning tomove about the porch. She stared at it a long time, unafraid. Then without thinkingwhat she was doing, she laid the gun aside and started around the edge of the bedto the kitchen. Behind her the cat was moving, fretting. She took down what wasleft of the ham and making her way back across the swaying floor to the windowshe shoved it through the broken pane. On the other side there was a hungry snarland something like a shock passed from the animal to her. Stunned by what she haddone, she drew back to the bed. She could hear the sounds of the panther tearing atthe meat. The house rocked around her. The next time she awoke she knew at once that everything had changed. The rain had stopped. She felt for the movement of the house but it no longer swayed on the flood.Drawing her door open, she saw through the torn screen a different world. The housewas resting on the bluff where it always had. A few feet down, the river still raced onin a torrent, but it no longer covered the few feet between the house and the live oak.And the cat was gone. Leading from the porch to the live oak and doubtless on intothe swamp were tracks, indistinct and already disappearing into the soft mud. Andthere on the porch, gnawed to whiteness, was what was left of the ham.85 90 95 100 105 11080 Use the story \"The Gift\" on the previous three pages to answer the questions which follow.

It is about two such frozen embryos in Australia that a storm of legal and ethical questions hasarisen. The embryos were destined to be implantedin Elsa Rios, wife of Mario Rios. A previousembryo implant had been unsuccessful, and theRioses wanted to have another chance at becomingparents. But before they had a second chance totry, the Rioses perished in an airplane crash. What was the Australian hospital to do with the frozen embryos? Could they be implanted insomeone else? There were numerous volunteers.Were the embryos somehow entitled to the Rioses'substantial estate? Or should the embryos bedestroyed? The Rioses, understandably, had madeno provision for the embryos' future. The Australians set up a commission to study the matter. Last week, the commission made itsreport. The embryos should be thawed, the panelsaid, because donation of embryos to someone elsewould require the consent of the \"producers,\" andno such consent had been given. The panel alsoheld that the embryos in their present state had nolife or rights and thus could be destroyed. The commission members were conscious of treading on slippery legal and ethical grounds.Therefore, they urged that three months beallowed for public opinion to respond to thecommission recommendation. Should there bean overwhelming outcry against destroying theembryos, the commission would reconsider. Couples now enrolling in Sydney's Queen Victoria hospital for in vitro fertilization programsmust specify what should be done with the embryosif something happens to them.This assures that a situation similar to the Rioses won't recur.

Bauakas exchanged clothes with a merchant and went on horseback to the city where the judge lived. At the entrance to the city a cripple approached the king and begged alms of him. Bauakas gave him money and was about to continue on his way, but the cripple clung to his clothing. \"What do you wish?\" asked the king. \"Haven't I given you money?\"\"You gave me alms,\" said the cripple, \"now grant me one favour. Let me ride with you as far as the city square, otherwise the horses and camels may trample me.\" Bauakas sat the cripple behind him on the horse and took him as far as the city square. There he halted his horse, but the cripple refused to dismount. \"We have arrived at the square, why don't you get off?\" asked Bauakas.\"Why should I?\" the beggar replied. \"This horse belongs to me. If you are unwilling to return it, we shall have to go to court.\" Hearing their quarrel, people gathered around them shouting:\"Go to the judge! He will decide between you!\"Bauakas and the cripple went to the judge. There were others in court, and the judge called upon each one in turn. Before he came to Bauakas and the cripple he heard a scholar and a peasant. They had come to court over a woman: the peasant said she was his wife, and the scholar said she was his. The judge heard them both, remained silent for a moment, and then said: \"Leave the woman here with me, and come back tomorrow.\"When they had gone, a butcher and an oil merchant came before the judge. The butcher was covered with blood, and the oil merchant with oil. In his hand the butcher held some money, and the oil merchant held onto the butcher's hand. \"I was buying oil from this man,\" the butcher said, \"and when I took out my purse to pay him, he seized me by the hand and tried to take all my money away from me. That is why we have come to you\u2014I holding onto my purse, and he holding onto my hand.

Bauakas instantly pointed out his horse among the twenty others. Then the judge called the cripple to the stable and told him to point out the horse. The cripple recognised the horse and pointed to it. The judge then returned to his seat. \"Take the horse, it is yours,\" he said to Bauakas. \"Give the beggar fifty strokes of the lash.\"When the judge left the court and went home, Bauakas followed him.\"What do you want?\" asked the judge. \"Are you not satisfied with my decision?\"\"I am satisfied,\" said Bauakas. \"But I should like to learn how you knew that the woman was the wife of the scholar, that the money belonged to the butcher, and that the horse was mine and not the beggar's.\" \"This is how I knew about the woman: in the morning I sent for her and said: 'Please fill my inkwell.' She took the inkwell, washed it quickly and deftly, and filled it with ink; therefore it was work she was accustomed to. If she had been the wife of the peasant she would not have known how to do it. This showed me that the scholar was telling the truth. \"And this is how I knew about the money: I put it into a cup full of water, and in the morning I looked to see if any oil had risen to the surface. If the money had belonged to the oil merchant it would have been soiled by his oily hands. There was no oil on the water; therefore, the butcher was telling the truth. \"It was more difficult to find out about the horse. The cripple recognised it among twenty others, even as you did. However, I did not take you both to the stable to see which of you knew the horse, but to see which of you the horse knew. When you approached it, it turned its head and stretched its neck toward you; but when the cripple touched it, it laid back its ears and lifted one hoof. Therefore I knew that you were the horse's real master.\" Then Bauakas said to the judge: \"I am not a merchant, but King Bauakas, I came here in order to see if what is said of you is true. I see now that you are a wise judge. Ask whatever you wish of me, and you shall have it as reward.\" \"I need no reward,\" replied the judge. \"I am content that my king has praised me.\" Source: Leo Tolstoy, \"A Just Judge\" in Fable and Fairytales, translated by Ann Dunningham.READING SAMPLE TASKS 512 TAKE THE TEST: SAMPLE QUESTIONS FROM OECD'S PISA ASSESSMENTS - ISBN 978-92-64-05080-8 - \u00a9OECD 2009QUESTION 14.1 Near the beginning of the story we are told that Bauakas exchanged clothes with a merchant.

Only one in three parents polled is aware of bullying involving their children, according to an Education Ministry survey released on Wednesday. The survey, conducted between December 1994 and January 1995, involved some 19,000 parents, teachers and children at primary, junior and senior high schools where bullying has occurred. The survey, the first of its kind conducted by the Ministry, covered students from the fourth grade up. According to the survey, 22 per cent of the primary school children polled said they face bullying, compared with 13 per cent of junior high school children and 4 per cent of senior high school students. On the other hand, some 26 per cent of the primary school children said they have bullied, with the percentage decreasing to 20 per cent for junior high school children and 6 per cent for senior high school students. Of those who replied that they have been bullies, between 39 and 65 per cent said they also have been bullied. The survey indicated that 37 per cent of the parents of bullied primary school children were aware of bullying targeted at their children. The figure was 34 per cent for the parents of junior high school children and 18 per cent for those of the senior high school students.Of the parents aware of the bullying, 14 per cent to 18 per cent said they had been told of bullying by teachers. Only 3 per cent to 4 per cent of the parents learned of the bullying from their children, according to the survey. The survey also found that 42 per cent of primary school teachers are not aware of bullying aimed at their students. The portion of such teachers was 29 per cent at junior high schools and 69 per cent at senior high schools. Asked for the reason behind bullying, about 85 per cent of the teachers cited a lack of education at home. Many parents singled out a lack of a sense of justice and compassion among children as the main reason. An Education Ministry official said the findings suggest that parents and teachers should have closer contact with children to prevent bullying. School bullying became a major issue in Japan after 13-year-old Kiyoteru Okouchi hanged himself in Nishio, Aichi Prefecture, in the fall of 1994, leaving a note saying that classmates had repeatedly dunked him in a nearby river and extorted money from him. The bullying-suicide prompted the Education Ministry to issue a report on bullying in March 1995 urging teachers to order bullies not to come to school. The article above appeared in a Japanese newspaper in 1996. Refer to it to answer the questions below.

Refer to the information to answer the questions which follow it. Collecting Nectar Bees make honey to survive. It is their only essential food. If there are 60,000 bees in a hive about one third of them will be involved in gathering nectar which is then made into honey by the house bees. A small number of bees work as foragers or searchers. They find a source of nectar, then return to the hive to tell the other bees where it is. Foragers let the other bees know where the source of the nectar is by performing a dance which gives information about the direction and the distance the bees will need to fly. During this dance the bee shakes her abdomen from side to side while running in circles in the shape of a figure 8. The dance follows the pattern shown on the following diagram. The diagram shows a bee dancing inside the hive on the vertical face of the honeycomb. If the middle part of the figure 8 points straight up it means that bees can find the food if they fly straight towards the sun. If the middle part of the figure 8 points to the right, the food is to the right of the sun. The distance of the food from the hive is indicated by the length of time that the bee shakes her abdomen. If the food is quite near the bee shakes her abdomen for a short time. If it is a long way away she shakes her abdomen for a long time.READING SAMPLE TASKS 572 TAKE THE TEST: SAMPLE QUESTIONS FROM OECD'S PISA ASSESSMENTS - ISBN 978-92-64-05080-8 - \u00a9OECD 2009MAKING HONEY When the bees arrive at the hive carrying nectar they give this to the house bees. The house bees move the nectar around with their mandibles, exposing it to the warm dry air of the hive. When it is first gathered the nectar contains sugar and minerals mixed with about 80% water. After ten to twenty minutes, when much of the excess water has evaporated, the house bees put the nectar in a cell in the honeycomb where evaporation continues. After three days, the honey in the cells contains about 20% water. At this stage, the bees cover the cells with lids which they make out of beeswax. At any one time the bees in a hive usually gather nectar from the same type of blossom and from the same area. Some of the main sources of nectar are fruit trees, clover and flowering trees.

Citizens have to use mathematicsin many daily situations, such as when consulting media presenting information on a wide range of subjectsin the form of tables, charts and graphs, when reading timetables, when carrying out money transactionsand when determining the best buy at the market. To capture this broad conception, PISA uses a concept ofmathematical literacy that is concerned with the capacity of students to analyse, reason and communicateeffectively as they pose, solve and interpret mathematical problems in a variety of situations includingquantitative, spacial, probabilistic or other mathematical concepts. Mathematics was the focus of the PISA 2003 survey, meaning that more time was dedicated to mathematics testing which allowed a more detailed analysis of the results. The 2006 mathematics results are comparedto the 2003 benchmarks, as will be the case for results from future surveys. In 2000 and 2006, mathematicswas also assessed, but less comprehensively than in 2003. Key assessment characteristics were establishedfor the 2000 survey and underwent minor modifications for the following surveys. Mathematics is defined in relation to three dimensions: the content, the mathematical processes and the situations. The first dimension, the content of mathematics, is defined primarily in terms of \"overarching ideas\" and only secondarily in relation to curricular strands. Strands such as numbers, algebra and geometry are commonly used in curricula. The overarching ideas used in PISA reflect the orientation towards real-life situations. For the first survey in 2000 two overarching ideas were assessed: change and growth and space and shape. These two were selected to allow a wide range of curriculum strands to be represented,without giving undue weight to number skills. In the assessments in 2003 and 2006 four overarching ideaswere assessed: quantity, space and shape, change and relationships and uncertainty. This is in line with the contemporary view of mathematics as the science of patterns in a general sense. The PISA overarchingideas reflect this: patterns in space and shape , patterns in change and relationships , patterns in quantity form central and essential concepts for any description of mathematics, and they form the heart of anycurriculum, at any level. But to be literate in mathematics means more. Dealing with uncertainty from amathematical and scientific perspective is essential. For this reason, elements of probability theory andstatistics give rise to the fourth overarching idea: uncertainty. The second dimension is the process of mathematics as defined by general mathematical competencies. Questions are organised into three \"competency clusters\" (reproduction, connections and reflection)defining the type of thinking skill needed. The first cluster - reproduction - consists of simple computations or definitions of the type most familiar in conventional mathematics assessments. The second requiresconnections to be made to solve relatively straightforward problems. The third competency cluster -reflection - consists of mathematical thinking, generalisation and insight, and requires students to engagein analysis, to identify the mathematical elements in a situation and to pose their own problems. In general,these processes are in ascending order of difficulty, but it does not follow that one must be mastered in orderto progress to the other: it is possible for example to engage in mathematical thinking without being good atcomputations. These competencies are applied as part of the fundamental process of mathematisation thatstudents use to solve real-life problems. Mathematisation can be broken up into five steps:MATHEMATICS SAMPLE TASKS 993 TAKE THE TEST: SAMPLE QUESTIONS FROM OECD'S PISA ASSESSMENTS - ISBN \u00a9OECD 2009Starting with a problem in reality.s\u0000 Organising it according to mathematical concepts and identifying the relevant mathematics.s\u0000 Gradually trimming away the reality to transform the real-world problem into a mathematicals\u0000 problem that faithfully represents the situation. Solving the mathematical problem.s\u0000 Making sense of the mathematical solution in terms of the real situation.s\u0000 The third dimension is the situation in which mathematics is used. PISA identifies four situations: personal, educational or occupational, public (related to the local community or society) and scientific. Each question used in a PISA survey falls into one category of each of the three dimensions. Question 10.1 from the unitCarpenter, for example, is part of the connections competency cluster, using content of the overarching ideaquantity and set in an occupational situation. As the last two categorisations are generally fairly obvious,they will not be explicitly mentioned for the questions presented here. To report the results of PISA 2000 a single mathematics scale was used. The average score on this scale is 500 with two-thirds of students scoring between 400 and 600. In 2003, when mathematics was themajor domain, separate scales for each of the four content areas were created in addition to the overallmathematics scale. As in 2000, the average on each scale is 500 with two-thirds of students scoring between400 and 600. In the 2006 survey, a single mathematics scale was used to gauge performance. The resultsare compared to the benchmark of 500 score points established by PISA 2003. More information on PISAproficiency scales can be found in Annex A. It is the policy of PISA that students should be allowed to use calculators and other tools as they are normally used in school. However, the test questions are chosen so that the use of calculators is not likelyto enhance a student's performance in the assessment. This chapter presents 50 units. The first 26 unitswere used in the PISA surveys. Units 27 to 50 were used in developing and testing out the surveys. While itwas decided not to include these units in the PISA surveys, they are nevertheless illustrative of the kinds ofquestions asked in PISA. The questions presented in this chapter are all publicly released PISA mathematicsquestions. Following the section with questions, answers for all questions are given. For units 1 to 26, acomment box includes score points, the percentage of students who answered correctly across OECDcountries and the question category. For country results, refer to Annex B. For units 27 to 50, a commentbox lists the question category. Because these units were not used in the final PISA surveys the informationregarding score points and percentage of students who answered correctly is not known or it not sufficientlyreliable to be presented here.MATHEMATICS SAMPLE TASKS 1003 TAKE THE TEST: SAMPLE QUESTIONS PISA ASSESSMENTS - ISBN 978-92-64-05080-8 - \u00a9OECD 2009MATHEMATICS UNIT 1: FARMS Here you see a photograph of a farmhouse with a roof in the shape of a pyramid.

For example: Apple trees = n X n and conifer trees = 8 X n both formulas have a factor n, buts\u0000 apple trees have another n which will get larger where the factor 8 stays the same. The number of apple trees increases more quickly. The number of apple trees increases faster because that number is being squareds\u0000 instead of multiplied by 8.Number of apple trees is quadratic.

This allows PISA to include scientific knowledge relevant tothe science curricula of participating countries without being constrained by the common denominator ofnational curricula. To capture this idea, PISA uses the concept of scientific literacy. In 2000 and 2003, scientific literacy was defined as: the capacity to use scientific knowledge, to identify questions and to draw evidence-based conclusionsin order to understand and help make decisions about the natural world and the changes made toit through human activity. To assess the students in science, three interconnected dimensions were distinguished: scientific concepts, scientific processes and scientific situations. Scientific concepts are drawn from physics, chemistry and biology. More specifically, PISA used themes such as \"forces and movement\" or \"the earth and its place in the universe\". The selection of topics is basedon their relevance to everyday situations, their enduring relevance as well as the possibility to combinethe topic with scientific processes (so for example more than just recalling a name or a definition). Theknowledge thus refers to the scientific concepts which students need to grasp. Students and people in general need to use and apply their scientific knowledge and understanding via scientific processes. In PISA the focus lies on processes which citizens will need, such as: distinguishing between questions which science can and cannot answer, deciding when scientific evidence is and is notvalid and weighing evidence for and against a particular course of action that affects life at the personal, socialor global level. In PISA 2000, a distinction was made between the following five scientific processes: Recognising scientifically investigable questions.1. Identifying evidence needed in a scientific investigation.2. Drawing or evaluating conclusions.3. Communicating valid conclusions.4. Demonstrating understanding of scientific concepts.5. In PISA 2003, three processes were distinguished: Describing, explaining and predicting scientific phenomena.1. Understanding scientific investigation.2. Interpreting scientific evidence and conclusions.3. The third of the three interrelated dimensions are scientific situations (sometimes referred to as areas of applications or as contexts). The situation can be science in life and health, science in earth and theenvironment or science in technology. In PISA 2006, science was assessed more comprehensively. As a result, some changes were made to the assessment. A major difference between the definition of scientific literacy used in PISA 2000 and 2003 andthe PISA 2006 definition is the distinction between knowledge of science and knowledge about science in the 2006 assessment.

The first three bear some resemblance to the earlier dimensions, but have been altered in fundamental ways. The attitudinal aspect is new. Knowledge is subdivided into knowledge of science and knowledge about science. Knowledge of science includes four sub-categories (physical systems; living systems; earth and space systems; technology systems) and knowledge about science encompasses two sub-categories (scientific enquiry and scientificexplanations). The three competencies which are assessed are: Identifying scientific issues.1. Explaining phenomena scientifically.2. Using scientific evidence.3. Thecontext can be personal, social or global, as well as - in some cases - historical. Each question used in a PISA survey falls into one category of each of the three aspects. For example, Question 10.1 from the unit Acid Rain (used in the PISA 2006 survey) is classified into the competency explaining phenomenascientifically, into the knowledge of science sub-category living systems and into a global context. As thelast two categorisations are generally fairly obvious, they will not be explicitly mentioned for the questionspresented here. The fourth dimension is student attitudes. These questions are different from the rest, because they have no right or wrong answer. They relate to the same scientific issue as the other questions in that unit, but they ask about students' attitudes towards that issue. The attitude dimension is divided into the following foursub-categories: a) interest in science, b) support for scientific enquiry, c) self-belief as science learners andd) responsibility towards resources and environments. To report the results of PISA 2000 and PISA 2003, a single science scale was used. The average score on this scale is 500 with two-thirds of students scoring between 400 and 600. In 2006, when science was assessedmore comprehensively, separate scales for each of the competencies and knowledge domains were createdin addition to an overall science scale. Like the science scales in PISA 2000 and 2003, each of these scaleshas a mean score of 500 points with two-thirds of students scoring between 400 and 600.

Next week I will take up a position as \"Herr Doktor\" at the First Ward of the maternity clinic of the Vienna General Hospital. I was frightened when I heard about the percentage of patients who die in this clinic. This month not less than 36 of the 208 mothers died there, all from puerperal fever. Giving birth to a child is as Semmelweis, were completely in the dark about the cause of puerperal fever. Semmelweis' diary again: 'December 1846. Why do so many women die from this fever after giving birth without any problems? For centuries science has told us that it is an invisible epidemic that kills mothers. Causes may be changes in the air or some extraterrestrial influence or a movement of the earth itself, an earthquake.' Nowadays not many people would consider extraterrestrial influence or an earthquake as possible causes of fever. We now know it has to do with hygienic conditions. But in the time Semmelweis lived, many people, even scientists, did! However, Semmelweis knew that it was unlikely that fever could be caused by extraterrestrial influence or an earthquake. He pointed at the data he collected (see diagram) and used this to try to persuade his colleagues. QUESTION 1.1 Suppose you were Semmelweis. Give a reason (based on the data Semmelweis collected) why puerperal fever is unlikely to be caused by earthquakes.

The body of a deceased person was cut open to find a cause of death. Semmelweis recorded that the students working on the First ward usually took part in dissections on women who died the previous day, before they examined women who had just given birth. They did not pay much attention to cleaning themselves after the dissections. Some were even proud of the fact that you could tell by their smell that they had been working in the mortuary, as this showed how industrious they were! One of Semmelweis' friends died after having cut himself during such a dissection. Dissection of his body showed he had the same symptoms as mothers who died from puerperal fever. This gave Semmelweis a new idea. QUESTION 1.2 Semmelweis' new idea had to do with the high percentage of women dying in the maternity wards and the students' behaviour. What was this idea? Having students clean themselves after dissections should lead to a decrease of puerperal fever.A. Students should not take part in dissections because they may cut themselves.B. Students smell because they do not clean themselves after a dissection.C. Students want to show that they are industrious, which makes them careless when they examine the D. women. QUESTION 1.3 Semmelweis succeeded in his attempts to reduce the number of deaths due to puerperal fever. But puerperal fever even today remains a disease that is difficult to eliminate. Fevers that are difficult to cure are still a problem in hospitals. Many routine measures serve to control this problem. Among those measures are washing sheets at high temperatures. Explain why high temperature (while washing sheets) helps to reduce the risk that patients will contract a fever. QUESTION 1.4 Many diseases may be cured by using antibiotics. However, the success of some antibiotics against puerperal fever has diminished in recent years. What is the reason for this? Once produced, antibiotics gradually lose their activity. A. Bacteria become resistant to antibiotics. B. These antibiotics only help against puerperal fever, but not against other diseases. C. The need for these antibiotics has been reduced because public health conditions have improved D. considerably in recent years.

The atmosphere is an ocean of air and a precious natural resource for sustaining life on the Earth. Unfortunately, human activities based on national/personal interests are causing harm to this common resource, notably by depleting the fragile ozone layer, which acts as a protective shield for life on the Earth. Ozone molecules consist of three oxygen atoms, as opposed to oxygen molecules which consist of two oxygen atoms. Ozone molecules are exceedingly rare: fewer than ten in every million molecules of air. However, for nearly a billion years, their presence in the atmosphere has played a vital role in safeguarding life on Earth. Depending on where it is located, ozone can either protect or harm life on Earth. The ozone in the troposphere (up to 10 kilometres above the Earth's surface) is \"bad\" ozone which can damage lung tissues and plants. But about 90 percent of ozone found in the stratosphere (between 10 and 40 kilometres above the Earth's surface) is \"good\" ozone which plays a beneficial role by absorbing dangerous ultraviolet (UV-B) radiation from the Sun. Without this beneficial ozone layer, humans would be more susceptible to certain diseases due to the increased incidence of ultra-violet rays from the Sun. In the last decades the amount of ozone has decreased. In 1974 it was hypothesised that chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) could be a cause for this. Until 1987, scientific assessment of the cause-effect relationship was not convincing enough to implicate CFCs. However, in September 1987, diplomats from around the world met in Montreal (Canada) and agreed to set sharp limits to the use of CFCs. Source: Connect, UNESCO International Science, Technology & Environmental Education Newsletter, Section from an article entitled 'The Chemistry of Atmospheric policy', Vol. XXII, No. 2, 1997 (spelling adapted) QUESTION 2.1 In the text above nothing is mentioned about the way ozone is formed in the atmosphere. In fact each day some ozone is formed and some other ozone disappears. The way ozone is formed is illustrated in the following comic strip. Suppose you have an uncle who tries to understand the meaning of this strip. However, he did not get any science education at school and he doesn't understand what the author of the strip is explaining. He knows that there are no little fellows in the atmosphere but he wonders what those little fellows in the strip stand for, what those strange notations O, O 2 and O3 mean and which processes the strip represents. He asks you to explain the strip. Assume that your uncle knows: that O is the symbol for oxygen;what atoms and molecules are.Write an explanation of the comic strip for your uncle.In your explanation, use the words atoms and molecules in the way they are used in lines 5 and 6.SCIENCE SAMPLE TASKS 1944 TAKE THE TEST: SAMPLE QUESTIONS FROM OECD'S PISA ASSESSMENTS - ISBN 978-92-64-05080-8 - \u00a9OECD 2009QUESTION 2.2 Ozone is also formed during thunderstorms. It causes the typical smell after such a storm. In lines 9-13 the author of the text distinguishes between \"bad ozone\" and \"good ozone\". In terms of the article, is the ozone that is formed during thunderstorms \"bad ozone\" or \"good ozone\"?

He took a very small piece fromthe udder of an adult sheep (sheep 1).From that small piece he removed thenucleus, then he transferred the nucleusinto the egg-cell of another (female)sheep (sheep 2). But first he removedfrom that egg-cell all the materialthat would have determined sheep 2characteristics in a lamb produced fromthat egg-cell. Ian Wilmut implanted themanipulated egg-cell of sheep 2 into yetanother (female) sheep (sheep 3). Sheep 3became pregnant and had a lamb: Dolly.

The greenhouse effect: fact or fiction? Living things need energy to survive. The energy that sustains life on the Earth comes from the Sun, which radiates energy into space because it is so hot. A tiny proportion of this energy reaches the Earth. The Earth's atmosphere acts like a protective blanket over the surface of our planet, preventing the variations in temperature that would exist in an airless world. Most of the radiated energy coming from the Sun passes through the Earth's atmosphere. The Earth absorbs some of this energy, and some is reflected back from the Earth's surface. Part of this reflected energy is absorbed by the atmosphere. As a result of this the average temperature above the Earth's surface is higher than it would be if there were no atmosphere. The Earth's atmosphere has the same effect as a greenhouse, hence the term greenhouse effect. The greenhouse effect is said to have become more pronounced during the twentieth century. It is a fact that the average temperature of the Earth's atmosphere has increased. In newspapers and periodicals the increased carbon dioxide emission is often stated as the main source of the temperature rise in the twentieth century. A student named Andr\u00e9 becomes interested in the possible relationship between the average temperature of the Earth's atmosphere and the carbon dioxide emission on the Earth. In a library he comes across the following two graphs. years yearsCarbon dioxide emission(thousand millions 1860 1870 1880 1890 1900 1910 199015.4 15.0atmosphere (\u00b0C)of the Earth'sAverage temperature 14.6 Andr\u00e9 concludes from these two graphs that it is certain that the increase in the average temperature of the Earth's atmosphere is due to the increase in the carbon dioxide emission.Source: CSTI Environmental Information Paper 1, 1992.SCIENCE SAMPLE TASKS 2004 TAKE THE TEST: SAMPLE QUESTIONS FROM OECD'S PISA ASSESSMENTS - ISBN 978-92-64-05080-8 - \u00a9OECD 2009QUESTION 5.1 What is it about the graphs that supports Andr\u00e9's conclusion?

CLOTHES TEXT A team of British scientists is developing \"intelligent\" clothes that will give disabled children the power of \"speech\". Children wearing waistcoats made of a unique electrotextile, linked to a speech synthesiser, will be able to make themselves understood simply by tapping on the touch-sensitive material. The material is made up of normal cloth and an ingenious mesh of carbon-impregnated fibres that can conduct electricity. When pressure is applied to the fabric, the pattern of signals that passes through the conducting fibres is altered and a computer chip can work out where the cloth has been touched. It then can trigger whatever electronic device is attached to it, which could be no bigger than two boxes of matches. \"The smart bit is in how we weave the fabric and how we send signals through it - and we can weave it into existing fabric designs so you cannot see it's in there,\" says one of the scientists.

Sunscreen products have a Sun Protection Factor (SPF) that shows how well each product absorbs the ultraviolet radiation component of sunlight. A high SPF sunscreen protects skin for longer than a low SPF sunscreen. Mimi thought of a way to compare some different sunscreen products. She and Dean collected the following: s two sheets of clear plastic that do not absorb sunlight; s one sheet of light-sensitive paper; s mineral oil (M) and a cream containing zinc oxide (ZnO); and s four different sunscreens that they called S1, S2, S3, and S4. Mimi and Dean included mineral oil because it lets most of the sunlight through, and zinc oxide because it almost completely blocks sunlight. Dean placed a drop of each substance inside a circle marked on one sheet of plastic, then put the second plastic sheet over the top. He placed a large book on top of both sheets and pressed down. Mimi then put the plastic sheets on top of the sheet of light-sensitive paper. Light-sensitive paper changes from dark grey to white (or very light grey), depending on how long it is exposed to sunlight. Finally, Dean placed the sheets in a sunny place.

She survived an attack of smallpox in 1715 but she was left covered with scars.While living in Turkey in 1717, she observed a method calledinoculation that was commonly used there. This treatmentinvolved scratching a weak type of smallpox virus into theskin of healthy young people who then became sick, but inmost cases only with a mild form of the disease. Mary Montagu was so convinced of the safety of these inoculations that she allowed her son and daughter to beinoculated. In 1796, Edward Jenner used inoculations of a related disease, cowpox, to produce antibodies against smallpox. Comparedwith the inoculation of smallpox, this treatment had less sideeffects and the treated person could not infect others. Thetreatment became known as vaccination.SCIENCE SAMPLE TASKS 2084 TAKE THE TEST: SAMPLE QUESTIONS PISA ASSESSMENTS - ISBN 978-92-64-05080-8 - \u00a9OECD 2009QUESTION 9.4 (ATTITUDE) How much do you agree with the following statements?

The statues are made of a type of rock called marble. Marble is composed of calcium carbonate. In 1980, the original statues were transferred inside the museum of the Acropolis and were replaced by replicas. The original statues were being eaten away by acid rain. QUESTION 10.1 Normal rain is slightly acidic because it has absorbed some carbon dioxide from the air. Acid rain is more acidic than normal rain because it has absorbed gases like sulfur oxides and nitrogen oxides as well. Where do these sulfur oxides and nitrogen oxides in the air come from? The effect of acid rain on marble can be modelled by placing chips of marble in vinegar overnight. Vinegar and acid rain have about the same acidity level.

FOOD WEB A FOOD WEB BBIODIVERSITY IS THE KEY TO MANAGING ENVIRONMENT An ecosystem that retains a high biodiversity (that is, a wide variety of living things) is much more likely to adapt to human-caused environment change than is one that has little. Consider the two food webs shown in the diagram. The arrows point from theorganism that gets eaten to the one that eats it. These food webs are highly simplified compared with food webs in real ecosystems, but they still illustrate a key difference between more diverseand less diverse ecosystems. Food web B represents a situation with very low biodiversity, where at some levels the food path involves only a single type of organism. Food web A represents a more diverse ecosystem with,as a result, many more alternative feeding pathways. Generally, loss of biodiversity should be regarded seriously, not only because the organisms that have become extinct represent a big loss for both ethical and utilitarian (useful benefit)reasons, but also because the organisms that remain have become more vulnerable (exposed) toextinction in the future.5 10 Eucalypt Wattle Tea Tree Wattle Beetle Leaf Butcher BirdNative Cat Source: Adapted from Steve Malcolm: 'Biodiversity is the key to managing environment', The Age, 16 August 1994.SCIENCE SAMPLE TASKS 2154 TAKE THE TEST: SAMPLE QUESTIONS PISA ASSESSMENTS - ISBN 978-92-64-05080-8 - \u00a9OECD 2009QUESTION 13.1 In lines 9 and 10 it is stated that \"Food web A represents a more diverse ecosystem with, as a result, many more alternative feeding pathways.\" Look at FOOD WEB A.

FLIES A farmer was working with dairy cattle at an agricultural experiment station. The population of flies in the barn where the cattle lived was so large that the animals' health was affected. So the farmer sprayed the barn and the cattle with a solution of insecticide A. The insecticide killed nearly all the flies. Some time later, however, the number of flies was again large. The farmer again sprayed with the insecticide. The result was similar to that of the first spraying. Most, but not all, of the flies were killed. Again, within a short time the population of flies increased, and they were again sprayed with the insecticide. This sequence of events was repeated five times: then it became apparent that insecticide A was becoming less and less effective in killing the flies. The farmer noted that one large batch of the insecticide solution had been made and used in all the sprayings. Therefore he suggested the possibility that the insecticide solution decomposed with age.

Yes/No The hair of all five calves has the same colour. Yes/No In February 1993 a research team of the National Institute for Agricultural Research in Bresson-Villiers (France) succeeded in producing five clones ofcalves. The production of the clones (animals with the same genetic material,even though born to five different cows), was a complicated process. First the researchers removed about thirty egg cells from a cow (let us say the cow's name was Blanche 1). The researchers removed the nucleus from eachof the egg cells taken from Blanche 1. Then the researchers took an embryo from another cow (let us say Blanche 2). This embryo containedabout thirty cells. The researchers separated the ball of cells from Blanche 2 into individual cells. Then they removed the nucleus from each of these individual cells. Each nucleus was injectedseparately into one of the thirty cells that camefrom Blanche 1 (cells from which the nuclei hadbeen removed). Finally the thirty injected egg cells were implanted into thirty surrogate cows. Nine months later, five of the surrogate cows each gave birth to a calfclone. One of the researchers said that a large scale application of this cloning technique could be financially beneficial for cattle breeders.

DUTCHMAN USES CORN AS FUEL Auke Ferwerda's stove contains a few logs burning quietly with low flames. From a paper bag next to the stove he takes a handful of corn and puts it onto the flames. Immediately the fire flares up brightly. \"Look here,\" Ferwerda says, \"The window of the stove stays clean and transparent. Combustion is complete.\" Ferwerda talks about the fact that corn can be used as fuel as well as cattle food. As far as he is concerned, this is the future. Ferwerda points out that corn, in the form of cattle food, is in fact a type of fuel too. Cows eat corn to get energy out of it. But, Ferwerda explains, the sale of corn for fuel instead of for cattle food might be much more profitable for farmers. Ferwerda has become convinced that, in the long run, corn will be widely used as fuel. He imagines what it will be like harvesting, storing, drying and packing the grains in bags for sale. Ferwerda is currently investigating whether the whole corn plant could be used as fuel, but this research has not been completed yet. What Ferwerda also needs to consider is the amount of attention being focused on carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide is regarded as the main cause of the increase of the Greenhouse effect. The increase of the Greenhouse effect is said to be the cause of the increasing average temperature of the Earth's atmosphere. In Ferwerda's view, however, there is nothing wrong with carbon dioxide. On the contrary, he argues, plants absorb it and convert it into oxygen for human beings. However, Ferwerda's plans may clash with those of the government, which is actually trying to reduce the emission of carbon dioxide. Ferwerda says, \"There are many scientists who say that carbon dioxide is not the main cause of the Greenhouse effect.\" QUESTION 18.1 Ferwerda compares corn used as fuel to corn used as food. The first column of the table below contains a list of things that happen when corn burns. Do these things also happen when corn works as a fuel in an animal body?Circle Yes or No for each. When corn burns: Does this also happen when corn works as a fuel in an animal body? Oxygen is consumed. Yes / No Carbon dioxide is produced. Yes / No Energy is produced.

Each type of virus usually infects only one animal species. A magazine has reported that a scientist has used genetic engineering to modify the DNA of mousepox. The altered virus kills all the mice it infects. The scientist says research on modifying viruses is necessary in order to control pests that damage human food. Critics of the research say viruses could escape from laboratories and infect other animals. They are also worried that a modified pox virus for one species could infect other species, especially humans. Humans are infected with a pox virus called smallpox. Smallpox kills most people it infects. While it is thought that this disease has been eliminated from the general population, smallpox virus samples are kept in laboratories around the world.

Male Female During the breeding season the male stickleback's belly turns from silver-coloured to red. The male stickleback will attack any competing male that comes into his territory, and try to chase it away. If a silver-coloured female approaches, he will try to guide her to his nest so she will lay her eggs there.In an experiment a student wants to investigate what will make the male stickleback show aggressive behaviour. A male stickleback is alone in the student's aquarium. The student has made three wax models attached to pieces of wire. He hangs them separately in the aquarium for the same amount of time.

OZONE SCORING 2.1 Full credit: Answers which mention the following three aspects: First aspect: an oxygen molecule or some oxygen molecules (each consisting of two oxygen atoms) are split into oxygen atoms (picture 1). The splitting should be described using the correct words (see lines 5 and 6) for Os\u0000 (atom or atoms) and O2(molecule or molecules). If O and/or Os\u00002 have been described only as \"particles\" or \"small parts\" no credit should be given for this aspect. Second aspect: the splitting (of oxygen molecules) takes place under the influence ofsunlight (picture 1). The sun's influence should be related to the splitting of O s\u00002 (an oxygen molecule or oxygen molecules). If the sun's influence is related to the forming of an ozone molecule from an oxygens\u0000 atom and an oxygen molecule (pictures 2 and 3) no credit should be given for this second aspect. Note: Aspects 1 and 2 may typically be given in the one sentence. Third aspect: the oxygen atoms combine with other oxygen molecules to form ozonemolecules (pictures 2 and 3). Credit (one point) should be given for this aspect if the answer contains any s\u0000 description of an O combining with an O2. If the formation of O3 is described as the combining of (three, separate) O atoms, credit should not be given for this thirdaspect. If O s\u00003 is not described as a molecule or molecules but for example as \"a group of atoms\" this can be tolerated for the third aspect. Examples of such answers: When the sun shines on the Os\u00002 molecule the two atoms separate. The two O atoms look for other O2 molecules to join with. When the O1 and O2 join they form O3, which is ozone.SCIENCE SAMPLE TASKS 2574 TAKE THE TEST: SAMPLE QUESTIONS PISA ASSESSMENTS - ISBN 978-92-64-05080-8 - \u00a9OECD 2009The strip illustrates the formation of ozone. If an oxygen molecule is affected bys\u0000 the sun, it breaks into two separate atoms. These separate atoms, O, float around looking for a molecule to link up to; they link up to existing O2 molecules and form an O3 molecule, as three atoms are now joined together; O3 forms ozone. The little guys are O, or oxygen atoms. When two are joined they make Os\u00002 or oxygen molecules. The sun causes these to decompose into oxygen again. TheO 2 atoms then bond with O2molecules creating O3, which is ozone . [Note: this answer can be regarded as correct. There is only one slip of the pen (\"O2 atoms\" after having mentioned \"oxygen atoms\" previously).] Partial credit: - Answers which correctly mention only the first and second aspects. For example: The sun decomposes the oxygen molecules into single atoms. The atoms fuse intos\u0000 groups. The atoms form groups of 3 atoms together. - Answers which correctly mention only the first and third aspects. For example: Each of the little fellows stand for one atom of oxygen. O is one oxygen atom, Os\u00002 is an oxygen molecule and O3 is a group of atoms all joined together. The processes shown are one pair of oxygen atoms (O2) getting split and then each joining with 2 other pairs forming two groups of 3 (O3). The little fellows are oxygen atoms. Os\u00002 means one oxygen molecule (like a pair of little fellows holding hands) and O3 means three oxygen atoms. The two oxygen atoms of one pair break apart and one joins each of the other pairs and out of the three pairs, two sets of three oxygen molecules (O3) are formed. - Answers which correctly mention only the second and third aspects. For example: The oxygen is broken up by the sun's radiation. It splits in half. The two sidess\u0000 go and join other oxygen \"particles\" forming ozone. Most of the time in pure oxygen (Os\u00002) environments oxygen comes in pairs of 2 so there are 3 pairs of 2. 1 pair is getting too hot and they fly apart going into anotherpair making O 3 instead of O2.[Note: Although \"one pair is getting too hot\" is not a very good description for the sun's influence, credit should be given for the secondaspect; the third aspect can also be regarded as correct.] - Answers which correctly mention the first aspect only. For example: Oxygen molecules are breaking down. They form O atoms. And sometimes there s\u0000 are ozone molecules. The ozone layer remains the same because new moleculesare formed and others die. - Answers which correctly mention only the second aspect. For example: O represents an oxygen molecule, O s\u00002 = oxygen, O3 = ozone. Sometimes both oxygen molecules, joining each other, are separated by the sun. The single moleculesjoin another pair and form ozone (O 3).SCIENCE SAMPLE TASKS 2584 TAKE THE TEST: SAMPLE QUESTIONS PISA ASSESSMENTS - ISBN 978-92-64-05080-8 - \u00a9OECD 2009- Answers which correctly mention only the third aspect. For example: The 'O' (oxygen) molecules are forced to bond with Os\u00002 (2 x oxygen molecules) to form O3 (3 x oxygen molecules), by the heat of the sun. [Note: the underlined part of the answer shows the third aspect. No credit can be given for the second aspect, because the sun is not involved in the formation of ozone from O + O2 but only in breaking down bonds in O2.] No credit: Answers which do not correctly mention any of the three aspects. For example: The sun (ultraviolet rays) burns the ozone layer and at the same time is destroyings\u0000 it as well. Those little men are the ozone layers and they run away from the sunbecause it is so hot. [Note: no point can be awarded, not even for mentioning something about the sun's influence.] The sun is burning the ozone in the first box.

Some flies could be taken. If they would both be put in a separate box you coulds\u0000 use a new spray and an older spray and see what the results are. [Note: Although the same species is not mentioned, it is implied that the flies are the same type, and that the flies have not been previously exposed.] Make one big batch of spray. Have 2 groups of flies and spray each group every sixs\u0000 months. Spray groups one with the big batch, and group 2 a new batch each time. [Note: Although the same species is not mentioned, it is implied that the flies are thesame type, and that the flies have not been previously exposed.] Partial credit: - Responses in which two of the three variables (type of flies, age of insecticide, and exposure) are controlled, such as: Compare the results from a new batch of the insecticide with the results from thes\u0000 old batch on the flies in the barn. Try a new bottle of it, then wait till it gets a bit older and the flies come back and thens\u0000 try again. [Note: Reproduction of what the farmer experienced, controlling the age of the insecticide and type of flies (\"the flies\" is interpreted to mean the same flies).] - Responses in which one variable only of three variables (type of flies, age of insecticide, and exposure) is controlled, such as: (Chemically) analyse samples of the insecticide at regular intervals to see if its\u0000 changes over time. Take batches of the insecticide to a laboratory every few months and have itss\u0000 strength tested.Spray the flies with a new batch of insecticide, but without mentioning comparison s\u0000 with old batch.Do the same thing but buy new insecticide each time, hence proving if his theory s\u0000 is right or wrong.(Chemically) analyse samples of the insecticide but without mentioning comparison s\u0000 of analyses over time.Maybe if he sent a fresh batch of the poison to the lab with a batch of the old stuff s\u0000 and get them retested the results may prove his theory.

Explanation 1: With the repeated use of the same insecticide the flies were becoming s\u0000 immune to the formula. Explanation 2: Over time chemicals in the insecticide roseto the top of spray can leaving water diluted (ineffective) at the bottom. Explanation 1: The flies were becoming immune to the spray. Explanation 2: Heat s\u0000 may make it decompose and temperature change.Explanation 1: Maybe the flies developed a defence gene so the insecticide would s\u0000 not work.

The relative ability of students taking aparticular test can be estimated by considering the proportion of test questions they get correct. The relativedifficulty of questions in a test can be estimated by considering the proportion of test takers getting eachquestion correct. In this way, it becomes possible to estimate the position of students and of questions on acontinuum referred to as the PISA literacy scale in either reading, mathematics or science. The scales stretch from very low levels of performance through to very high levels. When thinking about what such a scale means about student proficiency, it can be observed that a student whose ability estimateplaces him/her at a certain point on the PISA scale would most likely be able to successfully complete tasksat or below that location, and increasingly more likely to complete tasks located at progressively lowerpoints on the scale, but would be less likely to be able to complete tasks above that point, and increasinglyless likely to complete tasks located at progressively higher points on the scale. Figure 1 depicts a scale,stretching from relatively low levels at the bottom of the figure, to relatively high levels towards the top. Sixquestions of varying difficulty are placed along the scale, as are three students of varying ability.

This book presents all the publicly available questions from the PISA surveys. Some of these questions were used in the PISA 2000, 2003 and 2006 surveys and others were used in developing and trying out the assessment. After a brief introduction to the PISA assessment, the book presents three chapters, including PISA questions for the reading, mathematics and science tests, respectively. Each chapter presents an overview of what exactly the questions assess. The second section of each chapter presents questions which were used in the PISA 2000, 2003 and 2006 surveys, that is, the actual PISA tests for which results were published. The third section presents questions used in trying out the assessment. Although these questions were not used in the PISA 2000, 2003 and 2006 surveys, they are nevertheless illustrative of the kind of question PISA uses. The final section shows all the answers, along with brief comments on each question.
