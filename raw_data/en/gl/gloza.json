The 14-member Team was chartered by IHS Director Dr. Charles W .Grim in 2005 and is co-chaired by Phyllis Eddy, DeputyDirector for Management Operations at Headquarters, andGayle Riddles, IHS Performance Officer. Dr. Grim is committed to making the IHS a consistently high-performing federal agency. He relies on the Team toensure that the organizational culture includes an increasedemphasis on performance management and federalaccountability in carrying out the Agency' s mission. Thesuccessful alliance of leadership commitment and the Team' svigilant monitoring of performance measurements haveresulted in successful and consistent organizationalperformance achievements. The Agency' s performance is measured in a variety of ways. The first performance measure applies to all federalagencies and was initiated by the Administration to addressgovernment-wide management/performance deficiencies.This performance measure is the President' s ManagementAgenda (PMA) and is a scorecard approach to measuring anagency' s status and progress in meeting the Administration' smanagement goals. There are five government-widemanagement initiatives to improve federal management:Strategic Management of Human Capital, CompetitiveSourcing, Improved Financial Performance, ExpandedElectronic Government, and Budget and PerformanceIntegration. The IHS is scored in all five areas. There are alsoseveral PMA program initiatives, but IHS is scored in only one:Real Property Asset Management.The PMA scores are assigned to agencies by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and by theOffice of Management and Budget (OMB) for status and forprogress quarterly and annually. A score of green means allstandards have been completed by the agency. Agenciesparticipate in developing the standards for a green score and inassessing their scores. The IHS achieved green scores forprogress for all four quarters of FY 2006 for all six assignedareas of the PMA. More information about the PMA and whatHHS is achieving as a result of fulfilling the PMAcommitments is available at http://www.hhs.gov/pma/ . Two government-wide performance measures meet federal accountability requirements and link to public laws.

In FY 2006, the IHSachieved 79 percent of its GPRA performance targets and 75%of these measures are either efficiency and/or outcomemeasures, including sentinel indicators. The GPRA wasdesigned to focus Government programs and managers onresults and accountability for those results. Important featuresof the IHS GPRA are its emphasis on the integration ofperformance data with budget data in Agency decision-makingand its incorporation throughout the Agency' s budget narrativeto clearly link the relationship between funding andperformance. The IHS continues to embrace GPRA as acornerstone of ongoing commitment to clinical qualityimprovement. More information is available athttp://www.ihs.gov/NonMedicalPrograms/PlanningEvaluation/pe-gpra.asp. More information about the Clinical ReportingSystem (CRS) is available at http://www.ihs.gov/cio/crs/. A second government-wide performance measure linked to public law meets the IHS' s reporting responsibilities for theHHS Performance Accountability Report (PAR). The PARprovides reasonable assurance that an agency upholds fiscalresponsibility and good stewardship of the people' s money.The PAR links an agency' s program performance measure to aDepartment strategic goal and reports how the Departmentinvested resources in such a way as to improve futureoutcomes. The HHS PAR reports how HHS resources wereused to improve the health of Indian people. For the 2006 PAR, the IHS reported on one program performance measure \u2014 glycemic control. In addition to theprogram performance measure, the IHS also reported threeagency highlights: 1) expanded enrollment of American Indianand Alaska Native Medicare-eligible patients in prescriptiondrug coverage to help HHS to provide greater prescription drugcoverage to all people with Medicare, 2) enhanced access tospecialist care through the IHS Telehealth program, especiallyfor Indian health facilities in remote locations, and 3) receipt ofthe Nicholas E. Davies Award of Excellence from theHealthcare Information and Management Systems Society forthe IHS' s role as a national leader in information technologyand management systems such as the Clinical ReportingSystem. The PAR serves to strengthen financial controls tocontinue to improve agency audit results. As such, the PARcontains the Agency' s audited financial statements andverification of the effectiveness of internal control overfinancial reporting. The IHS participates in PAR measurementvia the PMA Budget and Performance Integration Scorecard.The IHS' s progress ratings were green for FY 2006. In 2002, the OMB introduced the Program Assessment Rating Tool (PART) evaluations to examine the effectiveness ofFederal programs by assessing program performance andresults. The PART evaluation contains four sections: programpurpose and design, strategic planning, program management,and program results. Programs receive numerical scores foreach section with the program results section accounting for50% of the overall score. Programs also receive narrativeratings of Effective, Moderately Effective, Adequate,Ineffective, and Results Not Demonstrated. Since 2002, theOMB has reviewed six IHS programs using the PART and theyall received ratings of Adequate or higher. No IHS programhas had a rating of Ineffective or Results Not Demonstrated.The IHS Sanitation Facilities Construction Program, theResource and Patient Management System, and Health CareFacilities Construction Program were rated Effective withscores of 80%, 88% and 92%, respectively. FederallyAdministered Health Program was rated Moderately Effectivewith a score of 77%. The Urban Indian and Tribally-OperatedHealth Programs were rated Adequate with scores of 69%each. No IHS programs were scheduled for review in 2006because the OMB determined that all major programs withinthe IHS had been PARTed. The IHS continues to implementrecommendations of previous PART program evaluations. Recently, more accountability for specific agency program and management performance is being linked directly tofederal leaders and their employees through the cascading ofperformance objectives from the Department Secretary to theagency director to senior executives and to their employees.The annual cascading starts with the Director' s PerformanceContract which is agreed upon by the HHS Deputy Secretaryand the IHS Director. For the last three consecutive fiscalyears, the IHS Director agreed to meet IHS-specificmanagement and program objectives that incorporatedrequired performance measures and aligned with Departmentalstrategic goals and the HHS Secretary' s priorities. At the endof the fiscal year, the IHS performed a self-assessment reporton the organization' s progress in meeting the objectives that isreviewed by the Department. For the last two consecutiveyears, the IHS has received a rating of Exceptional for theIHS' s organizational assessment, further demonstrating howleadership support and performance management contribute tothe enhancement of Agency performance. Editor' s Note: The 2007 Department of Health and Human Services objectives may be found at http://www.hhs.gov/pma/depObj.html . A speech given on October 12, 2006 by IHS Director, Dr. Charles W . Grim to theNational Indian Health Board discusses these goals as theyapply to the Indian Health Service; it may be read by going tohttp://www.ihs.gov/PublicInfo/PublicAffairs/Director/index.asp. A copy of the 2005 - 2007 IHS Performance Plan, found athttp://www.ihs.gov/nonmedicalprograms/planningevaluation/pe%2Dgpra.asp, will be of special interest to IHS clinicians. November 2006 THE IHS PROVIDER 272The Start Up of a Pharmacy-Based Immunization Delivery Program at the Walker River Pharmacy CAPT Stewart Jorgensen, RPh, Chief, Schurz Service Unit Pharmacy Program, Schurz, Nevada There has been a great amount of interest in getting pharmacists more involved in the immunization process otherthan acting only as vaccine advocates and a center fordissemination of vaccines. In the past, retail pharmacies havehosted nurses who administered immunizations in specialty fluclinic, and these have proved to be very successful. The newertrend is to have pharmacists who have completed a formaltraining program, which leads to a certificate of competencefor pharmacist-immunizers, to administer the immunizations.I was fortunate in that I was able to attend one of these trainingprograms developed by the American Pharmacist Association(APhA) and receive such a Certificate of Achievement. The Pharmacy-Based Immunization Delivery Program consists of two parts. The first part is a self-study learningcomponent, and the second part is a live training seminar. Theself-study component consists of an approximately onehundred page booklet that covers different types of vaccines,clinical considerations, practical considerations, case studies,and a self-study test. The live training seminar goes over theself-study component and discusses all aspects ofimmunizations; it also includes hands-on injection techniquetraining. The live training concludes with a written test and anassessment of intramuscular and subcutaneous injectiontechnique. Once I had obtained the necessary immunization training, I next focused on setting up a Pharmacist-Based ImmunizationDelivery program at the Walker River Clinic Pharmacy. Isecured a policy and procedure for the Pharmacist-ManagedImmunization Delivery Program and presented it to thePharmacy and Therapeutics Committee for comments andapproval. Once the policy and procedures had been approved, the next step was to set up standing orders for immunizationprotocols with authority to initiate immunizations. We set upstanding orders for each of the pharmacists involved; theseincluded restrictions of the ages of patients who could bevaccinated, the locations of the injection site, the type ofvaccinations, and the course for treating adverse events. Wealso decided to require current basic cardiac life support(BLS), that safety needles be used for all injections (except inthe case of pre-loaded vaccines), and that using latex glovesduring injections would be strongly recommended.The next step was gathering the patient information sheets for all the vaccines that were approved in the standing ordersand preparing the screening questions for all vaccines.Arrangements were then made with the nursing staff for thepharmacist to act as a secondary immunizer for the clinic withthe nursing staff acting as the primary personnel in charge ofimmunizations. We then coordinated with the nursing staff tofollow their documentation procedures for chartingimmunizations in the patients' charts and for state monthlyusage and inventory reporting. The goal of our pharmacistimmunization delivery program is to assist, not compete with,the nursing staff in administering immunizations to patients. November 2006 THE IHS PROVIDER 273RPMS Software Training Available David White, RPMS Training Coordinator, Albuquerque, New Mexico The Indian Health Service' s Office of Information Technology (OIT) offers an integrated solution for themanagement of clinical, business practice, and administrativeinformation in health care facilities of various sizes. Thissystem is known as the Resource and Patient ManagementSystem (RPMS). Flexible hardware configurations, over 50software applications, and appropriate network componentscombine to provide a comprehensive clinical, financial, andadministrative solution. This solution is in use at most healthcare facilities within the Indian health care delivery system. Y ou may ask yourself, \"Where can I learn how to use the RPMS software applications?\" OIT offers training on a varietyof these software applications. In fact, OIT offered more than140 training classes to 2500+ RPMS users in fiscal year 2006.These classes were offered as instructor-led training events aswell as online training sessions via WebEx (please see thearticle by Ms. Powers on page 275 for a more detaileddescription of some of these courses).

OB/GYN Chief Clinical Consultant's Corner Digest Abstract of the Month CDC Advocates for Routine Voluntary Testing of HIV The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) released revised HIV testing recommendations for adults, adolescents, and pregnant women in health care settingson September 22, 2006, which marks the first time therecommendations have been revised since 2001. After athorough 2-plus year process of consultations, literaturereview, and evidence-based research, the recommendationswere further refined by a panel. The guidelines illuminate theneed for voluntary HIV screening as a routine part of medicalcare, which, in turn, should increase the percentage of thepopulation that is aware of their status and form the foundationfor an enhanced public health measure against the pandemic.Here is a list of the major changes: Routine, voluntary screening for all persons 13 to 64 years of age, regardless of risk profile; Annual repeat of screening in persons with known risk; Opt-out screening process with opportunity to ask questions and ability to decline (declination should bedocumented in health record). Include HIV consentwithin general consent for medical care. Specific andseparate HIV consent not required. Oral or writtenpretest information should be provided and the patientshould be well informed that they will be screened forHIV; \"Prevention counseling\" in health care settings is not required. Patients are still to be linked with clinicalcare and support. High risk patients advised re testingand offered or referred for prevention counseling.Note: the CDC does not support removal of prevention counseling in appropriate settings or whenit can be done. Rather, it gives the option tostreamline the process to remove barriers and includebroad screening in the general population or low riskgroups; For pregnant women, routine opt-out prenatal screening is recommended, repeat screening in thirdtrimester is recommended in certain areas of elevatedrates of HIV infection among pregnant women, andopt-out rapid testing in labor and deliveryrecommended for women with undocumented status; General screening for HIV should be considered distinct from HIV counseling and testing conductedas prevention intervention for persons at perceived orknown higher risk. There is still a need forcommunity based prevention education, but it is aseparate process. Rationale for the changes included new research that awareness of serostatus substantially reduces high-riskbehaviors, data that support screening is cost-effective, andevidence that late testing and diagnosis are common. The CDCremains committed to the process for minimizing barriers toimplementation and will work with state health departments aswell as individual agencies for successful implementation. Editorial comment: Scott Giberson, IHS HIV Principal ConsultantA Call to Action for the Indian Health System Previous recommendations and efforts have not turned the tide of transmission, nor reduced the number of new infections each year in our population. From a public health perspective,release of these guidelines truly represents a step forward inHIV/AIDS mitigation efforts. The revisions have appropriatelystimulated discussion and revealed the challenges and barriersof implementation, yet this gives us an opportunity to utilizethem as a springboard for action. In the spirit of the release andrationale, it is critical that we do not create unnecessarybarriers to screening within our system. There may be concerns surrounding specific recommendations such as \"general consent\" or the \"guidelinessurrounding prevention counseling,\" as well as the potential forstigma and discrimination, and conflicting state healthregulations. Given these revisions, there have been concernsraised surrounding the removal of specific informed consent,the quality of care if prevention counseling is not required, thecost to implement, and issue of stigma and discrimination. The alternative \u2014 not taking advantage of these revisions \u2014 could keep us locked into a pattern that will not improve orprotect the health of our people. These recommendations arefor streamlining general procedures and must be interpretedand applied with competence. The American Indians/AlaskanNatives represent a specific population with unique sub-populations of higher risk. This situation must be taken into consideration with the science behind the revisions. There arebehavioral health, education, and health disparity componentsand issues that will surface. These guidelines are intended to improve population health by lowering or preventing disease transmission (read as:Health Promotion/Disease Prevention, which is one of ourDirector' s priorities). Attempt to adopt the methods and be mindful of the individual, cultural, and system barriers and perspectives withgood communication and collaboration as they arise (read as:both a GPRA indicator and a Healthy People 2010 goal). At Headquarters, we are addressing the current HIV/AIDS testing policy, since the information is outdated. In lieu of newIHS HIV/AIDS policy, we suggest implementing the CDCguidelines and realize there is more work to be done.Additional comments and progress on the revisions will beforthcoming. OB/GYN CCC Editorial comment: HIV Transmission is a Sentinel Event, Signaling a MissedOpportunity for Prevention Important take home points are: Awareness of serostatus substantially reduces high risk behaviors, and screening is cost-effective. Hence, the revised recommendations call for routine HIV testing for all individuals between the ages of 13 and 65 years in the United States. No separate written consent form is needed for screening; high risk patients should be tested for HIV annually The revised recommendations advocate for streamlining general procedures and should beapplied with competence Two clinical pearls and some food for thought. First, there is no central Indian health system requirement for writtenconsent. Having said that, you still need to provide pre-testteaching, either verbal or written. This is a very importantteachable moment with your patient that you should not let slipthrough your fingers. Pre-test teaching is very different fromprevention counseling. Prevention counseling is relatively longand involved, while pre-test counseling can be concise and tothe point. In a way, a negative HIV screen result may be moreimportant than a positive result, because you still have thechance to prevent that patient with a negative result frombecoming a future HIV patient. I suggest you coordinate with your patient educators and develop age appropriate materials that you can give toall your patients. The CDC is a great resource, and theIndian health system' s patient education team can help youadapt those materials to be more culturally specific. Ourgoal is to decrease HIV transmission and all the barriers tothat goal.Second, the Indian health system respects state laws, but be wary of information from other staff who say your individualstate requires written consent. In most cases, your state does notactually require a written consent. Rather, the state lab mayrequire a written consent to perform free HIV testing at theirlab. If you send your HIV tests out, perform them in your ownlab, or perform rapid testing at the bedside, then you would notneed a written consent. When in doubt, check this out yourself.Don't depend on the conventional wisdom without asking theright questions of the appropriate state officials. I have includeda great resource from Charlton Wilson, which answers thatquestion on a state by state basis below. Every perinatal HIV transmission is a sentinel health event, signaling either a missed opportunity for prevention or,more rarely, a failure of interventions to prevent perinataltransmission. When these infections occur, they underscorethe need for improved strategies to ensure that all pregnantwomen undergo HIV testing and, if found to be HIV positive,receive proper interventions to reduce their transmission riskand safeguard their health and the health of their infants. Data confirm that testing rates are higher when HIV tests are included in the standard panel of screening tests for allpregnant women. Women also are much more likely to betested if they perceive that their health care provider stronglyrecommends HIV testing. As universal prenatal screening hasbecome more widespread, an increasing proportion of pregnantwomen who had undiagnosed HIV infection at the time ofdelivery were found to have seroconverted during pregnancy.A second HIV test during the third trimester for women insettings with elevated HIV incidence (>17 cases per 100,000person-years) is cost-effective and might result in substantialreductions in mother-to-child HIV transmission. For those outside the perinatal and neonatal arena, you now have an opportunity to apply the success the perinatal andneonatal disciplines have shown with reducing perinataltransmission . . . but you can apply to all from 13-64.

From Your Colleagues Sunnah Kim, American Academy of PediatricsForty Years in Partnership: the American Academy ofPediatrics and Indian Health Fifty years ago, American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN) children faced an overwhelming burden of disease, especially infectious diseases such as pneumonia, meningitis,tuberculosis, hepatitis A and B, and gastrointestinal disease.Death rates of AI/AN infants between 1 month and 1 year ofage were much higher than in the US population as a whole,largely because of these infectious diseases. The health care ofAI/AN patients was transferred to the Department of Health,Education, and Welfare in 1955 and placed under theadministration of an agency soon to be known as the IndianHealth Service (IHS). The few early pediatricians in the IHSrecognized the severity of the challenges facing AI/ANchildren and asked for help. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) responded by creating the Committee on Indian Health in 1965. In 1986 theCommittee on Native American Child Health replaced theCommittee on Indian Health. Through the activity of thesecommittees, the AAP participated in and influenced IHSpolicies and services and, combined with improvedtransportation, sanitation, and access to vaccines and directservices, led to vast improvements in the health of AI/ANchildren. In 1965, American Indian/Alaska Nativepostneonatal mortality was more than three times that of thegeneral population of the US. It is still more than twice as highas in other races but has decreased 89% since 1965. Infectiousdiseases, which caused almost one fourth of all AI/AN childdeaths in 1965, now cause less than 1%. The IHS and tribalhealth programs, authorized by the Indian Self-Determinationand Education Assistance Act of 1976 (Pub L. 93-638),continue to seek AAP review and assistance through theCommittee on Native American Child Health to find andimplement interventions for emerging child health problemsrelated to pervasive poverty of many AI/AN communities.Acute infectious diseases that once were responsible for excessmorbidity and mortality now are replaced by excess ratesresulting from harmful behaviors, substance use, obesity, andinjuries (unintentional and intentional). Through strongworking partnerships such as that of the AAP and the IHS,progress hopefully will occur to address this \"new morbidity.\"In this article we document the history of the IHS and the AAPcommittees that have worked with it and present certainstatistics related to AI/AN child health that show the severity ofthe health status disparities challenging AI/AN and youth.

Editorial comment: Elaine Locke, ACOG In the same era that the pediatricians were responding to the needs of AI/AN children, the obstetricians were responding in parallel. The American College of Obstetricians andGynecologists (ACOG) established a Committee on AmericanIndian Affairs in 1970 for the purpose of studying anddeveloping expertise in the area of maternal and gynecologichealth problems among AI/AN women. The following is abrief description of what ACOG currently offers, links todocuments on the history of ACOG involvement, as well as theFellows in Service Program. ACOG' s Indian health activity began in 1970 and now includes programs that: Provide medical care when it is most needed to AI/AN women; obstetrician-gynecologists from the privatesector fill short-term vacancies in Indian hospitals. Offer an annual four-day course on Obstetric, Neonatal, and Gynecologic Care for IHS and tribalnurses and physicians who are not trained in thespecialty. An optional Neonatal ResuscitationProgram offers certificates of completion andadditional education credits. Produce a practical reference text for the use of nonspecialists in IHS and tribal hospitals. Conduct site visits to IHS and tribal hospitals; reports can support improvements in equipment, staffing,management, and clinical care. ACOG continues to support the Committee on American Indian Affairs as an expression of the College' s concern for thehealth and well-being of AI/AN women and their offspring.For more information, please Contact Yvonne Malloy or ElaineLocke at (202) 863-2580.

Hot Topics ObstetricsCan a 29% Cesarean Delivery Rate Possibly Be Justified? Have there been measurable improvements in fetal outcome from the use of EFM and its associated increase in thecesarean delivery rate? There is a very high false-positive rate for \"nonreassuring\" heart rate patterns used to predict adepressed newborn. It did not achieve its promise because itwas designed to prevent intrapartum death, an event so rare thatit was not possible to show a significant difference, and toprevent cerebral palsy, which we now know is attributable tobirth asphyxia in term infants only about 6 - 17% of the time.In fact, although most labors are followed with EFM, there hasbeen no reduction in the incidence of cerebral palsy over thelast three decades. What about the maternal benefits of cesarean delivery? There is little argument that vaginal delivery is associated witha higher frequency of subsequent stress urinary incontinenceand uterine and vaginal prolapse. However, it is also clear thatnulliparous women and those who have had only cesareandelivery may also be symptomatic, suggesting that the agingprocess, pregnancy per se, genetic factors, and just walkingupright for more than 50 years are significant contributors tothe problem. In contrast, the risks of the current cesarean delivery rate are not difficult to discern. Getahun and co-workers havereported a 50% increase in the risk of placenta previa and adoubling of the risk of abruptio placenta in the subsequentpregnancy after one previous cesarean delivery. These risksincreased with multiple prior cesareans. Resnik R. Can a 29% cesarean delivery rate possibly be justified? Obstet Gynecol. 2006;107:752-4. Gynecology A New Era in Ovulation Induction: Aromatase Inhibitors Conclusions: Aromatase inhibitors are as effective as or superior to clomiphene citrate in ovulation induction and in superovulation. Unlike CC, they do not carry an antiestrogeniceffect on the endometrium. Given the advantages of aromataseinhibitors, they can be used to replace CC as ovulation-inducing drugs. Their role in IVF remains to be determined. Holzer H, et al. A new era in ovulation induction. Fertility and Sterility. 2006;85(2):277-85. Child Health Fetal Injury at Cesarean Delivery: Related to Indicationand Type of Uterine Incision Results: A total of 37,110 cesarean deliveries were included in the registry, and 418 (1.1%) had an identified fetal injury. The most common injury was skin laceration (n=272,0.7%). Other injuries nerve palsy (n=11). Among primary cesareandeliveries, deliveries with a failed forceps or vacuum attempthad the highest rate of injuries (6.9%). In women with a priorcesarean delivery, the highest rate of injury also occurred in theunsuccessful trial of forceps or vacuum (1.7%), and the lowestrate occurred in the elective repeat cesarean group (0.5%). Thetype of uterine incision was associated with fetal injury, 3.4%\"T\" or \"J\" incision, 1.4% for vertical incision, and 1.1% for alow transverse (P=.003), as was a skin incision-to-deliverytime of three minutes or less. Fetal injury did not vary infrequency with the type of skin incision, preterm delivery,maternal body mass index, or infant birth weight greater than4,000 g. Conclusion: Fetal injuries complicate 1.1% of cesarean deliveries. The frequency of fetal injury at cesarean deliveryvaries with the indication for surgery as well as with theduration of the skin incision-to-delivery interval and the typeof uterine incision.

Chronic Disease and Illness Aspirin to Prevent Heart Attack and Stroke: What's theRight Dose? Despite hundreds of clinical trials, the appropriate dose of aspirin to prevent myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke is uncertain. In the US, the doses most frequently recommendedare 80, 160, or 325 mg per day. Because aspirin can causemajor bleeding, the appropriate dose is the lowest dose that iseffective in preventing both MI and stroke because these twodiseases frequently co-exist. Five randomized clinical trialshave compared aspirin with placebo or no therapy for theprevention of stroke and MI. These trials varied with regard tothe dose of aspirin, the duration of treatment, and, mostimportant, the populations selected for study varied in theirbaseline risk of stroke and MI. These studies indicate that themost appropriate dose for the primary and secondaryprevention of stroke and MI is 160 mg/day. Dalen J.

Features ACOGAmnioinfusion Does Not Prevent Meconium AspirationSyndrome Abstract: Amnioinfusion has been advocated as a technique to reduce the incidence of meconium aspiration and to improve neonatal outcome. However, a large proportion ofwomen with meconium-stained amniotic fluid have infantswho have taken in meconium within the trachea or bronchiolesbefore meconium passage has been noted and beforeamnioinfusion can be performed by the obstetrician;meconium passage may predate labor. Based on currentliterature, routine prophylactic for the meconium-stained not recommended.Prophylactic use of amnioinfusion for meconium-stainedamniotic fluid should be done only in the setting of additionalclinical trials. However, amnioinfusion remains a reasonableapproach in the treatment of repetitive variable decelerations,regardless of amniotic fluid meconium status.

Ask a Librarian: Diane Cooper, MSLS/NIH Updated Cochrane Systematic ReviewsAerobic Exercise and Pregnancy A review of eleven trials involving 472 pregnant women suggested that pregnant women who engage in vigorous exercise at least two to three times per week improve ormaintain their physical fitness, and there is some evidence thatthese women have pregnancies of the same length as those whomaintain their usual activities. There is too little evidence toshow whether there are other effects on the woman and herbaby. The trials reviewed included non-contact exercise suchas swimming, static cycling, and general floor exerciseprograms. Most of the trials were small and of insufficientmethodologic quality, and larger, better trials are needed beforeconfident recommendations can be made about the benefitsand risk of aerobic exercise in pregnancy. Aerobic exercise isphysical activity that stimulates a person' s breathing and bloodcirculation. Kramer MS, McDonald SW . Aerobic exercise for women during pregnancy. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews2006, Issue 3. Calcium Supplementation Safe and Cheap Calcium supplementation during pregnancy is a safe and relatively cheap means of reducing the risk of pre-eclampsia in women at increased risk, and women from communities withlow dietary calcium, according to a recent review. Pretermbirth (birth before 37 weeks) is often caused by high bloodpressure and is the leading cause of newborn deaths,particularly in low-income countries. No adverse effects havebeen found from calcium supplementation, but further researchis needed into the ideal dosage. Hofmeyr GJ, Atallah AN, Duley L.

Preclampsia Drugs: No Clear Choice A review of 24 trials including 2949 women found that while antihypertensive drugs lower blood pressure, there is not enough evidence to show which drug is the most effectivewhen taken by pregnant women with hypertension.

Family Planning Ortho Evra Patch Linked to Risk for VenousThromboembolism On September 21, 2006 the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Ortho-McNeil Pharmaceutical (a Johnson & Johnson company) notified health careprofessionals regarding changes in the safety labeling for aweekly norelgestromin/ethinyl estradiol transdermal system(Ortho Evra). The label has been updated to reflect new data from two US epidemiologic studies that evaluated the relative risk fordeveloping nonfatal venous thromboembolism (VTE) inwomen using contraceptivescontaining 35 \u00b5g of ethinyl estradiol, according to an alert sentrecently from MedWatch, the FDA' s safety information andadverse event reporting program. Both studies were conductedusing electronic health care claims data, and the second studyalso included patient chart reviews. Although findings from the first study revealed no significant difference in VTE risk for patch users comparedwith those taking oral contraceptives containing 35 \u00b5g ratio [OR] = 0.9; 95% confidenceinterval [CI], 0.5 - 1.6), the second study linked the patch tomore than double the risk for the event (OR = 2.4; 95% CI, 1.1- 5.5). The FDA notes that the latter finding supports theagency' s concerns regarding the risk for VTE in women usingthe contraceptive patch. Health care professionals are advised to balance the higher estrogen exposure and the possible increased risk of VTEagainst the chance of pregnancy if the patch is not used;contraceptive options other than the patch should be consideredfor women with risk factors for thromboembolic disease. Adverse events related to use of the norelgestromin/ethinyl estradiol contraceptive patch should be reported to the FDA' sMedWatch reporting program by phone at 1-800-FDA-1088,by fax at 1-800-FDA-0178, online athttp://www.fda.gov/medwatch, or by mail Maternal Survival Worldwide: Consensus andControversies In the year 2000, 189 countries and many major international agencies signed a \"Millennium Declaration\" that was to provide a blueprint for improving conditions around theworld - in particular, the conditions of the poor. The blueprintwas divided into eight goals. Millennium Development Goal#5 committed signatory countries to improve maternal health;since improving health is difficult to measure, the agreementwas to try to reduce maternal mortality by two thirds by 2015. Anyone interested in maternal and child health will want to take a look at the Lancet' s new series on maternal survival.In a series of five review articles and several associatedcommentaries, major figures in maternal health review whatwe know about maternal mortality (and to a lesser extentmorbidity) and what to do about it. The upshot? Six years intothe millennium, progress on maternal mortality does not lookgood. Statistics are unreliable, but it appears that maternaldeaths have stabilized at about 400 per 100,000 live births (farfrom the MDG target of 141 per 100,000 by 2015).Improvements in some countries, like Bangladesh, have beenoffset by worsening in others, such as Afghanistan and much ofsub-Saharan Africa. Inequality is worse for obstetric risk thanfor any other health indicator: a woman in Sweden has a 1 in30,000 lifetime risk of death in childbirth, while for a womanin Sierra Leone that risk is 1 in 6. Readers will find both consensus and controversy here. All contributors agree that political commitment and financialinvestment fall short of what they should be. All contributorsseem to agree that funding competition between maternalhealth programs and child health programs, and betweencommunity-based and clinic-based programs, has been a wasteof opportunity and time. To use the memorable Cameroonianproverb quoted in one editorial, \"When the elephant and therhino fight, it is the grass that suffers.\" All contributors agreethat women have a right to birth in a safe facility attended by askilled health worker - preferably a midwife. Major areas ofcontroversy remain, however: chief among them are the role ofhome birth with skilled attendants in the developing world; thecontribution of iatrogenic illness, especially infection, tomaternal death; and the importance of providing safe abortion. Review articles by C Ronsmans and WJ Graham; OMR Campbell and Filippi et al are especiallyhelpful overviews of global research on maternal health andsurvival. The authors provide evidence debunking some mythsmany of us will find hard to let go (for instance, that riskscreening during antenatal care will improve maternalmortality). They also provide heartening evidence that manydifferent strategies can improve maternal health, fromimproving control of infectious diseases, to ensuring access tohospital care, to providing midwifery in the community.

Look for the Maternal Survival Series, September 30, 2006. Medical Mystery Tour The Words 'Bizarre' and 'Atypia' in the yo P5015 presented to a field facility with ongoing menometrorrhagia despite conservative therapy with medroxyprogesterone 10 mg for 10 days a month for threemonths. Initial ultrasound revealed a 2.7 x 2.4 cm endometrialstructure felt to be consistent with an endometrial polyp or aleiomyoma. A follow-up ultrasound two months later at thefield facility revealed two complex masses involving theendometrium with the appearance of some myometrialextension. The first was located in the mid-uterus andendometrium and was larger than the second, which waslocated in the lower uterine segment. An endometrial biopsywas obtained at the initial visit and was consistent with benignproliferative phase endometrium. Examination revealed an eight-week-size uterus and no adnexal masses. There was urethral hypermobility, but novisible incontinence with Valsalva maneuver. The examinationwas otherwise unremarkable. A discussion with the patientensued and it was felt that further imaging modalities wereindicated. In addition, the patient was offered a hysteroscopy,further endometrial sampling, and possible hysteroscopicresection. As both the above management options requiredtransportation to a distant referral facility, the patient stated shewould prefer a definitive operative intervention, if she neededto make such a trip. The patient subsequently underwent anuncomplicated total vaginal hysterectomy with a left salpingo-oophorectomy. She was discharged on the second postoperative day. Pathologic evaluation revealed cytologic atypia present throughout the neoplasm that was of a degenerative and bizarretype. Occasional mitotic figures were identified. No tumortype necrosis was seen. The cellularity was felt to be somewhatincreased over what one normally sees in a highly cellularleiomyoma. The pathologic material was sent to a second sitefor pathologic evaluation and the above impression wasconfirmed. What do you think this patient' s diagnosis is? What is the risk of recurrence? Stay tuned to next month' s MedicalMystery Tour for the rest of the story Midwives Corner: Lisa Allee, CNM, Chinle External Fetal Monitors - Can you Kick the Habit? Hindley, et al, undertook a three-year research project due to the indiscriminate use of electronic fetal monitoring (EFM) in the United Kingdom despite evidence that states it should beused sparingly. They point out that extensive research in thelast 30 years has shown limited benefit of EFM in low riskwomen and an increase in cesarean section rates when womenare monitored continuously during labor. The evidence insteadstates that the most appropriate method of fetal monitoring forwomen of low obstetric risk is intermittent auscultation (IA). Hindley, et al, present their qualitative research interviewing midwives about EFM and IA. They interviewed58 midwives practicing in northern England with an average of15 years of experience. For IA they found three maincategories: freedom/liberating effects for the woman;closeness/proximity of the midwife; and quicker progress inlabor. For EFM the categories included: oppressive/restrictive;midwife by proxy; and increased requirements for painmedications. For both monitoring methods the interviews alsorevealed paradoxes. For IA there was a paradox that themidwives' positive comments were tempered by fears that theywould miss some pathological event between auscultations.The paradox for EFM was that the midwives' negativecomments and their insights that EFM is causing midwives toattend less to women and more to machines and to lose sight ofwhat is normal are contradicted by their practice realities ofcontinuing to work with EFM, even for low risk women. In their discussion, Hindley, et al, illuminate what occurs for many midwives \u2014 a belief in the normal process of birthand a desire to work with women to support and enhance thatprocess, but then the realities of where they work, including thereliance on EFM resulting in a devaluation and decreased useof the traditional, watchful, hands-on approach of the midwifeand an increased likelihood of the cascade effect leading toincreasing numbers of interventions in the process of birth.They point out a persistent paradox in our practices \u2014 theevidence shows overwhelmingly that the use of EFM is notbeneficial and may be harmful to patients and to midwiferypractice, but we keep on using it. The authors bring to the forefront the quandary we are in \u2014 we know that evidence-based care would mean not usingEFM, especially with low risk women, as it has not been shownto improve outcomes and has been shown to increaseinterventions, yet we continue to use it with virtually alllaboring women. The authors discuss the many influences thatmake this so, including: lack of institutional support for IA;staffing issues causing EFM to be used as a midwife proxy \u2014\"a substitute for the presence of the midwife who wouldotherwise use the clinical skills of perception, auscultation,palpation, and communication\"; trust in machines; that it' seasier to busy oneself with the monitor than to engage deeplywith a laboring woman; medical policies; and the persistentbelief by many obstetricians that birth is inherently dangerousand should be risk managed. They also make suggestions forfinding our way out of the quandary: where guidelines exist forappropriate use of EFM, audit compliance with the guidelines;provide resources for one-to-one midwifery care in labor tostop the use of EFM as a proxy; continued debate anddiscussion about oxytocin and thatoften necessitate EFM use; and about precise clinical riskindicators for the use of EFM. They also offer a first stepin the process of change: Simple strategies such as removing November 2006 THE IHS PROVIDER 284fetal monitors from rooms might also help the midwife to consciously question the need for EFM rather than applying itroutinely, merely because it is proximal.

Editorial Comment: Lisa Allee, CNM First, I have got to say that I love qualitative research because the results sound like actual humans and not just numbers. For example, the quotes the authors put in this articlewill likely ring true with many of us: \"I think it (IA) gives the woman more freedom. She can mobilise. I think the labour tends to get quickerbecause she is not pinned to the bed in one position. Shecan move around, it' s more natural, it' s more normal. \" \"I think a lot of the women feel really restricted by monitoring. It also means that as a midwife, your time istaken up with analysing and looking at the machine a lotof the time when you could be giving other support to thewoman. \" \"I think, especially with the monitors, they are waiting for the next pain. The focus is on the pain.Certainly, there are more epidurals as opposed to thewoman who is labouring in the bath or moving about. \" \"I think IA brings you closer to them, and it' s just more natural and normal, so it' s less technology that I amin favour of. \" Second, when I got to the end of this article I let out a whoop and did a little happy dance \u2014 someone finally said in print \"take the monitor out of the room.\" Wow, what a concept.There are some many reasons to do this, but most of all itwould mean that everyone would have to really think aboutusing EFM, its appropriateness and its implications, because touse it you would have to drag the thing into the room. Thischange would also make it all right to not use EFM, asappropriate, using doptones instead and, thus, make the focusof our care the laboring woman, the baby, and the familyinstead of the machine. Those of us who have practiced inhome birth, birth centers, and internationally know that thisreally is ok, safe, and so satisfying for all involved. I wouldlove to hear from any site that makes this change or has alreadydone so! E-mail me at lisa.allee@ihs.gov and I will include the information in a future column. One last thing: it is time to update the midwifery page on the IHS website. A few ideas I have are a patient educationsection, midwifery conferences, an ask the midwife column,why you are lucky to have midwifery care, and profiles of thedifferent midwifery services in IHS. Please send me yourcomments on these ideas and your suggestions for other items.Also, please send me pictures that could be used on the page. Oklahoma Perspective: Greggory Woitte - Hastings Indian Medical CenterAsthma in Pregnancy Y our next patient is a new OB physical. After scanning her history, you note that she reports having a medical history significant for asthma in the past. Given the high prevalence ofasthma in the general population, it is one of the more commoncomplications of pregnancy. Pregnancies complicated withasthma are more likely to also be complicated by preterm birth,hyperemesis gravidarum, pre-eclampsia, IUGR, and neonatalmortality. The goals that should be met in taking care of thispatient include: 1. objectively evaluating the maternal/fetal clinical condition 2. control of asthma symptoms and prevention of acute attacks by avoidance/control of triggers 3. Maximize lung function with medications while minimizing side effects 4. patient education Placing a patient into a category of mild-intermittent, mild-persistent, moderate, or severe, based on her pre-pregnancy condition will assist in your treatment of the patientduring pregnancy. However, the foundation of management ofthese patients is the peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR). Use ofthe peak flow meter can assist in management, recognition, andprevention of exacerbations. Here are the National AsthmaEducation and Prevention Program recommendations. Asthma and pregnancy report.

Managing Asthma Gilson, MFM, ANMC Fetal Lung Maturity Assessment The evaluation of fetal lung maturity by use of lipid chromatography analysis of amniotic fluid surfactant with the lecithin-sphingomyelin ratio and per cent phosphatidylglycerol (\"L/S and PG\") has been standard obstetric practicefor over 40 years. Over the last 20 years however, this test hasbeen largely supplanted by the fluorescence polarization assay,which, in its current iteration, is known as the \"TDx-FLM II\"test (Abbott Laboratories). There is an extensive literature (seebelow for partial list of references) evaluating its accuracy, bothits correlation with L/S and PG, as well as its clinical efficacy November 2006 THE IHS PROVIDER 285November 2006 THE IHS PROVIDER 286in predicting infants diagnosed with respiratory distress syndrome (IRDS). The accuracy of the TDx-FLM is now considered excellent, and, in the latest studies, demonstrates that it isprobably superior to L/S and PG determinations. Ourconsultants at the University of Washington and our referencelab have now largely abandoned the L/S and PG in favor of theTDx-FLM II. I would therefore like to propose that we alsoexclusively use this simpler and less costly test, which can bedone locally, with results provided within several hours, andwhich only requires 1 mL of amniotic fluid. Currently, if theFLM is negative or indeterminate, Providence sends thespecimen out for confirmation with an L/S and PGdetermination. This is called the \"sequential\" or \"cascade\"strategy, and was likewise proposed over 20 years ago. Thistakes about 48 hours for the result, accrues a substantialadditional charge, and is probably not necessary with theaccuracy of the current TDx-FLM II. While most laboratories more accurate (seereferences online), and do not give just a \"yes or no\" answer.For example, a FLM of 50 at 36 weeks predicts a risk of IRDSof 4.3%, probably an acceptable risk depending on theindication for early delivery. Like the L/S, amniotic fluidspecimens contaminated with significant quantities of blood,meconium, or bilirubin may give erroneous results.Insufficient data have been accrued on vaginal pool amnioticfluid specimens. All tests of fetal lung maturity, including theL/S, have over a 95% negative predictive value (if the test isreported mature, there is only a 5% chance of IRDS), but onlya 60% positive predictive value (test reported as immature, butinfant does not develop IRDS). Amniocentesis for fetal lung maturity is currently only thought to be useful in two clinical situations: 1) between 34-36 weeks where delivery is thought to be indicated for maternalor fetal reasons, but the need is not urgent (under 34 weeks:rarely ever mature results, over 36 weeks: rarely ever severeIRDS), and 2) in a woman with unsure dating with adifferential diagnosis of possible fetal growth restriction(requiring delivery) versus lesser (premature) gestational age.In other situations, if there is an urgent indication for delivery,the pregnancy should be delivered regardless of the results offetal lung maturity testing.

There are limited data on HPVinfection in heterosexual men.Results. We included a total of 40 publications on HPV DNA detection and risk factors for HPV in men; 27 evaluatedmultiple anatomic sites or specimens, 10 evaluated a single siteor specimen, and three evaluated risk factors or optimalanatomic sites/specimens for HPV detection. Twelve studiesassessed site- detection. HPVprevalence in 1.3% - 72.9% in studies in whichmultiple anatomic sites or specimens were evaluated; 15 (56%) of these studies reported 20% HPV prevalence. HPV prevalence varied on the basis of sampling, processing methods, and the anatomic site(s) or specimen(s) sampled. Weincluded 15 publications seropositivity depended on the population, HPV type, andmethods used. In nine studies that evaluated both men andwomen, all but one demonstrated that HPV seroprevalence waslower in men than in women. Conclusion: HPV infection is highly prevalent in sexually active men and can be detected by use of a variety of specimensand methods.

IHS Child Health Notes November 2006 THE IHS PROVIDER 288Quote of the month A long habit of not thinking a thing wrong, gives it a superficial appearance of being right, and raises at first aformidable outcry in defence of custom. But the tumult soonsubsides. Time makes more converts than reason. \" Thomas Paine, 1776 Article of Interest Tall girls: the social shaping of a medical therapy. Arch Pediatr Adolesc Med. Oct 2006;160(10):1035-9. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?db=pubmed&cmd=Retrieve&dopt=AbstractPlus&list_uids=17018462&query_hl=2&itool=pubmed_docsum . During the latter half of the 20 thcentury, estrogen therapy was given to prevent otherwise healthy girls with tall staturefrom becoming tall adults by inhibiting future linear growth.Estrogen therapy represented the logical application ofscientific knowledge regarding the role of estrogen for closureof the growth plates, but it also reflected prevailing societal andpolitical beliefs about what it meant to be a tall girl. Theauthors also discuss the rise and fall in popularity of thistherapy and suggest that it has implications for the currenttherapy of short stature with growth hormone. Editorial Comment Here was a medical therapy being applied to what was clearly not a medical problem. Especially interesting is how the definition of \"unacceptable\" height for girls changed overtime while this therapy was never applied to males to makethem less tall. The article reminds us how medical knowledgeand therapy is always applied within a particular social context. Infectious Disease Updates. Rosalyn Singleton, MD, MPH Rotavirus vaccine licensed: How do diarrhea-associated hospitalization rates among American Indian and Alaska Native children compare with the rates for children in the USgeneral population? It often appears that that AI/AN childrenhave higher rates of just about any infectious disease. Butwhat' s the story with gastroenteritis and rotavirus? In 1980 - 1982, the rate of diarrhea-associated hospitalizations in American Indian and Alaska Native(AI/AN) children < 5 years (236 per 10,000) was nearly twiceas high as the US rate (136). However, by 1993 - 1995, theAI/AN hospitalization rate (71) was similar to the US rate (89).An updated analysis reveals that the hospitalization rate for2000 - 2004 for AI/AN children < 5 years of age (66) is similarto or lower than the 2003 US childhood rate (79). The AI/ANhospitalization rate varied by region, with the highest rate inthe Southwest region (93), followed by the East (79) andAlaska (77). However, there are still areas of disparity.The 2000 - 2004 AI/AN hospitalization rate in infants (262) issignificantly higher than the US rate (154), and the rate ofoutpatient visits for AI/AN children < 5 years (2,255 per10,000) is also higher than the US outpatient rate (1,648). What about the burden of rotavirus disease? Unfortunately, only 2.7% of the AI/AN diarrhea-associatedhospitalizations and 0.2% of outpatient visits were coded asrotavirus. This proportion underestimates the true burden ofrotavirus. Epidemiologic characteristics, such as the age rangeand seasonal peak of diarrhea-associated hospitalizations,suggest that the proportion of diarrhea-associatedhospitalizations caused by rotavirus among AI/AN childrenmay be similar to proportion seen in the US population (~ 30 -50% of diarrhea-associated hospitalizations). RotaTeq, alive oral pentavalent rotavirus vaccine, is now licensed andavailable for use in infants 6 - 32 weeks of age. Recent literature on American Indian/Alaskan Native HealthDoug Esposito, MD Prevalence and comorbidity of mental disorders among American Indian children in the northern Midwest. J Adolesc Health. 2006 Sep;39(3):427-34. Epub 2006 Jul 10. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?db=pubmed&cmd=Retrieve&dopt=AbstractPlus&list_uids=16919807&query_hl=7&itool=pubmed_DocSum . The authors report on the prevalence of 11 mental disorders in 10 - 12-year old American Indian children in the northernMidwest. This study compliments a previous article published bythe same group of researchers that described the 12-month andlifetime prevalence of five mental disorders seen in the caretakersof these same children. That article was reviewed for the August2006 edition of the IHS Child Health Notes (http://www.ihs.gov/MedicalPrograms/MCH/M/documents/ICHn806.doc).Information on the 11 disorders was gathered from DISC- R diagnostic surveys conducted by trained non-clinician community members who interviewed the children and theirparents/caretakers. Study subjects resided on or near one offour rural American Indian reservations in the northern midwestor one of five rural or remote Canadian First Nations reservesin Ontario. All sites are of one culture and language, with onlyminor dialectic variations. The disorders investigated weresubstance abuse disorders (alcohol abuse, alcohol dependence,marijuana abuse, marijuana dependence, and nicotinedependence), major depressive episode, dysthymic disorder,general anxiety disorder, oppositional defiant disorder, conductdisorder, and inattention/hyperactivity disorder. The authors report that 22.8% of the children satisfied the 12-month diagnostic criteria for at least one of the 11 mentaldisorders under investigation, while 9% met criteria for two ormore disorders. The most prevalent disorder was conductdisorder (8.6%), followed by oppositional/defiant disorder(7.9%), and then andgeneral anxiety disorder (4.1%). Major depressive disorder(3.6%) rounded out the top five most prevalent conditions. Thereported prevalence rates represent a combination from bothcaretaker and child reports. The rationale behind thismethodology is discussed in detail in the article, but is beyondthe scope of this review. Obviously, however, rates combinedfrom both data sources will exceed those reported individuallyby either the caretaker or the child. The authors contend that their results support the contemporary theory that ineffective parenting plays a pivotalrole in the development of mental and behavioral disorders inoffspring. Conditions and realities that negatively influencethe effectiveness of parenting would be expected to increasethe likelihood that children would develop these mentalconditions. In multivariate analysis, they found an associationbetween female caretaker depression and alcohol abuse withmental disorders in their children. As reported in their initialpublished article of mental disorders among theparents/caretakers of these same children (see link above),lifetime alcohol abuse was found to be nearly five times thatobserved in a national cohort. Thus, they contend, children inthis study are at increased risk of exposure to \"nonoptimalparenting,\" and by association, a high prevalence of certainmental disorders would be expected. Additionally,approximately 20% of the female caretakers of these childrenwere found to have a lifetime prevalence of major depressionin the previous report. Given that depression is known to bedisruptive of the parenting process, the authors imply that thedevelopment of mental disorders in children exposed to adepressed female caretaker would be more likely to occur. The authors warn about the generalizability of their results to other American Indian cultures. Other limitations of the dataare discussed, and can be examined by the interested reader inthe article itself.Editorial Comment There seems to be a recent proliferation of articles scrutinizing mental and behavioral health problems inAmerican Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN) communities.Individually, I believe many of these papers simply point outsome of the things we perhaps already intuitively know. In toto, however, I am hopeful that this body of data andknowledge will serve to focus attention on the mental andbehavioral problems and needs of these populations.Ultimately, this might lead to an increase in resources andprograms devoted to dealing with the prevalent mental healthissues of AI/AN populations. QuickStats: adolescent death rates by race/ethnicity and sex \u2014 United States, 2001-2003. MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep. 2006 Sept 1;55(34):943.http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5534a5.htm . Editorial Comment Just an \"FYI.\" American Indian/Alaska Native children ages 15 - 17 years as a group lead the pack in both male andfemale death rates. Although AI/AN females are nearly twiceas likely to die as the next closest ethnic group (White, non-Hispanic, 60.4 vs. 36.6 deaths/100,000 population), males arebarely ahead of Black, non-Hispanic youth (89.6 vs. 89.3deaths/100,000 population). As acknowledged in the footnotesof the QuickStats, AI/AN death rates are known to beunderestimated, often by sizeable margins. Translation: thedisparity might be a whole lot more dramatic, in reality, thanthis bar graph suggests.

November 2006 THE IHS PROVIDER 289Report on the Annual Business Meeting for Advanced Practice Nurses Judith Whitecrane, CNM, Phoenix Indian Medical Center, Phoenix, Arizona The Annual Business Meeting for Advanced Practice Nurses (APNs) was held May 22 - 23, 2006 in conjunction withthe IHS PA/APN Continuing Education Conference inScottsdale, Arizona. Approximately 50 APNs attended theday-and-a-half business meeting representing many Indianhealth facilities throughout the nation. Carolyn Aoyoma MPH, CNM, IHS Headquarters APN representative, attended the first full day of the businessmeeting. CAPT Aoyoma shared with us her duties as IHSNurse Consultant for Women' s Health and Advanced PracticeNursing. Among her many projects are promotion oftelemammography in Indian health, increasing Pap andmammography screening rates, attending IHS/ACOGobstetrical site reviews, and project management of the annualIHS/ACOG postgraduate obstetrical course in Denver,Colorado. She works closely with the Office of Women' sHealth, is part of the Surgeon General' s workgroup forWomen' s Health, and is the project officer for seven women' shealth grants. She was warmly received by the APNs attendingthis meeting. This year' s attendees chose four items to address for this years workplan. Integrating Behavioral Health and Primary Care Model programs were shared at the meeting. At Phoenix Indian Medical Center, this model uses nurse midwives to manage prenatal care and social workers who see patientsimmediately afterward in the same clinic to assess and treatsubstance abuse problems, primarily methamphetamine abuse.It has been effective in reducing methamphetamine use duringpregnancy. There is a clinic in southwestern Michigan that isutilizing shared clinical space in a similar manner. APNsstrongly support the use of mental health care nursepractitioners and other behavioral health professionals in theclinical setting. It is a combination that enhances successfulmedical outcomes. GS-11 Issues There is still a ceiling of GS-11 for Civil Service APN ratings in some IHS Areas. Unfortunately, this has been a recurrent theme at our business meeting for several years thathas not found remedy. Areas of concern include Alaska,Billings, and Tucson. This issue was presented to Dr. Grim atthe 2006 NCCD meeting in Phoenix. Dr. Grim voiced concernand assured us of his support. The classification process waspresented and discussed as a means to better understand howthe classification standards are developed. It was noted thatAPN classifications have not been updated since 1977. Sincethen, our practice has expanded and become significantly morecomplex and independent. Dr. Grim recently signed the APNNational Scope of Practice, which supports higher GS ratingsby defining APN practice as it exists today. We will continueto support a minimal GS-12 rating for nurse practitioners. Marketing and Communication We will continue to market how APNs are serving American Indian/Alaska Natives' health care needs. APNs have developed brochures to teach both patients and personnelabout their style of practice. Judy Whitecrane, CNM sharedthe powerpoint program that she presents at IHS businessmeetings promoting the utilization of APNs. We promoteAPN practice because it is cost effective, patient and educationcentered, and often more available, especially in rural areas.APNs also tend to be the stable core of Indian health facilities. Women's Health Issues The advanced practice nurses at this meeting enthusiastically support work to improve women' s health care in the Indian health system. They pledged their support towork with CAPT Aoyama to improve Women' s Health GPRAindicators, especially domestic violence and depressionscreening, mammography, and pap smear screening andtreatment rates. The financial support and assistance of the Clinical Support Center and Nursing Headquarters for this annual eventare gratefully acknowledged. We look forward to meetingagain in 2007.
