Their members and producers assist furniture designers, retailers, architects, government officials and others with product development as well as sustainable practices. The SFC provides resources to promote sustainability in the industry by creating standards for production processes that reduce carbon emissions through renewable energy use or by disposing of toxic wastes responsibly. The sustainability standards also protect natural environments with responsible management (or disposal) of non-recyclable materials. For more information, [visit SFC website](https://sustainablefurnishings.org/). It's a certification system developed to identify forest products (primarily timber) from well-managed forests. This internationally accepted and independent standard is an assurance that the forests where these products originate have met environmental, social, and economic standards of production. Forest Stewardship Council's goal is to balance the conservation of biodiversity while at the same time harvesting trees in a sustainable manner. The FSC also aims to protect the rights of workers and indigenous people living in or near those forests by reconciling conservation goals with their needs for land use and traditional resources or subsistence living, including hunting, fishing, and collecting firewood, etc. Buying an eco-friendly bed frame and bedroom furniture from an FSC-certified manufacturer helps boost sustainable forestry nationally and globally.

The company tests its finished furniture to ensure no potential contaminants are making their way into your home and helping you breathe easily without any lung problems, like asthma or dust-related allergies. Moreover, the material must undergo clinical trials to prove it's environmentally safe, too-meaning it doesn't release any persistent chemicals that could leak into your carpet or other household surfaces, finding their way into the soil and water. Read More: [Where to buy a nontoxic dresser?](https://greensnooze.com/best-non-toxic-dresser-reviews/) The best bed frame material is solid wood with a zero-VOC, water-based finish, or natural oil finish to minimize your exposure to harmful chemicals. Solid woods offer more stability for the frame and last much longer, minimizing squeaks from the joints and creating a nicer appearance. Plenty of options for different types of hardwoods offer their own benefits, such as durability in oak and poplar wood or attractiveness in cherry. Metal frames such as steel, aluminum, and wrought iron are durable and come in many styles for all budgets. Steel framed beds may be economical but they can be noisy due to creaking depending on the quality of their construction. They're not typically found at local home improvement stores so you'll need to order them from a metal bed supplier, such as Keetsa. Engineered wood, like MDF (medium-density fiberboard), plywood, or particle board should be avoided at all costs. The problem with these types of materials is that they are often more susceptible to dents, scratches, and warping in comparison to solid wood bed frames. In addition, MDF is the most toxic type of wood you can buy because it contains formaldehyde and toxic glues. These [substances in engineered wood furniture emit gases](https://greensnooze.com/how-long-does-new-furniture-off-gas/) as they cure which can have toxic effects on our respiratory system and contribute to respiratory problems after long periods of time exposure. This toxicity is especially problematic for children who crawl, jump or climb on them repeatedly, allowing the formaldehyde gas to enter their lungs more easily. Read More: [Wood vs Metal Bed Frames](https://greensnooze.com/metal-vs-wood-bed-frame/) Bed frames can be constructed with a variety of hardwoods, and it really depends on your preference. However, there are some high-quality woods that tend to be more resistant to the elements. Hardwoods like cherry, maple, oak, and walnut can be used for decades without showing any signs of wear or damage because they're made from strong wood that's naturally durable. Cherry tends to cost more than other types because it was traditionally used in furniture construction in Europe but is now grown all over the world due to its sustainability and quality when refined. Oak is also a good option if you want something reasonably priced while still being durable enough for everyday use. But with all that said, we don't recommend beds made of softwood, such as pine and cedar, especially if you've got children at home because this type of wood does not stand up well under increased weight or movement such as kids playing hopscotch around bedtime.
