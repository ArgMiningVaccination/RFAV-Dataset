Feel Your Best Inside and Out Naturopathic Medicine In Cle Elum & Ellensburg how does it work? Naturopathic medicine in Ellensburg and Cle Elum is a kind of primary care that focuses on preventing disease, promoting self-healing and focuses on the restoration of normal function using natural agents and medications when necessary. It is the foundation from which [Functional Medicine](https://swiftwatermedical.com/naturopathic-functional-medicine/) was birthed and the training a Naturopathic doctor receives goes well beyond what is taught in a Functional Medicine program. A naturopathic physician combines millennia of wisdom, the belief that nature is by far the most efficient healer, with modern medicine, clinical research, and the understanding that when the root of illness is found and properly addressed the body can be restored to health and normal function. Naturopathic diagnosis done by a naturopathic doctor (ND) is based on the combination of peer reviewed research from a variety of disciplines and the art of taking a thorough history. In our practice, we often use labs not offered to you by your regular MD to look deeper at your nutrient levels, digestive health, microbiome, whole system hormones, toxins, and individual genetics. We have Naturopathic Medicine in Ellensburg & Cle Elum. What is Functional Medicine, and how does it work? Functional Medicine takes a systems-oriented approach to assess and treat the underlying causes of illness, with both the patient and clinician working together. Functional Medicine treats the complete person, not just a collection of symptoms, by moving the conventional disease-centered emphasis of medical treatment to a more patient-oriented approach. Functional Medicine is based on seven main principles: - Science-based medicine links new research findings to clinical practice - Individuality in biochemistry due to genetic or environment differences - Treatment that focuses on the patient instead of the illness - Internal and external influences that impact overall performance and balance - Every facet of functioning is affected by web-like interactions among the body's physiological functions. - Health is defined as a state of vitality, not only the absence of illness. - Promotion of organ health to extend life expectancy. A functional medicine doctor will run a comprehensive assessment of your symptoms, history, and goals to figure out the optimal bio-individualized approach to not just heal but thrive.

Naturopathic diagnosis done by a naturopathic doctor (ND) is based on peer-reviewed journals from a variety of disciplines, including naturopathic medicine. In our practice, we often use labs not offered to you by your regular MD to look deeper at your nutrient levels, digestive health, microbiome, whole system hormones, toxins, and individual genetics. Clinical nutrition, herbal medicine, vitamin IV therapy, hydrotherapy and homeopathy are some of the treatment techniques utilized in naturopathic medicine. It combines traditional, scientific, and empirical approaches with natural laws. Naturopathic medicine's theory and treatments, which are rooted in Hippocrates's work and ancient and indigenous remedies from across the globe, originally emerged as a unique profession in Germany during the mid-1800s. Dr. Benedict Lust, MD, introduced naturopathy to America in 1896, founding the Yungborn Health Institute in New Jersey as the first naturopathic college. Naturopathic medicine has been practiced in the United States for more than a century. In fact, in the 1800s and early 1900s, Naturopathy was the mainstay of medicine in this country. This changed with the industrial revolution and the introduction of drugs and drug companies to our culture. The following are the foundational concepts of naturopathic medicine: - Nature's Healing Power: Naturopathic medicine understands that humans have an orderly and intelligent self-healing mechanism. Naturopathic doctors work to discover and eliminate barriers to the healing process, as well as to support and increase the body's natural healing abilities. - Determine and Treat the Root Causes: Rather than just eliminating or suppressing symptoms, a naturopathic physician attempts to discover and remove the underlying causes of sickness. - First Do No Harm: Naturopathic doctors follow three rules to prevent causing harm to their patients: - Use procedures and pharmaceutical substances that reduce the danger of adverse side effects while diagnosing and treating patients with the least amount of force possible. - If at all possible, avoid suppressing symptoms. - Recognize, appreciate, and cooperate with people's self-healing processes. - Doctor as Educator: Naturopathic doctors teach their patients and urge them to take charge of their own health. They also acknowledge and make use of the doctor-patient relationship's therapeutic potential, as well as, individual physical, genetic, emotional, mental, social, environmental, and other aspects are considered by naturopathic doctors while treating each patient. Naturopathic doctors urge people to seek their own spiritual and emotional growth since overall health includes spiritual and mental wellness. - Prevention: NDs target disease prevention by identifying risk factors, genetics, and disease susceptibility, as well as identifying nutrient deficiencies and replenishing them to avoid illness. Other ways NDs provide preventative care is by offering support through stressful periods of life to prevent endocrine collapse and burnout, and by optimizing digestion and nutrient absorption. Swiftwater Medical What led to the development of Functional Medicine? The Institute of Functional Medicine was founded in 1991 by Dr. Jeffery Bland and his wife. Dr. Bland is a qualified clinical laboratory director and a nutritional biochemist. He was a former professor in biochemistry at the Linus Pauling Institute of Science and University of Puget Sound and Medicine's Director of Nutritional Research. Dr. Jeffery was the very first member of the Board of Trustees of Bastyr institution, the first federally accredited institution in the United States that offers undergraduate and postgraduate degrees in natural medicine, and he played a key role in its establishment and accreditation. Before the creation of Functional Medicine, Dr. Bland was affiliated with Bastyr University, one of the authorized Naturopathic Medical Schools in Seattle, Washington. Many Naturopathic Doctors are employed by the Institute of Functional Medicine in roles such as educators, curriculum development, and even on the board of directors. What are the parallels? And what about the differences? As you can see, there are many similarities between functional and naturopathic medicine, including the use of evidence-based medicine, patient-centered treatment, a holistic approach, and addressing the cause rather than simply the symptoms. In the 21st century, the demand for holistic, patient-centered treatment has increased. This has prompted NDs, MDs, and DOs to pursue functional medicine courses in order to widen their scope of practice to include nutrition and natural remedies, as well as functional tests. All these topics are covered in certified naturopathic medical curricula. MDs, and DOs must get functional clinical training after graduation to study a more natural approach to medicine, while NDs learn it throughout their medical schooling.
