GUIDELINES BACKGROUND AND SUMMARY The Pancreatic Cancer Action Network's competitive Research Grants Program funds promising and meritorious research on pancreatic cancer. The organization's grantmaking strategy recognizes the need to maintain a pipeline of researchers at various stages in their careers dedicated to studying pancreatic cancer and acknowledges an urgency to accelerate scientific and medical breakthroughs that benefit patients. In addition to funding research, PanCAN is also leading large-scale research initiatives that will help transform the way pancreatic cancer is detected and treated. Many of these initiatives generate a wide range of patient health data including molecular, multi-omic, clinical, patient-reported, treatment and outcomes. Ensuring rapid access to these diverse data is another way that PanCAN helps accelerate discoveries that will ultimately improve pancreatic cancer patient outcomes. SPARK is a cloud-based data and analytics platform that integrates patient health data from PanCAN's research initiatives. Through SPARK and its connections with the NCI Cloud Resource (Seven Bridges Cancer Genomics Cloud [CGC] platform), qualified researchers can mine and analyze available patient health data to computationally tackle complex questions in pancreatic cancer. Currently, SPARK contains data from PanCAN's precision medicine service, Know Your Tumor\u00ae. With this service, pancreatic cancer patients are provided tumor tissue biomarker testing and genetic testing for inherited mutations. This real-world data (RWD) consists of a rich array of clinical, genomic, transcriptomic, molecular, and whole-slide pathology imaging data that will allow researchers to address many fundamental research questions in pancreatic cancer. The Pancreatic Cancer Action Network Cancer Informatics & Data Science Research Fellowship represents an effort to encourage and support doctoral and/or postdoctoral candidates to apply computational and data science approaches to available pancreatic cancer data to support important biological and/or clinical hypotheses in the field. The grants will provide funding over two years to a graduate student and/or postdoctoral fellow that will apply computational and/or data science methods to problems in pancreatic cancer research. The research proposed for funding should leverage PanCAN patient health data in the SPARK platform, and applicants are highly encouraged to submit proposals that also leverage the applicant's own relevant data as well as other publicly available pancreatic cancer data. The fundamental biological questions tackled must have direct applicability and relevance to pancreatic cancer. It is anticipated that two grants will be funded: one for a graduate student and one for a postdoctoral fellow. Grant recipients not only receive financial support for their funded research, but also join the Community for Progress built by PanCAN to achieve the goal of increasing survival and improving patient outcomes. Our mentorship program connects grantees with leading scientists in the field. Ongoing career support activities offer opportunities for education and professional development to help keep our community of researchers committed and involved. The Community for Progress is a growing, robust and collaborative research community that is dedicated to changing the course of history for pancreatic cancer. IMPORTANT DATES Applications are due March 15, 2023, by noon Eastern Standard Time. Funding decisions are anticipated by May 2023. Start of grant term is July 1, 2023. Grant recipients are expected to attend the PanCAN Annual Scientific Summit. The meeting location and dates are to be determined.PANCREATIC CANCER ACTION NETWORK\u2014CANCER INFORMATICS & DATA SCIENCE RESEARCH FELLOWSHIP 2APPLICANT ELIGIBILITY Applicants must be either currently enrolled in a doctoral program in the biomedical sciences or in a field applicable to health science research at a U.S. university (graduate students) or be recent PhD graduates (within the past 5 years) currently in a postdoctoral position at a U.S. university. At the start of the grant term on July 1, 2023, applicants must: Be currently enrolled in a PhD or MD/PhD program at a U.S. university (for graduate students) or be a recent PhD or MD graduate (within the past 5 years) and currently in a postdoctoral position at a U.S. university. Work at an academic, medical or research institution within the United States; there are no citizenship requirements. However, by submitting an application, an applicant who is not a U.S. citizen or permanent resident assures that their visa status will provide sufficient time to complete the project and grant term within the United States. For questions regarding eligibility, contact PanCAN's Research Grants Department at grants@pancan.org before submitting an application. BUDGET Stipend salary levels for predoctoral and postdoctoral fellows with 0-5 years of experience are as determined by the National Research Service Award (NRSA) stipend level released May 13, 2022. Institutional allowance for training-related expenses (e.g., administrative support, health insurance, and research supplies) for each trainee: Predoctoral\u2014$4,400 per year at non-federal, public and private, non-profit institutions and $3,300 per year for federal and for-profit institutions. Postdoctoral\u2014$11,950 per year at non-federal, public and private, non-profit institutions and $10,850 per year for federal and for-profit institutions. An additional $5,000/year is allowed for research-related costs, including computational costs, computer hardware or software, or attendance at a scientific conference. Indirect costs at a maximum of 10% of the total cost are permitted. PANCREATIC CANCER ACTION NETWORK\u2014CANCER INFORMATICS & DATA SCIENCE RESEARCH FELLOWSHIP 3RESEARCH PROJECT CRITERIA Computational and/or data science research projects must have direct applicability and relevance to pancreatic cancer. The research proposed for funding should include use of PanCAN patient health data in the SPARK platform, and applicants are encouraged to include other external pancreatic cancer data sources. Descriptions of the available clinical data in the SPARK platform can be found here and molecular data here. PanCAN SPARK is a cloud-based analytical framework that includes over 500 built-in pipelines and workflows for raw multi-omics data analysis as well as an interactive data studio with cloud-based Jupyter and RStudio implementations. In addition to the PanCAN patient health data stored in SPARK, grantees will also have access to all of the analytical capabilities of the platform. Grantees may also use external computational resources. Grantees are encouraged to work under the mentorship of an interdisciplinary team of computational scientists, cancer biologists and/or clinical oncologists to address questions in pancreatic cancer. EVALUATION OF APPLICATIONS PanCAN's Cancer Informatics & Data Science Research Fellowship will be awarded using a competitive, rigorous peer- review process. Applications will be evaluated by a Scientific Review Committee appointed by PanCAN's Research Grants Department. The Committee is composed of scientists that are respected for their accomplishments in computational biology, data science, and/or pancreatic cancer research and viewed as leaders in the field. The Committee will consider the following criteria when reviewing applications: Candidate Does the applicant have the appropriate training, experience, and/or oversight to ensure successful implementation of the proposed project? Significance Is there a strong scientific rationale for the proposed project? Is there sufficient background and preliminary data to support the significance of the proposed project? Is the proposed project of high quality, and what potential does it have to advance the field of pancreatic cancer research and/or benefit patients? Approach Are the overall strategy, design and methodology well-reasoned and appropriate to accomplish the specific aims of the project within the grant term? Have possible barriers been anticipated and are solutions and alternative strategies proposed? Do the proposed data sources utilized include PanCAN health data, suggest other complementary data sets, and are they appropriate for the proposed study? Are proposed expenses justified and reasonable in relation to the proposed project? Environment What evidence is provided of commitment for the scientific development of the applicant? Has the necessary infrastructure for the project been identified and is the environment appropriate and conducive to the success of the project? Has an opportunity for interdisciplinary training been identified?PANCREATIC CANCER ACTION NETWORK\u2014CANCER INFORMATICS & DATA SCIENCE RESEARCH FELLOWSHIP 4II.
