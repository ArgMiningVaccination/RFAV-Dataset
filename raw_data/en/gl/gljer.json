Morgan, MD, MPH,** Gilberto Moreno, MD, MPH, and Fe \u00b4lix Espinoza, MD, PhD Background: Although the pentavalent rotavirus vaccine was highly efcacious against rotavirus diarrhea in clinical trials, the effectiveness ofvaccine under eld conditions in the developing world is unclear. InOctober 2006, Nicaragua became the rst developing nation to implementuniversal infant immunization with the pentavalent rotavirus vaccine. Toassess the effect of the immunization program, we examined the incidenceof diarrhea episodes between 2003 and 2009 among children in the state ofLeo\u00b4n, Nicaragua. Methods: We extracted data on diarrhea episodes from health ministry records. We used scaled Poisson regression models to estimate diarrheaincidence rate ratios for the period following the program's implementationto the period before implementation.Results: Following implementation of the immunization program, diarrhea episodes among infants were reduced (incidence rate ratios: 0.85, 95%condence interval: 0.71-1.02) during the rotavirus season, but appear tohave increased during other months.Conclusions: Although the immunization program appears effective in reducing diarrhea episodes during the rotavirus season, a large burden ofdiarrhea still persists during the remainder of the year. Key Words: rotavirus, diarrhea, child, rotavirus vaccine, Nicaragua (Pediatr Infect Dis J 2011;30: 243-247) Diarrhea is among the leading infectious killers of children worldwide, second only to pneumonia in its contribution to child mortality. Rotavirus, the most important cause of diarrhea, isresponsible for an estimated 527,000 deaths 1and 138 million episodes of diarrhea2in the world each year. Although oral rehydration programs have been successful in reducing the mor- tality from diarrhea, the overall incidence of diarrhea has notdeclined since the 1950s.3The introduction of 2 rotavirus vaccines in 2006 offered new tools to prevent both diarrhea episodes and diarrhea-related deaths. In Nicaragua, rotavirus had been detected in 28% of chil- dren who received care for diarrhea.4As found elsewhere in the developing world, Nicaraguan children historically acquired their rst rotavirus infection at a young age; by 1 year, 90% haddeveloped symptomatic rotavirus diarrhea or had evidence ofseroconversion. 5The highest peak of rotavirus transmission in Central America occurs during the dry season (Quarter 1, January to March).6 In October 2006, Nicaragua became the rst nation eligible for funding by the GAVI Alliance to begin universal infantrotavirus immunization. Nicaraguan infants receive the pentava-lent rotavirus vaccine (Rotateq, Merck) through the national ex-panded program on immunization at the ages of 2, 4, and 6 months.The rotavirus vaccine was made available to all infants who wereborn on or after August 2006. Children born before this time werenot eligible to receive the vaccine. By the end of 2007, the localhealth ministry in Leo \u00b4n, Nicaragua, reported that the vaccine's coverage in the state was 98% for receipt of the rst dose, 93% forreceipt of the second dose, and 77% for receipt of all 3 doses. Thecoverage for the complete series in Leo \u00b4n's 10 municipalities ranged from 61% to 82%. Although the pentavalent rotavirus vaccine was shown to prevent 98% of severe rotavirus gastroenteritis in clinical trials,these trials occurred primarily in Europe and the United States. 7It is unclear whether the rotavirus vaccines will perform as well in the developing world, due to factors such as the distribution ofrotavirus genotypes, 8 -11the simultaneous use of the oral polio vaccine,12-14a higher prevalence of malnutrition15-17and breast- feeding,18 -21and possible inadequate vaccine storage conditions. The vaccine provided only 49% efcacy against severe rotavirus gastroenteritis in a recent clinical inMalawi, signicantly lower the vaccine's efcacy in upper-income countries. 22,23Similarly, a case-control study based in 4 Nicaraguan hospitals found the pentavalent rotavirus vaccine to be 58% effective against severe rotavirus diarrhea.24 To quantify the effect of the rotavirus immunization pro- gram in Nicaragua, we compared the incidence of all-cause diar-rhea and diarrhea-related mortality in children before and after theimmunization program using data collected by the local healthministry in the state of Leo \u00b4n, Sistemas Locales de Atencio \u00b4n Integral a la Salud (SILAIS). By examining the effect for severalyears after the introduction of the immunization program, wereduced the effect of possible annual variation of rotavirus trans-mission.

The climate is tropical with a dry seasonlasting from December to April. Health Facilities and Information Management The public health care system in Leo \u00b4n is organized into primary care (13 primary care centers and 93 health posts) andsecondary care (referral hospital in Leo \u00b4n municipality). All pri- mary care facilities provide outpatient care for diarrhea, primarilywith oral rehydration solution; the 13 primary care centers are ableto initiate intravenous hydration. Children requiring inpatient careare referred to the hospital. Beginning in 2008, Leo \u00b4n transitioned to sectorizacio \u00b4n, a model of health care where primary care providers are responsible for a geographic area. Providers visitfamilies in the area at least annually, and visit young children morefrequently. All health facilities in Nicaragua are under a government mandate to report all visits for acute diarrhea episodes and deathsdue to diarrhea to their local health ministry. Diarrhea was denedas/H113503 liquid or loose stools within a 24-hour period, with or without dehydration. Reports are made by \"health statisticians\" atthe primary care centers and hospital and by nurses at the smallerhealth posts. In Leo \u00b4n, the electronic reportable illnesses database is maintained at the SILAIS ofce, and includes information on thepatient's age, gender, municipality, and date of the visit to thehealth facility. SILAIS estimates that 5% of diarrhea visits are notreported because of limited reporting from private clinics. On thebasis of hospital records between 2008 and 2009, less than one-quarter of the total diarrhea visits among infants occurred in thehospital setting. The national census in Nicaragua is conducted every 10 years by the Nicaraguan Institute of Development Information(INIDE), including 1995 and 2005. Ofcial regional populationestimates are made by SILAIS for the years between the census;these estimates incorporate yearly population reports obtainedfrom each health sector, a unit of approximately 2000 individuals.According to these estimates, between 2005 and 2009, there was a1% increase in the total population in the state of Leo \u00b4n and a 16% decrease in the size of the under 5-year-old population. Thedecrease in the childhood population size in Leo \u00b4n is attributed to the dramatic decline in the fertility rate among Nicaraguan women, 25and the emigration of Nicaraguan families to neighbor - ing countries in search of economic opportunities.26 Age categories in the census and reportable illnesses data- base include \"under 12 months\" and \"12 to 59 months.\" Beginningin August 2007, all of the children in the \"under 12 months\" agecategory would have been eligible to receive the rotavirus vaccine.An increasing proportion of children in the \"12 to 59 month\" agecategory would have been eligible to receive the vaccine withincreasing time since the vaccine's introduction. Statistical Analyses The primary outcome examined was the incidence rate of diarrhea episodes among infants in the pre- and postvaccineperiods, because infants are the age group with the highest burdenof rotavirus diarrhea, and because older children were not eligibleto receive the vaccine when the program began. We rst extractedand plotted the numbers of diarrhea episodes per week fromSILAIS records between January 2003 and September 2009. Weanticipated that vaccine effects would be greatest during therotavirus season (Quarter 1, January to March) and dened quar-ters of interest (weeks: 1-13, 14 -26, 27-39, and 40 -52) beforedata analysis. We grouped the counts of diarrhea episodes byquarter for each year and municipality. The corresponding expo-sure time for the infants was estimated as the number of weeks for which records were available times the number of infants living inthe municipality during the year, based on annual SILAIS popu-lation estimates. We used scaled Poisson regression models to estimate incidence rates of diarrhea episodes and their corresponding 95%condence intervals (CI) by quarter. Scaled Poisson regressionanalysis was also used to estimate the incidence rate ratio (IRR)and 95% CI among infants for the period following implementa-tion to the period before implementation, controlling for munici-pality, and to examine possible interaction between vaccine periodand quarter. We excluded records for the period of October 16,2006 to August 15, 2007 in estimating the IRR, because theprogram was being rolled out during this time, and not all infantsin the \"under 12 months\" age category had the opportunity toreceive the vaccine. We planned to report estimates of the IRRsseparately for each quarter if we observed a signicant quarter byvaccine period effect at the alpha /H110050.10 level. Secondarily, we used the same approach to estimate the IRR for children aged 12to 59 months. We also extracted the numbers of diarrhea-related deaths among children between January 2003 and December 2009. Wecalculated the rate of diarrhea-related deaths and corresponding95% CIs for the prevaccine period (January 2003 to December2006) and the postvaccine period (January 2007 through Septem-ber 2009). Because of the anticipated small numbers of diarrhea-related deaths overall, we included all children under age 60months in the calculation of rates. RESULTS Diarrhea Episodes The numbers of diarrhea episodes by year and surveillance week for both infants and children are shown in Figure 1. In theperiod before the program's implementation (January 2003-Octo-ber 2006) there were 10,313 diarrhea episodes reported for chil-dren under 12 months in the state of Leo \u00b4n within a total of 38,857 infant years of exposure. In the postvaccine period (August 2007-September 2009) there were 5280 diarrhea episodes reported in thesame age group, with 17,734 total infant years of exposure. Usingyearly population estimates for each year of the study, the inci-dence rates by quarter ranged from 15.9 to 31.9 diarrhea episodesper 100 infant years before the immunization program. In theperiod following program implementation, the incidence ratesranged from 18.7 to 37.5 diarrhea episodes per 100 infant years(Table 1). Incidence rates by quarter for each individual year areshown in Figure 2. The IRRs for the periods after versus before the program's implementation (Table 1) varied signicantly by quarter ( P/H11005 0.001). In Quarter 1, there was a reduction in the incidence ratethat approached statistical signicance (IRR /H110050.85, 95% CI: 0.71-1.02). However, during Quarters 2 and 3, the incidence rateswere higher in the period following UIRI implementation (Table 1). Among the children aged 12 to 59 months, the incidence rates by quarter ranged from 6.2 to 11.7 diarrhea episodes per 100child-years before the immunization program and 7.4 to 16.4diarrhea episodes per 100 child-years after the program's imple-mentation. During Quarter 1, the incidence rate was unchanged inthe period after versus before the program's implementation (IRR /H11005 1.10, 95% CI: 0.90 -1.34). During the other quarters, the incidencerates were increased after implementation of the program (Quarter 2:IRR SILAIS population estimates showed a consid- erable decrease in the childhood population during the years of theBecker-Dreps et al The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal \u007f Volume 30, Number 3, March 2011 \u00a9 2011 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins 244 | www.pidj.comstudy, we performed a sensitivity analysis using the midpoint year population estimate (2006) for all study years. The IRRs amonginfants for the periods before versus following program implemen-tation again varied signicantly by quarter ( P/H110050.001). For Quarter 1, the reduction in the incidence rate among infants wasgreater (IRR /H110050.69, 95% CI: 0.58 - 0.83) than in our primary analysis. During the other quarters, there were no changes inincidence rates among infants in the period following versusbefore the program's implementation (Table, Supplemental DigitalContent 1, http://links.lww.com/INF/A605). Diarrhea-related Mortality Deaths from diarrhea for infants and children are shown in Table 2. There were no deaths among children aged 12 to 59months in the years following the implementation of the immuni-zation program. Overall, there were 1.03 diarrhea-related deathsper 10,000 CI: per 10,000child-years years following the immu-nization program's implementation. DISCUSSION In our primary analysis, we found a 15% decrease in all-cause diarrhea incidence among infants during the rotavirusseasons following the implementation of the immunization pro-gram. During the remainder of the year, we found an unexpectedincrease in the diarrhea incidence after implementation of theimmunization program. Because population estimates showed adecrease in the childhood population over the years of the study,we performed a sensitivity analysis applying the 2006 population estimates for all years of the study. This analysis revealed a moredramatic decrease in diarrhea incidence of 31% during the rotavi-rus seasons following the immunization program, with no changesduring the remainder of the year. These estimates correspond wellto the rotavirus prevalence of 28% among Nicaraguan childrenwith diarrhea before the immunization program, 4and an analysis during the rst rotavirus season after the immunization program was implemented, showing a 23% decrease in all-cause diarrheaepisodes among infants. 27As the majority of diarrhea visits oc - curred to primary care facilities, the moderate reduction mayreflect the lower prevalence of rotavirus infection among mildercases of diarrhea as compared with more severe cases requiring ahospital visit. Childhood deaths because of diarrhea trended downward in the years following the immunization program from a rate of 1.03per 10,000 child-years to 0.82 per 10,000 child-years; however,because of the small numbers of deaths overall, we were unable toperform a rigorous analysis of the effect of the immunizationprogram on diarrhea-related deaths. Interestingly, there were noreported diarrhea-related deaths among children ages 12 to 59months in the years following implementation of the immunizationprogram, despite the fact that a large proportion of children in thisage category were not eligible to receive the vaccine when theprogram was implemented. This nding suggests either a directeffect of the vaccine among children over age 12 months in thesecond and third years of the immunization program or indirecteffects of the vaccine in preventing rotavirus-related deaths amongunimmunized children. Although our results show a reduction in diarrhea incidence during the rotavirus seasons following the implementation of theimmunization program, we did not anticipate a possible increase indiarrhea incidence during the remainder of the year. As we couldnot identify a biologically plausible explanation for an increase indiarrhea episodes, we believe that the changes in the postvaccineperiod may be because of an increase in reporting of diarrheaepisodes. We identied several factors that may be contributing toa change in the reporting of diarrhea episodes during the postvac-cine period as compared with the prevaccine period, which maybias against the benet of the vaccine: (1) a health worker strikeduring late 2005 and early 2006 may have resulted in a decrease inreporting during these months in the prevaccine period, (2) in-creasing cell phone use in recent years has facilitated collection ofepidemiological data, with less missing reports, (3) sectorizacio \u00b4n, or placing primary care providers in the community outside of250300350400asesage1-5 age<1 median* 50100150200250Number of ca 050 1 5 35 25 25 25 25 2 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 20 09 FIGURE 1.

Establishing an active surveillancesystem for diarrhea episodes and diarrhea-related deaths in theyears before the implementation of the immunization program andensuring a consistent method of reporting during the yearsfollowing the immunization program would have been one wayto avoid possible changes in reporting. However, providingactive surveillance at 107 health facilities over a 7-year periodwould have required overcoming multiple logistical challengesand great expense. A potential limitation of the study is our denition of the rotavirus season as the rst quarter of the year, based on regionalseasonality data. 6We acknowledge that the timing of the rotavirus season cannot be precisely determined from the available data and may vary from year to year. In conclusion, in the years following the introduction of a universal rotavirus immunization program, there was a reductionin all-cause diarrhea incidence during the rotavirus seasons. Thepersistent burden of diarrhea during the remainder of the yeardraws attention to other diarrhea etiologies in the postvaccineperiod, such as Shigella spp, and enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli. 28Hygiene, water, and sanitation programs29or the develop - ment of other enteric vaccines should be pursued in addition torotavirus immunization programs to reduce childhood diarrheayear-round.
