Such identification is not intended to imply recommendation or endorsement by the National Institute of Standards and Technology, nor is it intended to imply that the entities, material s, or equipment are necessarily the best available for the purpose. National Institute of Standards and Technology Handbook 133, 2019 Edition Natl. Inst. Stand. Technol. Handb. 133, 2019 Ed. 256 Pages (Nov. 2018) CODEN: NIHAE2 Handbook 133 - 2019 Foreword iii Foreword This handbook has been prepared as a procedural guide for the compliance testing of net content statements on packaged goods. Compliance testing of packaged goods is the determination of the conformance of the - results of the packaging, distribution, and retailing process (the packages) to specific legal requirements for net content declarations. This handbook has been developed primarily for the use of government officials. However, it should also be useful to commercial and industrial establi shments in the areas of packaging, distribution, and sale of commodities. In conducting compliance testing, the conversion of quantity values from one measurement system to another (e.g., from the metric system to the avoirdupois system) should be handled with careful regard to the implied correspondence between the accuracy of the data and the number of digits displayed. In all conversions, the number of significant digits retained should ensure that accuracy is neither sacrificed nor exaggerated. For th is 2019 edition of Handbook 133 all dimensions for test procedures, devices, or environments have been rounded to two significant digits (e.g., 2.5 cm to 1.0 in) or to a precision level applicable t o the test equipment (e.g., 200 kPa for 25 psi and 35 MPa for 5,000 psi).

Source. The information and procedures in this handbook comprise all of those adopted by the National Conference on Weights and Measures, Inc. (NCWM) www.ncwm.net . Contact NCWM is supported by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), which prov ides its Executive Secretary and publishes its documents. NIST also develops technical publications for use by weights and measures agencies; these publications may subsequently be endorsed or adopted by the NCWM or its members. This handbook is recommended by NCWM for adoption by states when reviewing or amending their official laws and regulations on testing the net contents of packaged goods. A similar recommendation is made with regard to the local jurisdictions within a state in the absence of the pr omulgation of such laws and regulations at the state level. B. Purpose. This handbook has been prepared as a procedural guide for the compliance testing of net content statements on packaged goods. Compliance testing of packaged goods is the determination of the conformance of the results of the packaging, distribution, and retailing process (the packages) to specific legal requirements for net content declarations. This handbook has been developed primarily for the use of government officials. However, com mercial and industrial establishments packaging, distributing, and selling commodities will find this handbook useful. In conducting compliance testing, the conversion of quantity values from one measurement system to another (e.g., from the metric system to the U.S. customary system) should be handled with careful regard to the implied correspondence between the accuracy of the data and the number of digits displayed. In all conversions, the number of significant digits retained should ensure that accuracy is neither sacrificed nor exaggerated. For this 2017 edition of NIST Handbook 133, \"Checking the Net Content of Packaged Goods\" all dimensions for test procedures, devices, or environments have been rounded to two significant digits (e.g., 2.5 cm to 1.0 in) or to a precision level applicable to the test equipment (e.g., 200 kPa for 25 psi and 35 MPa for 5000 psi). C. Amendments Amend ments to NIST Handbook 133 are deliberated and developed by NCWM's Committee on Laws and Regulations before presentation to the general membership for a vote. In some instances , amendments that significantly affect other NIST Handbooks may be processed jo intly by two or more committees. Amendments to the handbooks are made in accordance with NCWM procedures and policies. The process begins at the regional weights and measures association meetings in the fall of each year and is culminated at the NCWM Annu al Meeting in July. After passing through one or more of the regional associations , the proposed amendment is placed on the agenda of the appropriate NCWM committee for consideration at the NCWM's Interim Meeting in January. A fter final deliberation and development by the committee , the _____________________________________________________________________________________________________ This publication is available free of charge from: https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.HB.133-2019Introduction Handbook 133 - 2019 2 amendment may be presented to the membership for a vote at the NCWM A nnual M eeting in July. The NCWM policy provides for exceptions to the process to accommodate urgent or priority items. NIST staff provides technical as sistance and advice throughout the process. The policy is available on the NCWM website at www. ncwm.net . For information on the regional weights and measures associations, visit www.ncwm.net/meetings/regions . D. Revisions to the Handbo ok NIST publishes a new edition of this handbook after significant changes are made. If NIST determines that amendments made by NCWM were minor or editorial in nature an annual publication will not be published. Instead, NIST will issue a notice that the current edition is still valid and will publish a list of the changes on the NIST website. E. Annotation Beginning in 1971, amendments or additions to sections in the handbook are annotated at the end of each section (e.g., \" Amended 1982\") as a service to those states that are planning to update their own laws or regulations. The references to each revision and the year will enable government officials and industry members to trace the rationale for the changes by referring to the \"Report of the X XX National Conference on Weights and Measures (also known as the NCWM Annual Report ) for the year indicated and make decisions regarding adoptions and amendments to their laws and regulations. F. Effective Enforcement Dates of Regulations Unless otherwise specified, new or amended sections are intended to become effective and subject to enforcement on January 1 of the year following adoption by NCWM. G. Section References In most references made to specific sections or subsections in this handbook, the word \"Section\" followed by the section number is used. H. The International System of Units The \"International System of Units,\" \"SI,\" or \"SI Units\" means the modernized metric system as established in 1960 by the General Conference on Weights and Measures (GIPM). In 1988, Congress amended the Metric Conversion Act of 1975 (see Section 5164 of Public Law 100- 418) to declare that it is the policy of the United States to designate the metric system of measurement as the preferred measurement system for U.S. trade and commerce, and it further defined \"the metric system of measurement\" to be the International System as established by the GIPM and as interpreted or modified for the United States by the Secretary of Commerce. (See Metric Conversion Law 15 U.S.C. 205; NIST Special Publication (SP) 330 , \"The International stem of Units (SI) ; NIST SP 814, \"Guide for the Use of the International System of Units (SI); Interpretation of the International System of Units [the Metric System of Measurement] for the United States in the \" Federal Register \" of May 16, 2008, [ \"Federal Register\" Vol. 73, No. 96] or subsequent revisions) . In 1992, Congress amended the Federal Fair Packaging and Labeling Act (FPLA) to require certain consumer commodities to include the appropriate SI units along with the customary inch-pound units in their quantity statements. _____________________________________________________________________________________________________ This publication is available free of charge from: https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.HB.133-2019Handbook 133 - 2019 Introduction 3 I. \"Mass\" and \"Weight.\" [NOTE 1 , page 3] The mass of an object is a measure of the object's inertial property or the amount of matter it contains. The weight of an object is a measure of the force exerted on the object by gravity or the force needed to support it. The pull of gravity on the earth gives an object a downward acceleration of about 9.8 m/s2. In trade and commerce and everyday use, the term \"weight\" is often used as a synonym for \"mass.\" The \"net mass\" or \"net weight\" declared on a label indicates that the package contains a specific amount of commodity exclusive of wrapping materials. The use of the term \"mass\" is p redominant throughout the world and is becoming increasingly common in the United States. J. Use of the Terms \"Mass\" and \"Weight.\" [NOTE 1 , page 3] When used in this handbook, the term \"weight\" means \"mass.\" The term \"weight\" appears when U.S. customary units are cited or w hen both inch- pound and SI units are included in a requirement. The terms \"mass\" or \"masses\" are used when only SI units are cited in a requirement. The following note appears where the term \"weight\" is first used in a law or regulation. NOTE 1: When used in this law (or regulation), the term \"weight\" means \"mass.\" (See paragraphs I. \"Mass\" and Weight and J. Use of the Terms \"Mass\" and \"Weight\" in the Introduction section of NIST Handbook 133 for an explanation of these terms.) (Introduction added 2015) _____________________________________________________________________________________________________ This publication is available free of charge from: https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.HB.133-2019Introduction Handbook 133 - 2019 4 THIS PAGE INTENTIONALLY LEFT BLANK _____________________________________________________________________________________________________ This publication is available free of charge from: https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.HB.133-2019Handbook 133 - 2019 Chapter 1. General Information 5 Chapter 1. General Information 1.1. Scope The procedures in this handbook are recommended for use to verify the net quantity of contents of packages kept, offered, or exposed for sale, or sold by weight, measure (including volume, and dimensions), or count at any location (e.g., at the point-of- pack, in storage warehouses, retail stores, and wholesale outlets). 1.1.1. When and Where to U se Package C hecking Procedures An effective program will typically include testing at each of the following levels. Testing packages at the \"point-of- pack\" has an immediate impact on the packaging process. Usually, a large number of packages of a single product are available for testing at one place. This allows the insp ector to verify that the packer is following current good packaging practices. Inspection at the point -of-pack also provides the opportunity to educate the packer about the legal requirements that products must meet , and may permit resolution of any net c ontent issues or other problems that arise during the testing. Point -of-pack testing is not always possible because packing locations can be in other states or countries. Work with other state, county, and city jurisdictions to encourage point -of-pack inspection on products manufactured in their geographic jurisdictions. Point-of- pack inspections cannot entirely replace testing at wholesale or retail outlets, because this type of inspection do es not include imported products or the possible effects of product distribution and moisture loss. Point -of-pack inspections only examine the manufacturing process. Therefore, an effective testing program will also include testing at wholesale and retail outlets. Testing packages at a distribution warehouse is an alternative to testing at the point-of- pack with respect to being able to test large quantities of , and a variety of products. Wholesale testing is a very good way to monitor products imported from other countries and to follow up on products suspected of being under filled or underweight based on consumer complaints or findings made during other inspections, including those done at retail outlets. Testing packages at retail outlets evaluates the soundness of the manufacturing, distributing, and retailing processes of the widest variet y of goods at a single location. It is acceptable and practical for weights and measures jurisdictions to monitor packaging procedures and to detect present or potential problems. Generally, retail package testing is not conducive to checking large quant ities of individual products of any single production lot. Therefore, follow -up inspections of a particular brand or lot code number at a number of retail and wholesale outlets, and ultimately at the point - of-pack are extremely important aspects in any package -checking scheme. After the evaluation of an inspection lot is completed, the jurisdiction should consider what, if any, further investigation or follow -up is warranted. At the point -of-sale, a large number of processes may affect the quality or quantity of the product. Therefore, there may be many reasons for any inspection lot being out of compliance. A shortage in weight or measure may result from mishandling the product in the _____________________________________________________________________________________________________ This publication is available free of charge from: https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.HB.133-2019Chapter 1. General Information Handbook 133 - 2019 6 store or the retailer's failure to rotate stock. Shortages may also be caused through mishandling by a distributor or failure of some part of the packaging process. Shortages may also be caused by moisture loss (desiccation) if the product is packaged in permeable media. Therefore, being able to de termine the cause of an error in order to correct defects is more difficult when retail testing is used. (Amended 2010) 1.1.2. Selecting a P roduct f or Testing Any commodity sold by weight, measure, or count may be tested. The product to be tested may be chosen in several ways. The decision may be based on different factors, such as (1) marketplace surveys (e.g., jurisdiction -wide surveys of all soft drinks or breads), (2) surveys based on sales volume, or (3) audit testing (see Section 1.3. \"Sampling Plans \") to cover as large a product variety as possible at food, farm, drug, hardware stores, or specialty outlets, discount and department stores. Follow -up of possible problems detected in audit testing or in review of past performance tends to concentrate inspection resources on particular commodity types, brand names, retail or wholesale locations, or even particular neighborhoods. The expected benefits for the public must be balanced against the cost of testing. Expensive products should be tested because of their cost per unit. However, inexpensive items should also be tested because the overall cost to individual purchasers may be considerable over an extended period of time . Store packaged items, which are usually perishable and not subject to other official monitoring, should be routinely tested because they are offered for sale where they are packed. Products on sale and special products produced for local consumption should not be overlooked because these items sell quickly in large amounts. Regardless of where the test occurs, remember that it is the inspector's presence in the marketplace through routine unannounced testing that ensures equity and fair competition in the manufacturing and distribution process. Finally, always follow -up on testing to ensure that the problems are corrected; otherwise, the initial testing may be ineffective. 1.2. Package R equirements The net quantity of content statement must be \"accurate,\" but reasonable variations are permitted. Variations in package contents may be a result of deviations in filling. The limits for acceptable variation s are based on current good manufacturing practices in the weighing, measuring, and packaging process. The first requirement is that accuracy is applied to the average net contents of the packages in the lot. The second requirement is applied to negative errors in individual packages. These requirements apply simultaneously to the inspection of all lo ts of packages except as specified in Section 1.2.5. \"Exceptions to the Average and Individual Package Requirements .\" Inspection Lot An \"inspection lot\" (called a \"lot\" in this handbook) is defined as a collection of identically labeled (except for quantity or identity in the case of random packages) packages available for inspection at one time. The inspection lot will pass or fail as a whole based on the results of tests on a sample drawn from the lot in accordance with Section 1.3. \"Sampling Plans\" and Section 2.3.4. \"Random Sample Selection.\" This handbook describes procedures to determine if the packages in an \"inspection lot\" _____________________________________________________________________________________________________ This publication is available free of charge from: https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.HB.133-2019Handbook 133 - 2019 Chapter 1. General Information 7 contain the declared net quantity of contents and if the individual packages' variations are within acceptable limits. (Amended 2017) Average R equirement In general, the average net quantity of contents of packages in a lot must at least equal the net quantity of contents declared on the label. Plus or minus variations from the declared net weight, measure, or count are permitted when they are caused by unavoidable variations in weighing, measuring, or counting the contents of individual packages that occur in current good manufacturing practice. Such variations must not be permitted to the extent that the average of the quantities in the packages of a particular commodity or a lot of the commodity that is kept, offered, exposed for sale, or sold, is below the stated quantity. (See Section 3.6. \"Pressed and Blown Glass Tumblers and Stemware\" and Section 4.2.1. \"Packages Labeled wit h 50 Items or F ewer\" for exceptions to this requirement.) (Refer to Section 1.4.1. Net Quantity of Contents Requirements for Pesticides Labeled with Minimum Net Quantity of Contents Declarations. ) (Amended 2018) Individual Package R equir ement The variation of individual package contents from the labeled quantity must not be \"unreasonably large.\" In this handbook, packages that are under filled by more than the Maximum Allowable Variation (MAV) specified for the package are considered unreasonable errors. Unreasonable shortages are not generally permitted, even when overages in other packages in the same lot, shipment, or delivery compensate for such shortage. This handbook does not specify limits of overfilling ( with the exception of textiles), which is usually controlled by the packer for economic, compliance, and other reasons. (Amended 2010) Maximum A llowa ble Variation The limit of the \"reasonable minus variation \" for an under filled package is called a \"Maximum Allowable Variation \" (MAV). An MAV is a deviation from the labeled weight, measure, or count of an individual package beyond which the deficiency is considered an unreasonable minus error . Each sampling plan limits the number of negative package errors permitted to be greater than the MAV. (Amended 2010) Exceptions to the Average and I ndividual Package R equirements There is an exemption from the average requirement for packages labeled by count with 50 items or fewer. The reason for this exemption is that the package count does not follow a \"normal\" distribution even if the package is designed to hold the maximum count indicated by the label declaration (e.g., egg cartons and packages of chewing gum). Another exception permits an \"allowable difference\" in the capacity of glass tumblers and stemware because mold capacity doesn't follow a normal distribution. Deviations C aused by M oisture Loss or G ain Deviations from the net quantity of contents caused by the loss or gain of moisture from the package are permitted when they are caused by ordinary and customary exposure to conditions that normally occur in good distribution practice and that unavoidably result in change of weight or measure. According to _____________________________________________________________________________________________________ This publication is available free of charge from: https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.HB.133-2019Chapter 1. General Information Handbook 133 - 2019 8 regulations adopted by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, no moisture loss is recognized on pesticides. (See Code of Federal Regulations 40 CFR 156.10.) 1.2.6.1. Applying a M oisture A llowance Some packaged products may lose or gain moisture and, therefore, lose or gain weight or volume after packaging. The amount of moisture loss depends upon the nature of the product, the packaging material, the length of time it is in distribution, environmental conditions, and other factors. Moisture loss may occur even when manufacturers follow good distribution practices. Loss of weight \"due to exposure\" may include solvent evaporation, not just loss of water. For loss or gain of moisture , the moisture allowances may be applied before or after the package errors are determined. To apply an allowance before determining package errors, adjust the Nominal G ross Weight (see Section 2.3.6. \" Determine Nominal Gross Weight and Package Errors \"), so the package errors are increased by an amount equal to the moisture allowance. This approach is used to account for moisture loss in both the average and individual package errors. It is also permissible to apply the moisture allowances after individual package errors and average errors are determined. Example: A sample of a product that could be subject to moisture loss might fail because the average error is minus or the error in several of the sample packages are found to be unreasonable errors (i.e., the package error is greater than the Maximum Allowable Variation (MAV) permitted for the package's labeled quantity). You may apply a moisture allowance after determining the package errors by adding the allowance to the Sample Error Limit ( SEL) and then, comparing the average error to the SEL to determine compliance. T he moisture allowance must be added to the MAV before evaluating sample errors to identify unreasonable minus errors . (Amended 2010) This handbook provides \"moisture allowances\" for some meat and poultry products, flour , pasta, and dry pet food. (See Chapter 2, Tabl e 2-3. \"Moisture Allowances\") These allowances are based on the premise that when the average net weight of a sample is found to be less than the labeled weight, but not by an amount that exceeds the allowable limit, either the lot is declared to be within the moisture allowance or more inf ormation must be collected before deciding lot compliance or noncompliance. Test procedures for flour, some meat, and poultry are based on the concept of a \"moisture allowance\" also known as a \"gray area\" or area (see Section 2.3.8. \" Moisture Allowances\") . When the average net weight of a sample is found to be less than the labeled weight, but not more than the boundary of the \"gray area,\" the lot is said to be in the \"gray\" or \"no decision \" area. The gray area is not a tolerance. More info rmation must be collected before lot compliance or noncompliance can be decided. Appropriate enforcement should be taken on packages found short weight and outside of the \"moisture allowance\" or \"gray area.\" (Amended 2002) _____________________________________________________________________________________________________ This publication is available free of charge from: https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.HB.133-2019Handbook 133 - 2019 Chapter 1. General Information 9 1.3. Sampling Plans This handbook contains two sampling plans use d to inspect packages: \" Category A\" and \" Category B.\" Use the \"Category B\" Sampling Plans to test meat and poultry products at point -of-pack locations that are subject to U.S. Department of Agriculture Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) requirements. When testing all other packages, use the \"Category A\" Sampling Plan. Inspections by we ights and measures officials must provide the public with the greatest benefit at the lowest possible cost. Sampling reduces the time to inspect a lot of packages, so a greater number of items can be inspected. Net content inspection, using sampling plan s for marketplace surveillance, protects consumers who cannot verify the net quantity of contents of the package they purchase. This ensures fair trade practices and maintains a competitive marketplace. It also encourages manufacturers, distributors, and retailers to follow good manufacturing and distribution practices. Testing a \"sample\" of packages from a lot instead of every package is efficient, but the test results have a \"sampling variability\" that must be corrected before determining if the lot passes or fails. The \"Category A\" sampling plans give acceptable lots a 97.5 % probability of passing. An \"acceptable\" lot is defined as one in which the \"average\" net quantity of contents of the packages equals or exceeds the labeled quantity. The \"Catego ry B\" sampling plans give acceptable lots at least a 50 % probability of passing. The sampling plans used in this handbook are statistically valid. That means the test acceptance criteria are statistically adjusted, so they are both valid and legally def ensible. This handbook does not discuss the statistical basis, risk factors, or provide the operating characteristic curves for the sampling plans. For information on these subjects, see explanations on \"acceptance sampling\" in statistical reference books. A randomly selected sample is necessary to ensure statistical validity and reliable data. This is accomplished by using random numbers to determine which packages are chosen for inspection. Improper collection of sample packages can lead to bias and unreliable results. Audit T ests Audits may be used to speed the process of detecting possible net content violations. These audit procedures may include: using smaller sample sizes; using tare lists provided by manufacturers to spot check; or selecting samples without collecting a random sample. These audit procedures allow spot checking of more products than is possible with the more structured techniques, but do not take the place of \"Category A\" or \"Category B\" testing. Do not take enforcement action using audit test results. If, after an audit test, there is suspi cion that the package lot is not in compliance, use the appropriate \"Category A\" or \"Category B\" sampling plan to determine if the lot complies with the package requirements. 1.4. Other Regulatory A gencies Responsible for Package R egulations and A pplicable Requirements In the United States, several federal agencies issue regulations regarding package labeling and net contents. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) regulates meat and poultry. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulates food, drugs, cosmetic products, tobacco, and medical devices under the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA) and the Fair Packaging and Labeling Act (FPLA). The Federal Trade Commission _____________________________________________________________________________________________________ This publication is available free of charge from: https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.HB.133-2019Chapter 1. General Information Handbook 133 - 2019 10 (FTC) regulates most non -food consumer packaged products as part of the agency's responsibility under the FPLA. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulates pesticides. The Bureau of Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB) in the U.S. Department of the Treasury promulgat es regulations for beer, wine, and distilled spirits as part of its responsibility under the Federal Alcohol Administration Act. Packaged goods produced for distribution and sale also come under the jurisdiction of state and local weights and measures agencies that adopt their own legal requirements for packaged goods. Federal statutes set requirements that pre -empt state and local regulations that are or may be less stringent or not identical to federal regulation depending on the federal law that authorizes the federal regulation. The application of Handbook 133 procedures occurs in the context of the concurrent jurisdiction amon g federal, state, and local authorities. Therefore, all agencies using this handbook should keep abreast of the revisions to federal agency regulations that may contain sampling or testing information not in the regulations at the time of publication of this handbook. ( See Appendix A, Table 1-1. \"Agencies Responsible for Package Regulations and Applicable Requirements\" for information on the responsible agencies for package regulations. T he requirements of this handbook must be used when testing products concurrently subject to federal regulations.) Net Quantity of Contents Requirements for Pesticides Labeled with Minimum Net Quantity of Contents Declarations The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) permits packers of pesticides the option of declaring the net quantity of contents using either the average or the minimum package fill systems. If the manufacturer uses the minimum system, the term \"minimum\" must appear adjacent to the quantity declaration. If the packer uses the average system, the proced ures in Section 2.3.7. \"Evaluate for Compliance\" are used to determine compliance. Use the procedures in Section 2.3. \"Basic Test Procedure for Gravimetric Testing of Net Weight\" to select and test a sample and use the following compliance procedure to de termine if the sample passes or fails the minimum package fill requirements. Compliance Requirements for Packaged Pesticides (e.g., antimicrobial wipes, insect repellent wipes, towelettes, liquid or dry products) 1. The net weight or measure of quantity shall be exclusive of wrappers or other materials and shall be the average quantity unless there is an explicit statement on the Principal Display Panel (PDP) in conjunction with the quantity declaration that the package was filled under the minimum system o f fill [e.g., minimum weight 500 g (1 lb 1 oz).] 2. A Maximum Allowable Variation (MAV) is not applied. 3. Variation above minimum content is permissible only to the extent that it represents deviation unavoidable in good manufacturing practice. 4. Variation belo w the declared minimum quantity is NOT permitted. 5. Compliance Procedure and Requirements : a. After the samples are tested , the individual package errors are determined. The average error is not calculated. b. Review the individual package errors: If a minus package error is found , the sample fails. _____________________________________________________________________________________________________ This publication is available free of charge from: https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.HB.133-2019Handbook 133 - 2019 Chapter 1. General Information 11 If no minus package errors are found, the sample passes (e.g., the errors are 0 or plus) (Added 2018) 1.5. Assistance in T esting O perations If the storage, display, or location of any lot of packages requires special equipment or an abnormal amount of labor for inspection, the owner or the operator of the business must supply the equipment and/or labor as required by the weights and measures official. 1.6. Health and S afety This handbook cannot address all of the health and safety issues associated with its use. The inspector is responsible for determining the appropriate safety and health practices and procedures before starting an inspection (e.g., contact the establishment's health and safety official). Comply with all handling, health, and safety warnings on package labels and those contained in any associated Safety Data Sheets (SDS) . The inspector must also com ply with federal, state, and local health and safety laws , and other appropriate requirements in effect at the time and location of the inspection. Contact your supervisor to obtain information regarding your agenc y's health and safety policies and to obtain appropriate safety equipment. 1.7. Good M easurement Practices The procedures in this handbook are designed to be technically sound and represent good measurement practices. To assist in documenting tests, we have included \"model\" inspection report forms designed to record the information. Traceability R equirements for M easurement S tandards and T est E quipment Each test procedure presented in this handbook includes a list of the equipment needed to perform the inspection. The scales and other measurement standards used (e.g., balances, mass standards, volumetric, and linear measures) to conduct any test must be traceable to the International System of Units (SI) , usually through the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). Standards must be used in the manner for which they were designed and calibrated . Certification R equirements for S tandards and Test Equipment All measurement standards and test equipment identified in this handbook or associated with the test procedures must be calibrated or standardized before initial use. This must be done according to the calibration procedures and other instructions found on NIST's Laboratory Metrology and Calibration Procedures website at www.n ist.gov/pml/weights- and-measures/laboratory -metrology/calibration- procedures or using other recognized procedures (e.g., those adopted for use by a state weights and measures laboratory). After initial certification, the standards must be routinely recert ified according to your agency's measurement assurance policies. _____________________________________________________________________________________________________ This publication is available free of charge from: https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.HB.133-2019Chapter 1.

Test Procedures for Packages Labeled by Weight - Gravimetric Testing 13 Chapter 2. Test Procedure s for Packages Labeled by Weight - Gravimetric Testing 2.1. Scope The gravimetric test method uses weight measurement to determine the net quantity of contents of packaged goods. This chapter includes general test methods to determine the net quantity of contents of packages labeled in terms of weight . Gravimetric testing is the preferred method of testing most products because it reduces destructive testing and improves measurement accuracy . 2.2. Measurement Standards and Test Equipment Scale R equir ements Use a scale (for this handbook the term \" scale\" includes balances) that has at least 100 scale divisions. It must have a load -receiving element of sufficient size and capacity to hold the packages during weig hing. It also requires a scale division no larger than 1/6 of the Maximum Allowable Variation (MAV) for the package size being weighed. The MAV/6 requirement ensures that the scale has adequate resolution to determine the net contents of the packages. Subsequent references to product test results requiring the agreement to within one scale division are based on scale divisions that are equal to or only slightly smaller than the MAV/6. (See Appendix A, Table 2-5. \"Maximum Allowable Variations (MAVs) for Packages Labeled by Weight.\" ) Example : The MAV for packages labeled with a net weight 113 g (0.25 lb) is 7.2 g (0.016 lb). Divide ( \u00f7) the MAV by 6 to obtain the maximum scale division that can be used to determine the gross, tare and net weights for a package size. 7.2 g (0.016) \u00f7 6 = 1.2 g (0.002 lb ) In this example, a 1 g (0.002 lb) scale division would be the maximum scale division appropriate for weighing these packages. (Amended 2010) Scale A ccuracy Verify the accuracy of a scale before each initial daily use, each use at a new location, or when there is any indication of abnormal equipment performance (e.g., erratic indications). Recheck the scale accuracy if it is found that the sample does not pass, so there can be confidence that the test equipment is not at fault. Scales used to check packages must meet the acceptance tolerances specified for their accuracy class in the current edition of NIST Handbook 44 (HB 44) \"Specifications, Tolerances, and Other Technical Requirements for Weighing and Measuring Devices. \" The tolerances for Class II and Class III scales are presented in NIST HB 44, Section 2.20. Scales, \" T.N. Tolerances Applicable to Devices Marked I, II, III, III L, and IIII.\" _____________________________________________________________________________________________________ This publication is available free of charge from: https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.HB.133-2019Chapter 2. Test Procedures - Packages Labeled by Weight - Gravimetric Testing Handbook 133 - 2019 14 Note: If the package checking scale is not marked with a \"class\" designation, use T able 2-1. \"Class of Scale\" to determine the applicable tolerance. Always use good weighing and measuring practices . For example, be sure to use weighing and measuring equipment according to the manufacturer's instructions and make sure the environment is suitable. Place scales and other measuring equipment (e.g., flasks and volumetric measures) on a rigid support and maintain them in a level condition if being level is required to ensure accuracy. Scale T olerance Follow this procedure to determine the scale tolerance : 1. Determine the total number of divisions (i.e., the minimum increment or graduation indicated by the scale) of the scale by dividing the scale's ca pacity by the minimum division. Example: A scale with a capacity of 5000 g and a minimum division of 0.1 g has 50 000 divisions. 5000 \u00f7 0.1 g = 50 000 division 2. From Table 2-1. \"Class of Scale\", determine the class of the scale using the minimum scale division and the maximum number of scale divisions. Example: On a scale with a minimum division of 0.1 g and 50 000 total scale divisions the appropriate class is \"II.\" Note: If a scale is used where the number of scale divisions is between 5001 and 10 000 and the division size is 0.1 g or greater and is not marked with an accuracy Class II marking, Class III scale tolerances apply. 3. Determine the number of divisions for any test load by dividing the value of the mass standard being applied by the minimum division indicated by the scale . 4. Determine the tolerance from Table 2-2. \"Acceptance Tolerances for Class of Scale Based on Test Load in Divisions\" in divisions appropriate for the test load and class of scale Example: If the scale has a minimum division of 0.1 g and a 1500 g mass standard is applied, the test load is equal to 15 000 divisions (1500/0.1). On a Class II scale with a test load between 5001 and 20 000 divisions, Table 2-2. \"Acceptance Tolerances for Class of Scale Based on Test Load in Divisions\" indicates the tolerance is plus or minus one division. _____________________________________________________________________________________________________ This publication is available free of charge from: https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.HB.133-2019Handbook 133 - 2019 Chapter 2.

For scales marked Class II, the verification division is larger than the minimum displayed division. The minimum displayed division must be differentiated from the verification scale division by an auxiliary reading means such as a vernier, rider, or at least a significant digit that is differentiated by size, shape, or color. Where the verification division is less than or equal to the minimum division, use the verification division instead of the minimum division. Where scales are made for use with mass standards (e.g., an equal arm balance without graduations on the indicator), the smallest mass standard used for the measurement is the minimum division.

These procedures, which are based on those required in NIST Handbook 44, have been modified to reduce the amount of time required for testing scales in field situations.

Test Procedures - Packages Labeled by Weight - Gravimetric Testing Handbook 133 - 2019 16 2.2.4.1. Increasing -Load T est Use certified mass standards to conduct an \"increasing -load test\" with all test loads centered on the load- receiving element. Start the test with the device on zero and progress with increasing test loads to a \"maximum test load\" of at least 10 % more than the gross weight of the packages to be tested. Use at least three different test loads of approximately equal value to test the device up to the \"maximum test load.\" Verify the accuracy of the device at each test load. Include the package tare weight as one of the test points. 2.2.4.2. Decreasing -Load T est For all types of scales, other than one with a beam indicator or equal -arm balance, conduct a \"decreasing -load test\" with all test loads centered on the load -receiving element. Use the same test loads used in the \"increasing -load test\" of this section , and start at the \"maximum test load.\" Remove the test loads in the reverse order of the increasing -load test until all test loads are removed. Verify the accuracy of the scale at each test load. 2.2.4.3. Shift T est When conducting a Shift Test on B ench Scales or Balances, use a test load equal to one -third of the \"maximum test load\" used for the \"increasing -load test.\" For bench scales (see Figure 2-1. \"Bench Scales or Balance s\") apply the test load as nearly as possible at the center of each quadrant of the load receiving element as shown in Figure 2 -1. \"Bench Scale or Balances .\" For Equal- Arm Balances, use a test load equal to one -half capacity center ed successively at four points positioned equidistance between the center and the front, left, back, and right edges of each pan as shown (see Figure 2 -2. \"Equal -Arm Balance\" ). For example, where the load -receiving element is a rectangular or circular shape, place the test load in the center of the area represented by the shaded area . Position 1.

Test Procedures - Packages Labeled by Weight - Gravimetric Testing Handbook 133 - 2019 18 Define the Inspection Lot The official defines which packages are to be tested and the size of the inspection lot. The lot may be smaller or larger than the production lot defined by the packer. Only take action on the packages contained in the lot that has been defined. Lots may be made up o f either standard or random weight packages. Standard packages are those with identical net content declarations such as containers of soda in 2 L bottles and 2.26 kg (5 lb) packages of flour. \"Random packages\" are those with differing or no fixed pattern of weight, such as packages of meat, poultry, fish, or cheese. Note s: (1) Normally, there will never be access to the entire \"production lot\" from a manufacturer. The \"inspection lot\" is selected from packages that are available for inspection/test at any location in the distribution chain. (2) When packages are tested in retail stores, it is not necessary to sort by lot code. If lot codes are mixed during retail testing, be sure to record the lot codes for all of the packages included in the sample so that th e inspector and other interested parties can follow up on the information. For special reasons, such as a large number of packages or the prior history of problems with the product or store, the inspector may choose to define a lot as only one type of packaged product (e.g., ground beef). Another reason to narrowly define the lot is if the results of an audit test indicate the possibility of a shortage in one particular lot code within a particular product. Example: An inspection lot should consist of all of the cans of a single brand of peach halves, labeled with a net quantity of 453 g (1 lb). Select S ampling Plans This handbook contains two sampling plans use d to inspect packages: \" Category A\" and \"Category B. \" Use the \"Category B\" Sampling Pl ans to test meat and poultry products at point-of- pack locations that are subject to U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) requirements. When testing all other packages, use the \"Category A\" Sampling Plan. Use Appendix A, Table 2-1. \"Sampling Plans for Category A,\" to \"Category A\" inspections. Use Appendix A, Table Category B,\" to co nduct \"Category B\" inspections. Record Inspection Data Use an official inspection report to record information. Attach additional worksheets, test notes, and other information as needed. This handbook provides random and standard packaged products model inspection report forms in Appendix C, \"Model Inspection Report Forms.\" ( Refer to Appendix C for instructions on how to complete the forms' box numbers.) Modify the model reports and the box numbers to meet your agency's needs. Other formats that contain more or less information may be acceptable. The proce dure below describes how to record inspection data using the \"Model Inspection Report Forms\" in Appendix C. The same information should be recorded regardless of the form used. Note: Inspection reports should be legible and complete. Good recordkeeping practices typically _____________________________________________________________________________________________________ This publication is available free of charge from: https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.HB.133-2019Handbook 133 - 2019 Chapter 2. Test Procedures - Packages Labeled by Weight - Gravimetric Testing 19 include record retention for a specified period of time. 2.3.3.1. Procedure for Recording Data 1. Record the product identity, packaging description, lot code, location of test, and other pertinent data. 2. Record the labeled net quantity of contents in Box 1. Record both metric and U.S. customary declarations if they are provided on the package label. Example: If the labeled weight is 453 g (1 lb), record this in Box 1. Note: When the declaration of net quantity on the package includes both the International System of Units (SI) (metric) and U.S. customary units, the larger of the two declarations must be verified. The rounding rules in NIST Handbook 130, \"Uniform Packaging and Labeling Regulations\" permit packers to round declarations up or down based on their knowledge of their package filling targets and the accuracy of packaging equipment. 3. Determine the larger of the values by converting the SI declaration to U.S. customary units, or vice versa, using conversion factors that are accurate to at least six places. Compare the values, and use the larger value in computing the nominal gross weight (see later steps). Indicate on the report w hich of the declarations is being verified when packages labeled with two units of measure are encountered. Example: If the net weight declared on a package is 1 lb, the metric equivalent (accurate to six significant digits) is 453.592 g. Do not round down or truncate values in the calculations until the nominal gross weight is determined and recorded. If the package is labeled 454 g, then the metric declaration is larger than the U.S. customary declaration and should be used to verify the net contents of the package. 4. Record the unit of measure in Box 2. The unit of measure is the minimum division of the unit of measurement used to conduct the test. If a scale is used that reads to thousandths of a pound, the unit of measure is 0.001 lb even if the scale division is 0.002 lb or 0.005 lb. Example s: If the scale has a scale division of 0.5 g, the unit of measure is 0.1 g. If a weighed package that has an error of \" 0.5 g,\" record the error as \" 5\" using \"dimensionless units .\" 0.5 g \u00f7 0.1 = 5 dimensionless units If the scale indicates in increments of 0.002 lb, the unit of measure is 0.001 lb. If a weighed package has an error of \" + 0.016,\" record the error as \" + 16\" using \"dimensionless units .\" 0.016 lb \u00f7 0.001 = 16 dimension less u nits _____________________________________________________________________________________________________ This publication is available free of charge from: https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.HB.133-2019Chapter 2. Test Procedures - Packages Labeled by Weight - Gravimetric Testing Handbook 133 - 2019 20 Note s: (1) When using dimensionless units , multiply package errors by the unit of measure to obtain the packa ge error in weight. (2) The Basic Test Procedure does not prohibit the use of units of weight instead of dimensionless units when recording package errors, nor does it prohibit the use of software programs to determine product compliance. Refer to Appendix F. \"Glossary,\" for the definition of dimensionless units. 5. Enter the appropriate MAV value in Box 3 for the type of package (weight, volume, etc.), the labeled net contents, and the unit of measure using Appendix A. Tables 2-5 through 2-10. 6. Determine the MAV in dimensionless units and record in Box 4 on the Standard Package Report Form (a dimensionless unit is obtained by dividing the MAV recorded in Box 3 by th e unit of measure recorded in Box 2). 7. Determine how many minus package errors are permitted to exceed the MAV, (errors known as unreasonable minus errors or UMEs), see Column 4 in either Table 2-1. \"Sampling Plans for Category A\" or Table 2- 2. \"Sampling Plans for Category B\" (refer to Appendix A). Record this number in Box 8. Random S ample S election It is important to select a random sample when conducting an official package inspection. Follow the steps below to select your sample. If the sample packages for the sample are not randomly selected, the test results may not be statistically valid. 1. Count the number of packages comprising the inspection lot or est imate the size to within 5 % and record the inspection lot size in Box 5. 2. Determine sample size using Appendix A, Table 2 -1, \"Sampling Plans for Category A\" or Table 2-2, \"Sampling Plans for Category B.\" In Column 1, find the size of the inspection lot (the number recorded in Box 5 of the report form). Read across from Column 1 to find the appropriate sample size in Column 2 and record this number in Box 6 of the report form. 3. Randomly select a sample from the inspection lot. Random number tables (see Appendix B. \"Random Number Tables\") or a calculator that is able to generate random numbers may be used to identify the sample. Note: If the inspector and the party that is ultimately responsible for the packing and declaration of net weight for the product agree to an alternative method of sample selection, document how the sample packages were selected as part of the inspection record . Procedures for Determining T are There are three types of tare for the inspection of packaged goods. The tare weight may vary considerably from package to package as compared with the variability of the package net contents, even for packages in the same production lot. T he basic test procedure in this handbook considers the variation for all tare materials. _____________________________________________________________________________________________________ This publication is available free of charge from: https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.HB.133-2019Handbook 133 - 2019 Chapter 2. Test Procedures - Packages Labeled by Weight - Gravimetric Testing 21 Used Dry Tare is used tare material that has been air dried, or dried in some manner to simulate the unused tare weight. It includes all packaging materials that can be separated from the packaged product, either readily (e.g., by shaking) or by washing, scraping, ambient air drying, or other techniques involving more than \"normal\" household recovery procedures, but not including laboratory proce dures like oven drying. Labels, wire closures, staples, prizes, decorations, and such are considered tare. Used Dry Tare is available regardless of where the packages are tested. The net content verification procedures described in this handbook reference Used Dry Tare. Note: When testing frozen foods with Used Dry Tare, the frost found inside frozen food packages is included as part of the net contents , except in instances in which glazed or frozen foods are tested according to Section 2.6. \" Net Weight of Encased -in-Ice and Ice Glazed Products.\" Unused Dry Tare is all unused packaging materials (including glue, labels, ties, etc.) that contain or enclose a product. It includes prizes, gifts, coup ons, or decorations that are not part of the product. If testing packages in retail store locations where they are packaged, and sold in small quantities to the ultimate consumers, the basic test procedure may be modified by using samples of the packaging material available in the store. Wet Tare is used tare material where no effort is made to dry the tare material. Free -flowing liquids are considered part of the tare weight. Wet tare procedures must not be used to verify the labeled net weight of packages of meat and poultry packed at an official United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) facility and bearing a USDA seal of inspection. The USDA Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) adopted specific sections of the 2005 4th Edition of NIST H andbook 133 by reference in 2008 but not the \"wet tare\" method for determining net weight compliance. FSIS considers the free -flowing liquids in packages of meat and poultry product s, including single -ingredient, raw poultry products, to be integral components of these products (see Federal Register, September 9, 2008 [Volume 73, Number 175] [Final Rule - pages 52189-52193] ). If the jurisdiction uses wet tare to determine net weight, follow the procedures described below that reference Used Dry Tare, except make no effort to dry the tare material. If Wet Tare is used to verify the net weight of the packages, the inspector must allow for moisture loss. (Amended 2010) 2.3.5.1. Determination of T are S ample and Average T are Weight Except in the instance of applying Unused Dry Tare, use this procedure for selecting and determining the tare sample and average tare weight . Depending upon the initial tare sample results, additional tare samples may need to be taken. 1. Determine the initial tare sample size using Column 5 under initial tare sample size in Appendix A.

Determine and record the \" Range of Tare Weights (Rt) \" in Box 10. 9. Compute the ratio Rc/Rt by dividing the value in Box 9 by the value in Box 10. Record the resulting value in Box 11. Rc and Rt must both be in the same unit of measure or both in dimensionless units . 10. Determine and record in Box 12 the total number of tare samples to be opened for the tare determination from either Appendix A, Table 2-3. \"Category A\" or Table 2-4. \"Category B.\" In the first column (titled Ratio of R c/Rt), locate the range in which the computed Rc/Rt falls. Then, read across to the column headed with the appropriate sample size. If the total number of packages to open equals the number already opened, go to Step 11. If the total number of packages to open is greater than the number of packages already opened, compute the number of additional packages to open for the tare determination. Open and weigh as per Steps 3, 4, and 5 and go to Step 11. Enter the total number of tare samples in Box 12. _____________________________________________________________________________________________________ This publication is available free of charge from: https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.HB.133-2019Handbook 133 - 2019 Chapter 2.

Determine the average tare weight using the tare weight values for all the packages opened and record the average tare weight in Box 13. 2.3.5.1.1. Unused D ry Tare The average tare weight may be determined using samples of Unused Dry Tare when testing meat, poultry, or any other products that are not subject to regulation of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). You may utilize Unused Dry Tare samples when conducting inspections at locations where the point -of-pack and sale are identical (e.g., store -packed products in a supermarket meat case). To determine Unused Dry Tare at the point -of-sale, randomly select two (2) samples of Unused Dry Tare , and weigh each separately. If there is no measurable variation in weight between the samples, proceed with the test using the weight of one of the samples. If the weight of the two (2) initial samples varie s, randomly select three (3) additional tare samples and determine the average weight of all five (5) samples. Use this value as the average tare weight. 2.3.5.2. Special Procedures for D etermining T are Aerosol s and Other Pre -Press urized Containers Aerosol and other pre -pressurized containers (aerosols) are handled differently for two reasons : first, regulations in NIST H andbook 130 under the \" Uniform Packaging and Labeling Regulation \" (UPLR) require that packages designed \"to deliver\" the product under pressure, \"must state the net quantity of the contents that will be expelled when the instructions for use as shown on the container are followed.\" This means that any product retained in aerosol containers after full dispersion is included in the tare weight. Second, aerosol containers must not be opened because they are pressurized; for safety reasons they should not be punctured or opened. When emptying aerosol containers to determine a tare weight, exhaust them in a well -ventilated area (e.g., under an exhaust hood or outdoors) at least 15 m (50 ft) from any source of open flame or spark. To ensure that the container properly dispenses the p roduct, read and follow any dispensing instructions on the package. If shaking during use is specified in the instructions, periodically shake (at least two or three times during expulsion of the product). If directions are not given, shake the container five times with a brisk wrist twisting motion. If the container has a ball agitator, continue the shaking procedure for one minute after the ball has shaken loose. Vacuum Packed C offee The gross weight of a container (typically a metal can) of vacuum -packed coffee will be more after the seal is broken and air enters the can. In the procedure to determine the tare weight of the packaging material, correct the gross weight determined for unopened cans as follows. Use the initial tare sample packages, weigh, and record the gross weight of the product -filled cans before and after breaking the vacuum seal. Compute the average gross weight difference (open weight minus sealed weight) and record this in Box 13a of the report form. The nominal gross weight equals the average tare weight minus the average difference in gross weights plus the labeled weight (Box 14): Box 13 Box 13a + Box 1.

Test Procedures - Packages Labeled by Weight - Gravimetric Testing Handbook 133 - 2019 24 Determine N ominal G ross Weight and Package Error 2.3.6.1. Determine N ominal G ross Weight A nominal gross weight is used to calculate package errors. To compute the nominal gross weight, add the average tare weight (recorded in Box 13) to the labeled weight (recorded in Box 1). Record in Box 14. The nominal gross weight is represented by the formula: Nominal gross weight = average tar e weight + labeled weight 2.3.6.2. Determine Package E rror To obtain the package error, subtract the nominal gross weight from each package's gross weight. The package error is represented by the formula: Package error = gross weight nominal gross weight (Added 2010) Determine the errors of the packages opened for tare by subtracting the nominal gross weight recorded in Box 14 from the individual package gross weights recorded for each package (Pkg . 1, Pkg. 2, etc.) in Block a, \"Gross Wt .\" The nominal gross weight must be used, rather than the actual net weight, for each package to determine the package error. This ensures that the same average tare weight is used to determine the error for every package in the sample, not just the unopened packages. Standard Packages. - Record the package error in the appropriate plus or minus column on the report form for each package opened for tare. Random Packages. - Determine the package error for the tare sample using a nominal gross weight for each package so that all of the package errors are determined with the same tare weight value. Record the package error on the Random Package Report Form in the appropriate plus or minus column under Package Errors. Note: Converting the package error to dimensionless units allows the inspector to record the package errors as whole numbers disregarding decimal points and zeroes in front and unit of measure after the number. This section does not prohibit the use of software or units of weight instead of dimensionless units. Example: If weighing in 0.001 lb increments, the unit of measure is 0.001 lb. If the package error for the first package opened for tare is + 0.008 lb, instead of recording 0.008 lb in the plus column, record the error as \"8\" in the plus column. If the second package error is + 0.060 lb, record the package error as \"60\" in the plus column, and so on. _____________________________________________________________________________________________________ This publication is available free of charge from: https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.HB.133-2019Handbook 133 - 2019 Chapter 2.

Record the package errors in the \"Package Errors\" section of the report form using either units of weight (lb or g) or dimensionless units. 2.3.6.3. Compute T otal Package E rror Add all the package errors for the packages in the sample. Be sure to subtract the minus package errors from the plus package errors and to record the total net error in Box 15, indicating the pos itive or negative value of the error. (Amended 2010) Evaluate for Compliance This inspection lot will pass or fail based on the sample test results. The following steps lead the inspector through the process to determine if a sample passes or fails. If the product is subject a moisture allowance, follow the procedures under Section 2.3.8. \"Moisture Allowances\" to correct the MAV. 2.3.7.1. Maximum A llowable Variation (MAV) R equirement 1. Compare each minus package error with the MAV recorded in Box 3 or Box 4 (if using dimensionless units ). Circle the package errors that exceed the MAV. These are \"Unreasonable Minus Errors.\" Record the number of unreasonable minus errors found in the sample in Box 16. 2. Compare the number in Box 16 with the number of unreasonable errors allowed (recorded in Box 8). If the number found exceeds the allowed number, the lot fails. Record in Box 17 whether the number of unreasonable errors found is less or more than allowed. 2.3.7.2. Average R equirement 1. Determine the average error by dividing the total error recorded in Box 15 by the sample size recorded in Box 6. Record the average error in Box 18 if using dimensionless units or in Box 19 if using units of weight. 2. Compute the average error in terms of weight (if working in dimensionless units up to this time) by multiplying the average error in dimensionless units by the unit of measure and record the value in Box 19. If the average error is positive, the sample passes the average requirement. If the average error is negative, the sample fails under a \"Category B\" test. Record in Box 20. Note: If the total error recorded in Box 15 is a plus value, and Box 17 is \"No,\" (the number of unreasonable errors is equal to or less than the number allowed, recorded in B ox 8), the lot passes. (Refer to Section 1.4.1. Net Quantity of Contents Requirements for Pesticides Labeled with Minimum Net Quantity of Contents Declaration s.\") 3. If the average error is a negative value when testing under the Sampling Plans for \"Category A,\" compute the Sample Error Limit (SEL) as follows: _____________________________________________________________________________________________________ This publication is available free of charge from: https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.HB.133-2019Chapter 2.

If the value of the Average Error (disregarding the sign) (Box 18) is larger than the Sample Error Limit (Box 23), the sample fails. However, if the product is subject to moisture loss, the sample does not necessarily fail. Follow the procedures under \"Moisture Allowances\" in this chapter. (Amended 2018) Moisture A llowances When no predetermined allowance is found in NIST Handbook 133, the potential for moisture loss must be considered. Inspectors should follow their jurisdiction's guidance for making their determination on an acceptable moisture allowance. (Added 2010) If the product tested is subject to moisture loss, provide for the moisture allowance by following one of the two procedures listed below. 2.3.8.1. Applying Moisture L oss before D etermining Package E rrors 1. Determine the percent value of the moisture allowance if the product is listed below .

Test Procedures - Packages Labeled by Weight - Gravimetric Testing 27 Table 2-3. Moisture Allowances Verifying the labeled net weight of packages of: Moisture Allowance is: Notes Flour 3 % Dry pet food 3 % Dry pet food means all extruded dog and cat foods and baked treats packaged in Kraft paper bags and/or cardboard boxes with a moisture content of 13 % or less at time of pack. Pasta products 3 % Pasta products means all macaroni, noodle, and like products packaged in kraft paper bags, paperboard cartons, and/or flexible plastic bags with a moisture content of 13 % or less at the time of pack. Borax See Section 2.4. Borax Wet Tare Only1 Fresh poultry 3 % Fresh poultry is defined as poultry a bove a temperature of 3 \u00b0C (26 \u00b0F) that yields or gives when pushed with the thumb. Franks or hot dogs 2.5 % Bacon, fresh sausage, and luncheon meats 0 % For packages of bacon, fresh sausage, and luncheon meats, there is no moisture allowance if there is no free-flowing liquid or absorbent material in contact with the product and the package is cleaned of clinging material. Luncheon meats are any cooked sa usage product, loaves, jellied products, cured products, and any sliced sandwich -style meat. This does not include whole hams, briskets, roasts, turkeys, or chickens requiring further preparation to be made into ready -to-eat sliced product. When there is no free -flowing liquid inside the package and there are no absorbent materials in contact with the product, Wet Tare and Used Dried Tare are equivalent. 1Wet tare procedures must not be used to verify the labeled net weight of packages of meat and poultry packed at an official United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) facility and bearing a USDA seal of inspectio n. The Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) adopted specific sections of the 2005 4th edition of NIST H andbook 133 by reference in 2008 but not the \"Wet Tare\" method for determining net weight compliance. FSIS considers the free -flowing liquids in packages of meat and poultry products, including single -ingredient, raw poultry products, to be integral components of these products (see Federal Register, September 9, 2008 [Volume 73, Number 175] [Final Rule - pages 52189-52193]). (Amended 2010 and 2013) _____________________________________________________________________________________________________ This publication is available free of charge from: https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.HB.133-2019Chapter 2. Test Procedures - Packages Labeled by Weight - Gravimetric Testing Handbook 133 - 2019 28 Note s: (1) There is no moisture allowance when inspecting meat and poultry from a USDA inspected plant when Used Dry Tare and \"Category A\" sampling plan s are used. (2) For the Wet Tare Only section of Table 2 -3. \"Moisture Allowances,\" free-flowing liquid and liquid absorbed by packaging materials in contact with the product are part of the wet tare. (Added 2010) 2. To compute moisture allowance, multiply the labeled quantity by the decimal percent value of the allowance. Record this value in Box 13a. Example: Labeled net quantity of flour is 907 g (2 lb) Moisture Allowance is 3 % (0.03) Moisture Allowance = 907 g (2 lb) \u00d7 0.03 = 27 g (0.06 lb) 3. If the Moisture Allowance is known in advance (e.g., flour , pasta products , and dry pet food), it can be applied by adjusting the Nominal Gross Weight used to determine the sample package errors. The Moisture Allowance in Box 13a is subtracted from the Nominal Gross Weight to obtain an Adjusted Nominal Gross Weight which is entered in Box 14. The Nominal Gross Weight is defined in Section 2.3.6.1. as the sum of the Labeled Weight and the Average T are Weight from Box 13. Example : Use a Labeled Weight of 907 g (2 lb) and an A verage Tare Weight of 14 g (0.03 lb ) The calculation is: Labeled Net Quantity 907 g (2 lb) + Average Tare Weight 14 g (0.03 lb) = 921 g (2.03 lb) - Moisture Allowance 27 g (0.06 lb) = Adjusted Nominal Gross Weight of 894 g (1.97 lb) This result is entered in Box 14. 4. Determine package errors by subtracting the Adjusted Nominal Gross Weight from the Gross Weights of the Sample Packages. Example: The calculation is: Gross Weigh t of the Sample Packages - A djusted Nominal Gross Weight = Package Error Note: When the Nominal Gross Weight is adjusted by subtracting the Moisture Allowance value(s) the Maximum Allowable Variation (s) is not changed. This is because the errors that will be found in the sample packages have been adjusted by subtracting the Moisture Allowance (e.g., 3 %) from the N ominal Gross Weight . That increases the individual package errors by the amount of the moisture a llowance (e.g., 3 %).

Applying Moisture Allowance after Determining Package Errors Adjustments can b e made when the value of the Moisture Allowance is determined following the test (e.g., after the sample fails or if a packer provides reasonable moisture allowance based on data obtained using a scientific method) using the following approach: If the sample fails the Average Requirement but has no unreasonable package errors, only Step 1 is used. If the sample passes the Average Requirement but fails because the sample included one or more Unreasonable Minus Errors, only Step 2 is used. If the sample fails the Average and MAV Requirements, both of the following steps are applied. 1. Use the following approach to apply a Moisture Allowance to the Average Requirement after the test is completed: the Moisture Allowance is computed ; Example: 3 % \u00d7 907 g (2 lb) = 27 g (0.06 lb) added to the Sample Error Limit; Example: If the S ample E rror Limit is 0.023, add 0.06 to obtain an Adjusted Sample Error Limit of 0.083) the Adjusted Sample Error Limit is then compared to the Average Error of the Sample ; and if the average error (disregarding sign) in Box 18 is smaller than the A djusted Sample Error Limit, the sample passes. HOWEVER, if the average error (disregarding sign) in Box 18 is larger than the A djusted Sample Error Limit, the sample fails. 2. To apply Moisture Allowance to the MAV (s) after the test , the following method is recommended: compute Moisture Allowance ; Example: 3 % \u00d7 907 g (2 lb) = 27 g (0.06 lb) _____________________________________________________________________________________________________ This publication is available free of charge from: https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.HB.133-2019Chapter 2.

(Added 2010) 2.3.8.3. Moisture A llowance G ray A rea When the average error of a lot of fresh poultry, franks/ hot dogs, or pasta products is minus but does not exceed the established \"moisture allowance\" or \"gray area,\" contact the packer or plant management personnel to determine what inf ormation is available on the lot in question. Questions to the plant management representative may include: Is a quality control program in place? What information is available concerning the lot in question? If net weight checks were completed, what were the results of those checks? What adjustments , if any, were made to the target weight? Note: If the plant management has data on the lot, such data may help to substantiate that the \"lot\" had met the net content requirements at the point of manufacture. This handbook provides \"moisture allowances\" for some meat and poultry products, flour, pasta products, and dry pet food. These allowances are based on the premise that when the average net weight of a sample is found to be less than the labeled weight, but not by an amount that exceeds the allowable limit, either the lot is declared to be within the moisture allowance or further investigation can be conducted. Reasonable variations from net quantity of contents caused by the loss or gain of moisture from the package are permitted when caused by ordinary and customary exposure to conditions that occur under good distribution practices. If evidence is obtained and documented to prove that the lot was shipped from the packaging plant in a short -weight condition or was distributed under inappropriate or damaging distribution practices, appropriate enforcement action should be taken.

Test Procedures - Packages Labeled by Weight - Gravimetric Testing 31 2.4. Borax This audit test is only used if the sample fails a net weight test. This procedure applies to packages of powdered or granular products consisting predominantly (more than 50 %) of borax. This method is used to identify possible short -filling by weight at point -of-pack for borax. Since the density of borax can vary at point -of-pack, further investigation is required to determine whether such short -filling has occurred. Use the following procedure to determine if packages of borax are labeled correctly. Borax shall be labeled by weight . Borax can lose more than 23 % of its weight due to moisture loss. However, it does not lose volume with moisture loss, and this property makes possible a method of volume testing based on a density determination in the event that the net weight of the borax does not meet the average or individual package requirements.

This volume declaration shall not appear on the principal display panel. Instead, it shall appear on the back, side, or bottom of the package and may read as: Volume _________ mL per NIST Handbook 133 Note: 1 mL = 1 cm3 3. Determine the gross weight of the package (Box 5). 4. Look up the dry measure used in the following table and record the volume (Box 8). Dry Measure Volume in Milliliters Dry Pint 550.6 ml Dry Quart 1101 ml Liter 1000 ml 5. Determine the empty weight of dry measure and record the value (Box 9.) (a) Place the dry measure in the pan or on top of drop cloth/polyethylene sheeting and verify that it is level. Place the funnel on top of the dry measure and close the funnel side gate. (b) Pour an adequate amount of borax into the funnel so that the dry measure will be filled to overflowing. (c) Quickly remove the slide -gate from the funnel, allowing the borax to flow into the dry measure. To en sure that the borax is free- flowing, repeat Steps 5 (a), (b), and (c) at least three times. After the final filling, go to Step 5 (d). (d) Carefully, without agitating the dry measure, remove the funnel and level off the borax with the straightedge or ruler at a right angle to the rim of the cup, and carefully draw it across the top of the dry measure to leave an even surface. If the surface of the borax is not smooth, repeat Steps 5 (a), (b), (c), and (d). If the surface of the borax is smooth, proceed to S tep 6. 6. Determine the gross weight of the filled dry measure and borax (Box 10). 7. Subtract the empty weight of the dry measure from the gross weight of the dry measure (Box 10 - Box 9) to obtain the net weight of the borax in the dry measure (Box 11). 8. Determine the tare weight of the package (Box 6). 9. Determine the net weight of package (Box 7). 10. Determine the net volume of the borax by dividing the net weight of the package (Box 7) by the net weight of the borax in the dry measure (Box 11) and multiply the result by the volume of the dry measure (Box 8). The result is the net volume of the borax in the package in milliliters (Box 12). If the net volume of borax in the lightest package equals or exceeds the declared volume on the package, treat the lot as being in compliance based on volume and take no further action.

Take further steps to determine if the lot was i n compliance with net weight requirements at point-of- pack or was short -filled by weight. To determine this, perform a laboratory moisture loss analysis to ascertain the weight of the original borax when it was fully hydrated; obtain additional data at th e location of the packager; and/or investigate the problem with the packager of the borax . (Amended 2016) 2.5. Determination of D rained Weight Since the weight per unit volume of a drained product is of the same order of magnitude as that of the packaging liquid that is drained off, an \"average nominal gross weight \" cannot be used in checking packages of this type. The entire sample must be opened. The procedure is based upon a test method accepted by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) . A tare sample is not needed because all the packages in the sample will be opened and measured. The weight of the container plus drained- away liquid is determined. This weight is then subtracted from the gross weight to determine the package error. Test E quipment Scales and weights recommended in Section 2.2. \"Measurement Standards and Test Equipment \" are suitable for the determination of drained weight.

Place the unwrapped frozen seafood, meat , poultry , or similar products in the wire mesh basket or an open container to thaw (e.g. , it is not placed in a plastic bag) and immerse in a 15 L (4 gal) or larger container of fresh water at a temperature between 23 \u00b0C to 29 \u00b0C (75 \u00b0F to 85 \u00b0F). Submerge the basket so that the top of the basket extends above the water level. 3. Maintain a continuous flow of water into the bottom of the container to keep the temperature within the specified range. This is accomplished by maintaining a constant flow of warm water into the container holding the product (e.g., place a bucket in a sink to catch the overflow, and feed warm water into the bottom of the bucket through a hose). Note: Direct immersion does not result in the product absorbing moisture because the freezing process causes the tissue to lose its ability to hold water . 4. As soon as the product thaws, determined by loss of rigidity, transfer all material to a sieve (203 m m [8 in] for packages 453 g [1 lb] or less ). A sieve 304 m m [12 in] for packages weighing more than 453 g [1 lb]) and distribute it evenly over the sieve. 5. Withou t shifting the product, incline the sieve 30\u00b0 from the horizontal position to facilitate drainage, and drain for two minutes. 6. While the product is draining, place pan on scale and tare the scale reading to zero. 7. At the end of the drain time, immediately transfer the product to the tared pan for weighing to determine the net weight of the product .

Net Weight and Purge Determinations Follow these procedures to determine the net weight and amount of purge from chitterlings. 2.7.2.1.1. Test Procedure for Determining the Net Weight and Purge from Fresh and Frozen Chitterlings 1. Determine the G ross Weight of each sample package (record in Column B). 2. Determine the tare weight of the sieve drain pan (record in Drain Pan Tare above Column F). Frozen Chitterlings 3. Fully immerse the unopened package of frozen chitterli ngs in a water bath maintained at a temperature between 23 \u00b0C to 29 \u00b0C (75 \u00b0F to 85 \u00b0F). Note s: (1) An alternative approach to thawing large frozen packages (e.g., 5 kg [10 lb] plastic pails) is to randomly select (mark them to be held for inspection) the sample packages and place them in a refrigerator for partial thawing over several days, and then carrying out the final thawing using the water bath technique. (2) If the products are to be placed in refrigerated storage for several days for partial thaw ing, segregate them from other product inventory and mark each container with an identifier to allow the inspector to ensure that they were the samples selected for testing (mark both lid and container on buckets) when the inspection is resumed after the t hawing process. Also, mark the packages with a conspicuous notice that they are being held for inspection. 4. Maintain a continuous flow of water into the bath to keep the temperature within the specified range until the chitterlings are thawed. The chitte rlings are thawed when it is determined by touch that they are not rigid and no ice crystals are observed or felt within or on their outside surface. Note: For buckets , insert a plastic rod into the chitterlings to determine if the product is thawed and t o ensure there are no chunks of ice remaining. Fresh and Frozen Chitterlings 5. Draining the Chitterlings - Depending on the availability of a sink , work space , and the inspector's preference, use the procedures in either Method A or Method B to drain the chitterlings. Refer to the Table 2- 4. \"Sieve Size Based on Labeled Net Weight\" for the appropriate size sieve to use based on the labeled net weight on the package. _____________________________________________________________________________________________________ This publication is available free of charge from: https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.HB.133-2019Chapter 2.

Sieve S ize Based on Labeled Net Weight Labeled Net Weight Sieve Diameter 30 Degree Tilt from Horizontal Incline Height If more than 453 g (1 lb) use a: 304 mm (12 in) 175 mm (6.9 in) If less than 453 g (1 lb) use a: 203 mm (8 in) 116.8 mm (4.6 in) This procedure requires that the sieve and drain pan be cleaned and dried after each use. It is a good measurement practice to obtain the dry weights of both the sieve and pan and recheck those weights periodically during the test to make sure the cleanin g and drying procedures are efficient. If the amount of chitterlings in the package exceeds the capacity of the sieve, divide the solids evenly among two or more sieves of the same dimensions or make multiple determinations using a single sieve. Exercise care when transferring the chitterlings into the sieves to avoid spilling liquid which can void the test. Method A : Place a sieve over a sink or waste collection container. Pour the chitterlings into the sieve and distribute them over the surface of the sieve with a minimum of handling. Hold the sieve firmly and incline it 30 degrees (see Figure 2-3. \"Sieve with Tilt Block Set at 30 Degrees\" for an example of a tilt block for use with a sink drain set at 30 degrees) to facilitate drainage, then start the stop watch and drain for exactly two minutes. At the end of the drain time, immediately transfer the chitterlings to a drain pan for weighing. Determine the purged net weight of the chitterlings using the following formula and r ecord in Column F of the worksheet. Drained Chitterlings and Drain Pan - Drain Pan Tare = Purged Net Weight Method B : Place a sieve on its drain pan. Pour the chitterlings into the sieve and distribute them over the surface of the sieve with a minimum of handling. Hold the sieve firmly and incline it 30 degrees to facilitate drainage, then start the stop watch and drain for exactly two minutes. At the end of the drain time , immediately transfer the drain pan with the purged liquid to the scale for weighing. Dry the empty package to determine its tare weight and enter it in Column C.

Dry the empty package and determine its tare weight (record in Column C of the worksheet.) 8. Subtract the individual Package Tare Weight from the individual Package Gross Weight to obtain the Actual Package Net Weight (record in Column D of worksheet). Do not use an Average Tare Weight. Use the formula: Actual Package Net Weight = Gross Weight Tare Weight Actual Package Net Weight = Column B - Column C 9. Subtract the Actual Package Net Weight from the Labeled Net Weight (record in Column E of worksheet). Use the formula: Package Error = Labeled Net Weight - Actual Package Net Weight Package E rror = Column A - Column D 10. Repeat for all packages in the sample. Note: The determination of compliance with the net weight and purge requirements are carried out concurrently. The calculation of the average net weight and average purge is complete d after all of the packages are opened and all purge amounts are obtained. The sample must pass both the net weight and purge tests to comply with this section. (Added 2015) Evaluations of Results - Compliance Determinations 1.

Test Procedures - For Packages Labeled by Volume 45 Chapter 3. Test Procedures - For Packages Labele d by Volume 3.1. Scope Use these procedures to determine the net contents of packaged goods labeled in fluid volume such as milk , water, beer, oil, paint, distilled spirits, soft drinks, juices, liquid cleaning supplie s, or chemicals. This chapter also includes procedures for testing the capacities of containers such as paper cups, bowls, glass tumblers, and stemware. These procedures do not cover berry baskets and rigid -dry measures that are covered by specific code requirements in NIST Handbook 44 \"Specifications, Tolerances, and Other Technical Requirements for Weighing and Measuring Devices.\" 3.1.1. Test Methods The gravimetric procedure may be used to verify t he net quantity of contents of packages labeled in volume when the density (density means the weight of a specific volume of liquid determined at a reference temperature) of the product being tested does not vary excessively from one package to another. If the density varies from one package to another, test each package using the volumetric test procedure s described in this chapter. Special test methods are required for a number of unique products so care should be taken to select the correct test procedure. Reference Temperature: In addition to possible package -to-package variations in product density, the temperature of the liquid will affect the volume . The product will expand or contract based on a rise or fall in product temperature. Example: The volume of a liquid cleaning product might be 5 L (1.32 gal) at 20 \u00b0C (68 \u00b0F) and 5.12 L (1.35 gal) at 25 \u00b0C (77 \u00b0F), which represents a 2.2 % change in volume. Note s: (1) This extreme example is for illustrative purposes. A 2.2 % volume change will not occur in normal testing. Use the reference temperature specified in T able 3-1. \"Reference Temperatures for Liquids\" to determine volume. When checking liquid products labeled by volume using the gravimetric procedure, maintain the packages used to determine product densities at reference temperatures. If testing the packages in a sample volumetrically, each package in the sample must be maintained at or corrected to the reference temperature when its volume is dete rmined. (2) When checking liquid products using a volumetric or gravimetric procedure, the temperature of the samples must be maintained at the reference temperature \u00b1 2 \u00b0C ( \u00b1 5 \u00b0F). _____________________________________________________________________________________________________ This publication is available free of charge from: https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.HB.133-2019Chapter 3.

Gravimetric Test Procedure for Non -Viscous Liquids 3.2.1. Test E quipment A scale that meets the requirements in Chapter 2, Section 2.2. \"Measurement Standards and Test Equipment.\" Note: To verify that the scale has adequate resolution for use, it is first necessary to determine the density of the liquid; next verify that the scale division is no larger than MAV/6 for the package size under test. The smallest graduation on the scale must not exceed the weight value for MAV/6. Example: Assume the inspector is using a scale with 1 g (0.002 lb) increments to test packages labeled 1 L (33.8 fl oz) that have an MAV of 29 mL (1 fl oz). Also, assume the inspector finds that the weight of 1 L of the liquid is 943 g (2.078 lb). This will result in an MAV/6 value in weight of 4.715 g (0.010 lb): 29 mL \u00f7 6 = 4.8 mL (1 fl oz \u00f7 6 = 0.166 6 fl oz) 943 g \u00f7 1000 mL = 0.943 g/mL (2.07 8 lb \u00f7 33.6 fl lb/fl oz = lb) In this example, the 1 g (0.002 lb) scale division is smaller than the MAV/6 value of 4.5264 g (0.010 lb) so the scale is suitable for making a density determination. _____________________________________________________________________________________________________ This publication is available free of charge from: https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.HB.133-2019Handbook 133 - 2019 Chapter 3.

Volumetric measures Note : When checking packages labeled in SI units, flask sizes of 100 mL, 200 mL, 500 mL, 1 L, 2 L, 4 L, and 5 L and a 50 mL cylindrical graduate with 1 mL divisions may be used. When checking packages labeled in U.S. customary units the use of measuring flasks and graduates with capacities of gill, half- pint, pint, quart, half -gallon, gallon, and a 2 fl oz cylindrical graduate, graduated to \u00bd fl dr is recommended. Defoaming agent s may be necessary for testing liquids such as beer and soft drinks that effervesce or are carbonated. Two such products are Hexanol or Octanol (Capryl Alcohol* ). *Note: The mention of trade or brand names does not imply that these products are endorsed or recommended by the U.S. Department of Commerce over similar products commercially available from other manufacturers. Bubble level at least 152 mm (6 in) in length Stopwatch 3.2.2. Test Procedure 1. Follow Section 2.3.1. \"Define the Inspection Lot.\" Use a \"Category A\" sampling plan in the inspection. Select a random sam ple. 2. Bring the sample packages and their contents to the reference temperature as specified in Table 3-1. \"Reference Temperatures for Liquids.\" To determine if the liquid is at its reference temperature, immerse the thermometer in the liquid before starting the test. Verify the temperature again immediately after the flask and liquid is weighed. If the product requires mixing for uniformity, m ix it before opening in accordance with any instructions specified on the package label. Shaking liquids, such as flavored milk, often entraps air that will affect volume measurements, so use caution when testing these products. Often, less air is entrap ped if the package is gently rolled to mix the contents. 3. For milk, select a volumetric measure equal to or one size smaller than the label declaration. For all other products, select a volumetric measure that is one size smaller than the label declaration. (Amended 2004) Example: If testing a 1 L bottle of juice or a soft drink, select a 500 mL volumetric measure. Note: When determining the density of milk, if the product from the first container does not fill the volumetric measure to the nominal capacity graduation, product may be added from another container as long as product integrity is maintained (i.e., brand, id entity, lot code, and temperature). 4. Prepare a clean volumetric measure to use according to the following procedure: _____________________________________________________________________________________________________ This publication is available free of charge from: https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.HB.133-2019Chapter 3. Test Procedures - For Packages Labeled by Volume Handbook 133 - 2019 48 Because flasks are ordinarily calibrated on a \"to deliver\" basis, they must be \"wet down\" before using. Immediately before use, fill the volumetric flask(s) or graduate with water. The water should be at the reference temperature of the product being tested. Fill the flask(s) with water to a point slightly below the top graduation on the neck. The flask should be emptied in 30 seconds ( \u00b1 5 seconds). Tilt the flask gradually so the flask walls are splashed as little as possible as the flask is emptied. When the main flow stops, the flask should be nearly inverted. Hold the flask in this position for 10 seconds more and touch off the drop of water that adheres to the tip. If necessary, dry the outside of the flask. This is called the \"wet down\" condition. The flask or graduate is then ready to fill with liquid from a package. Note: When using a volumetric measure that is calib rated \"to contain,\" the measure must be dry before each measurement. If the liquid effervesces or foams when opened or poured (such as carbonated beverages), add two drops of a defoaming agent to the bottom of the flask before filling with the liquid. If working with a carbonated beverage, make all density determinations immediately upon placing the product into the standard. This reduces the chance of volume changes occurring from the loss of carbonization. 5. If the flask capacity is equal to the labeled volume, pour the liquid into the volumetric measure tilting the package to a nearly vertical position. If the flask capacity is smaller than the package's labeled volume, fill the flask to its nominal capacity graduation. 6. Position the flask on a level surface at eye level. For clear liquids, place a material of some dark color outside the flask immediately below the level of the meniscus. Read the volume from the lowest point of the meniscus. For opaque liquids, read volume from the center top rim of the liquid surface. 7. Evaluate the density variation . Select a volumetric measure equal to or one size smaller than the labeled volume (depending on the product) and prepare it as described in Step 4 of this section. Then determine and record its empty weight. Determine acceptability of the liquid density variation, using two packages as follows: Determine the gross weight of the first package. Pour the liquid from the first package into a flask. M easure exactly to the nominal capacity marked on the neck of the measure. Weigh the filled flask and subtract its empty weight to obtain the weight of the liquid. Determine density by dividing the weight of the liquid by the capacity of the flask . Determine the weight of the liquid from a second package using the same procedure. _____________________________________________________________________________________________________ This publication is available free of charge from: https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.HB.133-2019Handbook 133 - 2019 Chapter 3.

Determine the Average Used Dry Tare Weight of the sample according to provisions of Section 2.3.5. \" Procedures for Determining Tare.\" 9. Calculate the Average Product Density by adding the densities of the liquid from the two packages and div iding the sum by two. 10. Calculate the \"nominal gross weight \" using the following formula if the flask capacity is equal to the labeled volume: Nominal Gross Weight = (Average Product Density [in weight units]) + (Average Used Dry Tare Weight) Note: If the flask size is smaller than the labeled volume, the following formula is used: Nominal Gross Weight = (Average Product Density \u00d7 [Labeled Volume/Flask Capacity]) + (Average Used Dry Tare Weight) 11. Weigh the remaining packages in the sample. 12. Subtract the nominal gross weight from the gross weight of each package to obtain package errors in terms of weight. All sample packages are compared to the nominal gross weight. 13.

Test Procedures Use the volumetric headspace procedure described in this section to determine volume when the commodity has a level surface. Open every package in the sample. Note: Make all measurements on a level surface. 1. Bring the temperature of both the liquid and t he water to be used to measure the volume of the liquid to the reference temperature specified in Table 3- 1. \"Reference Temperatures for Liquids .\" Verify with a thermometer that the product has maintained the reference temperature. 2. Measure the headspace of the package at the point of contact with the liquid using a depth gage with a fully rounded, rather than a pointed, rod end. If necessary, support the package to prevent the bottom of the container from distorting. 3. Empty, clean , and dry the package. 4. Refill the container with water measured from a volumetric standard to the original liquid headspace level measured in Step 2 of this procedure until the water touches the depth gage. _____________________________________________________________________________________________________ This publication is available free of charge from: https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.HB.133-2019Chapter 3. Test Procedures - For Packages Labeled by Volume Handbook 133 - 2019 52 5. Determine the amount of water used in Step 4 of this procedure to obtain the volume of the liquid and calculate the \"package error\" based on that volume. \"Package Error\" = Labeled Value - Measured Volume Use the following volumetric headspace procedure to determine volume when the commodity does not have a l evel surface (e.g., mayonnaise, salad dressing, and other water immiscible products without a level liquid surface). The procedure guides the inspector to determine the amount of headspace above the product in the package and the volume of the container. Determine the product volume by subtracting the headspace volume from the container volume. Open and test every package in the sample. (Amended 2010) Note: Make all measurements on a level surface. 1. Bring the temperature of both the commodity and the wat er used to measure the volume to the appropriate temperature designated in Table 3-1. \"Reference Temperatures for Liquids.\" 2. Open the first package and place a disk larger than the package container opening over the opening. 3. Measurement Procedure : Deliver water from a flask (or flasks), graduate, or buret, through the central hole in the disk onto the top of the product until the container is filled. If it appears that the contents of the flask may overfill the container, do not empty the flask. A dd water until all of the air in the container has been displaced and the water begins to rise in the center hole of the disk. Stop the filling procedure when the water fills the center disk hole and domes up slightly due to the surface tension. Do not a dd additional water after the level of the water dome has dropped. If the water dome breaks on the surface of the disk, the container has been overfilled and the test is void; dry the container and start over. 4. To obtain the headspace capacity, record the volume of water used to fill the container and subtract 1 mL (0.03 fl oz), which is the amount of water held in the hole in the disk specified. 5. Empty, clean, and dry the package container. 6. Using Steps 3 and 4 of this procedure, r efill the packag e container with water measured from a volumetric measure to the maximum capacity of the package, subtract 1 mL (0.03 fl oz), and record the amount of water used as the container volume; and 7. From the container volume determined in Step 6 of this procedu re, subtract the headspace capacity in Step 4 of this procedure to obtain the measured volume of the product. 8. Calculate the \"package error\" for that volume where \"package error\" equals labeled volume minus the measured volume of the product. _____________________________________________________________________________________________________ This publication is available free of charge from: https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.HB.133-2019Handbook 133 - 2019 Chapter 3.

Select a sample container and place a disk larger than the container opening over the opening. 4. Measurement Procedure : Add water to the container using flask (or flasks), graduate, or buret corresponding to labeled capacity of the container. If it appears that the contents of the flask may overfill the container, do not empty the flask. Add water until all of the air in the container has been displaced and the water begins to rise in the center hole of the disk. Stop filling the container when the water fills the center disk hole and domes up slightly due to th e surface tension. If the water dome breaks on the surface of the disk, the container has been overfilled and the test is void; dr y the container and start over.

The method determines the volume of a single can in the sample selected as most likely to contain the smallest volume of product. Do not empty any containers since only their critical dimensions are being measured. The configuration of the bottom of the can, paint clinging to the lid, and slight variations in the wall and label thicknesses of the paint container may produce an uncertainty estimated to be at least 0.6 % in this auditing procedure. Therefore, this method is recommended solely to eliminate from more rigorous testing those packages that appear to be full measure. Use the violation procedures when the volume determined in Step 10 is less than the labeled volume or in any case where short measure is suspected. Note: When instructed to record a measurement in a column, refer to the numbered columns in the \"Audit Worksheet for Checking Paint\" in this section. 1. Select a random sample. A tare sample is not needed. 2. For containers less than 4 L or (1 gal): Measure the outside diameter of each container near its middle to the closest 0.02 mm (0.001 in) using a diameter tape. R ecord the measurements in Column 3. Place the containers on a level surface and using the micrometer depth gage, record their heights in Column 1 on the worksheet. If the range of outside diameters exceeds 0.125 mm (0.005 in) or the range in heights exceeds 1.58 mm (0.062 5 in), do not use this procedure. If the ranges a re within the specified limits, weigh all cans in the sample, select the container with the lightest gross weight, and remove its lid. Continue with Step 4 below. 3. For 4 L (1 gal) containers: Gross weigh each package in the sample. Select the package with the lightest gross weight and remove its lid. 4. Use a direct reading diameter tape measure to measure the outside diameter of the selected container near its top, middle (already measured if Step 2 was followed), and bottom to the closest 0.02 mm (0. 001 in). Record these measurements in Columns 2, 3, and 4. Add the three diameter values and divide by three to obtain the average diameter and record this value in Column 5. 5. If a micrometer is available, measure the wall and the paper label thickness of the container; otherwise, assume the wall and label thicknesses given in Table 3- 3. \"Thickness of Paint Can Walls and Labels\" below: Subtract twice the thickness of the wall of the can and paper label from the average can diameter (Step 4) to obtain the average liquid diameter.

On a level surface, place the container on the circular metal disk that is slightly smaller in diameter than the lower rim of the can so the bottom of the container nests on the disk to eliminate any \"sag\" in the bottom of the container. 7. Place the spanning bar and depth gage across the top of the paint can and mark the location of the spanning bar on the rim of the paint container. Measure the distance to the liquid level, to the nearest 20 \u00b5 m (0.02 mm) (0.001 in), at three points in a straight line. Take measurements at points approximately 1 cm (3/8 in) from the inner rim for cans 12.5 cm (5 in) in diameter or less (and at 1.5 cm [1/2 in] from the rim for cans exceeding 12.5 cm [5 in]) in diameter and at the center of the can. Add the three readings and divide by three to obtain the average distance to the liquid level in the container. Record the average distance to the liquid level in Column 7. 8. Measure th e distance to the bottom of the container at three points in a straight line in the same manner as outlined in Step 7. Add the three readings and divide by three to obtain the average height of the container and record it in Column 8. 9. Subtract the aver age distance to the liquid level (Column 7) from the average height of the container (Column 8) to obtain the average height of the liquid column and record it in Column 9. 10. Determine the volume of paint in the container by using the following formula: Volume = 0.7854 D2H Where D = average liquid diameter (Column 6) and H = average liquid height (Column 9) 11.

Measure the distance to the liquid level at the center of the container and record this level in Column 7 below the reading recorded in Step 2. If this distance is equal to or greater than the distance determined in Step 2, assume that the package is satisfactory. If the distance is less than the distance determined in Step 2, the product may be short measure. When the audit test indicates that short measure is possible use the \"Violation Procedure\" in Section 3. 7.2.c.

Use Section 2.3.6. to d etermine the \"Nominal Gross Weight\" as follows: The nominal gross weight equals the sum of the average weight of the labeled volume (average of values recorded in Column 8) plus the average tare (average of values recorded in Column 3) for the packages selected for tare. Note that the weight of a given volume of paint often varies considerably from container to container; therefore, volumetric measurements may prove necessary for the entire sample. 3.7.3. Evaluation of R esults Follow the procedures in Section 2.3.7. \"Evaluat e for Compliance\" to determine lot conformance. 3.8. Testing Viscous Materials - Such As Caulking Compounds and Pastes Use the following procedure for any package of viscous material labeled by volume. It is suitable for very viscous materials such as cartridge -packed caulking compounds, glues, pastes, and other similar products. It is best to conduct this procedure in a laboratory using a hood to ventilate solvent fumes. If used in the field, perform the test in a well-ventilated area. Except for the special measurement procedures to determine the weight of the labeled volume, this procedure follows the basic test procedure . 3.8.1. Test E quipment A scale that meets the requirements in Section 2.2. \"Measurement Standards and Test Equipment.\" Pycnometer (pik\u00b7n\u00e4m t r), a vessel of known volume used for weighing semifluids. The pycnometer can be bought or made. If it is made, refer to it as a \"density cup.\" To make a 150 mL or 5 fl oz density cup, cut off the lip of a 150 mL beaker with an abrasive saw and grind the lip flat on a lap wheel. The slicker plate is available commercially. The metrology laboratory should calibrate the density cup gravimetrically with respect to the contained volume using the procedure as defined by the latest version of ASTM E542, \"Standard Practice for Calibration of Laboratory Volumetric Apparatus.\" This publication is available free of charge from: https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.HB.133-2019Chapter 3. Test Procedures - For Packages Labeled by Volume Handbook 133 - 2019 62 Note: If applicable, comply with any special instructions furnished by the manufacturer to calibrate a pycnometer that has not been calibrated. It is not necessary to reweigh or recalibrate for each test; however, mark the pieces of each unit to prevent interchange of cups an d slicker plates. Appropriate solvents (water, Stoddard solvent, kerosene, alcohol, etc.) Caulking gun (for cartridge packed products) 3.8.2. Test Procedure 1. Follow the procedures in Section 2.3.1. \"Define the Inspection Lot.\" Use a \"Category A\" sampling plan in t he inspection; and select a random sample. 2. Weigh a calibrated pycnometer and slicker plate and record as \"pycnometer weight\" and record the volume of the pycnometer. 3. Determine the gross weight of the first package and record the weight value. Open the package and transfer the product to the pycnometer by filling it to excess. Use a caulking gun to transfer product from the caulking cartridges. If using a pycnometer, cover it with a lid and screw the cap down tightly. Excess material will be forced out through the hole in the lid, so the lid must be clean. If using a density cup, place the slicker plate over \u00be of the cup mouth, press down and slowly move the plate across the remainder of the opening. With the slicker plate in place, clean all the exterior surfaces with solvent and dry. 4. Completely remove the product from the package container; clean the package container with solvent; dry and weigh it to determine the tare weight. 5. Weigh the filled pycnometer or filled density cup with slicker plate and record this weight. Subtract the weight of the empty pycnometer from the filled weight to determine the net weight of the product contained in the pycnometer and record this weight. 6. Clean the pycnometer and repeat Steps 3, 4, and 5 for the second package in the tare sample. 7. Determine acceptability of the density variation on the two packages selected for tare. If the difference between the densities of the two packages exceeds one division of the scale, do not use the gravimetric procedure to determine the net quantity of contents. Instead, use the procedure in steps 9, 10, and 11. Weight of Product in Pycnometer \u00f7 Pycnometer Volume = Product Density Note: If the gravimetric procedure can be used, perform Steps 8, 10 , and 11 for each package in the sample . 8. Calculate the weight of product corresponding to the labeled volume of product according to the following formula: Product Density \u00d7 Labeled Volume = Labeled Weight 9. Test each package individually by determining the product density in each package using the pycnometer and record the gross, tare, and net weight of each package. Subtract the weight of _____________________________________________________________________________________________________ This publication is available free of charge from: https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.HB.133-2019Handbook 133 - 2019 Chapter 3.

Test Procedure Test Notes : Rounding: When a package measurement falls between graduations on a ruler, round the value up. This practice eliminates the issue of rounding from the volume determination and provides the packager the benefit of the doubt. If a ruler with a graduation of 1.0 mm is used, the rounding error will be limited to 0.5 mm or less. It is good practice to circle a measurement that has been rounded up or make a statement to such effect so that it becomes a part of the record. Dimension Identification: The following package nomenclature is used to identify the dimensions measured in this test procedure. 1Notice: The mention of trade or brand name does not imply endorsement or recommendation by the U.S. Department of Commerce over similar products available from other manufacturers. _____________________________________________________________________________________________________ This publication is available free of charge from: https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.HB.133-2019Handbook 133 - 2019 Chapter 3. Test Procedures - For Packages Labeled by Volume 65 Note: Packages of compressed peat moss do not have declaration of expanded volume. Safety Precautions: This procedure does not address all of the safety issues that users need to be aware of in order to carry out the following tasks. Users are sometimes required to conduct tests in warehouse spaces or retail sto res where fork -trucks are in motion - care must be taken to warn others to avoid or exercise care around the test site. The procedure requires users to lift heavy objects including large bulky packages and test measures and includes the use of sharp instr uments to obtain packages from shrink -wrapped pallets. Users may be required to climb ladders or work platforms to obtain sample packages. When opening and emptying packages, dust, or other particles may be present or escape from the packages, which may cause eye injuries and respiratory or other health problems. Users must utilize appropriate safety equipment and exercise good safety practices. If safe working conditions cannot be ensured, suspend testing until the situation is corrected. 1. Follow Section 2.3.1. \"Define the Inspection Lot.\" Use a \"Category A\" Sampling Plan for the inspection. Collect the sample packages from the Inspection Lot using random sampling. If the packages are not randomly selected, the sample will not be representative of the lot and the test results will not be valid for use in enforcement action. Place the sample packages in a location where there is adequate lighting and ample space for the packages and test equipment. 2. Examine the package for excess packaging material (i.e., packaging tails). Fold the packaging material consistent with design of the packaging and tape the material securely to the package so that its effect on the dimensional measurement is minimized. I f the thickness of packaging tail appears excessive, it is appropriate to determine its average thickness by making at least three measurements along its length using a dead weight dial micrometer specified in Section 4.5. \"Polyethylene Sheeting\" and subtr act the thickness from the measurement of length, width or height. Any deduction from a measurement should be noted on the inspection report. Figure 3 -2.

If a table is used, select one of su fficient load capacity to hold the weight of the frame and the heaviest package to be tested. 4. Position the frame so that the zero end of the ruler can be placed squarely and firmly against a surface of the frame and so that the ruler graduations can b e read. Position yourself so that you can read both the ruler and the edge of the carpenter square in Figure 3 -3. \"Rigid Frame.\" 5. Place the package against two sides of the frame without compressing the package. Place a carpenter square against the package at the point of measurement and align the ruler perpendicular to the edge of the carpenter square as shown in Figure 3-4. \"Lengt h Measurement\" where the package length and Figure 3 -5. \"Height Measurement\" where the package height are being determined . 6.

The measure must accommodate the entire contents of the package being tested, and a transparent sidewall is useful for determining the level of fill, but must be reinforced if it is not thick enough to resist distortion. If the measure has a clear front, place the level gage at the back (inside) of the measure so that the markings are read over the top of the mulch. Notes 1Other interior dimensions are acceptable if the test measure approximates the configuration of the package under test, can accommodate the entire contents of the package at one time and does not exceed a base configuration of the package cross -section. 2The height of the test measure shall be 355.6 mm (14 in) for a 1 cu ft package, 685.8 mm (27 in) for a 1.5 cu ft to 2 cu ft package or 990.6 mm (39 in) for a 3 cu ft package. 3When lines are marked in boxes, they should extend to all four sides of the measure, if possible to improve readability. It is recommended that a line indicating the MAV level also be marked to reduce the possibility of reading errors when the level of the mulc h is at or near the MAV. 4The Nominal Capacity is given to identif y the size of packages that can be tested in a single measurement using the dry measure with the listed dimensions. It is based on the most common package sizes of mulch in the marketplace. If the measures are built to the dimensions shown above the actual volume will be larger than the nominal volume so that plus errors (overfill) can be measured accurately.

Follow Section 2.3.1. \"Define the Inspection Lot.\" Use a \"Category A\" sampling plan in the inspection, and select a random sample. 2. Some types of mulch are susceptible to clumping and compacting. To ensure that the material is loose and free flowing when placed into the test measure, gently massage the package while rolling the bag on the ground (or flat surface) at least four full rotations (but not more than eight full rotations), without lifting or dropping the package, before opening to reduce the clumping and compaction of the materi al. Note: Mulch products stored exposed to the elements may become saturated with moisture. Excessive moisture adds weight to mulch particles and distorts the volume test results. Test samples with flowing or excessive collected moisture in the package shall be excluded from the test procedure. 3. Placing contents into the test measure. Open the bag, gather the bag opening to ensure that no product is lost. Place the gathered bag opening as far into the top of the measure as possible without disturbing or leaning against the measure. Release the bag opening and quickly dump the contents of the package into a test measure in a continuous flow. Note: Do not touch the product or disturb the test measure by rocking, shaking, dropping or tamping it during the test procedure. Massage the outside of the bag to maintain a continuous flow of the product but not for the purpose of de-clumping the product. Using your hand, gently level the contents, being careful not to affect the compaction of the product. 4. Read the horizontal marks at a position level with the product and round the readings between two marked intervals up to the nearest 38.1 mm ( 1/2 in) increment to determine the package net volume. 5. Determine package errors by subtracting the labeled volume from the package net volume in the measure. Record each package error . Package Error = Package Net Volume Labeled Volume (Amended 2017) 3.10.3. Evaluation of R esults Follow the procedures in Section 2.3.7. \"Evaluat e for Compliance \" to determine lot conformance.

When testing mulch and soil with a net quantity in terms of volume, one package out of every 12 in the sample may exceed the 5 % MAV (e.g., one in a sample of 12 packages; two in a sample of 24 packages; four in a sample of 48 packages) . However, the sample must meet the average requirement of the \"Category A\" Sampling Pla n. 3.11. Ice Cream Novelties Note: The f ollowing procedure can be used to test packaged products that are solid or semisolid and that will not dissolve in, mix with, absorb, or be absorbed by the fluid into which the product will be immersed. For example, ice cream labeled by volume can be tested using ice water or kerosene as the immersion fluid. Exception : Pelletized ice cream is beads of ice cream which are quick frozen with liquid nitrogen. The beads are relatively small, but can vary in shape and size. On April 17, 2009, the FDA issued a letter stating that this product is considered semisolid food, in accordance with 21 CFR 101.105(a). The FDA also addresses that the appropriate net quantity of content declaration for pelletized ice cream products be in terms of net weight . (Added 2010) The following volume displacement procedure uses a displacement vessel specifically designed for ice cream novelties such as ice cream bars, ice cream sandwiches, or cones. The procedure determines the volume of the novelty by measuring the amount of wat er displaced when the novelty is submerged in the vessel. Two displacements per sample are required to subtract the volume of sticks or cups. The procedure first determines if the densities of the novelties are the same from package to package (in the same lot) so that a gravimetric test can be used to verify the labeled volume. If a gravimetric procedure is used, compute an average weight for the declared volume from the first two packages and weigh the remainder of the sample. If the gravimetric procedure cannot be used, use the volume displacement procedure for all of the packages in the sample. 3.11.1. Test Equ ipment A scale that meets the requirements in Section 2.2. \"Measurement Standards and Test Equipment\" Volumetric measures Displacement vessel with dimensions appropriate for the size of novelties being tested (see Figure 3-7, \" Example of a Displacement Vessel\"). It should include an interior baffle that reduces wave action when the novelty is inserted and a downward angle d overflow spout to reduce dripping.

According to the type of novelty, prepare the sample products as follows: *Ice-pop. Mark on the stick(s) with the indelible marker the point to which the pop will be submerged in the ice water. ( After the ice- pop contents have been submerged, remove the novelty to determine the volume of the stick.) *Cone . Make a small hole in the cone below the ice cream portion to allow air to escape.

Work quickly, and return the novelty to the freezer before the sandwich softens. Cup. Remove the cap from the cup . 4. Fill the displacement vessel with ice water until it overflows the spout. Allow it to sit until dripping stops. Raise the displacement vessel as necessary and place the graduate beneath the spout. 5. Remove a package from the freezer, determine its gross weight, and record it. 6. Submerge the novelty as suggested until it is below the surface level of the water. Ice-pop. Use a clamp, tongs, or your fingers to hold the stick(s) and submerge the pop to the level marked in Step 3 of the Test Procedure. Cone . Shape the wire into a loop, and use it to push the cone, headfirst (ice cream portion first) into the ice water. Do not completely submerge the cone immediately: let water fill the cone through the hole made in Step 3 of the Test Procedure before completely submerging the novelty. Sandwich or cup . Skewer the novelty with the thin wire or form a loop on the end of the wire to push the sandwich or ice cream portion or cup completely below the liquid level. 7. Record the total water volume in the graduate. For a cone or sandwich, record the water volume as the net volume and go to Step 9. For ice -pops or cups, record the water volume in the graduate as the gross volume and go to Step 8. 8. Refill the displacement vessel with water to overflowing and reposition the empty graduate under the spout. After the cup and novelty contents have been submerged, remove the novelty from the cup to determine the volume of the cup. Ice-pop. Melt the ice -pop off the stick or sticks. Submerge the stick or stic ks to the line marked in Step 3. Record the volume of tare material (i.e., stick) by measuring the water displaced into the graduate. The net volume for the ice -pop is the gross volume recorded in Step 7 minus the volume of the tare materials in this ste p. Record this volume as the \"volume of novelty.\" To determine the error in the package, subtract the labeled quantity from the volume of novelty. Cup. Remove the novelty from the cup. Rinse the cup, and then submerge it in the displacement vessel. Small pinholes in the base of the cup can be made to make submersion easier. Record the volume of water displaced into the graduate by the cup as the vol ume of tare material. The net volume for the novelty is the gross volume _____________________________________________________________________________________________________ This publication is available free of charge from: https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.HB.133-2019Chapter 3. Test Procedures - For Packages Labeled by Volume Handbook 133 - 2019 76 determined in Step 7 minus the volume of the tare materials determined in this step. Record this as the net volume of the novelty. To determine the error in the package, subtract t he labeled quantity from the volume of novelty. 9. Clean and air -dry the tare materials (sticks, wrappers, cup, lid, etc.). Weigh and record the weight of these materials for the package. 10. Subtract the tare weight from the gross weight to obtain the net weight and record this value. 11. Compute the weight of the labeled volume for the package using the following formula and then record the weight: Product Density = (product net weight in Step 10) \u00f7 (the total water volume in Step 7 - volume of tare material in Step 8) Weight of labeled volume = (labeled volume) \u00d7 (Product Density) 12. Repeat Steps 3 through 11 for a second package. 13. If the weight of the labeled volumes in Step 11 for the two packages differs from each other by more than one division on the scale, the gravimetric test procedure cannot be used to test the sample for compliance. If this is the case, use Steps 3 through 8 for each of the remaining packages in the sample to determine their net volumes and package errors. Then go to evaluation of results. If the weights of the labeled volumes agree within one division, continue to Step 14 to test the rest of the sample using the gravimetric test procedure. * 14. Use Section 2.3.5.1. \"Determination of Tare Sample and Average Tare Weight \" to determine the Average Used Dry tare Weight of the sample. 15. Find the Average Product Density by adding the densities of the product from the two packages and dividing the sum by two. 16. Using the we ight of labeled volume determined in Step 11, calculate the Average Product Weight by multiplying the weight of the labeled volume by the average product density. *Average Product Weight = Labeled Volume \u00d7 Average Product Density 17. Calculate the \"nominal gross weight \" using the formula: Nominal Gross Weight = Average Product Weight + Average Used Dry Tare Weight 18. Weigh the remaining packages in the sample. 19. Subtract the nominal gross weight from the gross weight of each package to obtain package errors in terms of weight. Note: Compare the sample packages to the nominal gross weight . 20. Determine the average package error by totaling all package errors and dividing by the number of packages in the sample. _____________________________________________________________________________________________________ This publication is available free of charge from: https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.HB.133-2019Handbook 133 - 2019 Chapter 3.

Evaluation of R esults Follow the procedures in Section 2.3.7. \"Evaluat e for Compliance \" to determine lot conformance. 3.12. Fresh O ysters Labeled by Volume Packaged fresh oysters removed from the shell must be labeled by volume. The maximum amount of permitted free liquid is limited to 15 % by weight. (See NIST Handbook 130, Method of Sale of Commodities, Section 1.5.2.3. \"Fresh Oysters Removed From Shell.\" ) Testing the quantity of contents of fresh oysters requires the inspector to determine total volume, total weight of solids and liquid, and the weight of the free liquid. 3.12.1.

Test Procedure Note: Test the oys ters at a temperature of 7 \u00b0C (\u00b1 1 \u00b0C) \u00b0F [\u00b1 2 \u00b0F]) 1. Follow Section 2.3.1. \"Define the Inspection Lot .\" Use a \"Category A\" sampling plan in the inspection; and select a ra ndom sample. 2. Determine and record the gross weight of a sample package. 3. Set the container on a level surface and open it. Use a depth gage to determine the level of fill. Lock the depth gage. Mark the location of the gage on the package. 4. Weigh a dry receiving pan and record the weight. Set strainer over the receiving pan. 5. Pour the contents from the container onto the strainer without shaking it. Drain for two minutes. Remove strainer with oysters. It is normal for oysters to include mucous (which is part of the product) that will not pass through the strainer, so do not force it. 6. Weigh the receiving pan and liquid and record the weight. Subtract the weight of the dry receiving pan from the weight of pan and liquid to obtain the weight of free liquid and record the value. 7. Clean, dry, and weigh the container and record the tare weight. Subtract the tare weight from the gross weight to obtain the total weight of the oysters and liquid and record this value. 8. Determine and record the percent of free liquid by weight as follows: Note: This handbook provides a w orksh eet for Determining the Free Liquid and Net Volume of Oysters in Appendix C. \"Model Inspection Report Forms.\" Percent of free liquid by weight = [(weight of free liquid) \u00f7 (weight of oysters + liquid)] \u00d7 100 or (f \u00f7 c) \u00d7 100 = Percentage of Free Liquid by Weights Where: f = Weight of Free Liquid c = (Net Weight of Oysters + Liquid ) 9. Set up the depth gage on the dry package container as in Step 3. Pour water from the flasks and graduate as needed to re -establish the level of fill obtained in Step 3. Add the volumes delivered as the actual net volume for the container and record the value. _____________________________________________________________________________________________________ This publication is available free of charge from: https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.HB.133-2019Handbook 133 - 2019 Chapter 3. Test Procedures - For Packages Labeled by Volume 79 Note: Some containers will hold the declared volume only when filled to the brim; they may have been designed for other products, rather than for oysters. If the net volume is short measure (per Step 9), determine if the container will reach the declared volume only if filled to the brim. Under such circumstance, the package net volumes will all be short measure because the container canno t be filled to the brim with a solid and liquid mixture. A small headspace is required in order to get the lid into t he container without losing any liquid. (Amended 2014) 3.12.3. Evaluation of R esults Follow the procedures in Section 2.3.7. \"Evaluat e for Compliance \" to determine lot conformance. 3.13. Determining the Net Contents of C ompressed Gas in C ylinders These procedures are for industrial compressed gas. Compressed gas may be labeled by weight (for example, Liquefied Petroleum [LP] gas, or carbon dioxide) or by volume. Acetylene, liquid oxygen, nitrogen, nitrous oxide, and argon are all filled by weight. Acetylene is sold by liters or by cubic feet. Helium, gaseous oxygen, nitrogen, air, and argon are filled according to pressur e and temperature tables. Checking the net contents of compressed gas cylinders depends on the method of labeling; those labeled by weight are generally checked by weight. Cylinders filled by using pressure and temperature charts must be tested using a pressure gage that is connec ted to the cylinder. The volume is determined using the pressure and temperature of the cylinder. Safety Precautions: Be aware of the hazards of the high pressure found in cylinders of compressed gas. An inspector should handle compressed gas only if the inspector has been trained and is knowledgeable regarding the product, cylinder, fittings, and proper procedures (see Compressed Gas Association [CGA] pamphlet P -1, \"Safe Handling of Compressed Gases in Containers ,\" for additional information). Additiona l precautions that are necessary for personal safety are described in the CGA Handbook of Compressed Gases. All personnel testing compressed gases should have this manual for reference and be familiar with its contents. It is essential that the inspector be certain of the contents before connecting to the cylinder. Discharging a gas or cryogenic liquid through a system for which the material is not intended could result in a fire and/or explosion or property damage due to the incompatibility of the system and the product. Before connecting a cylinder to anything, be certain of the following: 1. Always wear safety glasses. 2. The cylinder is clearly marked or labeled with the correct name of the contents and that no conflicting marks or labels are present. Do not rely on the color of the cylinder to identify the contents of a cylinder. Be extremely careful with all gases because some react violently when mixed or when coming in contact with other substances. For example, oxygen reacts violently when it com es in contact with hydrocarbons. 3. The cylinder is provided with the correct Compressed Gas Association (CGA) connection(s) for the product. A proper connection will go together smoothly; so excessive force should not be used. Do not use an adapter to connect oxygen to non- oxygen cleaned equipment. When a cylinder valve is opened to measure the internal pressure, position the body away from the pressure gage blowout plug or in front of the gage if the gage has a solid cast front case. If the _____________________________________________________________________________________________________ This publication is available free of charge from: https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.HB.133-2019Chapter 3. Test Procedures - For Packages Labeled by Volume Handbook 133 - 2019 80 bourdon tu be should rupture, do not be in a position to suffer serious injuries from gas pressure or fragments of metal. Note: The acetone in acetylene cylinders is included in the tare weight of the cylinder. Therefore, as acetylene is withdrawn from the cylinder, some acetone will also be withdrawn, changing the tare weight. 4. Thoroughly know the procedure and place emphasis on safety precautions before attempting any tests. Do not use charts referred to in the procedure until the necessary training has been completed. When moving a cylinder, always place the protective cap on the cylinder. Do not leave spaces between cylinders when moving them. This can lead to a \"domino\" effect if one cylinder is pushed over. 5. Open all valves slowly. A failure of the gage or other ancillary equipment can result in injuries to nearby persons. Remember that high gas pressure can propel objects with great force. Gas ejected under pressure can also cause serious bodily injuries if someone is too close during release of pressure. 6. One of the gages will be reserved for testing oxygen only and will be prominently labeled \"For Oxygen Use Only.\" This gage must be cleaned for oxygen service and maintained in that \"clean\" condition. The other gage (s) may be used for testing a variety of gases if they are compatible with one another. 7. Observe special precautions with flammable gas in cylinders in addition to the several precautions necessary for the safe handling of any compressed gas in cylinders. Do not \"crack\" cylinder valves of flammable gas before connecting them to a regulator or test gage . This is extremely important for hydrogen or acetylene. 3.13.1. Test E quipment Scale that meets the requirements in Section 2.2. \"Measurement Standards and Test Equipment .\" Use a wooden or non- sparking metal ramp to roll the cylinders on the scale to reduce shock loading. Two calibrated precision bourdon tube gage s or any other approved laborator y-type pressure- measuring device that can be accurately read within plus or minus 40 kPa (5 psi). A gage having scale increments of 200 kPa (25 psi) or smaller shall be considered as satisfactory for reading within plus or minus 40 kPa (5 psi). The range of both gage s shall be a minimum of 0 kPa to 23 MPa (0 psi to 5000 psi) when testing cylinders using standard industrial cylinder valve connections. These standardized connections are listed in \"CGA Standard V -1, Standard for Compressed Gas Cylinder Valve Outlet and Inlet Connections for use with Gas Pressures up to 21 MPa (3000 psi) .\" For testing cylinders with cylinder valve connections rated for over 21 MPa (3000 psi), the test gage and its inlet connection must be rated at 14 MPa (2000 psi) over the maximum pressure that the connection is rated for in CGA V-1. Note s: (1) There are standard high- pressure industrial connections on the market that are being used up to their maximum pressure of 52 MPa (7500 psi). _____________________________________________________________________________________________________ This publication is available free of charge from: https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.HB.133-2019Handbook 133 - 2019 Chapter 3. Test Procedures - For Packages Labeled by Volume 81 (2) Any gage or connectors used with oxygen cylinders must be cleaned for oxygen service, transported in a manner which will keep them clean and never used for any other gas including air or oxygen mixtures. Oxygen will react with hydrocarbons and many foreign materials that may cause a fire or explosion. (3) Use a separate gage and fitting for each gas to be tested. If adapters must be used, do not use on oxygen systems. An approved and calibrated electronic temperature measuring device or three calibrated liquid- in-glass thermometers having either a digital readout or scale division of no more than 1 \u00b0F (0.5 \u00b0C). The electronic device equipped with a surface temperature sensor is preferred over a liquid -in-glass thermometer because of its shorter response time. Two box- end wrenches of 29 mm (11/8 in) for oxygen, nitrogen, carbon dioxide, argon, helium, and hydrogen and 22 mm (7/8 in) for some sizes of propane. All industrial CGA connections are limited to these two hex sizes. Avoid using an adjustable wrench because o f the tendency to round the edges of the fittings, which can lead to connections not being tightened properly. 3.13.2. Test Procedures 1. Follow Section 2.3.1. \"Define the Inspection Lot.\" Use a \"Category A\" sampling plan in the inspection; select a random sample . 2. The cylinder should be marked or stenciled with a tare weight. The marked value may or may not be used by the filling plant when determining the net weight of those cylinders sold or filled by weight. If there is a tare weight marked on the net contents tag or directly on the cylinder, then an actual tare weight was determined at the time of fill . If there is no tare weight marked on a tag or on the cylinder, then the stamped or stenciled tare weight is presumed to have been used to determine the net contents. Note: Check the accuracy of the stamped tare weights on empty cylinders whenever po ssible. The actual tare weight must be within (a) \u00bd % of the stamped tare weight for 9.07 kg (20 lb) tare weights or less or (b) 1/4 % of the stamped tare weight for greater than 9.07 kg (20 lb) tare weights. (See NIST Handbook of Sale Regul ation , Section 2.16. \"Compressed or Liquefied Gases in Refillable Cylinders .\") 3. Place cylinder on scale and remove protective cap. The cap is not included in the tare weight. Weigh the cylinder and determine net weight, using either the stamped or stenci led tare weight, or the tare weight marked on the tag. Compare actual net weight with labeled net weight, or use the actual net weight to look up the correct volume declaration (for Acetylene Gas), and compare that with the labeled volume. Note: Most producers will replace acetone in the cylinder before the cylinder is refilled, filling the cylinder with acetone to the stamped tare weight. Other producers, although not following recommended procedures, do not replace the acetone until it drops to a predetermined weight. In the latter situation, the refilling plant must note the actual tare weight of the cylinder and show it _____________________________________________________________________________________________________ This publication is available free of charge from: https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.HB.133-2019Chapter 3.

Refer to tables for acetylene if necessary (if t he acetylene is labeled by volume). 1. Follow Section 2.3.1. \" Define the Inspection Lot .\" Use a \"Category A\" sampling plan in the inspection; select a random sample. 2. Determine the temperature of the cylinders in the sample. Place the thermometer approximately halfway up a cylinder in contact with the outside surface. Take the temperature of three cylinders selected at random and use the average temperature of the three values. 3. Using the appropriate pressure g age, measure the pressure of each cylinder in the sample. 4. Determine the cylinder nominal capacity from cylinder data tables or from the manufacturer. (These tables must be obtained in advance of testing.) 5. The SCF/CF volume of compressed gases (e.g., oxygen, argon, nitrogen, helium, or hydrogen) shall be determined using NIST Standard Reference Database 23 \"Reference Fluid Thermodynamic and Transport Properties Database\" (REFPROP). (See https://www.nist.gov/ srd/refprop) (Note: Weights and measures officials should contact the NIST Office of Weights and Measures at (301) 975-4004 or owm@nist.gov for access to the database.) 6. Multiply the cylinder nominal capacity by the value (SCF/CF) obtained from the content tables. This is the actual net quantity of gas. 7. Subtract the labeled net quantity from the actual net quantity to determine the error. 3.13.3. Evaluation of R esults Follow Section 2.3.7. \"Evaluat e for Compliance \" to determine lot conformance. 3.14. Firewood - Volumetric Test Procedure for Packaged Firewood with a Labeled Volume of 113 L [ 4 ft3] or Less and Stacked Firewood Sold by the Cord or Fractions of a Cord. Unless otherwise indicated, take all measurements without rearranging the wood or removing it from the package. However, i f the layers of wood are crosshatched or not ranked in discrete sections in the package, remove the wood from the package, re -stack, and measure according to the procedures described in this section. For boxed firewood, it is the volume of the wood in the box that is determined not the volume of the box.

Test E quipment Linear Measurement The maximum value of graduations on a ruler or tape shall be equal to or less than: For Testing SI Units U.S. Customary Units Packaged Firewood 1 mm 1/16 in (0.0625 in) Stacked Firewood 0.5 c m 1/8 in (0.125 in) Other Equipment: Except where a long tape measure is needed for measuring stacks of wood and unless otherwise noted below, a precision tempered steel ruler should be used for linear measurements. Current calibration certificates issued by a NIST recognized or accredited l aboratory should be available for all measuring devices. To test boxes of firewood, use a straightedge and a 150 mm (6 in) tempered steel pocket ruler to measure the box headspace. A rigid 610 mm (24 in) tempered steel ruler is required to measure piece length and the dimensions of the box. To test bundles of firewood, use a rigid 610 mm (24 in) tempered steel ruler to measure typical piece length. If the circumference based auditing method is to be conducted, a precision 610 mm (24 in) diameter (pi) tape or flexible steel tape with 1 mm (1/16 in) graduations may be used to approximate the package volume for screening and audit purposes. For testing stacks of firewood, a precision tape or long tape measure is used. For testing bundles and bags of fire wood, the following equipment and materials are used in addition to the linear measures listed above: Binding Straps : Straps with ratchet type closures are easily tightened to secure the wood tightly. The binding straps are used to hold wood bundles together if the bundles need to be removed from the package/wrapping material. Graph Paper : 279.4 mm \u00d7 431.8 mm (11 in \u00d7 17 in) with 0.5 centimeter or \u00bc inch squares. This paper is used for tracing and calculating the areas of the ends of a bundle of firewood.

Stacked wood At least 12 pieces for each \u00bd cord or fraction thereof *Note: While the packages of firewood to be included in the sample must be selected using the random sampling techniques described in NIST Handbook 133, Section 2.3.4. \"Random Sample Selection,\" those techniques are not used in selecting the individual pieces for measurement of length. Since the packages were selected at random, the assumption is made that the length of any piece selected for measuring is generally representative of the other pieces that the packer cut or selected for inclusion in the package u nder inspection. When selecting pieces of wood for measurement, take them from different locations in the package or stack so they are representative of the total amount of wood under test. Measuring Procedures for Length . Use the instructions and graphics in Table 3-6. \"Determining Piece Length\" when measuring the length of the pieces to determine the average length of a piece of firewood based on its shape in a package or stack. If a piece of wood does not appear to fall within the examples shows, measure it as if it were an irregular shape and take three or more measurements and average them. _____________________________________________________________________________________________________ This publication is available free of charge from: https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.HB.133-2019Handbook 133 - 2019 Chapter 3. Test Procedures - For Packages Labeled by Volume 85 Table 3-6. Determining Piece Length (a) Uniform Shapes Errors in the length measurement can result in a significant volume errors especially with the small quantities typical of packaged wood. When the pieces are generally cut in a uniform manner, a single measurement along the center line of the lo ngitudinal axis is used to determine piece length. Take the measurement along a stra ight line between two points over solid wood. (i) Most wood pieces are cut perpendicular to their longitudinal axis so one measurement taken from the face of one end to the face of the other end will provide an accurate length determination. (ii) On pieces of wood with \"reverse bias\" and \"bias\" end cuts estimate where the center line of the piece is and then measure to these points as shown below. The intent of this measurement is to determine an \"average\" length that is assumed to fall along the center line of the piece. The top piece is an example of a \"reverse\" bias cut. The bottom piece is an example of a bias cut _____________________________________________________________________________________________________ This publication is available free of charge from: https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.HB.133-2019Chapter 3. Test Procedures - For Packages Labeled by Volume Handbook 133 - 2019 86 Table 3-6. Determining Piece Length (b) Irregular Shapes When the pieces have irregular shapes, cuts, or shattered ends , it is necessary to take at least three measurements and average the results to obtain the length of the piece. Take the measurements along a straight line between two points which cover solid wood that appear to be the shortest and longest dimensions and a third measurement at or near the center line of the piece. (iii) This piece has a bias cut end on the left and an irregular end on the right. The measurements are taken at the longest and shortest points where the line crosses over solid wood. The lowest measurement (dotted line over the air space) is not used because it does not cross wood. Only the three upper measurements are used to calculate the average length for this piece unless additional measurements across solid wood are taken. (iv) This is a piece with a bias cut on the left end and irregular end on the right. Note how the measurements are taken at the longest and shortest points where the line crosses over solid wood. The lowest measurement (the dotted line) would not be used because it does not crossover wood. (v) This piece of wood has a \"shattered end.\" Shattering occurs when wood is stressed beyond its breaking point and the end is not trimmed. The inspector will take additonal measurements to account at the shortest point of the voids and longest points at the extensions. In this example, five measurements were taken and averaged to account for the voids and extensions. _____________________________________________________________________________________________________ This publication is available free of charge from: https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.HB.133-2019Handbook 133 - 2019 Chapter 3.

If the wood is irregularly shaped (see Table 3-6. \"Determining Piece Length , (b) Irregular Shapes\" for examples) , take at least three measurements along a straight line between two points crossing solid wood that appear to be the shortest and longest dimensions, and a third at or near the center line of the piece. Calculate the average of the measurements to obtain the Average Individual Piece Length and record the length of the piece. To determine Average Individual Piece Length (AIPL) of irregularly shaped pieces: AIPL = (L 1 + L2 + L3) \u00f7 3 After all pieces are measured, total the lengths and divide that total by the number of samples to obtain the Average Piece Length for the package. _____________________________________________________________________________________________________ This publication is available free of charge from: https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.HB.133-2019Chapter 3. Test Procedures - For Packages Labeled by Volume Handbook 133 - 2019 90 To determine Average Piece Length (APL) for the package: APL = (L1 + L2 + L3 + Ln) \u00f7 (Number of Pieces in Sample) 7. Use the average values for height, width, and length to calculate the volume of wood in the box. Volume in liters = (height in mm \u00d7 width in mm \u00d7 length in mm) \u00f7 1,000,000 Volume in cubic feet = (height in inches \u00d7 width in inches \u00d7 length in inches) \u00f7 (1728) Note: 1 cubic foot = 1728 in3, 1 cubic liter = 1,000,000 L3 8. For boxes of wood that are packed with the wood ranked in two discrete sections perpendicular to each other, calculate the volume of wood in the box as follows: (1) determine the average height, width, and length as in 1, 2, and 3 above for each discrete section, compute total volume, and (2) total the calculated volumes of the two sections. Compute total volume by adding Volume 1 (V 1) and Volume 2 (V 2) according to the following formula. Total Volume = V1 + V2 This illustration shows how the width of the firewood is measured when two perpendicular stacks of firewood are in a box. The height, width, and length of the pieces are used to determine the volume of the separate stacks which are then added together to obtain the volume of wood in the package. Bulk deliveries of firewood are typically required by law or regulation to be on the basis of cord measurements. The \"cord\" is defined as the amount of wood contained in a space of 128 ft3 when the wood is ranked and well stowed. The standard dimensions for a cord of wood are 4 ft (height) \u00d7 4 ft Volume 1 Volume 2 _____________________________________________________________________________________________________ This publication is available free of charge from: https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.HB.133-2019Handbook 133 - 2019 Chapter 3.

See Figure 3-11. \"A Cord of Wood \" for an illustration of how a cord may be stacked. 1. Wood Delivered to a Consumer. If a delivery ticket or sales receipt is available (these are often required by state regulation), review the delivery ticket or sales receipt and determine the quantity delivered. Identify the wood to be measured and verify the wood delivered was not mixed with wood that was already present at the location. Also, determine if the delivery was partial or complete (i.e., no additional deliveries are expected) and if any of the delivered wood has been used. If necessary, stack the firewood in a ranked and well- stowed geometrical shape that facilitates volume calculations (i.e., rectangular). Any voids that will accommodate a piece of wood in the stack shall be deducted from the measured volume. Note: The length measurements of the individual pieces may be made during the stacking process. 2. Determine the Average Measurements of the Stack. The number of measurements for each dimension given below is the minimum that should be taken. Height of Stack . A height measurement is the vertical distance between the top edge of a piece of wood in the top row and the bottom edge of a piece of wood on the bottom row. Start at one end of the front of the stack; measure the height of the stack at five equally spaced intervals (e.g., approximately 18 in to 24 in) along the length of stack. If the length of the stack is over 10 ft, take additional height measurements at equally spaced intervals along its length. If the height of the stack varies significantly (e.g., the pieces are stacked in peaks along the length of the stack), take additional height measurements. Calculate and record the average height for the front of the stack. Repeat the same height measurement procedure along the back of the stack and then cal culate and record the average height for the back of the stack. Calculate the average height of the stack by averaging the two results. If the wood to be measured is stacked on a slope, take the height measurements at right - angles to the slope. Average Height Front = (h 1 + h2 + h3 + h 4 + h5) \u00f7 5 Average Height Back = (h 1 + h2 + h3 +h4 + h5) \u00f7 5 Average Height of Stack = Average Height Front + Average Height Back \u00f7 2 Figure 3 -11.

A cord of wood measures Length (8 ft) \u00d7 Width (4 ft) \u00d7 Height ( 4 ft). _____________________________________________________________________________________________________ This publication is available free of charge from: https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.HB.133-2019Chapter 3. Test Procedures - For Packages Labeled by Volume Handbook 133 - 2019 92 Average Height Measurement (front and back) Length of Stack . A length measurement is the horizontal distance between the left edge of a piece of wood on the left side of the stack and the right edge of a piece of wood on the opposite side of the stack. Start at either side of the stack; measure the length of the stack in five equal intervals. Calculate and record the average length. If the length of the stack varies significantly (e.g., the ends of the stack bulge out along the height of the stack), take additional measurements. Average Length Measure ment (fro nt and back) Calculate and r ecord the Average Length or the Front of the Stack. Repeat the length measurement procedure along the back of the stack and then calculate and record the average length for the stack. Average Stack Length Front = (l1 + l2 + l3 + l4 + l5) \u00f7 5 Average Stack Length Back = (l 1 + l2 + l3 + l4 + l5) \u00f7 5 Average Stack Length = (Average Length Front + Average Length Back ) \u00f7 2 Width of Stack. This is equal to the Average Length of Pieces that make up the Width of the Stack. Refer to Table 3 -5. \"Minimum Number of Pieces to be Measured for Length\" to determine how many pieces are to be measured. This dimension is calculated by averaging the length of individual pieces of wood in the stack. The wood can be stacked in a single or multiple rows. If the wood is stacked in several rows deep, select a _____________________________________________________________________________________________________ This publication is available free of charge from: https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.HB.133-2019Handbook 133 - 2019 Chapter 3. Test Procedures - For Packages Labeled by Volume 93 representative random sample from each row. If the wood needs to be stacked, measure the pieces prior to stacking. If the wood is already stacked, select the pieces at random by moving up and down and across the stack. If it is necessary to remove the wood from a stack to measure the individual piece lengths, always complete the heig ht and length measurements before disturbing the stacked wood. 3. Individual Piece Length. Table 3- 5. \"Minimum Number of Pieces to be Measured for Length\" requires that at least 12 pieces of wood be measured for every half cord estimated to be in the stack. If the wood is uniform in shape, take at least one point -to-point measurement along the center line of the longitudinal axis (See Table 3- 6. \"Determining Piece Length, (a) \"Uniform Shape\" for examples) and record the value. If the wood is irregularly shaped ( See Table 3 -6. \"Determining Piece Length, (b) Irregular Shape\" for examples), take at least three measurements along a straight line between two points crossing solid wood that appear to be the shortest and longest dimensions, and a third at or near the center line of the piece. Calculate the average of the measurements to determine Average Individual Piece Length (AIPL) of irregularly shaped pieces: AIPL = (L 1 + L2 + L3) \u00f7 3 After all the pieces are measured, total the lengths and divide the total by the number of samples to obtain the Average Piece Length for the stack. To determine Average Piece Length (APL) for the package: APL = (L1 + L2 + L3 + ... L n) \u00f7 (Number of Pieces in Sample) 4. Calculate Volume. Volume in liters = (Avg. Height [cm] \u00d7 Avg.

To calculate the volume of a triangular stack , take at least two measurements (one each side) of the height and length, and five measurements of the width of the stack and average each result. Use this formula to calculate the volume. Volume of Triangular Stack = (Avg. Height \u00d7 Avg. Length of Base \u00d7 Avg. Width) \u00f7 2 The volume of the triangular stack may be added to the volume of other stacks. _____________________________________________________________________________________________________ This publication is available free of charge from: https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.HB.133-2019Chapter 3. Test Procedures - For Packages Labeled by Volume Handbook 133 - 2019 94 3.14.3. Field Audit Procedure - Bundle d and Bag ged Firewood A circumference estimating method can be used for quickly identifying potentially short measure bundles. The procedure is based on measuring the circumference of the package ends and calculating the areas without using graph paper. It shall be used for audit purposes only and must not be used for official inspection. 1. After the bundle or bag is secured, use a flexible measuring tape to measure the circumference near each end of the bundle or bag of firewood. Using one movement, extend the measuring tape around the end of the bundle or bag to obtain its circumference. The tape must be pulled tight. If the wood at the ends of a bag or bundle is not accessible due to plastic wrapping, the wrapping should be moved away from the ends so the measuring tape can be placed tightly around the bundle so circumference measurements can be taken.

Calculate the Average Circumference: Average Circumference = (circumference 1 + circumference 2) \u00f7 2 Example: If circumference 1 is 34 in and circumference 2 is 33.75 in then: Average Circumference: 34 + 33.75 \u00f7 2 = 33.875 in 3. Calculate the Radius: Radius = Average Circumference \u00f7 2 Where: = radius = 33.875 \u00f7 (2 \u00d7 or 6.283) = 5.39 in 4. Calculate the Average Area Average Area = r\u00b2 Example: Average Area = 3.1415 \u00d7 5.392 (or 29.06) = 91.3 in2 5. Calculate the Average Length of the Pieces: Average length of the pieces of wood - measure the length of several pieces of wood in the bundle or bag. Measurements are to be taken from center to center at the end of each piece. Then calculate the average: Average length = sum of the length of all pieces \u00f7 number of pieces Figure 3-13b.

Follow Section 2.3.1. \"Define the Inspection Lot.\" Use a \"Category A\" sampling plan in the inspection; and select a random sample. Figures 3 -14. Firewood Bundle and Bag. Test Note: To test a bag of firewood remove the wood from the bag and form a compact bundle and strap it as shown in Figure 3-15. \"Bundle with Straps Placed at 10 cm (4 in) ,\" and follow the procedures for measuring a bundle. _____________________________________________________________________________________________________ This publication is available free of charge from: https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.HB.133-2019Handbook 133 - 2019 Chapter 3. Test Procedures - For Packages Labeled by Volume 97 2. Average Area of Bundle Ends: Place a binding strap around each end of the bundle (or bag of wood) to prevent movement of the pieces during test. Place the straps approximately 10 cm (4 in) from the ends (See Figure 3-15. \" Bundle with Straps Placed at 10 cm ( 4 in)\" and tighten them securely. Set one end of the bundle or bag on graph paper large enough to cover the end completely. Draw a line around the outside of the wood perimeter on the graph paper using a sharp point marking pen (see Figure 3-16. \" Tracing Perimeter of the Wood \"). Count the number of square centimeters or square inches that are enclosed within the perimeter line. Determine portions of square centimeters or square inches not com pletely within the perimeter line to the nearest one -quarter square inch. Repeat this process on the opposite end of the bundle or bag. Notice: Do not use shrink wrap or packaging to define the perimeter because it can result in inaccurate measurements. If necessary, trim the shrink wrap back from the ends to allow for the bundle to sit flat on the graph paper.Figure 3 -15 Bundle with Straps Placed a t 10 cm (4 in). _____________________________________________________________________________________________________ This publication is available free of charge from: https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.HB.133-2019Chapter 3. Test Procedures - For Packages Labeled by Volume Handbook 133 - 2019 98 Figures 3 -16. Tracing the Perimeter of the Wood. Example s: (1) Using 1/4 sq in graph paper and a ruler with 1/4 in graduations, large blocks of the area within the perimeter are quickly measured. This is done by using the ruler to determine the length and then width of the area which are each divided by 0.25 (1/4 in) {or multiply 4 \u00d7 7.25} to obtain the number of bloc ks in that dimension. These two values are multiplied to obtain the total number of blocks enclosed in the area. The areas in the partially covered blocks are rounded up or down to the nearest 1/4 in by enclosing the whole square and placing an \"x\" in the partial spaces which are included in the blocks where the area has been rounded up. One reason for squaring the graph squares is to simplify the counting. (2) Use a ruler to count graph squares, the rulers in Figure 3-17. \"Perimeter of a Bundle as Defined by the Wood\" indicate the dimensions of the square are 71/4 \u00d7 73/4 in. To obtain the number of blocks divide 7.25 by 0.25 {or multiply 4 \u00d7 7.25}. T o obtain the number of blocks along the left hand line (7.25 \u00f7 0.25 = 29). The bottom line measures 73/4 in so 7.75 \u00f7 0.25 = 31 {or 4 \u00d7 7.75 = 31}. Multiple the two values to obtain the total number of squares within the area which is: 29 \u00d7 31 = 899. To obtain square inches divide 899 by 16 (the number of 1/4 in graph squares in a square inch) or 899 \u00f7 16 = for area of 56.19 in2 for this area of the bundle. (3) Continue to divide the area into blocks to make counting easier and then count the blocks in the remaining areas and sum these values to obtain the total. See the example in Figure 3-17. \"Perimeter of a Bundle of asDefined by the Wood.\" The total number of blocks was calculated by adding: _____________________________________________________________________________________________________ This publication is available free of charge from: https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.HB.133-2019Handbook 133 - 2019 Chapter 3.

Calculate the Average Area: Average Area = (Area 1 + Area 2) \u00f7 2 Figure 3 -17. Perimeter of a Bundle as Defined by the Wood . 3. Average Length of the Pieces of Wood. Individual piece length, remove the wood from the package and measure the length of each piece of wood (see Table 3-5. \"Minimum Number of Pieces to be Measured for Length\" for the number of pieces to be measured.) If the piece of wood is uniform in shape, take at least one point -to-point measurement along the center line of the longitudinal axis (see Table 3-6. \" Determining Piece Length, \" (a) Uniform Shapes for examples) and record the value. If the wood is irregularly shaped (see Table 3 -6. \"Determining Piece Length, \" (b) Irregular Shapes for examples), t ake at least three measurements along a straight line between two points crossing solid wood that appear to be the shortest and longest dimensions, and a third at or near the center -line of the piece. Calculate the average of the measurements to obtain the Average Individual Piece Length and record the length of the piece. To determine Average Individual Piece Length (AIPL) of irregularly shaped pieces: AIPL = (L1 + L2 + L3) \u00f7 3 Note: If length measurements are made in millimeters divide the total by 10 to obtain centimeters.

Testing Chutes) may be constructed using hinges and pins so that they lie flat for transporting. They can be constructed of sheet metal or with other slick surface material which enable the bedding to flow easily. The construction of the chutes used i n this study allows the sides to move in or out slightly so that the bedding does not become clogged at the outlet. The heights and lengths may be adjusted slightly to fit into vehicles for transport but the widths should not be reduced because narrowing the opening can restrict material flow and result in \"bridging\" where the bedding collects and creates a block. Also, the width should be kept smaller than the opening of the test measure so that spillage does not occur during pouring. Illustration 1.

Rectangular and Square Based Dry Measures are typically constructed of 12.7 mm to 19.05 mm (0.5 in to 0.75 in) marine plywood. A 4.76 mm (3/16 in) transparent sidewall is useful for determining the level of fill, but must be reinforced or be made of thicker material if it distorts when the measure is filled. If the measure has a clear front, place the level gage at the back (inside) of the measure so that the markings are read over the top of the animal bedding. Any of these measures may be made without an attached bottom for ease of emptying if they are plac ed on a solid level base during filling and measurement. b. Other size measures may be used if calibrated and the volume equivalence of the increment of 1.0 mm is no greater than 1/6 the MAV. Widening the base of a measure reduces the column height of the product and will reduce compression but the trade- off is that the larger surface area increases the volume so the potential for measurement errors increase. One of the benefits of the cylindrical design is that, in addition to eliminating the 90 degree angles of the corners where gaps in fill frequently occur, the surface area of a cylinder is less than an equal volume square measure and that results in better resolution in the volume measurements (i.e., compare the readability of a 24 in sq box which has a surface area of 576 in2, to the 24 in cylinder which has a surface area of 433 in2). The height of the test measure may be reduced, but this will limit the volume of the package that can be tested. c. If lines are marked in any test measures, they sho uld extend around all sides of the measure if possible to improve readability. It is recommended that a line indicating the MAV level also be marked to reduce the possibility of reading errors when the level of the product is at or near the MAV. d. If the measures are built to the dimensions shown above, the actual volume of most of the measures will be larger than the nominal volume so that plus errors (overfill) can be measured accurately.

Test Procedure Test Notes : Rounding: When a volume measurement falls between graduations on a ruler, round the value in the direction that favors the packer. This practice eliminates the issue of rounding from the volume determination and provides packagers the benefit of the doubt. The ruler graduation is 1.0 mm so the rounding error will be limited to 0.5 mm or less. It is good practice to circle a measurement that has been rounded up or make a statement to such effect so that it becomes a part of the inspection record. Safety Precauti ons: This procedure does not address all of the safety issues that users need to be aware of in order to carry out the following tasks. Users are sometimes required to conduct test in warehouse spaces or retail stores where fork -trucks are in motion - c are must be taken to warn others to avoid or exercise care around the test site. The procedure requires users to lift heavy objects including large bulky packages and test measures and includes the use of sharp instruments to obtain packages from shrink -wrapped pallets. Users may be required to climb ladders or work platforms to obtain packages. When opening and emptying packages, dust, and other particles may be present or escape from the packages which may cause eye injuries and respiratory or other health problems. Users must utilize appropriate safety equipment and exercise good safety practice. If safe working conditions cannot be ensured, suspend testing until the situation is corrected. 1. Follow Section 2.3.1. \"Define the Inspection Lot\" select \" Category A, Sampling Plan\" in this inspection. Determine the Sample Size based on the size of the Inspection Lot using Category A. Collect the sample packages from the Inspection Lot using Section 2.3.4. \"Random Sampling Selection.\" Test Notes : (1) Place t he test equipment and sample packages in a location where there is adequate lighting and ample space around the packages and equipment so the packages can be opened and the chutes and test measures used safely. (2) If the package is not labeled with a usable v olume, it is opened and the contents are poured directly into the test measure. Optional - Audit Screening by Weight The full test procedure requires that all of the packages be opened for testing. Regardless of the type of bedding, the product cannot be returned to the original package. An alternative gravimetric auditing procedure may be used to reduce the amount of destructive testing and conserve inspection resources. Audit Procedure: After randomly selecting the sample packages from the Inspection Lot, obtain the gross weight for each package. Select the lightest and heaviest packages and conduct a usable volum etric test these two packages. If the lightest and heaviest packages pass (i.e., each contains _____________________________________________________________________________________________________ This publication is available free of charge from: https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.HB.133-2019Chapter 3. Test Procedures - For Packages Labeled by Volume Handbook 133 - 2019 106 at least the useable volume declared on the label), it is highly likely that the remaining packages in the sample will also pass. Accept these two package samples as an AUDIT TEST and move on to inspect other types of bedding or Inspection Lots of other types or brands of bedding. If either of the two packages is found to have a minus error that exceeds the Maximum Allowable Variation, the sample fails. No fur ther testing is required (i.e., assuming no MAV is allowed for the sample size (see Appendix A, Table 2- 1. \"Sampling Plans for Category A\".) If either of the packages is found to have a minus error that does not exceed the MAV, continue to test all of the packages and take action based on the final results from the complete sample. Test Note: If the gravimetric audit procedure is used, ensure the scale is placed on a solid level support , and its accuracy has been verified to a test load that is at least 10 % more than the gross weight of the packages (e.g., to estimate th e load, place one of the packages on the scale and then test the scale with a load above the package's gross weight). See Section 2.2. \"Measurement Standards and Test Equipment\" for additional information. 2. Select the appropriate test measure for the package size. Spread a tarp large enough to hold a chute and test measure. Place the chute and test measure on the tarp. Verify that the test measure is level. 3. Select a chute of appropriate capacity (see Table 1) for the package size and position it on the tarp. 4. Open the packaging, uncompressing and pouring the bedding into the test measure twic e. Open Package: Place the package in the chute and use a knife or box cutter to open and remove the wrapper. Spread the bedding uniformly along the length of the chute. The bedding is uncompressed in two steps. The first step is to loosen the clumps of bedding by gently pulling them apart (do not tear the fibers of cellulose bedding or \"grind\" any bedding between your hands because these practices break the material down). Spread your fingers and pick the material up using your hands from beneath to loosen it up. There should be no clumps of bedding in the chute. If any bedding has fallen out of the chute onto the tarp, collect it and return it to the chute. The following pictures illustrate this step of the procedure. The second step of the expanded volume recovery process is to pour the bedding into a test measure as described in Step 2. _____________________________________________________________________________________________________ This publication is available free of charge from: https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.HB.133-2019Handbook 133 - 2019 Chapter 3.

First Pour: The first pour into the test measure is only used to further un- compress the bedding so no measurements are taken. Hold the chute above the test measure and tilt it so that you pour the bedding into the center of the test measure. The bedding should be poured slowly into the test measure in one continuous stream and not \"dumped\" (if it is \"dumped\" or poured too quickly some of the bedding will blow out of the measure or the bedding will be packed down and its volume reduced). The flow rate should be controlled by the tilt angle of the chute. The chute itself can be shaken but DO NOT HIT OR SHAKE THE TEST MEASURE. Also, do not touch the product to facilitate flow. (Do not adjust the flow by closing the opening of the chute as that may cause the beddin g to heap up and then fall into the measure in clumps , which may result in impact compression). Empty the bedding back into the chute and spread it out evenly along its length. _____________________________________________________________________________________________________ This publication is available free of charge from: https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.HB.133-2019Chapter 3.

Cradle the chute on one arm while holding it with one hand and tilting the cradle with the other hand. Second Pour: The second pour into the test measure is used to make the volume determination. Hold the chute above the test measur e and tilt it so that you pour the bedding into the center of the test measure. The bedding should be poured slowly into the test measure in one continuous stream and not \"dumped.\" The flow rate should be controlled by the tilt angle of the chute. The c hute can be shaken but DO NOT HIT OR SHAKE THE TEST MEASURE. Test Note: Stop filling the measure if it appears that the test measure will overflow. The overflow product should be measured separately (use a smaller test measure of adequate size and capacity if one is available) and the multiple measurement volumes are added. If pouring into a square test measure, pour at an angle to two corners for the widest opening (see Figure 3 -24. \"Filling a Test Measure\"). _____________________________________________________________________________________________________ This publication is available free of charge from: https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.HB.133-2019Handbook 133 - 2019 Chapter 3.

THEN: Calculate the Total Error (Enter in Box 8. \"Total Error\"). (Amended 2016) 3.15.3. Evaluation of the Test Results and Determination of Pass or Fail 1. Determine if any of the minus package errors exceeds the MAV. Apply a MAV value of 5 % (0.05 \u00d7 labeled expanded volume) to single measurement volume determinations. If none of the minus package errors exceeds the MAV, go to Step 3. If any of the minus package errors exceed the MAV, enter the number of packages in Box 9 \"Number of Unreasonable Minus Errors\". Go to Box 10 \"Is Box 9 Greater than Box 7?\" and determine if the value exceeds the number in Box 7 \"Number of Unreasonable Package Errors Allowed fo r Sample Size\". If the number of packages with unreasonable errors exceeds the number permitted in Box 7 \"Number of Unreasonable Package Errors Allowed for Sample Size,\" the sample fails. Go to Box 17 \"Disposition of the Inspection Lot\" and reject the In spection Lot. 2. Calculate the Average Error for the sample by dividing Box 8 \"Total Error,\" by Box 6 \"Sample Size\" and enter the value in Box 11 \"Calculate Average Error,\" then go Box 12 \"Does Box 11 equal Zero or Plus?\" If the Average Error is zero or a po sitive number the sample passes, go to Box 17 \"Disposition of the Inspection Lot\" and approve the inspection lot.

Test Procedures - Packages Labeled by Count , Linear Measure, Area, Thickness, and Combinations of Quantities 4.1. Scope The following procedures should be used to determine the net contents of products sold by count, area, thickness, and linear measure. If a package includes more than one declaration of quantity, each declaration must mee t the package requirements. A gravimetric procedure may be used to test products sold by measure or count if the density of the product does not vary excessively from one package to another. If the gravimetric procedure cannot be used, each package in the sample must be opened to measure or count the contents. 4.2. Packages L abeled by C ount If the labeled count is 50 items or fewer, use Section 4.2.1. \"Packages Labeled with 50 Items or Fewer .\" If the labeled count is more than 50 items, see Section 4.2.2. \"Packages Labeled by Count of More than 50 Items.\" If the labeled count is more than 50 items for corn, soybeans, field beans, and wheat seeds, see Section 4.9. \"Procedure for Checking the Contents of Specific Agricultural Seed Packages Labeled by Count.\" 4.2.1. Packages Labeled with 50 Items or Fewer 4.2.1.1. Test E quipment None. 4.2.1.2. Test Procedure 1. Follow Section 2.3.1. \"Define the Inspection Lot.\" Use \" the sampling plan s in Appendix A.

Refer to Column 2 to determine the number of packages that are allowed to contain fewer than the labeled count. 2. If the number of packages in the sample that contain fewer than the labeled count exceeds the number permitted in Column 2, the sample and the lot fail to meet the package requirement. _____________________________________________________________________________________________________ This publication is available free of charge from: https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.HB.133-2019Chapter 4. Test Procedures - Packages Labeled by Count, Linear Handbook 133 - 2019 Measure, Area, Thickness, and Combinations of Quantities 118 Note: For statistical reasons, the average requirement does not apply to packages labeled by count of 50 or fewer items, and the MAV does not apply to the lot . It only applies to the packages in the sample. 3. Maximum Allowable Variations: The MAVs listed in Appendix A, Table 2-7. \"Maximum Allowable Variations (MAVs) for Packages Labeled by Count\" define the limits of reasonable variation for an individu al package even though the MAV is not directly used in the sampling plan. Individual packages that are undercount by more than the MAV are considered defective. Even if the sample passes, these should be repacked, relabeled, or otherwise handled. Example: If testing a lot of 160 packages of pencils labeled \"50 pencils,\" choose a random sample of 12 packages from the lot. If the scale cannot discriminate between differences in count, open every package and count the pencils. For example, assume the 12 package counts are: 50, 52, 50, 50, 51, 53, 52, 50, 50, 50, 47, and 50. Because only one package contains fewer than 50 pencils, the sample passes the test (refer to Appendix A. Table 2-11. \"Accuracy Requirements for Packages Labeled by Low Count [50 or Fewer] and Packages Given Tolerances [Glass and Stemware]\"). However, the package containing 47 pencils should not be introduced into commerce even though the lot complies with the package requirements because it is undercount by more than the MAV (1 item) permitted in Appendix A, Table 2-7. \"Maximum Allowable Variations (MAVs) for Packages Labeled by Count.\" (Amended 2010) 4.2.2. Packages L abeled by C ount of More than 50 I tems There ar e two procedures to determine count without opening all packages in the sample. The first is an audit procedure and the second is recommended for determining compliance and taking legal action. Both use the weight of a counted number of items in the pack age. If the weight of discrete items or numbers of items in a package varies excessively , the packaged items must be counted rather than weighed. To determine if a gravimetric procedure can be used to inspect packages labeled by count, follow the steps be low. 4.2.2.1. Test Equipment Scale that meets the requirements in Section 2.2. \"Measurement Standards and Test Equipment.\" Scale Sensitivity: First, determine if the scale being used is sensitive enough to determine the weight of individual items by doing the following: _____________________________________________________________________________________________________ This publication is available free of charge from: https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.HB.133-2019Handbook 133 - 2019 Chapter 4. Test Procedures - Packages Labeled by Count, Linear Measure, Area, Thickness, and Combinations of Quantities 119 1. For packages labeled with a count of 84 or higher, calculate the weight equivalent for the MAV/6 for the labeled count of the package. MAV/6 must be at least equal to one -half scale division on a mechanical scale or one division on a digital scale. 2. For packages with a labeled count of 83 or fewer, when each unit weighs at least two-scale divisions, consider the scale acceptable. Example: According to Appendix A, Table 2-7. \" Maximum Allowable Variations (MAVs) for Packages Labeled by Count,\" the MAV is 7 for a package labeled with a count of 250 items. The scale should be capable of measuring differences corresponding to MAV/6 or, in this exa mple, the weight of one item. If the scale meets the appropriate requirement, gravimetric testing can be used to determine package count or, If the scale does not meet the criteria, count the content in each package in the sample. 4.2.2.2. Test Procedures Audit Procedure Use this procedure to audit lots of packages labeled by count of more than 50 items but not for determining lot compliance . Determine the lot compliance based on actual count or by using the \"Violation Procedure\" (b) . Note: The precision of this procedure is only \u00b1 1 %. 1. Follow Section 2.3.1. \"Define the Inspection Lot.\" Use a \"Category A\" sampling plan in the inspection; and select a random sample . 2. Select an initial tare sample according to Section 2.3.5.1. \"Determination of Tare Sample and Average Tare Weight .\" 3. Gross weigh the first package in the tare sample and record this weight. 4. Select the number of items from the first tare package that weighs the greater: 10 % of the labeled count; or a quantity equal to at least 50 minimum divisions on the scale. Example: Using a scale with 1 g divisions, the selected count must weigh at least 50 grams. If a scale with 0.001 lb divisions is used, the selected count must weigh at least 0.05 lb. Record the count and weight. _____________________________________________________________________________________________________ This publication is available free of charge from: https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.HB.133-2019Chapter 4. Test Procedures - Packages Labeled by Count, Linear Handbook 133 - 2019 Measure, Area, Thickness, and Combinations of Quantities 120 5. Calculate the weight of the labeled count using the following formula: Weight of the Labeled Count = (labeled count \u00d7 weight of items in Step 4) \u00f7 (Count of items in Step 4) Record the result as \"labeled count weight.\" 6. Gross weigh the remaining packages of the tare sample and keep contents of opened packages separated in case all of the items must be counted. 7. Determine the Average Used Dry Tare Weight of the sample according to Sec tion 2.3.5.1. \"Determination of Tare Sample and Average Tare Weight .\" 8. Record the nominal gross weight by adding t he weight of the labeled count and the average tare weight . 9. Subtract the nominal gross weight from the gross weight of the individual packages and record the errors. (Package error [weight]) = (actual package gross weight) (nominal gross weight ) 10. Convert the package errors in units of weight to count using the following formula : Package error (count) = (Package error [weight] \u00d7 labeled count) \u00f7 (labeled count weight) Round any fractional counts up to whole items in favor of the packager. Record the package error in units of count. 11. Compute the average error. If the average error is minus, go to the \" Violation Procedure \" below. If the average error is zero or positive, the sample is presumed to conform to the package requirements. Violation Procedure If possible, use the gravimetric procedure to determine compliance, to minimize the number of packages to be opened . This procedure combines the measurement of the weight of the number of units in the package with the determination of tare. Therefore, it will not be necessary to open more packages than the tare sample. If the audit procedure in this section has been used, the procedure below can be followed with the same sample if package contents have been kept separate and can still be counted. Use the following procedure to determine if the sample passes or fails. 1. Follow Section 2.3.1. \"Define the Inspection Lot.\" Use a \"Category A\" sampling plan in the inspection; select a random sample. 2. Select an initial tare sample according to Section 2.3.5.1. \"Determination of Tare Sample and Average Tare Weight .\" _____________________________________________________________________________________________________ This publication is available free of charge from: https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.HB.133-2019Handbook 133 - 2019 Chapter 4. Test Procedures - Packages Labeled by Count, Linear Measure, Area, Thickness, and Combinations of Quantities 121 3. Gross weigh the packages selected for the tare sample and record these weights. Open these packages and determine the tare and net weights of the contents, and count the exact number of items in the packages. Record this information. 4. Calculate and record the weights of the labeled counts for the first two packages using the formula: Weight of labeled count = (labeled count) \u00d7 (contents weight \u00f7 contents count) To avoid round off errors, carry at least two extra decimal places in the calculation until the weight of the labeled count is obtained. To use the gravimetric procedure, the difference in weights of the labeled counts of the two packages must not exceed one scale division. If the difference in weights exceeds this criterion, determine the actual count per package for every package in the sample recording plus and minus errors. Then, follow the procedures in Section 2.3.7. \"Evaluat e for Compliance\" to determine lot conformance. If the difference is within the criterion, average the weights of the labeled count and go on to Step 5. 5. Determine the Average Used Dry Tare Weight of the sample according to provisions in Section 2.3.5.1. \"Determination of Tare Sample and Average Tare Weight .\" 6. Determine and record the nominal gross weight by adding the average weight of the labeled count of items in the package Step 4 to the average tare weight Step 5. 7. Weigh the remaining packages in the sample, subtract the nominal gross weight from the gross weight of the individual packages, and record the errors. Package Error (weight) = (Actual Package Gross Weight) (Nominal Gross Weight) 8. Look up the MAV for the package size from Appendix A, Table 2-7. \"Maximum Allowable Variations (MAVs) for Packages Labeled by Count\" and convert it to weight using the formula: MAV (weight) = (MAV (count) \u00d7 Average W eight of Labeled Count [from Step 4]) \u00f7 (Labeled Count) 9. Convert the MAV to dimensionless units by dividing the MAV (weight) by the unit of measure and record. _____________________________________________________________________________________________________ This publication is available free of charge from: https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.HB.133-2019Chapter 4.

Paper Plates and Sanitary P aper Products The following procedure is used t o verify the size of paper plates and other sanitary paper products. It may also be used to verify the size declarations of other disposable dinnerware. Note: Do not distort the item's shape during measurement. The count of sanitary paper products cannot be adequately determined by weighing. Variability in sheet weight and core weight requires that official tests be conducted by actual count. However, weighing can be a useful audit method. These products often declare total area as well as unit count a nd sheet size. If the actual sheet size measurements and the actual count comply with the average requirements, the total area declaration is assumed correct. 4.3.1. Test E quipment Steel tapes and ruler s. Determine measurements of length to the nearest division of the appropriate tape or ruler . Metric units: For labeled dimensions 400 m m or less, l inear measure: 3 00 m m in length, 1 mm divisions; or a 1 m ruler with 0.1 mm divisions, overall length tolerance of 0.4 mm. For la beled dimensions greater than 400 mm, 30 m tape with 1 mm divisions. U.S. customary units: For labeled dimensions 25 in or less, use a 36 in ruler with 1/64 in or 1/100 in divisions and an overall length tolerance of 1/64 in. For dimensions greater than 25 in, use a 100 ft tape with 1/16 in divisions and an overall length tolerance of 0.1 in. Measuring Base Note: A measuring base may be made of any flat, sturdy material approximately 38 cm ( 15 in) square. Two vertical side pieces approximately 3 0 mm (1 in) high and the same length as the sides of the measuring base are attached along two adjoining edges of the measuring base to form a 90\u00b0 corner. Trim all white borders from two or more sheets of graph paper ( at least 380 mm, 10 divisions per centimeter or 20 divisions per inch). Place one sheet on the measuring base and position it so that one corner of graph paper is snug in the corner of the measuring base and vertical sides. Tape the sheet to the measuring base. Overlap other sheets on the first sh eet so that the lines of top and bottom sheet _____________________________________________________________________________________________________ This publication is available free of charge from: https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.HB.133-2019Handbook 133 - 2019 Chapter 4.

Number each line from the top and left side of base plates: 1, 2, 3, etc. 4.3.2. Test Procedure 1.* Follow Section 2.3.1. \"Define the Inspection Lot.\" Use a \"Category A\" sampling plan in the inspection; select a random sample . 2.* Select an initial tare sample according to Section 2.3.5.1. \"Determination of Tare Sample and Average Tare Weight .\" 3. Open each package and select one item from each. Note s: (1) Some packages of plates contain a combination of different- sized plates. In this instance, take a plate of each declared size from the package to represent all the plates of that size in the package. For example, if three sizes are declared, select three different plates from each package. (2) Occasionally, packages of plates declared to be one size contain plates that can be seen by inspect ion to be of different sizes in the same package. In this instance, select the smallest plate and use the methods below to determine the package error . If the smallest plate is not short measure by more than the MAV, measure each size of plate in the package and ca lculate the average dimensions. Example: If five plates measure 21.41 cm (8.43 in) and 15 measure 21.74 cm (8.56 in), the average dimension for this package of 20 plates is 21.66 cm (8.53 in). 4. For paper plates: Place e ach item on the measuring base plate (or use the linear measure) with the eating surface down so two sides of the plate touch the sides of the measuring base. 5. For other products : Use either the measuring base or a linear measure to determine actual labeled dimensions (e.g., packages of napkins, rolls of paper towels). If testing folded products, be sure that the folds are pressed flat so that the measurement is accurate. 6. If the measurements reveal that the dimensions of the individual items vary, select at least 10 items from each package. Measure and average these dimensions. Use the average dimensions to determine package error in Step 7 below. 7. The package error equals the actual dimensions minus the labeled dimensions. 4.3.3.

Follow Section 2.3.1. \"Define the Inspection Lot.\" Use a \"Category A\" sampling plan in the inspec tion; select a random sample. 2. Be sure the product is not mislabeled . Check the label declaration to confirm that all of the declared dimensions are consistent with the required standards. The declaration on sheeting, film, and bags shall be equal to or greater than the weight calculated by using the formulas below. For values less than 453.6 kg (1000 lb), the final value shall be calculated to at least four digits and declared to three dig its, truncating the final digits as calculated (e.g., a calculated value of 943.1 g [2.079 lb] is truncated to 943 g value of 14.92 kg (32.89 lb) is truncated to 14.9 kg (32.8 lb), a calculated value of 124.4. kg (274.2 lb) is truncated to 124 kg (274 lb). For values of 453.6 kg (1000 lb) or more, the final value shall be calculated to at least five digits and declared to four digits, truncating the final digits as calculated (e.g., a calculated value of 570.44 kg [1257.6 lb] is truncated to 570.4 kg [1257 lb]).

If the density (D)* value is not declared , use t he following as appropriate: For linear low density polyethylene plastics (LLPDE) , the minimum density (D) shall be 0.92 g/cm3 (when D is not known). For linear medium density polyethylene plastics (LMDPE), the minimum density (D) shall be 0.93 g/cm3 (when D is not known). For high density polyethylene plastics (HDPE), the minimum density (D) shall be 0.94 g/cm3 (when D is not known). *Determined by the latest versions of ASTM Standard D1505, \"Standard Method of Test for Density of Plastics by the Density -Gradient Technique\" and the ASTM Standard D883, \"Standard Terminology Relating to Plastics.\" U.S. Customary Dimensions: Target Weight in Pounds = T \u00d7 A \u00d7 D \u00d7 0.036 13 Where: T = nominal thickness in inches; A = nominal area; that is the nominal length in inches \u00d7 nominal width (the nominal width for bags is twice the labeled width) in inches; D = minimum density in grams per cubic centimeter; 0.036 13 is a factor for converting g/ cm3 to lb/in3 4.

Select packages for tare samples according to Section 2.3.5.1. \"Determination of Tare Sample and Average Tare Weight.\" 6. Determine and record the gross weights of the initial tare sample. 7. Extend the product in the sample packages to their full dimensions and remove by hand all creases and folds. 8. Measure the length and width of the product to the closest 3 mm (1/8 in). Make all measurements at intervals uniformly di stributed along the length and width of the sample and record the results. Compute the average length and width, and record. With rolls of product, measure the length of the roll at three points along the width of each roll and measure the width at a min imum of 10 points along the length of each roll. For folded products, such as drop cloths or tarpaulins, make three length measurements along the width of the sample and three width measurements along the length of the sample. 9. Determine and record the aver age tare weight according to Section 2.3.5.1. \"Determination of Tare Sample and Average Tare Weight.\" 10. Follow the procedures in Section 2.3.7. \"Evaluate for Compliance\" to determine the lot conformance requirements for length, width, and weight. 11. If the sample failed to meet the package requirements for any of these declarations, no further measurements are necessary. The lot fails to conform. Note: If the sample meets the package requirements for the declarations of length, width , and weight proceed to Step 12 to verifying the thickness declaration. 12. Measure the thickness of the plastic sheet with a micrometer using the following guide. Place the micrometer on a solid level surface. If the dial does not read zero with nothing bet ween the anvil and the spindle head, set it at zero. Raise and lower the spindle head or probe several times; it should indicate zero each time. If it does not, find and correct the cause before proceeding. 13. Take measurements at five uniformly distributed locations across the width at each end and five locations along each side of each roll in the sample. If this is not possible, take measurements at five uniformly distributed locations across the width of the product for each package in the sample. 14. When measuring the thickness, place the sample between the micrometer surfaces and lower the spindle head or probe near, but outside, the area where the measurement will be made. Raise the spindle head or probe a distance of 0.008 mm to 0.01 mm (0.000 3 in to 0.000 4 in) _____________________________________________________________________________________________________ This publication is available free of charge from: https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.HB.133-2019Chapter 4.

Drop the spindle head onto the test area of the sheet. 15. Read the dial thickness two seconds or more after the drop, or when the dial hand or digital readout becomes stationary. This procedure minimizes small errors that may occur when the spindle head or probe is lowered slowly onto the test area. 16. For succeeding measurements, raise the spindle head 0.008 mm to 0.01 mm (0.000 3 in to 0.000 4 in) above the rest position on the test surface, move to the next measurement location, and drop the spindle head onto the test area. Do not raise the spindle head more than 0.01 mm (0.000 4 in) above its rest position on the test area. Take measurements at least 6 mm (1/4 in) or more from the edge of the sheet. 17. Repeat Steps 12 through 16 above on the remaining packages in the sample and record all thickness measurements. Compute and record the average thickness for the individual package and apply the following MAV requirements. (Amended 2012, 2017, and 2018) 1. Follow Section 2.3.1. \" Define the Inspection Lot. \" Use a \" Category A \" sampling plan in the inspection ; select a random sample. 2. Follow the steps in Section 4.5.2.a. \"Test Procedure for Polyethylene Sheeting\" for calculating the weight of polyethylene sheeting. Multiply the calculated weight times the count (the number of bags or liners), then multiply by two (to account for both sides of each bag or liner) to obtain your target net weight. 3. To determine the target net weight for bags with a cutout, (i.e., t -shirt or specialty bags), subtract from the target net weight the weight of the cutout. Use the following method to calculate the weight of the cutout: Trace the cutout on ruled graph paper with 0.5 cm (\u00bc in) squares as shown in the diagram that follows . (See Figure 4 -1. T- Shirt Bag. ) For t -shirt bags with a fold or gusset, you will need to draw an extra line up from the gusset to the edge of the graph paper. This will aid in accounting for the additional plastic layers within the bag. ( See shaded area in Figure 4 -1. T- Shirt Bag. ) Count the squares and divide this number by the number of squares per square inch (sq in) (i.e., 16 - 1/4 inch squares = 1 sq in) to determine the total area of the cutout. Adjust your total area by taking into account the number of layers for each region counted. (Figure 4-2. Polyethylene Bag Outline on Graph.) Once the total area of the bag has been deter mined, take the total area of the cutout and divide it by the total area of the bag to calculate the percentage of the cutout. Compute and record the weight of the bag without the cutout by subtracting the calculated net weight of the cutout from the total target net weight of the bags being tested. The calculated net weight of the cutout is determined by multiplying the total target net weight of the bag by the percentage of the area of the cutout. _____________________________________________________________________________________________________ This publication is available free of charge from: https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.HB.133-2019Handbook 133 - 2019 Chapter 4.

Four- Layer Area: 4 [(6 \u00d7 20) + 64 additional boxes] \u00f7 16 squares/ sq in = 46 sq in Two-Layer Area: 2 [(21 \u00d7 20) + 28 additional boxe s] \u00f7 16 square s/sq in = 56 sq in The area of the cutout = 46 sq in + 56 sq in = 102 sq in If the total area for the bags prior to cutout is 836 sq in, then the percentage of the cutout is 12.2 %, (102 sq in \u00f7 836 sq in = 0.1220 \u00d7 100) Multiply the theoretical weight by 12.2 % to determine the weight of the cutout for the bags, then subtract this from the target net weight to determine the weight of the bags. If the calculated target net weight for a box of bags is 11.57 lb, then 12.2 % would weigh 1.41 lb (11.57 lb \u00d7 12.2 % = 1.41 lb). Therefore, the target net weight of the product is: 11.57 lb 1.41 lb = 10.16 lb of Results Note: Refer to Appendix A, Table 2-10. \" Exceptions to the Maximum Allowable Variations (MAVs) for Textiles, Polyethylene Sheeting and Film, Mulch and Soil Labeled by Volume, Packaged Firewood and Stovewood Labeled by Volume, and Packages Labeled by Count with 50 Items or Fewer , and Specific Agricultural Seeds Labeled by Count.\" (Amended 2010) On polyethylene with a declared thickness greater than 25 \u00b5m (1 mil or 0.001 in) : an individual thick ness measured may be up to 20 % less than the declared thickness.

Weigh and record the weight of each piece separately and record the values. Compare the weight values to determine the variability of the samples. If the individual weights of the eight tw ine samples vary by more than one division on the scale, use one of the following steps: (1) if the lot is short, determine the actual length of the lightest- weight roll found in the lightest- weight package of the lot to confirm that the weight shortages reflect the shortages in the length of the rolls; or (2) determine the average weight -per- unit of measure by taking ten 30.48 m (100 ft) lengths from inside the lightest weight package. Use this value to recalculate its length and determine lot compliance 5. Weigh all of the sample lengths together and record the total value. Determine the total length of the samples (243.8 m or 800 ft, unless more than eight sample -lengths were taken) and record the value. Compute the average weight -per-unit-of- length by dividing the total weight by the total length of the pieces. 6. Determine the MAV for a package of twine (refer to Appendix A, Table 2-8. \"Maximum Allowable Variations for Packages Labeled by Length, ( Width ), or Area\"). Record the total declared package length . Multiply the MAV from Appendix A, Table 2-8. \"Maximum Allowable Variations for Packages Labeled by Length, (Width), or Area\" times the total package length to obtain the MAV for length and record this value. Multiply the weight per unit of length (from S tep 4) times the MAV for the total declared package length to obtain the MAV by weight and record this value. Convert the MAV to dimensionless units and record. 7. Calculate the nominal gross weight and record. _____________________________________________________________________________________________________ This publication is available free of charge from: https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.HB.133-2019Handbook 133 - 2019 Chapter 4.

Determine errors using the following formula: Package error (weight) = (package gross weight) - (nominal gross weight) To convert the package error in weight back to length, divide the weig ht by the average weight -per-unit-of-length. 4.7.3. Evaluation of R esults Follow the procedures in Section 2.3.7. \" Evaluate for Compliance\" to determine lot compliance. 4.8. Procedure for C hecking the A rea Measurement of Chamois Chamois is natural leather made from skins of sheep and lambs that have been oil -tanned. Chamois are irregularly shaped, which makes area measurement difficult. Because of these characteristics, an accurate area determination can only be made using an internationally recognized method of conditioning (rehydrating) and measurement. Chamois is produced in a wet manufacturing process, so it has high moisture content at time of measurement. Chamois is hydroscopic; therefore, its dimensions and total area change as it loses or absorbs moisture. It is also subject to wrinkling. Because of the variation of the thickness and density, and therefore the weight per unit area of chamois, an estimated gross weight procedure cannot be used to verify the labeled area declaration. Standard Test Conditions: As with all hydroscopic products, reasonable variations in measure must be allowed if caused by ordinary and customary exposure to atmospheric conditions that normally occur in good distribution practice. Both federal and international standards specify procedures to restore the moisture content of chamois so that tests to verify dimensions and area can be conducted. Federal Test Method Standard 311, \"Leather, Methods of Sampling and Testing,\" (Janua ry 15, 1969) defines the standard atmospheric condition for chamois as 50 \u00b1 4 % relative humidity and 23 \u00b1 2 \u00b0C (73.4 \u00b1 3.6 \u00b0F). The chamois is considered to be at equilibrium moisture when the difference in two successive weighings, made at 1 hr interval s, is no greater than 0.25 % (e.g., the maximum change in weight on a 100 g sample in two successive weighings is less than 0.25 g (250 mg). The area of chamois is verified using a two -stage test procedure. The first stage is a field audit using the templ ate test procedure. This test is used for field audits because it is simpler to perform and does not require the chamois to be conditioned. The field audit is used to identify chamois that are potentially under measure. It is not as accurate as the gravimetric procedure because some error results from reading the area from the template. The gravimetric procedure should be used for compliance testing because it includes conditioning (rehydrating) the chamois. 4.8.1. Template T est Method (for field audits) Chamo is is typically labeled in uniform sizes in terms of square decimeters and square feet, and are sized in increments of 1/4 ft2 (e.g., 1 ft2, 11/4 ft2, and 11/2 ft2). 4.8.1.1. Test E quipment Use a transparent, flexible template that is graduated in square centimeters or square inches and that has been verified for accuracy. The template must be large enough to completely cover the chamois under test. _____________________________________________________________________________________________________ This publication is available free of charge from: https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.HB.133-2019Chapter 4. Test Procedures - Packages Labeled by Count, Linear Handbook 133 - 2019 Measure, Area, Thickness, and Combinations of Quantities 136 4.8.1.2. Test Procedure 1. Select a random sample o f chamois. Separate the chamois into different sizes and define the inspection lot by specific sizes. 2. Place the template over the chamois specimen on a smooth surface. Determine the area by co unting the number of squares that cover the surface of the chamois. Estimate parts of the template that do not completely cover the chamois by adding the number of partially covered blocks. (See Figure 4-3. \"Template for Checking the Area of a Chamois\" ) Compute the total area and refer to Section 4.8.3. Evaluation of Results to determine if further action is necessary. First Stage - Decision Criteria If the average minus error exceeds 3 % of the labeled area, the chamois may not be labeled accurately . To confirm the finding, the sample must be taken to a laboratory for conditioning and testing using the gravimetric test procedure. Figure 4 -3. Template for Checking the Area of Chamois . 4.8.2. Gravimetric Procedure for Area Measurement This test cannot be performed in the field because the samples must be conditioned with water before testing. This method is intended for use in checking full or cut skins, or pattern shapes. Open and condition all of the packages in the sample before determining their area on the recommended paper. Conditioning and verifying chamois can be accomplished without destroying the product. When successful tests are completed, the chamois may be repackaged for sale, so do not destroy the packaging material. 4.8.2.1. Test E quip ment Scale with a capacity of 1 kg that is accurate to at least \u00b1 0.01 g and a load -receiving element of adequate size to properly hold the chamois Atomizer or trigger- type sprayer and sealable, airtight polyethylene bags Medium weight drawing paper (e.g., drawing paper, medium weight (100 lb), regular surface or comparable) _____________________________________________________________________________________________________ This publication is available free of charge from: https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.HB.133-2019Handbook 133 - 2019 Chapter 4.

Remove each sample from its package and weigh and record each weight. Using an atomizer -type sprayer, spray water in the amount of 25 % of the weight of each skin uniformly over its area. Place wetted chamois in an airtight polyethylene bag; seal the bag, and leave it in this condition at room temperature for 24 hours. 2. Open the bag, remove the chamois, and reweigh the chamois to confirm that it retained maximum moisture. (This is done by confirming that the difference in the two consecutive weighings conducted an hour apart does not exceed 0.25 %.) 3. Place the chamois flat on a continuous piece of drawing paper. To remove wrinkles and make the chamois lie flat, use a normal domestic iron that is heated to a maximum of 30 \u00b0C to 40 \u00b0C (86 \u00b0F to 104 \u00b0F). Place the iron on the bottom of the skin, and iron the skin up from the center to the top. Then, iron the skin from the center out to each side. Iron until the skin is fully extended and perfectly flat. 4.8.2.2. Test Procedure 1. Immediately after ironing, carefully draw around the outline of the sk in on the paper. Remove the skin; carefully cut along the outline of the skin; weigh the cutout pattern, and record to the nearest 0.1 g Sample Weight 1 (W 1). 2. Lay out the pattern and cut an accurately measured rectangle of a size not less than one - half the area of the pattern. Weigh the cutout rectangle and record the weight to the nearest 0.1 g Sample Weight 2 (W 2). Calculate the area of the rectangle cut fro m the patterns by multiplying length by width and record as Area (A) in centimeters or square inches. For metric u nits - calculate the area of the original skin being checked as follows: W1/W2 \u00d7 A = Skin Area in cm2/100 = Area in dm2 For U.S. customary units - calculate the area of the original skin being checked as follows: W1/W2 \u00d7 A = Skin Area in in2/144 = Area ft2 _____________________________________________________________________________________________________ This publication is available free of charge from: https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.HB.133-2019Chapter 4.

Procedure for C hecking the C ontents of S pecific A griculture S eed Packages L abeled by C ount The following method shall be employed when using a mechanical seed counter to determine the number of seeds contained in a sample of soybean (Glycine E quipment Mechanical seed counter Moisture proof container 4.9.2. Test Procedure 1. Testing samples shall be received and retained in moisture proof containers until the weight of the sample prepared for purity analysis is recorded. The sample shall be of at least 500 grams for soybean, corn, field beans, and 100 grams for wheat . 2. The seed counter shall be calibrated daily prior to use. Prepare a calibration sample by counting 10 sets of 100 seeds. Visually examine each set to insure that it contains whole seeds. Combine the 10 sets of seeds to make a 1000 seed calibration sample. The seeds of the calibration sample should be approximately the same size and shape as the seeds in a sample being tested. Note: If the seeds in a sample being tested are noticeably different in size or shape from those in the calibration sample, prepare another calibration sample with seeds of the appropriate size and shape. Periodically re -examine the calibration samples to insure that no seeds have been lost or added. Carefully pour the 1000 seed calibration sample into the seed counter. Start the counter and run it until all the seeds have been counted. Note: The seeds should not touch as they run through the counter. Record the number of seeds as displayed on the counter read out. The seed count should not vary more than \u00b1 2 seeds from 1000. If the count is not within this tolerance, clean the mirrors, adjust the feed rate and/or reading sensitivity. Rerun the calibration sample until it is within the \u00b1 2 seed tolerance. _____________________________________________________________________________________________________ This publication is available free of charge from: https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.HB.133-2019Handbook 133 - 2019 Chapter 4. Test Procedures - Packages Labeled by Count, Linear Measure, Area, Thickness, and Combinations of Quantities 139 Note : If the seed counter fails the calibration procedure and sample has been checked to ensure that it contains 1000 seeds, do not use the counter until it has been repaired. 3. Immediately after opening the container, mix and divide the sample to obtain a sample for purity analysis (refer to Appendix D: AOSA Rules for Testing Seeds). 4. Record the weight of this sample in grams to the appropriate number of decimal places. 5. Conduct the purity analysis to obtain pure seed for the seed count test. 6. After the seed counter has been calibrated, test the pure seed portion from the purity test and record the number of seeds in the sampl e. 7. Calculation of results. Calculate the number of seeds per pound to the nearest whole number using the following formula: Number of seeds per pound = 453.6 g/lb \u00d7 no. of seeds counted divided by the weight (g) of sample analyzed for purity 8. Determine the Maximum Allowable Variation (MAV). Multiply the labeled seed count by 4 % for soybean, 2 % for corn, 5 % for field bean, and 3 % for wheat. Note : Express the maximum allowable variation (the number of seeds) to the nearest whole number. Consider the results of two tests in accord with the maximum allowable variation if the difference, expressed as the number of seeds, is equal to or less than the maximum allowable variation . Example: Kind of seed: Corn Label claim: 2275 seeds/lb Lab Test: Purity working weight = 500.3 g Seed count of pure seed = 2479 seeds Number of seeds per pound = 453.6 g/lb 2479 seeds divided by 500.3 g = rounded to the nearest whole number = 2248 seeds/lb Calculate maximum allowable variat ion value for corn: multiply label claim by 2 % 2275 seeds/lb \u00d7 0.02 = 45.5 seeds/lb; rounded to the nearest whole number = 46 seeds/lb Determine the difference between label claim and lab test: 2275 seeds/lb 2248 seeds/lb = 27 seeds/lb is available free of charge from: https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.HB.133-2019Chapter 4. Test Procedures - Packages Labeled by Count, Linear Handbook 133 - 2019 Measure, Area, Thickness, and Combinations of Quantities 140 The diffe rence between the lab test and the label claim is less than the maximum allowable variation (27 < 46); therefore, the two results are in accord with the maximum allowable variation. 4.2.3.

Random Number Tables 159 Appendix B. Random Number Tables Reproduced from Million Random Digits, used with permission of the Rand Corporation, Copyright, 1955, The Free Press ( www.rand.org/publications/classics/randomdigits ) All of the sampling plans presented in this handbook a re based on the assumption that the packages constituting the sample are chosen at random from the inspection lot. Randomness in this instance means that every package in the lot has an equal chance of being selected as part of the sample. It does not ma tter what other pack ages have already been chosen, what the package net con tents are, or where the package is located in the lot. To obtain a random sample, two steps are necessary. First it is necessary to identify each package in the lot of packages wi th a specific number whether on the shelf, in the warehouse, or coming off the packaging line. Then it is necessary to obtain a series of random numbers. These random numbers indicate exactly which packages in the lot shall be taken for the sample. The Random Number Table The random number tables in Appendix B are composed of the digits from 0 through 9, with approxi mately equal frequency of occur rence. This appendix consists of 8 pages. On each page digits are printed in blocks of columns and blocks of rows. The printing of the table in blocks is intended only to make it easier to locate specific columns and rows. Random Starting Place Starting Page. The Random Digit pages are pages 161 through 167. You can use the day of the week to determine the starting page or use the first page for the first lot you test in a location, the second page for the second lot, and so on , moving to the following page for each new lot. Starting Column and Row. You may choose a starting page in the random number table and with eyes closed, drop a pencil any where on the page to indicate a starting place in the table. For example, assume that testing takes place on the 3 rd day of the week. Start with Table 3 of Appendix B. Assume you dropped your pencil on the page and it has indicated a starting place at Column 22, Row 45. That number is 1. (See the \"Illustration for Finding/Using Random Digits\" on the next page.) If one-digit random numbers are needed, record them, going down the column to the bottom of the page and then to the top of the next column, and so on. Ignore dupli cates and record zero (0) as ten (10). Following on from the last example, these numbers are 3, 2, 9, 8, etc. If two -digit random numbers are needed, rule off the pages, and further pages if necessary, in columns of two digits each. If there is a single column left on the page, ignore this column, and rule the next page in columns of two. Again, ignore duplicate numbers and record 00 as 100. For example, using the same starting place as in the last example (Table 3, Column 22, Row 45), the recorded two- digit numbers would be 11, 34, 26, 95, etc . When three -digit numbers are needed, rule the page in columns of three. Record 000 as 1000. Starting on Table 3, Column 22, Row 45, the recorded numbers would be 119, 346, 269, 959, etc. _____________________________________________________________________________________________________ This publication is available free of charge from: https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.HB.133-2019Appendix B.

AOSA Rules for Testing Seeds 189 Appendix D. AOSA Rules for Testing Seeds AOSA Rules for Testing Seeds - Section 2: Preparation of Working Samples Volume 1. Principles and Procedures (Provided by the Association of Official Seed Analyst ) SECTION 2: PREPARATION OF WORKING SAMPLES The laboratory analysis for law enforcement, labeling, and general information as to seed quality, should determine the following for the sample analyzed: (1) the purity composition, (2) the r ate of occurrence of noxious- weed seeds per unit weight, and (3) the percentage germination of the pure seed under consideration. Additional information, such as, seed count, detection of seed treatment, bulk examination for contaminants, tetrazolium viab ility, detection of fungal endophtyes, and seed moisture content may be determined using approved procedures. 2.1 Definitions (1) Seed unit : the structure usually regarded as a seed in planting practices and in commercial channels. Refer to section 3.2 e for pure seed unit descriptions. (2) Working samples: (a) Purity working sample: the sub- sample taken from the submitted sample on which the purity analysis is performed. 2.2 Obtaining the working sample The working sample on which the actual analysis is performed shall be taken from the submitted sample in such a manner that it will be representative. A suitable type of mechanical divider (conical, centrifugal, riffle, etc.) should be used. To avoid damage when dividing large -seeded crop kinds such as beans, peas, etc., prevent the seeds from falling great distances onto hard surfaces. a. Mechanical dividers. - This method is suitable for most kinds of seeds. The apparatus divides a sample into two approximately equal parts. The submitted sample is mixed by passing it through the divider, recombining the two parts and passing the whole sample through a second time and similarly a third time. After mixing, the sample shall be reduced by passing the seed through the divider repeatedly, removing half the sample on each occasion. This process of successive halving is continued until a working sample of approximately, but not less than the minimum weight(s) stated in Table 2A is obtained. _____________________________________________________________________________________________________ This publication is available free of charge from: https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.HB.133-2019Appendix D. AOSA Rules for Testing Seeds Handbook 133 - 2019 190 Use of comp ressed air or a vacuum is highly recommended for cleaning mechanical dividers. (1) Centrifugal divider (Gamet type): This divider is suitable for all kinds of seed though it is not recommended for oilseeds (such as rapeseed, canola, mustards, flax) and kinds susceptible to damage (such as peas, soybeans, etc .) and the extremely chaffy types. The divider makes use of centrifugal force to mix and scatter seeds over the dividing surface. The seed flows downward through a hopper onto a shallow rubber cup or spinner. Upon rotation of the spinner by an electric motor the seeds are thrown out by centrifugal force and fall downward. The circle or area where the seeds fall is equally divided into two parts by a stationary baffle so that approximately half the seed s fall in one spout and half in the other spout. The centrifugal divider tends to give variable results when not carefully operated, and therefore the following procedure must be used: (a) Preparation of the apparatus: (i) Level the divider using the adjustable feet. (ii) Check the divider and four containers for cleanliness. Note that seeds can be trapped under the spinner and become a source of contamination. (b) Sample mixing: (i) Place a container under each spout. (ii) Feed the whole sample into the hopper; when filling the hopper, the seed must always be poured centrally. (iii) After the sample has been poured into the hopper, the spinner is operated and the seed passes into the two containers. Turn off spinner. (iv) Full containers are replace d by empty containers. The contents of the two full containers are fed centrally into the hopper together, the seed being allowed to blend as it flows in. The spinner is operated. (v) The sample mixing procedure is repeated at least once more. (c) Sample reduction: (i) Full containers are replaced by empty containers. The contents of one full container are set aside and the contents of the other container are fed into the hopper. The spinner is operated. (ii) The successive halving process is cont inued until the working sample(s) of not less than the minimum weight(s) required stated in Table 2A are obtained. (iii) Ensure that the divider and containers are clean after each mixing operation. (2) Soil/Riffle divider : This divider is suitable for most kinds of seed. For round- seeded kinds such as Brassica species , the collection containers should be covered to prevent the seeds from bouncing out. This divider consists of a hopper with attached channels or ducts, a frame to hold the hopper, four collection containers and a pouring pan. Ducts or channels lead from the hopper to the collection containers, alternate ones leading to opposite sides. Riffle dividers are available in different sizes for different sizes of seed. The width and number of channels and spaces are important. The minimum width of the channels must be at least two times the largest diameter of the seed or any possible contamin ants being mixed. This apparatus, similar to the centrifugal divider, divides the sample into approximately equal parts. _____________________________________________________________________________________________________ This publication is available free of charge from: https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.HB.133-2019Handbook 133 - 2019 Appendix D. AOSA Rules for Testing Seeds 191 (a) Preparation of the apparatus: (i) Place the riffle divider on a firm, level clean surface. Ensure the divider is level. (ii) Ensure that the divider and the four sample collection containers are clean. Check all channels, joints and seams of the divider and collection containers to ensure there are no seeds or other plant matter present before each use. (iii) Two clean empty co llection containers shall be placed under the channels to receive the mixed seed. (b) Sample mixing: (i) Pour the whole sample into the divider by running the seed backwards and forwards along the edge of the divider so that all the channels and spaces of the divider receive an equal amount of seed. (ii) The two full containers shall be replaced with two clean empty containers. (iii) The contents of one full container shall be poured into the divider by holding the long edge of the pan against the long edge of the riffle hopper and then rotating the bottom up so that the seeds pour across all channels at the same time, followed by the other full container using the same procedure. (iv) This process of mixing the entire submitted sample shall be repeated at least one more time before successive halving begins. (c) Sample reduction: (i) The contents of one full container are set aside. Empty containers are placed under each channel, and the contents of the other container is poured into the hopper by holding the long edge of the pan against the long edge of the riffle hopper and then rotating the bottom up so that the seeds pour across all channels at the same time. (ii) The successive halving process is continued until the working sample(s) of not less than the minimum weight(s) required stated in Table 2A are obtained. (iii) Ensure that the divider and collection containers are clean after each mixing operation. Check a ll channels of the divider, the joints and seams. (3) Boerner divider: This divider is suitable for most kinds of seed, including chaffy species, peas, beans, soybeans, etc. This divider consists of a hopper, a cone, and a series of baffles which direc t the seed into two spouts. The baffles are arranged in a circle at the top and form equal width alternate channels and spaces. The channels lead to one spout, the spaces to the other. The width and number of channels and spaces are important. Five cha nnels and spaces should be regarded as a minimum. The more channels the better but the minimum width of the channels must be at least two times the largest diameter of the seed or any possible contaminants being mixed. (a) Preparation of the apparatus: Ensure that the divider and the two sample collecting pans are clean. (b) Sample mixing: (i) Place a collecting pan under each spout. (ii) Close the valve at the bottom of the divider. (iii) Pour the seed centrally into the hopper. _____________________________________________________________________________________________________ This publication is available free of charge from: https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.HB.133-2019Appendix D. AOSA Rules for Testing Seeds Handbook 133 - 2019 192 (iv) Quickly open the valve. Gravity will distribute the seed evenly through the channels and spaces. (v) To mix the seed, repeat the steps a t least twice for free flowing seed and three times for chaffy grasses. (c) Sample reduction: The contents of one full collection pan are set aside. Repeat steps in 2 \"sampling mixing\". To improve the randomness of reduction, choose collection pans from alternate sides for the successive halving process. The successive halving process is continued until the working sample(s) of not less t han the minimum weigh t(s) required stated in Table 2A are obtained. b. Non-mechanical methods. (2) Hand- halving method: This method can be used when a proper mechanical divider is not available. Procedure: (a) Seed is poured evenly onto a clean smooth surface. (b) The sample shall be thoroughly mixed using a flat -edged spatula and placed into a pile. (c) The pile shall be divided in half using a straight edge or ruler. (d) Each half portion is divided in half. (e) Each of the portions is divided into half again. There are now eight portions. (f) Arrange the eight portions into two rows of four. (g) Alternate portions should be combined to obtain two halves for example, combine the first portion from Row 1 with the second portion from Row 2. Remove the remaining four portions. (h) Repeat Steps (a) to (g ) until sufficient portions of seed are taken to constitute a working sample(s) of not less than the minimum weight(s) required stated in Table 2A are obtained. 2.3. Size of working samples. a. Weighing the working sample. - The weight of the working sample shall be determined to the number of decimal places indicated below: Weight of Working Sample in Grams Number of Decimal Places Less than 1.000 4 1.000 to 9.999 3 10.00 to 99.99 2 100.0 to 999.9 1 1000 or more 0 _____________________________________________________________________________________________________ This publication is available free of charge from: https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.HB.133-2019Handbook 133 - 2019 Appendix D. AOSA Rules for Testing Seeds 193 AOSA Rules for Testing Seeds - Section 12: Mechanical Seed Count Volume 1. Principles and Procedures (Provided by the Association of Official Seed Analyst ) SECTION 12: MECHANICAL SEED COUNT The following method shall be employed when using a mechanical seed counter to determine the number of seeds contained in a sample of soybean (Glycine 12.1 Samples . Samples for testing shall be of at least 500 grams for soybean, corn and field beans and 100 grams for wheat and received in moisture proof containers. Samples shall be retained in moisture proof containers until the weight of the sample prepared for purity analysis is recorded. 12.2 Seed counter calibration . The seed counter shall be calibrated daily prior to use. (a) Prepare a calibration sample by counting 10 sets of 100 seeds. Visually examine each set to insure that it contains whole seeds. Combine the 10 sets of seeds to make a 1,000 seed calibration sample. The seeds of the calibration sample should be approximately the same size and shape as the seeds in a sample being tested. If the seeds in a sample being tested are noticeably different in size or shape from those in the calibration sample, prepare another calibration sample with seeds of the appropriate size and shape. Periodically re- examine the calibration samples to insure that no seeds have been lost or added. (b) Carefully pour the 1,000 seed calibration sample into the seed counter. Start the counter and run it until all the seeds have been counted. The seeds should not touch as they run through the counter. Record the number of seeds as displayed on the counter read out. The seed count should not vary more than \u00b1 2 seeds from 1,000. If the count is not within this tolerance, clean the mirrors, adjust the feed rate and/or reading sensitivity. Rerun the calibration sample until it is within the \u00b12 seed tolerance. If the seed counter continues to fail the calibrat ion procedure and the calibration sample has been checked to ensure that it contains 1,000 seeds, do not use the counter until it has been repaired. 12.3 Sample preparation . Immediately after opening the moisture proof container, mix and divide the submit ted sample, in accordance with Section 2.2, to obtain a sample for purity analysis and record the weight of this sample in grams t o the appropriate number of decimal places (refer to Section 2.3 a). Conduct the purity analysis to obtain pure seed for the seed count test. _____________________________________________________________________________________________________ This publication is available free of charge from: https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.HB.133-2019Appendix D. AOSA Rules for Testing Seeds Handbook 133 - 2019 194 12.4 Conducting the test . After the seed counter has been calibrated, test the pure seed portion from the purity test and record the number of seeds in the sample. 12.5 Calculation of results. Calculate the number of seeds per pound to the nearest whole number using the following formula: Number of seeds per pound = 453.6 g/lb \u00d7 no. of seeds counted weight (g) of sample analyzed for purity 12.6 Tolerances for results from different laboratories. Multiply the labeled seed count or f irst seed count test result by four percent for soybean samples, two percent for corn (round, flat or plateless) samples, five percent for field bean samples and three percent for wheat samples. Express the tolerance (the number of seeds) to the nearest whole number. Consider the results of two tests in tolerance if the difference, expressed as the number of seeds, is equal to or less than the tolerance. Example : Kind of seed: Corn Label claim (1st test): 2275 seed/lb Lab Test (2nd test): Purity working weight = 500.3 g Seed count of pure seed = 2479 seeds Number of seeds per pound 2479 seeds = 2247.6 seeds/lb the nearest whole number = 2248 seeds/lb Calculate tolerance value for corn: multiply 2% 2275 seeds/lb \u00d7 0.02 = 45.5 seeds/lb; rounded to the nearest whole number = 46 seeds/lb Determine the difference between label claim and lab test: 2275 seeds/lb - 2248 seeds/lb = 27 seeds/lb The difference between the lab test (2nd test) and the label claim (1st test) is less than the tolerance (27 < 46); therefore, the two results are in tolerance. _____________________________________________________________________________________________________ This publication is available free of charge from: https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.HB.133-2019Handbook 133 - 2019 Appendix E. General Tables of Units of Measurement 195 Appendix E. General Tables of Units of Measurement These tables have been prepared for the benefit of those requiring tables of units for occasional ready reference. In Section 4. Tables of Units of Measurement of this Appendix, the tables are carried out to a large number of decimal places and exact values are indicated by underlining. In most of the other tables, only a limited number of decimal places are given, therefore making the tables better adapted to the average user . Section 1. Tables of Metric Units of Measurement In the metric system of meas urement, designations of multiples and subdivisions of any unit may be arrived at by combining with the name of the unit the prefixes deka , hecto , and kilo meaning, respectively, 10, 100, and 1000, and deci, centi , and milli, meaning, respectively, one -tenth, one -hundredth, and one -thousandth. In some of the following metric tables, some such multiples and subdivisions have not been included for the reason that these have little, if any currency in actual usage. In certain cases, particularly in scientific usage, it becomes convenient to provide for multiples larger than 1000 and for subdivisions smaller than one -thousandth. Accordingly, the following prefixes have been introduced and these are now generally recognized: yotta, (Y) meaning 1024 deci, (d), 1018 1012 nano, (n), meaning 10-9 giga, (G), meaning 109 pico, (p), meaning 1 0-12 mega, (M), meaning 106 femto, (f), meaning 10-15 kilo, (k), meaning 103 atto, (a), meaning 10-18 hecto, (h), meaning 102 zepto, (z), meaning 10-21 deka, (da), meaning 101 yocto, (y), meaning 10-24 Thus a kilometer is 1000 meters and a millimeter is 0.001 meter. Units of Length 10 millimeters (mm) = 1 centimeter (cm) 10 centimeters = 1 decimeter (dm) = 100 millimeters 10 decimeters = 1 meter (m) = 1000 millimeters 10 meters = 1 dekameter (dam) 10 dekameters = 1 hectometer (hm) = 100 meters 10 hectometers = 1 kilometer (km) = 1000 meters _____________________________________________________________________________________________________ This publication is available free of charge from: https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.HB.133-2019Appendix E.

Units of Length 12 inches (in) = 1 foot (ft) 3 feet = 1 yard (yd) 16\u00bd feet = 1 rod (rd), pole, or perch 40 rods = 1 furlong (fur) = 660 feet 8 furlongs = 1 U.S. statute mile (mi) = 5280 feet 1852 meters (m) = 6076.115 49 feet (approximately) = 1 international nauti cal mile Units of Area3 144 square inches (in2) = 1 square foot (ft2) 9 square feet = 1 square yard (yd2) = 1296 square inches 272\u00bc square feet = 1 square rod (rd2) 160 square rods = 1 acre = 43 560 square feet 640 acres = 1 square mile (mi2) 1 mile square = 1 section of land 2 This section lists units of measurement that have traditionally been used in the United States. In keeping with the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988, the ultimate objective is to make the International System of Units the primary measurement system used in the United States . 3 Squares and cubes of customary but not of metric units are sometimes expressed by the use of abbreviations rather than symbol s. For example, sq ft means square foot, and cu ft means cubic foot. _____________________________________________________________________________________________________ This publication is available free of charge from: https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.HB.133-2019Appendix E.

General Tables of Units of Measurement 201 Section 3. Notes on British Units of Measurement In Great Britain, the yard, the avoirdupois pound, the troy pound, and the apothecaries pound are identical with the units of the same names used in the United States. The tables of British linear measure, troy mass, and apothecaries mass are the same as the corresponding United States tables, except for the British spelling \"drachm\" in the table of apothecaries mass. The table of British avoirdupois mass is the same as the United States table up to 1 pound; above that point the table reads: 14 pounds = 1 stone 2 stones = 1 quarter = 28 pounds 4 quarters = 1 hundredweight = 112 pounds 20 hundredweight = 1 ton = 2240 pounds The present British gallon and bushel - known as the \"Imperial gallon\" and \"Imperial bushel\" - are, respectively, about 20 % and 3 % larger than the United States gallon and bushel. The Imperial gallon is defined as the volume of 10 avoirdupois pounds of water under specified conditions, and the Imperial bushel is defined as 8 Imperial gallons. Also, the subdivision of the Imperial gallon as presented in the table of British apothecaries fluid measure differs in two important respects from the corresponding United States subdivision, in that the Imperial gallon is divided into 160 fluid ounces (whereas the United States gallon is divided into 128 fluid ounces), and a \"fluid scruple\" is included. The full table of British measures of capacity (which are used alike for liquid and for dry commodities) is as follows: 4 gills = 1 pint 2 pints = 1 quart 4 quarts = 1 gallon 2 gallons = 1 peck 8 gallons (4 pecks) = 1 bushel 8 bushels = 1 quarter The full table of British apothecaries measure is as follows: 20 minims = 1 fluid scruple 3 fluid scruples = 1 fluid drachm = 60 minims 8 fluid drachms = 1 fluid ounce 20 fluid ounces = 1 pint 8 pints = 1 gallon (160 fluid ounces) _____________________________________________________________________________________________________ This publication is available free of charge from: https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.HB.133-2019Appendix E. General Tables of Units of Measurement Handbook 133 - 2019 202 Section 4. Tables of Units of Measurement Unit con- version is a multi -step process that involves multiplication or division by a numerical factor ; selection of the corre ct number of significant digits; and rounding. Accurate unit conversions are obtained by selecting an appropriate conversion factor (a ratio which converts one unit of measur e into another without changing the quantity), which are supplied in these tables. Some unit conversions may be exact, without increasing or decreasing the precision of the original quantity. Exact unit conversion factors are underlined in these tables. It is good practice to keep all the digits, especially if other mathematical operations or conversions will follow. Rounding should be the last step of the conversion process and should be performed only once. To convert a value from one unit of measure ment to different unit of measurement follow the steps below. Find the table corresponding to the general category of measurement; for example, the table titled \"Units of Volume\" includes conversion factors for volume measurements. Locate the \"starting unit\" of measurement in the far, left column. Proceed horizontally to the right on the same row until you reach the column with the heading of the \"ending unit\" of measurement. The unit conversion factor is located at the intersection of the row and column. Multiply the quantity value of the starting unit of measurement by the conversion factor. The result is the equivalent quantity value in the ending unit of measurement. Units of Length - International Measure 9 (All underlined figures are exact.)

General Tables of Units of Measurement 213 Section 5. Tables of Equivalents In these tables it is necessary to differentiate between the \"international foot\" and the \"survey foot.\" Therefore, the survey foot is underlined. When the name of a unit is enclosed in brackets (thus, [1 hand] . . . ), this indicates (1) that the unit is not in general current use in the United States, or (2) that the unit is believed to be based on \"custom and usage\" rather than on formal authoritative definition. Equivalents involving decimals are, in most instances, rounded off to the third decimal place except where they are exact, in which cases these exact equivalents are so designated. The equivalents of the imprecise units \"tablespoon\" and \"teaspoon\" are rounded to the nearest milliliter.

The international mile and the U.S. statute mile differ by about three millimeters although both are defined as being equal to 5280 feet. The international mile is based on the international foot (0.3048 meter) whereas the U.S. statute mile is based on the survey foot (1200/3937 meter). 13 The international nautical mile of 1852 meters (6076.115 49 feet) was adopted effective July 1, 1954, for use in the United States. The value formerly used in the United States was 6080.20 feet = 1 nautical (geographical or sea) mile. 14 The question is often asked as to the length of a side of an acre of ground. An acre is a unit of area containing 43 560 square feet. It is not necessarily square, or even rectangular. But, if it is square, then the length of a side is equal to 243560 ft 208.710 ft = (not exact). _____________________________________________________________________________________________________ This publication is available free of charge from: https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.HB.133-2019Handbook 133 - 2019 Appendix E.
