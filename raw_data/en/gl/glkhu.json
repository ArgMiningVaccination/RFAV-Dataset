In Spain, about a quarter of a million cases were diagnosed in 2017, and 81% of the Spanish population has used, at least once, some kind of complementary therapy. Said therapies are increasingly being used by cancer patients. The purpose of the study is to analyse the effectiveness of complementary therapies among cancer patients. A systematic peer review was conducted following the PRISMA-ScR guide in four databases (PubMed, CINAHL, Scopus and WOS). The inclusion criteria were Randomised Clinical Trials, published between 2013 and 2018, with a value of 3 or more on the Jadad Scale. The protocol was registered in PROSPERO (CRD42019127593). The study sample amounted to 1845 patients (64.55% women), the most common being breast cancer patients (794), followed by lung cancer patients (341). Fifteen complementary therapies were identified. We found two studies for each of the following: electroacupuncture, phytotherapy, hypnotherapy, guided imagery and progressive muscle relaxation. From the remaining ones, we identified a study on each therapy. The findings reveal some effective complementary therapies: auriculotherapy and acupuncture, laser moxibustion, hypnosis, Ayurveda, electroacupuncture, progressive muscle relaxation and guided imagery, yoga, phytotherapy, music therapy and traditional Chinese medicine. On the other hand, electroacupuncture, laser moxibustion and traditional Chinese medicine presented adverse effects, and kinesiology did not show effectiveness.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2021-01-24", "cleaned_text": "Effectiveness of Complementary Therapies in Cancer Patients: A Systematic Review [https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18031017](https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18031017) [Nursing Research]( /journal/ijerph/topical_collections/Nursing_Res )) Abstract: 1. Introduction [1](#B1-ijerph-18-01017)]. Nearly a quarter of a million new cases of cancer were diagnosed in Spain, amounting to 149,000 in men. The most common cancers in men were prostate (22.4%), colorectal (16.6%), lung (15.1%) and uterus (6.2%) and lung (6.0%) et al. [ [10](#B10-ijerph-18-01017)], CTs are defined as \"approaches and practices that are typically not part of conventional medical care\". They are considered complementary therapy when these treatments are used in combination with conventional medicine. However, if they are used as a substitute for conventional medicine, they are called alternative therapy. CTs' classification is wide due to their high diversity and different combinations among them. The United States National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH) classifies them into three large groups. First, we find the group of natural products, which are easily found in pharmacies and herb shops and are usually sold as diet supplements. This group includes products composed of herbs, minerals, vitamins and probiotics. Around 17.7% of adults in the United States used at least one natural product in 2012. Next, we find the mind and body practices group. These practices include yoga, acupuncture, relaxation techniques, therapeutic touch, movement therapies, tai chi, qi gong and hypnotherapy. Among them, yoga, chiropractic treatment, osteopathy, massage therapy and meditation are most frequently used by adults. Lastly, the final group incorporates other complementary methods like traditional Chinese medicine, Ayurveda, naturopathy and homeopathy [ [10](#B10-ijerph-18-01017), [13](#B13-ijerph-18-01017), [14](#B14-ijerph-18-01017), [15](#B15-ijerph-18-01017)]. [16](#B16-ijerph-18-01017), [17](#B17-ijerph-18-01017)]; CTs are mainly oriented to the treatment or prevention of various symptoms caused by cancer treatments or by the disease itself [ [10](#B10-ijerph-18-01017)]. In addition, the use of CTs causes many patients to feel that they are taking an active role in their health and in the treatment of their illness [ [18](#B18-ijerph-18-01017), [19](#B19-ijerph-18-01017), [20](#B20-ijerph-18-01017)], as we can also read in the study by Alimujiang et al. [ [21](#B21-ijerph-18-01017)]. 2. Materials and Methods [22](#B22-ijerph-18-01017)] and different authors [ [23](#B23-ijerph-18-01017), [24](#B24-ijerph-18-01017), [25](#B25-ijerph-18-01017)]. The review protocol was recorded in the international prospective register of systematic reviews PROSPERO under the number CRD42019127593 (National Institute Health Research, 2019) [ [26](#B26-ijerph-18-01017)]. This review was carried out using a peer-review process (M.D.G.-M. and M.S.T.-B.), and when there was any discrepancy, a consensus was reached [ [27](#B27-ijerph-18-01017)]. [25](#B25-ijerph-18-01017)], the same strategy was performed on the different databases: treatment outcome AND neoplasms AND complementary therapies. [28](#B28-ijerph-18-01017)]. [Figure 1](#ijerph-18-01017-f001)), of which two studies scored 5 points [ [29](#B29-ijerph-18-01017), [30](#B30-ijerph-18-01017)], seven scored [40](#B40-ijerph-18-01017), [41](#B41-ijerph-18-01017), [42](#B42-ijerph-18-01017), [43](#B43-ijerph-18-01017)]. 3. [33](#B33-ijerph-18-01017), [34](#B34-ijerph-18-01017), [36](#B36-ijerph-18-01017), [39](#B39-ijerph-18-01017), cancer [ [35](#B35-ijerph-18-01017)], 220 had pancreatic cancer [ [38](#B38-ijerph-18-01017)], 104 had prostate cancer and 104 had breast cancer [ [36](#B36-ijerph-18-01017)], 341 had lung cancer [ [41](#B41-ijerph-18-01017)], 142 had liver cancer [ [37](#B37-ijerph-18-01017)] and 194 had an unspecified type of cancer [ [29](#B29-ijerph-18-01017), [30](#B30-ijerph-18-01017), [42](#B42-ijerph-18-01017)]. [Supplementary Material Table S1](#app1-ijerph-18-01017)presents the sample/data collection/country. 3.2. Complementary Therapies [31](#B31-ijerph-18-01017)], Ayurveda [ [32](#B32-ijerph-18-01017)], music therapy [ [39](#B39-ijerph-18-01017)], yoga [ [40](#B40-ijerph-18-01017)], laser moxibustion [ [29](#B29-ijerph-18-01017)] and traditional Chinese medicine [ [30](#B30-ijerph-18-01017)]. We found one study addressing two therapies (acupuncture and auriculotherapy) [ [41](#B41-ijerph-18-01017)]. We also found two studies of each of the following: electroacupuncture [ [32](#B32-ijerph-18-01017), [ [34](#B34-ijerph-18-01017), [42](#B42-ijerph-18-01017)]. In addition, we found two studies addressing progressive muscle relaxation (PMR) and guided imagery [ [36](#B36-ijerph-18-01017), [43](#B43-ijerph-18-01017)], and one of them also covered hypnotherapy, acupressure and meditation [ [43](#B43-ijerph-18-01017)]. 3.3. Effectiveness of Complementary Therapies [31](#B31-ijerph-18-01017)] and phytotherapy [ [33](#B33-ijerph-18-01017)]. On the other hand, we found some effective therapies for all the factors studied: hypnosis [ [34](#B34-ijerph-18-01017), [42](#B42-ijerph-18-01017)], Ayurveda [ [32](#B32-ijerph-18-01017)], laser [29](#B29-ijerph-18-01017)] and auriculotherapy together with acupuncture [ [41](#B41-ijerph-18-01017)]. We also identified some therapies that are effective on almost all factors: electroacupuncture [ [42](#B42-ijerph-18-01017)], yoga [ [40](#B40-ijerph-18-01017)], [ [36](#B36-ijerph-18-01017), [43](#B43-ijerph-18-01017)], phytotherapy [ [38](#B38-ijerph-18-01017)] and traditional Chinese medicine [ [30](#B30-ijerph-18-01017)]. However, there are two therapies that have been shown to be effective on only one factor in the study: electroacupuncture [ [37](#B37-ijerph-18-01017)] and music therapy [ [39](#B39-ijerph-18-01017)]. Moreover, some authors identify some safe CTs with no associated adverse events: kinesiology [ [31](#B31-ijerph-18-01017)], auriculotherapy together with acupuncture [ [43](#B43-ijerph-18-01017)], phytotherapy [ music therapy [ [39](#B39-ijerph-18-01017)]. [Supplementary Material Table S2](#app1-ijerph-18-01017)presents CTs, interventions and findings. 3.4. Limitations and/or Biases of the Selected Studies [Table 1](#ijerph-18-01017-t001)presents the limitations and/or biases of the selected studies. 4. Discussion [31](#B31-ijerph-18-01017)] or phytotherapy [ [33](#B33-ijerph-18-01017)]. In contrast, there are therapies, such as Ayurveda [ [35](#B35-ijerph-18-01017)], hypnosis [ [34](#B34-ijerph-18-01017), [42](#B42-ijerph-18-01017)], laser moxibustion [ [29](#B29-ijerph-18-01017)] and auriculotherapy together with acupuncture [ [41](#B41-ijerph-18-01017)], which present significant results, in terms of effectiveness throughout the follow-up of the RCT, as a solution to resolve symptoms derived from some treatments or from the disease itself. These would be, for acupuncture and auriculotherapy, a decrease in the occurrence of postsurgical constipation [ [41](#B41-ijerph-18-01017)]; for laser moxibustion, a decrease in cancer-related fatigue [ [29](#B29-ijerph-18-01017)]; for hypnosis, an improvement in fatigue [ [34](#B34-ijerph-18-01017), [42](#B42-ijerph-18-01017)], sleep disturbance and pain [ [42](#B42-ijerph-18-01017)], coinciding with the results of other authors concerning the pain-decrease effect [ [44](#B44-ijerph-18-01017)]; and for Ayurveda, a decrease in the occurrence of radiodermatitis and an improvement of its symptoms [ [35](#B35-ijerph-18-01017)]. [37](#B37-ijerph-18-01017)] reported that of the three elements studied (nausea-vomiting, anorexia and the MD Anderson Symptom Inventory (MDASI) scale), only a significant decrease in anorexia was observed. In contrast, Mao et al. [ [32](#B32-ijerph-18-01017)] obtained better results in their study because they observed improvements in fatigue, anxiety and depression. However, we cannot compare both RCTs as they do not analyse the same elements. [33](#B33-ijerph-18-01017)] mentioned above argues that the intervention carried out did not produce effective results. Although in another study it is shown that there is no clear scientific evidence about mistletoe effectiveness [ [10](#B10-ijerph-18-01017)], Tr\u00f6ger et al. [ [38](#B38-ijerph-18-01017)] suggest that phytotherapy with mistletoe therapy has benefits in 13 of the 15 items obtained from the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) scale, highlighting improvements in pain, fatigue, anorexia and depression. This indicates that not all phytotherapy interventions are effective, but that mistletoe therapy applied in the RCT by Tr\u00f6ger et al. [ [38](#B38-ijerph-18-01017)], for example, has great benefits for the patient. The effectiveness of these therapies is supported by other authors, such as in the study by Codini et al., where the effectiveness of vitamin C is studied and it is found that this treatment provides broad benefits for cancer patients [ [45](#B45-ijerph-18-01017)]. [36](#B36-ijerph-18-01017)] and Stoerkel et al. [ [43](#B43-ijerph-18-01017)] agree that its use improves fatigue and pain but contradict each other in terms of anxiety, which is found to decrease in the RCT by Stoerkel et al. [ [43](#B43-ijerph-18-01017)] and has nonsignificant results in the RCT by Charalambous et al. [ [36](#B36-ijerph-18-01017)]. This result is due to the fact that PMR and guided imagery were not the only therapies used in the study by Stoerkel et al. [ [43](#B43-ijerph-18-01017)], as other therapies such as self-hypnosis, acupressure and meditation also played a role, making the set of different therapies more effective, as we can observe in the studies by Araujo et al. [ [46](#B46-ijerph-18-01017)] and Tac\u00f3n et al. [ [47](#B47-ijerph-18-01017)], where it is highlighted that meditation yields positive effects like lower anxiety levels in patients with cancer, in addition to other factors, as the study by Zhang et al. also considers [ [48](#B48-ijerph-18-01017)]. [30](#B30-ijerph-18-01017)], music therapy [ [39](#B39-ijerph-18-01017)] and yoga [ [40](#B40-ijerph-18-01017)] also fail to show significant effects on all study factors. In the first study [ [30](#B30-ijerph-18-01017)], there is significant improvement in chest discomfort, fullness and distension and shortness of breath, but not for palpitations and pain. Moreover, other authors consider the use of traditional Chinese medicine in the decrease of side effects caused by cancer treatments such as chemotherapy or radiotherapy [ [49](#B49-ijerph-18-01017)]. In the second [ [39](#B39-ijerph-18-01017)], there is a greater reduction in perioperative anxiety in both intervention groups, but not in the other factors to be studied. However, in the yoga RCT [ [40](#B40-ijerph-18-01017)], they are not present in all of them, but only one of the components studied does not give a significant positive result. On the other hand, in the systematic review by Behzadmehr et al. [ [44](#B44-ijerph-18-01017)], yoga and music therapy are effective in the reduction of pain, a factor that was not highlighted in the studies about music therapy [ [39](#B39-ijerph-18-01017)] and yoga [ [40](#B40-ijerph-18-01017)] of this review. Similar results were found in the study by Gosain et al. [ [50](#B50-ijerph-18-01017)], where they affirm that, in addition to yoga being effective, this therapy also increases tolerance to side effects of chemotherapy. [32](#B32-ijerph-18-01017), [37](#B37-ijerph-18-01017)], phytotherapy [ [38](#B38-ijerph-18-01017)], PMR and guided imagery [ [36](#B36-ijerph-18-01017), [43](#B43-ijerph-18-01017)], traditional Chinese medicine [ [30](#B30-ijerph-18-01017)], music therapy [ [39](#B39-ijerph-18-01017)] and yoga [ [40](#B40-ijerph-18-01017)] are effective in some of the items studied, and they are mostly beneficial. [37](#B37-ijerph-18-01017)], laser moxibustion [ [29](#B29-ijerph-18-01017)] and traditional Chinese medicine [ [30](#B30-ijerph-18-01017)] described side effects, although they are listed as mild and rapidly resolving symptoms. Depending on the therapy, these are mild erythema, with 3 cases in 39 patients using laser moxibustion [ [29](#B29-ijerph-18-01017)]; mild tingling and redness, with 2 cases in 79 patients using electroacupuncture [ [37](#B37-ijerph-18-01017)]; and skin irritation and allergic reaction, with 4 cases in 36 patients using traditional Chinese medicine [ [30](#B30-ijerph-18-01017)]. However, in relation to traditional Chinese medicine, the study of Wang et al. affirms that there is little evidence to validate the therapy's safety [ [51](#B51-ijerph-18-01017)]. [25](#B25-ijerph-18-01017)]; auriculotherapy [ music therapy [ [33](#B33-ijerph-18-01017)]; and PMR and guided imagery together with self-hypnosis, acupressure and meditation [ [37](#B37-ijerph-18-01017)], coinciding with the results of other authors such as Araujo et al. [ [46](#B46-ijerph-18-01017)] and Gosain et al. [ [50](#B50-ijerph-18-01017)], who show that meditation is a safe intervention. [52](#B52-ijerph-18-01017)] and Thomford et al. [ [53](#B53-ijerph-18-01017)], in relation to phytotherapy, CTs can cause interactions with conventional medicine, some with fatal clinical outcomes. However, we found that some studies did not mention the risks or adverse effects in the use of certain therapies, such as electroacupuncture [ [32](#B32-ijerph-18-01017)], PMR and guided imagery [ [36](#B36-ijerph-18-01017)], yoga [ [40](#B40-ijerph-18-01017)] and phytotherapy [ [33](#B33-ijerph-18-01017)].
