INTRODUCTION a. nOPV 2 Background Circulating vaccine -derived poliovirus (cVDPV) outbreaks occur when the weakened strain of the poliovirus contained in the oral polio vaccine (OPV) genetically reverts into a form that can cause paralysis. In rare circumstances, this can occur when the OP V strain circulates in under -immunized populations for a long period of time, with the weakened strain contained in Type 2 OPV most at risk of reverting . A new tool developed for polio eradication is the novel oral polio vaccine (nOPV2), a modification of the existing OPV type 2 vaccine , which has been shown to provide comparable protection against poliovirus while being less likely to lead to cVDPV outbreaks. nOPV2 is being made available for outbreak response through WHO's Emergency Use L isting (EUL) procedure, a rigorous analysis of efficacy and safety data to address public health emergencies of international concern, such as polio. Countries wishing to use nOPV2 under an EUL will be able to introduce the vaccine in accordance with esta blished criteria. To date, the safety of nOPV 2 has been evaluated through phase 1 and phase 2 clinical trials. It has been well tolerated among adults, young children, and infants with no indication of any increase in general safety risk compared to mono valent oral polio vaccine ( mOPV2 ). There have also been no serious adverse events that are considered to be causally related to vaccination with nOPV2 have been identified . Still, countries will benefit from enhanced nOPV 2 safety monitoring processes that will facilitate rapid identification and response to safety signals should they arise. This monitoring will be particularly important during the approximately 3 -month initial global use period , as well as the approximately 24 months following the initial use period . Here, we describe a template that can be used to implement active surveillance for adverse events of special interest (AESI) by leveraging the existing resources and processes already established for acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) surveillance. b. AFP and AEFI surveillance background Global surveillance for polio includes monitoring for Acute Flaccid Paralysis ( AFP) cases. AFP cases are reported to local government area- level surveillance officers by health facility staff or a network of trained community members. Surveillance officers also perform active case finding at traditional and non-traditional healthcare locations. When an AFP case is identified, surveillance officers perform detailed case investigations, asking questions about symptoms and immunization status and collecting stool samples for laboratory analysis. Confirmed cases of polio are generally diagnosed via detection of poliovirus in stool samples from AFP cases. Polio can also be diagnosed by identification of the virus in asymptomatic close contacts of the case or by assessment from a national expert review committee. In addition to AFP surveillance, countries perform routine passive surveillance for all adverse events following immunization (AEFI). AEFI are any untoward medical occurrence which follow immunization and which do not necessarily have a causal relationship with the usage of the vaccine. The adverse event may be an unfavourable or unintended si gn, abnormal laboratory finding, symptom or disease . Although reporting structures may vary by country, these systems typically involve both National Regulatory Authorities (NRA) and National Immunization Programs and follow a process of case identification , reporting, and investigation separate from the AFP surveillance system . In addition, the national Vaccine Safety Advisory Committee/AEFI Causality Committee review data on serious AEFI and Version October 27, 2020 Guid e for Surveillance of AESI during novel Oral Polio Vaccine type 2 (nOPV2) Introduction 5 signal clusters to conduct a causality assessment based on established WHO processes. Causality assessment is a systematic evaluation to determine the likelihood that an event might have been caused by a vaccine or vaccination. During new vaccine introductions, post -licensure safety monitoring is critical to detect rare or unexpected adverse events since the vaccine is given to large number of individuals beyond those in Phase 1 and 2 clinical trials . In times of public health crises, such as during cVDPV outbreaks, enhanced vaccine safety surveillance processes can effectively and efficiently provide high quality data for public health decision -making in settings where clinical trial data is limited . Active surveillance for a focused list of adverse events of special interest (AESI) during the initial phase of use is an important complement to AFP and AEFI surveillance systems because it can assist with generating safety signals for complex conditions that may warrant timely further investigation to ensure public trust in the immunization program . c. For whom is the guide intended? This document is intended to assist countries and regions utilizing nOPV 2 in implementing active AESI surveillance to generate high quality safety data for decision -making purposes. It is developed for public health staff at the central, intermediate and peripheral levels who will contribute to the active surveillance of nOPV2 AESI including health care workers, vaccinators, surveillance staff and decision - makers in public health. It is meant to complement other safety monitoring activities, including passive AEFI surveillance and AFP surveillance, and should be adapted for individual country context s to address the roles of different stakeholders who will be involved in nOPV 2 safety monitoring effort s. These stakeholders may includ e the country's Expanded Program on Immunization (EPI), the NRA, the WHO Country Office (WHO CO), the Vaccine Safety Advisory Committee /AEFI Causality Committee, the Polio Expert Review Committee, GPEI and Bio Farma , the license holder . Data will be generated primarily for use by countries but will also benefit comparison across countries. B y standard izing the processes for AESI data collection , this guide will enable comparison of data across countries to improve the detection of safety signals at a regional and global level. d. Objectives of the guide The objective of this guide is to describe the process for conducting standardized high -quality active AESI surveillance during nOPV2 initial use in cVDPV outbreak response. The objective of active AESI surveillance is to detect rare, serious complex adverse events that may be anticipated based on what is currently known about polio vaccine . 2. ADVERSE EVENTS OF SPECIAL INTEREST a. List of conditions for AESI surveillance AESIs are a subset of AEFI that typically fall under one of the following categories: 1. Proven association with immunization in general (e.g. anaphylaxis , VDP V, Guillain Barr\u00e9 Syndrome) Version October 27, 2020 Guid e for Surveillance of AESI during novel Oral Polio Vaccine type 2 (nOPV2) Introduction 6 2. Proven association with a vaccine platform and/or adjuvant: (e.g., arthritis following recombinan t vesicular stomatitis virus vectored vaccine). 3. Theoretical concern based on immunopathogenesis. 4. Theoretical concern related to viral replication during wild type disease. 5. Theoretical concern because it has been demonstrated in an animal model with one or more candidate vaccine platforms. There have been no significant safety signals associated with nOPV2 thus far , though data is limited . Based on summary safety data from WHO , a number of conditions are likely to be of interest for nOPV 2 AESI surveillance . A working list of AESI conditions has been developed through consultation with WHO, the United States Center s for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and GPEI partners . The AESI conditions proposed for active surveillance include : anaphylactic reactions aseptic meningitis/encephalitis acute disseminated encephalomyelitis ( cVDPV) unexplained deaths A harmonized approach across countries will increase the power of surveillance to detect safety signals and allow comparability of findings to guide global decision -making and document lessons learned . The final list of conditions for AESI surveillance in a particular country will need to be defined with input from country level partners. b. Case definitions for AESIs Two types of case definitions are presented in this manual: (1) simplified case definitions (Annex 6); and (2) comprehensive Brighton Collaboration Case definitions (Annex 5 ). Simplified case definitions will be used at the peripheral level by frontline healthcare workers and designated AESI surveillance staff to identify and report AESI. These definitions have a low level of specificity, needing to be usable by health care workers to identify and report AESI. Simplified case definitions can be used in conjunction with the AESI Reporting Form and the AESI line listing form (described in the nex t section of this document). The s implified case definitions have been developed from multiple sources including medical textbooks, WHO and country -level AEFI surveillance definitions, AFP case definitions, and Brighton Collaboration case definitions. Brighton Collaboration case definitions will be used in the context of case ascertainment/ verification and data abstraction forms that will be a part of case investigation (Annex 5 ) and to assist with causality assessment. Brighton Collaboration case definitions exist for: death . Version October 27, 2020 Guid e for Surveillance of AESI during novel Oral Polio Vaccine type 2 (nOPV2) Introduction 7 3. FORMS AND TOOL DEVELOPMENT A total of 4 form s have been developed to assist countries in the collection of nOPV2 AESI data: a reporting form (Annex 2), a line listing form (Annex 3), a case ascertainment form (Annex 4), and a data abstraction forms for each AESI condition (Annex 5 ). The Reporting form, Case Ascertainment form , and the Line Listing form are simplified and/or modified versions of WHO AEFI forms and tools1 that have been adapted for the purposes of nOPV 2 AESI surveillance , including the Reporting form for Adverse Events Following Immunization (AEFI) and the AEFI Line Listing Form. The AESI condition -specific data abstraction forms are modified versions of AESI data abstraction forms used for other AESI surve illance efforts. These draft forms will potentially be further adapted for use in each country conducting nOPV2 AESI surveillance. The nOPV2 AESI Reporting form includes information on the patient, reporter, assessor (person that assessed the AESI), AESI, facility, and vaccinations administered . This form should be filled out by the staff that have identified an AESI case, including frontline health care worke rs, AFP or vaccine safety surveillance officers, or others. The nOPV2 AESI Line Listing form is to be filled out by a n AESI surveillance officer to keep track of potential AESI cases identified through active surveillance. It also enables staff at the nati onal and subnational level to keep track of AESI cases and identify potential clusters in space or time, or other patterns. The nOPV2 AESI Case Ascertainment Form will include clinical information obtained by surveillance staff from clinical records and patient interview. The form will enable verification of AESI cases. Data Abstraction Forms have been developed for each AESI and are to be used by surveillance officers or other designated personnel as part of investigating AESI cases and as part of causalit y assessment . These forms will aid in chart abstraction of information from patient files and provide information which will enable the classification of potential cases according to diagnostic certainty. Where appropriate, a process will be undertaken to harmonize nOPV2 AESI forms with AFP surveillance forms. All forms and tools will be piloted before use and electronic forms and tools will be used, if feasible. 4. SAFETY SURVEILLANCE Once a country decides to use nOPV2, several steps can be undertaken to assure readiness to conduct AESI surveillance , as described in the nOPV2 Vaccine Deployment Readiness Checklist . Passive AEFI surveillance , environmental surveillance, and active AFP surveillance should already be ongoing before nOPV2 use and continue after nOPV2 campaign s concl ude per country -specific methods . Environmental surveillance can help detect wild type virus or VDPV. Routine passive AEFI surveillance will be particularly important in detecting unexpected adverse events. Active AESI surveillance should be undertaken to identify selected AESI in the areas with nOPV 2 administration . The active AESI surveillance will help detect more complex adverse events that may be anticipated based on what is currently known about polio virus and OPV . The active surveillance will continue for 6 weeks following each nOPV2 campaign. It is recommended that AESI conditions occurring six months prior to the nOPV2 campaign are retrospectively identified to capture baseline rates. Surveillance will focus on children in the eligible age range for nOPV2, i.e. up to five years old. Interim an d final assessments of safety data will take place within each country and across countries using nOPV2 under EUL . A robust vaccine related event (VRE) response, described in the nOPV2 VRE Response plan, will ensure adverse event and 1 WHO Reporting form for Adverse Events Following Immunization (AEFI) and the AEFI Line Listing Form link: https://www.who.int/vaccine_safety/initiative/tools/AEFI_reporting_form_EN_Jan2016.pdf?ua=1 Version October 27, 2020 Guid e for Surveillance of AESI during novel Oral Polio Vaccine type 2 (nOPV2) Introduction 8 communication response s are aligned and coordinated ( Figure 1) . Please note the timing and activities described below may be modified based on field conditions, including restrictions due to COVID -19. The activities necessary for AESI surveillance include AESI identification, reporting, case ascertainment/verification and chart abstraction, investigation, analysis, and assessment. All AESI cases will be investigated and causality assessed, if temporally linked to vaccination. All countries using nOPV2 during in the initial use phase should consider enlisting a national or subnational - level Vaccine safety coordinator (level will depend on scope of SIAs), who will collaborate with the Ministry of Health, WHO, CDC and other partners to oversee and coordinate nOPV2 safety surveillance activities. Because active surveillance may generate more reports that will require special attention, having a designated person responsible for the management and coordination of AEFI/AESI information will be critical to the success o f the activitie s Figure 1: Timeline for nOPV 2 AESI surveillance Prospective nOPV2 AESI surveillance: Figure 2 below describes an example of a proposed prospective AESI surveillance flow. The process starts with a patient with an AESI presenting at a heal th facility in the nOPV2 campaign area. Information about the AESI condition, signs and/or symptoms will be recorded in facility records by a health worker. A n AESI surveillance officer ( AESI SO) or other designated person will visit selected facilities to identify AESI recorded in facility records on a regularly scheduled basis. The AESI SO will then report the AESI to the national level safety team using an AESI Reporting form (Annex 2) and will also complete an AESI L ine Listing fo rm (Annex 3) .

In this scenario, SOs will complete an AESI Reporting form (Annex 2 ) and an AESI Line Listing form (Annex 3) only . Case ascertainment/verification (via a Case Ascertainment form; Annex 4) and chart abstraction (via condition specific data abstraction forms ; Annex 5) may be done by a trained clinician (to be paid a stipend for the activity) or the national Vaccine safety coordinator. The Vaccine safety coordinato r will coordinate or be responsible for data entry (if paper forms are used) and will participate in case investigation (as part of a case investigation team) if the case is temporally linked to vaccination . AESI SOs are responsible for case identificati on, reporting, case ascertainment and data abstraction , and data entry (Figure 2, Track B) . In this scenario SOs will complete the AESI Reporting form (Annex 2) , AESI Case Ascertainment form (Annex 4 ), AESI Line Listing form (Annex 3 ), and relevant condition -specific data abstraction form(s) (Annex 5 ). The SOs will enter relevant data into a database to be shared with the relevant stakeholders at national/ subnational level. The Vaccine safety coordinator will participate in case investigation (as part of a case investigation team) , if the case is temporally linked to vaccination . The final steps include data analysis and the reconciliation of AESI data with AEFI and AFP data by the Vaccine safety coordinator, followed by data sharing and follow -up with the causality and polio expert review committee . Finally , the Causality Committee or Polio Expert Review Committee conducts a causality assessment. Depending on the strength of the c ountry's AFP surveillance infrastructure, AFP surveillance officers may be ideally positioned to fulfill the role of the AESI SO described above. If so, a process must be undertaken to integrate AESI surveillance into AFP surveillance, as well as separate processes to ensure AESI get identified, reported, investigated, and causally assessed as described in this manual. A process should also be undertaken to review the list of surveillance sites that AFP surveillance officers visit and add locations where AE SI cases are likely to present. While some of the AESI conditions are also captured by AFP surveillance (ex: VAPP, transverse myelitis, GBS), the AESI conditions will also have to be reported, and investigated and causally assessed (for verified cases temp orally linked to vaccination) as AESI in addition to the processes undertaken regarding AFP surveillance. Alternately, if a country does not have a strong active AFP surveillance system, then a standalone AESI system, with dedicated AESI SOs can be establ ished for countries using nOPV2 during the initial use period. The country may determine whether these SOs are managed by the AEFI surveillance program or another group. Further, specific activities described above may be undertaken by trained clinicians, who are provided stipends for conducting specific duties. Countries will make the final determination as to which specific staff cadres will be used for active AESI surveillance. The surveillance flow figure above (Figure 2) serve s as an example. EPI, NRA, AFP and AEFI surveillance infrastructures and staff will all have roles in implementing the AESI surveillance system. Specific roles and responsibilities will need to be outlined depending on the country context. Because of the potential for AFP, AEFI and AESI surveillance systems to detect the same conditions, efforts should be made to reduce duplication of activities and plan for data reconciliation . Version October 27, 2020 Guid e for Surveillance of AESI during novel Oral Polio Vaccine type 2 (nOPV2) Introduction 11 Retrospective nOPV2 AESI surveillance: For the recommended retrospective identification of AESI cases, the AFP or designated AESI surveillance officer will be res ponsible for reviewing records from active surveillance sites for a recommended period of 6 months prior to vaccine introduction. All data will be entered into a separate database to establish a baseline to which prospective AESI data may be compared and shared with the appropriate vaccine safety stakeholders in country and globally. Causality Assessment of reported nOPV2 AESI cases: A trained national Vaccine Safety Advisory Committee/AEFI Causality Committee and polio Expert Review Committee can conduct AESI causality assessments jointly or independently, or a member(s) of the ERC can participate with the Causality Committee to cond uct causality assessment. Countries should consider designating an oversight body (e.g. a National Immunization Technical Advisory Group (NITAG)), for this group to facilitate a comprehensive interpretation of the data. The Causality Committee and Expert R eview Committee will report to the oversight body; the oversight body will have access to the AFP, AESI and AEFI surveillance data. It will be important to clearly define roles, responsibilities and decision -making processes for this effort. 5. DATA FLOW AESI data may reside in three separate databases: (1) dedicated AESI database; (2) AFP surveillance database, if the AESI is a suspected AFP; and (3) AEFI database, for those AESI conditions that are temporally associat ed with vaccine administration. Envir onmental surveillance data may be managed by a separate surveillance system. AESI data may be owned and managed by the country's polio program, EPI program, or NRA program , and data should be shared between these programs . This will require commitment from all vaccine safety stakeholders to share and reconcile the data so that signals can be detected effectively and efficiently. The Vaccine Safety Advisory Committee/AEFI Causali ty Committee and polio Expert Review Committee should have access to both AEFI and AESI data to conduct causality assessment, as should any global oversight body. Data will flow from the peripheral to the national level following standard practices in eac h country. I f data flows from the district to provincial to national level, the following scheme is proposed: At the district level, designated staff will ensure that all forms filled at the peripheral level are incorporated in district level versions of t he AESI and AFP surveillance databases, as appropriate, on a weekly basis. Similar processes will occur at the provincial and national levels . The AESI portion of t his activity will be overseen by Vaccine safety coordinator . While these data are country -owned, a data sharing agreement should be considered with external partners such as WHO, Bio Farma, CDC, and other stakeholders for the purposes of global public health decision making (Annex I) . 6. ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES Each country will determine which public health staff will conduct the activities necessary for AESI surveillance. These activities include AESI identification, notification, reporting, investigation, analysis, and assessment. Depending on the level (ex: national vs. subnational ) roles may vary. Table 1 describes examples of specific activities that can be undertaken to successfully roll out AESI surveillance , with the expectation of adap ting to the context of each country.

EPI will share data and causality assessment conclusions with stakeholders 7. TRAINING nOPV2 AESI surveillance includes activities related to AESI identification, notification, investigation, reporting, analysis and causality assessment . Staff specifically tasked with these safety activities should receive training on the aspects of nOPV2 AESI surveillance they will contribute to , for example, Causality Assessment committees should be trained on causality assessment. The target audiences for the different components of AEFI surveillance will vary based on roles and responsibilities . AEFI systems strengthening training activities should also take place for vaccine safety staff. This should include national and subnational training on AEFI processes including reporting and investigation , and training of the Vaccine Safety Advisory Committee/AEFI Causality Committee on causality assessment. Front -line h ealth care workers working in nOPV2 campaigns , including vaccinators, should also be trained on reporting. 8. CONFIDENTIALITY All paper forms will be stored in locked file cabinets in a secured room. Efforts will be made to only share identifying information with those that need this information. Participants will be identified in databases through unique IDs. Persons with access to identifying information will sign a nondisclosure form. 9. LIMITATIONS This AESI surveillance is for the purpose of signal generation , not signal testing. Should a signal be identified and considered of importance after more detailed assessment of the available data, then further epidemiological studies to assess the signal would be required.

Encephalitis Encephalitis, or inflammation of the brain, is an acute onset of severe illness characterized by fever and altered mental status (encephalopathy). Focal neurological findings such as focal weakness, cranial nerve palsies, sensory deficits, or seizures can also be present. It occurs in approximately 2 -30 days. Reporting criteria: Encephalitis as described by a healthcare prov ider c ase definition Acute Disseminated Encephalomyelitis (ADEM) ADEM is a rapidly progressive neurological condition caused by a post -infectious inflammatory reaction in the brain and spinal cord. It is characterized by altered mental status and a decreased or complete loss of one or more cranial nerves, focal weaknes s and lack of muscle control or coordination of voluntary movements (ataxia). It occurs in approximately 2-30 days.

It is characterized by ascending, flaccid (limp) weakness in legs to arms mostly in both sides of the body, may cause numbness (sensory loss) and eventually paralysis. It occurs in approximately 1 -4 weeks Reporting criteria: GBS as described by a healthcare provider Source: Brighton case definition Myelitis/Transver se myelitis Myelitis/Transverse myelitis (TM) is a rare disorder caused by inflammation of the spinal cord . Transverse implies that the inflammation extends horizontally across the spinal cord. TM is characterized by: weakness in arms/legs; sensory symptoms such as numbness or tingling of the limbs, pain and discomfort as well as bowel or bladder dysfunction. The signs and symptoms depend on the area of spine involved and distribution of those symptoms may be symmetric or asymmetric affecting either legs, arms or both. It occurs within hours to weeks.
