THE WA Y AHEAD .............................................................................................................. Findings Force EXECUTIVE SUMMARY PAIN MANAGEMENT TASK FORCE E-1 Public EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Introduction The Army Surgeon General LTG Eric B. Schoomaker chartered the Army Pain Management Task Force (TF) in August 2009 to make recommendations for a MEDCOM compr ehensive pain management strategy that was holistic, multidisciplinary, and multimodal in its appr oach, utilizes state of the art/science mo dalities and technologies, and provides optimal quality of life for Soldie rs and other patients with acute and chronic pain. TSG appointed BG Richard Thomas, Assistant Surgeon General for Force Pro jection, as the TF Chairperson. Task Force membership included a variety of med ical specialties and disciplines from the Army, as well as representatives from the Navy, Air Force, TRICARE Management Activity, and Veterans Health Administration (VHA). The Task Force conducted its review and ana lysis utilizing site visits, interviews with clinical subject matter experts and medical staff, and data collection through Regional Medical Commands, as well as through a review of medical literature, and policies and regulation s of U.S. Army Medical Command (MEDCOM) and the Department of Defense (DoD). The Task Force conducted 28 site visits from October 2009 throu gh January 2010 at Army, Navy, and Air Force Medical Centers, Hospitals and Health Clinics, as well as VH A and civilian hospitals. Visits outside of Army Medical Treatment Facilities (MTFs) were scheduled based on rec ommendations from Service re presentatives, while also taking into account the facilities' reputati ons for innovative and state of the art ap proaches to pain medicine. During site visits, leadership and staff were asked to assess pain ma nagement capabilities, str engths, weaknesses, and best practices at their respective facilities. National Defense Authorization Act for 2010 Section 711 of the National Defense Au thorization Act for fiscal year 2010 tasked the Secretary of Defense to develop and implement a comprehensive policy on pain management by the military health care system, no later than March 31, 2011. Overview of Pain in the United States and the Military Health System Pain is the most frequent reason patients seek physician ca re in the United States, and more than 50 million Americans suffer from chronic pain. The annual cost of chronic pain in the U.S. is estimated at $100 billion, including health care expenses, lost income, an d lost productivity. Back pain alone is the leading cause of disability in Americans under 45 years of age. The failure to adequately address pain in the health care system continues to result in unnecessary suffering, exacerbation of other medical conditions, and huge financial and personnel costs. The variability that characterizes the practice of pain management in the U.S. health care system is a result of several factors. To begin with, each medical provider's unders tanding and approach to pain management is unique and variable, as it is sign ificantly influenced by each physician's aca demic medical training, mentors, cultural beliefs, and personal experiences with pain. In addition, there is a lack of clear ownership of pain medicine by any one medical specialty. According to the America n Academy of Pain Medicine, \"pain me dicine\" is a relati vely new medical specialty that is evolving along with its place in the medical hierarchy. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY PAIN MANAGEMENT TASK FORCE E-2 Public Although there are many treatment modalities for pain m anagement, one of the major components for the treatment of pain continues to be the use of Over-The-Counter and prescription medications. Th e use of medications is appropriate, required, a nd often an effective way to treat pain. However, th e possible overreliance on medications to treat pain has other unintended consequences, such as the increased prevalence of prescription medication abuse and diversion throughout the United States. Accordi ng to the Office of National Dru g Control Policy, prescription opioid analgesics are the mo st commonly abused prescription drugs in the U.S., with the highest rate of abuse occurring among those ages 18-25. For patients interested in treatments other than, or in additi on to, medication, Complementary Alternative Medicine (CAM) is a popular option. Though CAM is incre asing in popularity among patients, th is popularity has ye t to result in a parallel increase in acceptance and use within traditional medicine. There is a wide range of these therapies and treatments, such as acupuncture and yoga therapy, that have proven va luable in reducing an overreliance on use of medications to treat pain. Many of the Military Health System's (MHS) challenges with pain management ar e very similar to those faced by other medical systems, but the MHS also faces some unique issues because of its distinctive mission, structure and patient population. For example: /g120The nation expects the MHS to provide the highest leve l of care to those carrying wars' heaviest burdens. /g120The transient nature of the military population, incl uding patients and providers, makes continuity of care a challenge for military medicine. /g120Pain management challenges associated with combat po lytrauma patients require integrated approaches to clinical care that cross traditional medical specialties, not all of which are universally available across the MHS. MEDCOM and MHS lack a comprehensive pain management strategy that addresses current deficiencies. As a result, pain management initi atives are fragmented - often driven by local champions and subject to retirements, changes of command, and annual budget priorities for their continued existence. Finally, the MHS care for Warriors is rooted in a military cu lture that praises selflessness, toughness, and willingness to accept pain. \"No pain, no gain\" is a philosophy embraced by much of the Active Duty force and their leadership. This attitude often causes delays in seeking treatment, as Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen, and Marines attempt to work through their pain and \"tough it out.\" This frequently res ults in relatively minor acute issues later becoming harder-to- manage chronic conditions. Pain Management Task Force Recommendations The Pain Management Task Force develope d 109 recommendations that lead to a comprehensive pain management strategy that is holistic, multidiscip linary, and multimodal in it s approach, utilizes state of the art/science modalities and technologies, and provides optimal quality of life for Soldiers and other patients with acute and chronic pain. The recommendations rely heavily on an education and communication plan that crosses DoD and VHA medical staff and patients. The Task Force also place d an emphasis on linking to exist ing Service and MHS initiatives (e.g. Patient Centered Medical Home, Comprehensive Soldier Fitne ss) that support the pain management strategy. The requirement to synchronize both effort and approach to pa in management across the MHS and VHA is an essential first step in combating the variability th at plagues pain management across the MHS. This requirement was the driving force behind many of the other TF recommendations. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY PAIN MANAGEMENT TASK FORCE E-3 Public Recommendations are di vided into four areas: 1. Provide Tools and Infrastructure that Support and Enc ourage Practice and Researc h Advancements in Pain Management 2. Build a Full Spectrum of Best Practice s for the Continuum of Acute and Chronic Pain, Based on a Foundation of Best Available Evidence 3. Focus on the Warrior and Family - Sustaining the Force 4. Synchronize a Culture of Pain Awareness, Education, and Proactive Intervention All recommendations support the TF vision sta tement of \"Providing a Standar dized DoD and VHA Vision and Approach to Pa in Management to Optimize the Care for Warriors and their Families.\" The Way Ahead Improving pain management acro ss the DoD will require a significant reorganization, education, and training effort that will be most effective if pursued as a part of a DoD and VHA partnership. The Uniformed Services boast an impressiv e group of pain medicine physician su bspecialist but they are relatively few in number when compared with the mission. In addition to ensuring there are continued efforts to grow and retain pain medicine specialists, the MHS must develop a supporting team of clinicians and staff to assist specialists in addressing the pain management needs of their patients and staff. Pain medicine should be mana ged by integrated care teams which empl oy a biopsychosocial model of care. The standard of care should have objectives to decrease overreliance on me dication driven solutions and create an interdisciplinary appro ach that encourages collaboration among providers from differing specialties. The DoD should continue to responsibly explore safe a nd effective use of advanced and non-traditional approaches to pain management and support efforts to make these mo dalities covered benefits once they prove safe, effective and cost efficient. MHS Leadership must establish pain as a priority, with an urgency that leads to practice changes. The focus should be on prevention, followed by prompt a nd appropriate treatment that seeks to relieve acute pain and eliminate progression to chronic pain when possible. Including the VHA in this strategy is essential. DoD and VA should cooperate and share common educational materials, venues, protocols, and formula ries. A common standard would dem onstrate the power of a unified effort and expedite achievement of the common goal: providing a standardized DoD and VHA visio n and approach to pain management to optimize the care for Warriors and their Families. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY PAIN MANAGEMENT TASK FORCE E-4 Public Task Force Recommendation Objectives Provide Tools and Infrastructure that Support and Encourage Practice and Research Advancements in Pain Management Establish common pain taxonomy across the DoD and VHA. Describe a common language DoD and VHA pain assessment tool with visua l cues and a common set of measurement questions.

Incorporate scientific advances in battl efield surgery and medical technology to improve the delivery of pain care across the continuum. Expand telemedicine capabilities to incorporate pain management initiatives. Add a Joint Theater Trauma Registry module to capture, de fine, and characterize Wounded Warrior pain issues throughout the care continuum, from the battlefield to MTFs. Develop an electronic pain order set to assist health ca re providers in selecting evid ence-based, individually tailored pain management plans. Standardize medical equipment, personnel sup port, and training across t he continuum of pain care. Leverage advances in regional an esthesia techniques by integrating the data through an existing, sanctioned joint tracking data system. Identify substance abuse patients in Warrior Transition Units by embedding the necessary resources to develop and implement a coordinated care and monitoring plan. Mitigate the risk of prescription drug abuse and dependence in pain pati ents, with a focus on those receiving controlled substances for the tr eatment of chronic pain. Develop collaborative pain research strategies that advance Warrior pa in care and rapidly translate effective findings into practice. Improve military pain research strategic communications. Standardize the practice of pain medicine with pain management clinical practice and clinical management guidelines. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY PAIN MANAGEMENT TASK FORCE E-5 Public Build a Full Spectrum of Best Practices for the Continuum of Acute and Chronic Pain, Based on a Foundation of Best Available Evidence Incorporate integrative and altern ative therapeutic modalities into a patient centered plan of care. Leverage embedded osteopathic and physical therapy resources in the provision of manipulation therapies for musculoskeletal pain. Integrate pain management into primary care, consistent with the Patient Centered Medical Home Model. Adopt the VHA Stepped Care Model to ensure timely access to co llaborative care, redu ce pain and suffering, and improve quality of life for Warriors and their Families. Integrate the prevention, early identification, and treatment of injuries as a co mponent of the co mprehensive pain management strategy. Focus on the Warrior and Family - Sustaining the Force Implement a drug abuse assessment strategy to ensur e the efficacy of pain treatment and reduce aberrant behavior, abuse and addiction with opioids. Provide appropriate pain management and clinic al pharmacy oversight in Warrior Transition Units. Collaborate with the Warrior Transition Command to revise the satisfaction survey to incorporate pain metrics. Synchronize a Culture of Pain Awareness, Education, and Proactive Intervention Transform the pain curriculum at all levels of medical education and care delivery. Integrate TF recommendations and STRATCOM with other related DoD and VHA programs. Develop a pain management educ ation plan that addresses the full spectrum of stakeholders and issues. Establish enterprise-wide tiered pain management requirements to standardize patient care services. Establish interdisciplinary pain management services to oversee optimum patient-centered, integrated pain care. Develop requirements for Service pa in consultants to reflect an interdisc iplinary, integrative approach to pain management. Establish an effective pain manageme nt advisory board for DoD and VHA. PublicTASK FORCE REPORT PRELUDE TO THE PAIN MANAGEMENT TASK FORCE PAIN MANAGEMENT TASK FORCE 1 Public I. PRELUDE TO THE PAIN MANAGEMENT TASK FORCE In May 2008 the Health Policy and Services (HP&S) Proponency Office for Rehabilitation and Reintegration (PR&R) at Office of The Army Surgeon General (OTSG) began an ex amination of \"Pain\" as a distinctive issue for the U.S. Army Medical Command (MEDCOM). Around the same time, Congress proposed a \"Military Pain Care Act\" in the House and Senate versions of the National Defense Aut horization Act (NDAA) for 2009. The legislative language included an assessmen t that stated: \"Comprehensive pain care is not consistently provided on a uniform basis throughout the systems to all patients in need of such care.\" Although the Military Pain Care Act was not included in the NDAA for 2009, the Services were informed by Congress that the issue would be revisited in the NDAA for 2010. Subsequently, PR&R formed the MEDCOM Pain Management Work Group, consisting of local military pain management specialists from Army, Navy and Air Force, as well as a few OTSG staff officers. The gr oup concluded that MEDCOM's pain management strategy was focused on complying with the Join t Commission (JC) pain standards . Although this was a worthy objective and MEDCOM appeared to be successful in meeting th e JC standards for pain management, the work group was convinced that this goal was not sufficiently ambitious. During a PR&R-sponsored strategic summit in December 2008 , participants shared information about local pain care initiatives, including the Walter Reed-based Military Advanced Regional Anesthesia & Analgesia (MARAA) program that focuses primarily on the analysis of: /g120Acute pain management techniqu es for the battlefield, and ways to make improvements. /g120Pain management clinics that util ize a wide variety of integr ated medicine approaches. /g120The Veterans Administration's (VA) very mature pain management initiative. At the 2009 Army Family Action Plan (AFAP) Conference, one of the four new medical issues presented to Army Senior leadership was \"overmed ication of Service Members and Famili es.\" Senior leaders at the MEDCOM Behavioral Health Summit singled out pain management as a priority for the organization. Several months later, the Army Suicide Prevention Task Force (ASPTF) tasked MEDCOM to develop recommendations to provide alternate approaches to pain management. The ASPTF concluded there was a possible overrelianc e on pain management medications, while certain complementary approaches for pain management were being underutilized. Although the Pain Management Work Group memb ers concurred with the need to expand available trea tment modalities, they were also convinced that no new approach would have the desired effect unless it was pa rt of a comprehensive pain management strategy for MEDCOM. Despite some successes, such as establ ishing a requirement for a Pain C onsultant to The Surgeon General (TSG) and increased recognition of the ongoing efforts of many local pain management cha mpions around MEDCOM, there continued to be insufficient progress toward the developm ent of an effective comprehensive pain management strategy. The Pain Managem ent Work Group determined that: /g120Significant improvement in pain management would require a course correction for the organization. /g120Pain management would need to be redefined for MEDCOM. /g120MEDCOM would require a reorientation and an updated approach to a new defini tion of pain management. The PR&R and HP&S leadership supported the assessment that an increased amount of command attention and resources would be required to develop and implement an effective str ategy for an organization as large as MEDCOM. Following a briefing from the MEDCOM Chief of Staff, TSG elected to charter a Task Force (TF) to address the pain management c hallenge under his command.TASK FORCE ORGANIZATION AND LIMITATIONS PAIN MANAGEMENT TASK FORCE 2 Public II. TASK FORCE ORGANIZATION AND LIMITATIONS Charter Army Surgeon General LTG Eric B. Schoomaker establis hed the Pain Management Task Force in August 2009 to make recommendations for improving cl inical, administrative, and research pr ocesses for the provision of pain management care and services at MEDCOM facilities. The primary objective of the TF was to develop a template for a MEDCOM comprehensive pain management strategy that is holistic, multidisciplin ary, and multimodal in its approach, utilizes state of the art/science modalities and technologies, and provides optimal quality of life for Soldiers and other patients with acute and chro nic pain. A copy of the signed Ch arter is attached as Appendix C. LTG Schoomaker appointed BG Richard Thomas, Assist ant Surgeon General for Force Projection, as the TF Chairperson and later appointed th e remainder of MEDCOM TF members, ensuring representation from the continuum of clinical specialties involved in pain management. Because pain management challenges are not unique to MEDCOM, and a joint solution is required to ensure a uniform continuum of care is provided for Warriors and other Beneficiaries, TSG invited the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Manpower and Reserve Affairs (M&RA); Acting Un der Secretary for Health for the Veterans Health Administration (VHA); Su rgeons General of the Air Force a nd Navy; Deputy Director, TRICARE Management Activity (TMA); and United States Army Reserve (USAR) and United States Army National Guard (USNG) to nominate representatives for the TF. All of these organizations nominated individuals who were subsequently appointed to the Task Force. Structure and Member Selection Because relieving pain and su ffering is an objective that is organic to al l specialties across the health care continuum, there was an extensive list of stakeholders to be considered for inclusion on the TF. MEDCOM Regional Medical Commands submitted nomina tions for the TF with the understanding th at TF activities would require an estimated 25% of representatives' duty time. The TF Chairperson selected the number of members as well as the cross section of specialties required to adequately represent this complex issue, while ensuring a manageable TF size. The TF member list follows in Figure 1. Chairperson BG Thomas requested that t hose specialties not specifically repres ented on the Task Force be provided the opportunity to offer feedback on the TF recommendati ons prior to release of the Final TF Report. Their feedback has been solicited and integrated, as directed. A list of the medical specialties and stakeholders is attached as Appendix D.

The large amount of information co llected during the TF operations was man aged through a Web portal developed on Army Knowledge Online (AKO). Access to the AKO We b portal was limited to TF me mbers and select invited guests. Capabilities of the Web portal included document sharing, editing, and scheduling, as well as an extensive library of pain-related in formation links, news stori es, medical literatu re, and educational materials.

Assessment of current pain management clinical and administrative processes, capabilities, best practices, and research; 2. Identification of safe and effective complementary and alter native approaches to pa in management; and 3. Recommendations for improvements to clinical and administrative processes, capabilities, best practices, and research. Task Force Activities Data call The first activity of the Task Force was a pain management data call sent to MEDCOM Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs). Regional Medical Ce nters (RMCs) with a 100% retu rn rate, providing the TF with qualitative baseline summaries of MTF pain manage ment activities, initiatives, resources and perceived defici encies. This data provided the TF visibility of locations with unique approaches to pain care and the identity of local champions. Information from the data call help ed further focus TF areas of ex ploration and analysis. The data revealed a wide variation in approaches to trea ting acute and chronic pain across MEDCOM, specifically in coordination, collaboration, standardized measurement, trackin g, and resource availabilit y. MTFs of similar size and mission reported significant variations in pain management structure, staffing and available treatment modalities. Many promising local initiatives we re Unfinanced Requirements (UFR). There were neither standards for patient- centered, outcomes-based care nor actionable pain metrics across the enterpri se. In summary, there was no common understanding of pain manage ment responsibilities, approaches or resourcing across commands. A copy of the MTF distribution list and data call tem plate can be found in Appendix E. Meetings The Pain Management Task Fo rce held its first meeting 24 -27 August 2009. In addi tion to TF Chairperson BG Thomas, and the appointed members of the attendees included: /g120 ASA TMA /g120BG (Ret) Stephen Xenakis, M.D. The meeting also included invited representatives from: /g120MEDCOM /g120Warrior Transition Command (WTC) /g120Headquarters Department of the Army (HQDA) /g120Defense Centers of Excellence (DCoE) /g120Veterans Health Administration (VHA) The first day consisted of an orientation to the Pain Manage ment Task Force goals followed by presentations from MEDCOM, Army, DoD, and VHA progra ms and initiatives. These briefings were organized to: /g120Educate the TF membership about th e wide variety of ongoing init iatives related to the TF mission; /g120Educate the representatives on initiatives and programs related to TF objectives; and /g120Initiate collaboration and communication among TF participants to ensure activi ties complement existing efforts. (b) (6) (b) (6)TASK FORCE ORGANIZATION AND LIMITATIONS PAIN MANAGEMENT TASK FORCE 5 Public The second day TF members were divided into three facilitated breakout sessions focused on identifying Policy and Performance Management, Service Delivery, Warriors in Transiti on, and Program Integration issues related to pain management. The TF focused on these tasks in its init ial evaluation of MEDCOM pain management and began to develop a comprehensive pain management strategy. TF members decided to invite representatives from Air Force (USAF), Navy (USN), and Army Guard and Reser ve to ensure full representation. Following the initial meet ing, the TF held monthly in-person meetings a nd weekly or biweekly telephone conferences to provide updates, conduct issue discu ssions, and coordinate future TF activitie s. Additionally, ad hoc meetings were held among TF members while working on their assigned issues. Site Visits The Task Force conducted 28 site visits from October 2009 through January 2010. The TF visited Army, Navy, Air Force, and VA MEDCENS, MEDDACS and Health Cl inics as well as civilian facilities, which were chosen based on their reputations for innovative and state of the art approach es to pain medicine. Civilian facilities outside of MEDCOM were selected based on input from TF representatives. The TF developed a standardized site vis it template that was used to conduct interviews and re port findings on the site visits (Appendix F). Interview questions asked leaders hip and staff to assess pain management capabilities, strengths, weaknesses, and best practices at their respective facilities. The TF found a variety of best practices and confirmed the wide variation in existi ng practices and available resources, furthe r substantiating information provided through the MTF data call. Findings from the site visits, and other activities of the Task Force, are presented in this Task Force Report. Figure 2: Task Force Site Visit Map TASK FORCE ORGANIZATION AND LIMITATIONS PAIN MANAGEMENT TASK FORCE 6 Public Limitations and Caveats for the TF Report The Army Surgeon General chartered the Army Pai n Management Task Force to evaluate MEDCOM pain management, and although the TF membership and charter were natural ly \"Army-centric,\" The Surgeon General recognized the importance of in cluding Navy, Air Force, and Veterans Health Administration in this effort. At the start of the process, all TF members concluded that achieving significant pain mana gement improvements in their respective organizations would require developing recommendatio ns that could be applied to a larger DoD and VHA approach to pain care. As such, all recommendations in thi s report were developed with the intent of being part of a DoD and VHA comprehensive pain management strategy. Representations in this TF Report were made as part of t he TF mandate to provide recommendations regarding the DoD and VHA programs, initiatives, and projects. The Task Force understands that the Services and the Veteran's Health Administration, whil e having representation on the TF, have not ha d the opportunity to officially review and staff the recommendations within their organizations. While the TF Report appears to focus on the inadequac ies of pain medicine in th e military and VHA health care systems, there was no intention to leave an impression that standards of care are not currently being met. In fact, the DoD and VA facilities continue to deliver exceptional health care within accepted standards of care. During the site visits and interviews, the TF identified numerous best practices for pain management that were later used to develop the recommendations in this report. The TF mem bers determined that there was both a need and an opportunity to push the MHS and VHA beyond meeting the current standards of care. The Pain Task Force conducted its evaluation and analysis over the course of six months. With the exception of scheduled monthly meetings and site visits, the appointed members continued working at their regularly assigned places of duty and positions. The Ta sk Force leadership continually balanced the desire to leverage the synergy of gathering TF members with the competing reality that these were leaders in military medicine with clinical responsibilities. Lastly, with the limited time available, the Task Force was not able to fully ev aluate and make specific recommendations for Pediatric and Palliative Care pain management. The consens us from the Task Force members was that a thorough evaluation of th ese areas would require further experti se and time, neither of which were available to the TF. PAIN MANAGEMENT OVERVIEW PAIN MANAGEMENT TASK FORCE 7 Public III. PAIN MANAGEMENT OVERVIEW Introduction Treating pain is one of medicine's ol dest and most fundamental responsibilities. Yet modern medicine continues to be challenged in its efforts to understand pain mechanisms an d to relieve pain and suffer ing. Pain is an enigmatic issue that places significant burden s on patients, families, medical providers, and employers. Pain is the most frequent reason patients seek physician care in the United States and it affects more Americans than diabetes, heart di sease and cancer co mbined (Centers for Dis ease Control and Preve ntion and American Academy of Pain Medicine). When in cluding health care expenses, lost income, and lost productivity, the annual cost of chronic pain in the U.S. is estimated at $100 billi on (National Institutes for Health). Back pain alone is the leading cause of disability in Americans under 45 years of age. The variability in pain management practice throughout medicine is partially due to the lack of a congruent pain curriculum in the academic preparatio n of various medical professionals. The topic of pain management is often poorly presented and inadequat ely developed in the curricula of many U.S. medical, nursing, pharmacy, and other medical professional schools, as well as in their respective continuing education. A medical provider's understanding and approach to pain management is unique and variable. It is significantly influenced by academic medica l training, currency of pain curriculum, medic al mentors, cultural beliefs, and personal experiences with pain. Co nsiderable variation in the management of pain currently exist s also, in part, due to a lack of clear ownership of pain medicine by any one medical specialty. This has resulted in medical turf-wars as diverse specialties battle for reimbursement and workload credit. The failure to ade quately address pain in the health care systems continues to result in unnecessary suffering, exacerbation of other medical conditions and huge financial and personnel costs. According to the American Academy of Pain Medicine, \"pain medicine\" is a rel atively new medical specialty that is evolving in conjunction with advances in pharmacology and interventional procedures. Its place in the medical hierarchy is still developing. There is much variability in what constitutes a \"Pain Specialist\" or \"Pain Clinic.\" This creates uncertainty for patients and pr oviders. The perception of many patients and providers is that pain management specialists fall within one of two categories: in tervention-centered (e.g., needles) or medication- centered (e.g., pills). Neither of thes e unitary approaches to pain management complete ly meets the needs of patients, who often present complicated causes and reasons for their pain. Therefore, a comprehensive and integrated approach to pain management across se veral medical specialties is required. Although there are many treatment modalities for pain m anagement, one of the major components for the treatment of pain, whether in primary care or by \"pain specialists, \" continues to be the use of Over-the-Counter (OTC) and prescription medications. Using medications to treat pa in is appropriate, require d, and often effective. In some cases, an increased reliance on pr escription medications for pain treatment appears to be influenced by the fact that most pain medications are relatively inexpensive, patien ts readily accept their use, a nd they require minimum time expenditure on behalf of the provider and patient. The possible overreliance on medications to treat pain has other unintended consequen ces, however, such as an increase in prescription medica tion abuse and dive rsion throughout the United States. According to the Office of National Drug Policy, prescription op ioid analgesics are the most commonly abused prescription drugs in the U.S., with the highest rates of abus e occurring among those between the ages of 18 and 25 (Wilson, 2006). Th ese medications are often diverted from family members or friends and are viewed as \"legal,\" less shameful to use, and safer than illega l drugs (NIDA, 2008). PAIN MANAGEMENT OVERVIEW PAIN MANAGEMENT TASK FORCE 8 Public For patients seeking a treatment plan that includes more than just medicatio n, Complementary Alternative Medicine (CAM) is gaining popularity, thoug h this has yet to result in a parallel in crease in the acceptance and use of these complementary modalitie s within traditional medicine. There is a wi de range of these therapies and treatments, such as acupuncture and yoga therapy, that have proven valuable in reducing an overreliance on use of medications to treat pain. There are many reasons individuals may seek the option to use CAM, not the least of which is the failure of current treatment to relieve thei r pain. Current research indicates that part of the appeal of CAM includes the opportunity for greater personal involvement in health maintena nce, holistic health beliefs and, for those with chronic conditions, an active coping mechanism (Bisho p, Yardley and Lewith, 2007; Sollner et al., 2000). Understanding that pain is not just a symptom of disease but at times, is a disease process in itself, is a fundamental change occurring in modern medicin e, explaining the new emphasis on ef fective pain control. Regardless of the treatment setting, inadequate acute pain control is assoc iated with a myriad of physiologic changes that can significantly increase patient morbidity and possibly mortality (Dubois, 2009). Evidence suggests that untreated or poorly treated acute pain, and the pro-in flammatory and immunosuppr essive responses assoc iated with it, may result in deleterious health effects for months or even years after the initial onset of pain (Meiler, 2006). Pain is a disease state of the nervous system and deserves the same management attention given to any other disease states. Pain in MEDCOM, MHS, and VHA The Military Health System's (MHS) challenges with pain management are very similar to those faced by other medical systems. However, there are some unique issues faced by the MHS because of its distinctive mission, structure and patien t population. The MHS's mission to take care of Service Members and their Families extends beyond the usual relationship between a health care system and its patients. Providing world-class medical care is always an imperative, but during a time of war, its importance is heightened. The nation expects a nd demands that the MHS provide the highest level of care possible for those carrying the heaviest burdens. Doin g any less than this is unacceptable to the military leadership, Congress, and the American people. The likelihood that patients have their me dical care coordinated by a sing le Primary Care Manager (PCM) remains very low in the MEDCOM. The transient nature of the military population, including bot h patients and providers, creates extraordinary challenges to prov iding continuity of care, something very important to pain management. Ongoing access to a PCM is often limite d because of provider deployment s, Temporary Duty (TDY) for training, or Permanent Change of Station (PCS) moves. Patients are al so subject to many of these same variables. The inability to provide continuity of care is extremely problematic when attempting to develop and implement long-term treatment plans for pain management and other chronic me dical conditions. This often exposes patients to duplicative appointmen ts, laboratory tests, and medical procedures, along with inco nsistent treatment approaches that can cause confusion, frustration and in some case s unnecessary suffering. Modern military medicine is unparalleled in its ability to save Wounded Warriors. Body armor and improved delivery of battlefield medicine have in creased patient survival from wounds that were fatal in previous conflicts. This, however, has resulted in pain management challe nges for combat polytrauma patients. One su ch challenge is the need to provide pain control for po tentially medically unstable Warriors im mediately following injury and then continuously during transport to secondary and tertiary care facilities. Other challenges include the management of comorbid conditions, such as post concussive syndrome, mild-Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) and PTSD. These latter conditions require integrated appr oaches to clinical care that cross traditional medical specialtie s, not all of which are universally available across the MHS. Overall, both MEDCOM and MHS lack a comprehensive pain management strategy, exacerbating several patient- provider continuity challenges. The MED COM and MHS are responsible for patient care throughout the world. PAIN MANAGEMENT OVERVIEW PAIN MANAGEMENT TASK FORCE 9 Public However, no widely disseminated pain management philosophy is currently in place and specialty care services, personnel, and treatment modalities are neither stan dardized nor predictable across MTFs. The MEDCOM and MHS have no published standa rds for pain managemen t structure, capabilities, or person nel for their clinics, hospitals, or medical centers. As a result, MEDCOM and MHS pain managem ent initiatives are fragm ented, driven by local champions and subject to retirements, changes of command, and annual budget priorities for their continued existence. A PCS move for a Service or Family Member can result in loss of access to cert ain treatment modalities th at have proven successful for pain management. Losing access to multimodal treatm ent options frequently results in an overreliance on medications, associated co mplications, decreased quality of life and, eventually un necessary burdens on both the health care system and Families. Another complication is that the MHS care for Warriors is rooted in a military culture that praises selflessness, toughness, and a willingness to accept pain. \"No pain, no gain\" is a philosophy embraced by much of the Active Duty force and the ir leadership. This attitude often results in dela ys in seeking treatment as Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen, and Marines attempt to work through their pain and \"tough it out.\" This frequently results in rel atively minor acute issu es becoming harder-to-manage chronic conditions. Additionally, the military faces complex pain manag ement challenges during a time of war when the patient population is sustaining le vels of physical and emotional trauma unparalleled in civilian medicine. Veterans Health Administration Pain Management Initiative The Veterans Health Administration initiated a national pain strategy in 1998 in an effort to develop a system- wide approach to pain management, with an ultimate goal of reducing suffe ring among Veterans with acute and chronic pain. The strategy aimed to establish consistent pain managem ent understanding and expectations among the patients, providers, and support staff in a medical system that cares for more than 5.8 Million patients in 153 Medical Centers, 134 Co mmunity Living Centers (NH Care), 6 independent outpatient clinics, and 783 Community Based Outpatient Clinics across the U.S. \"Pain as the 5th Vital Sign\" was promoted in all inpatient and outpatient clinical settings in or der to ensure consistency of pa in assessments th roughout the VHA. One of the elements the plan addressed wa s the complexity of chronic pain management, which is often beyond the expertise of a single practitioner, especially for patients whose pain problems are complicated by PTSD, combat injuries, and substance abuse. Primary care prov iders' ability to effectively deal with pain management challenges requires additio nal education and access to resources, such as pain medicine specialists and behavioral specialists, as we ll as interdisciplinary pain clinics in or der to effectively evaluate and manage these complex patients. The VHA pain management strategy was strengthened in October 2009 with the publication of VHA Directive 2009-053 for Pain Management (Appendix B-9). This directive provides policy and implementation procedures for the improvement of pain management consistent with th e VHA National Pain Management Strategy and in compliance with generally accepted pa in management standards of care. It also defined the \"Stepped Care\" model for pain management. This model serves as the framework for developing orga nizational capabilities th at support timely access to providers, treatment modalities, an d specialty referrals commensurate with patient pain management needs. Stepped Care balances a focus on managing pain as early as possible in a primary care setting while providing access to pain medicine specialty consult ation, and interdisciplinary and multimodal pain management resources when required. It also emphasizes optimal pain co ntrol, improved function, and increased quality of life. \"No pain, no gain\" is a philosophy embraced by much of the Active Duty force and their leadership and this frequently results in relatively minor acute issues becoming harder-to-manage chronic conditions PAIN MANAGEMENT OVERVIEW PAIN MANAGEMENT TASK FORCE 10 Public Patients and Families are encouraged to be active partici pants in their pain management plans of care. Lastly, the national strategy promotes standardi zed education and training of medica l staff appropriate to their clinical settings and role. Pain Care Legislation Section 711 of the National Defen se Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2010 (FY10 NDAA) tasked the Secretary of Defense to develop and impl ement a comprehensive policy on pain ma nagement by the MHS, no later than March 31, 2011. This policy will cover: 1. The management of acute and chronic pain. 2. The standard of care for pain management to be used throughout the Department of Defense. 3. The consistent application of pain assessments throughout the Department of Defense. 4. The assurance of prompt and appropriate pain car e treatment and managem ent by the Department when medically necessary. 5. Programs of research related to acute and chronic pa in, including pain attributable to central and peripheral nervous system damage characteristic of injuries incurred in modern warfare, brain injuries, and chronic migraine headache. 6. Programs of pain care education and training for health care pers onnel of the Department of Defense. 7. Programs of patient education for Members suffering from acute or chronic pa in and their Families. The Secretary of Defense was also directed to revise the poli cy on a periodic basis in accordance with experience and evolving best practice guidelines. Not later than 180 days after the implementation date of the policy and on October 1 each year thereafter through 2018, the Secr etary shall submit to the Committee on Armed Services of the Senate and the Committee on Armed Services of the Hous e of Representatives a report on the policy that will include: 1. A description of the policy implement ed, and any revisions to such policy. 2. A description of the performance measures used to determ ine the effectiveness of th e policy in improving pain care for Beneficiaries enrolled in the military health care system. 3. An assessment of the adequacy of Department pain ma nagement services based on a current survey of patients managed in Department clinics. 4. An assessment of the research projects of the Depa rtment relevant to the treatment of the types of acute and chronic pain suffered by Members of the Armed Forces and their Families. 5. An assessment of the training provided to Department he alth care personnel with respect to the diagnosis, treatment, and management of acute and chronic pain. 6. An assessment of the pain care education programs of the Department of Defense. 7. An assessment of the dissemination of information on pain management to Beneficiaries enrolled in the military health care system. The Pain Task Force was nearly ha lf-way into its evaluation of pain management in the MEDCOM, MHS, and VHA when this legislation was signed in October 2009. At that time, a comparis on between the NDAA language and the Task Force's charter, ongo ing analysis, and the pain management strategy under devel opment validated the current direction of the Task Force.FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS PAIN MANAGEMENT TASK FORCE 11 Public IV. FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 4.1 Provide Tools and Infrastructure that Support and Encourage Practice and Research Advancements in Pain Management One of the major observations realized during the Pain Task Force site visits was a general feeling among medical providers that they were i ll-prepared to manage th e full continuum of pa in management responsi bilities for their patients. With the exception of those with advanced training in pain manageme nt, providers almost universally communicated that they did not have the necessary training, time, support staff, modalities, or available consultative services in their \"pain toolkit\". Pain care tools, clinical orientation, and capabilities varied greatly between MTFs, even those with a similar si ze and mission. There was also signific ant variation in the orientation, documentation, and understanding of pain management re sponsibilities within individual MTFs. It was difficu lt to find consistency in either the MTF capabilities or the exp ectations of their clinical staffs. Although most primary care providers felt they could adequately provide pain care for their acute pain patients, most would qualify this statement by adding t hat the available modalities were la rgely limited to medic ation and possibly Physical Therapy (PT). MTFs with pain management specialty care are frequently only able to provide that care to small segments of the facilities' patients, many times for Warriors in Transition (WT) or Active Duty only. Patients unable to access specialty care at the MTFs are referred to network care of varying perceived quality and value. It is clear that any first step in improving pain care should consist of developing a system of tools and capabilities for provider \"toolkits.\" Develo ping and deploying a un iform approach to pain care t hat includes common taxonomy, tools, technologies, medical capabilities, and data coll ection across DoD and VHA will have wide appeal and the potential to make significant im provements in the practice of pain medic ine. The tools, education and pain structure will create a common language, standardize measurement of pain, and facilitate enhanced data collection, treatment outcomes reporting and analysis. After establishing each Service and MTF baseline, the pa in management infrastructure and tools must be integrated into the medical practice, pain care must be optimized acros s the continuum, and a vali d and strategically informed research agenda must be developed and resourced. The MHS should build on lessons learned from the VHA pain initiative. Finally, initial prior ities should focus on Wounded Warriors and their Families by ensuring that future pilot projects target areas with large WT and Veteran populations. FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS PAIN MANAGEMENT TASK FORCE 12 Public Standards and System Improvements Figure 3: A Summary of Categories for Standards and System Improvements Provide Tools and Infrastructure that Support and Encourage Practice and Research Advancements in Pain Management Standards and System Improvements/g120Standardized Pai n Taxonomy /g120Standardized Pain Assessment Tool /g120Pain Management Survey /g120Nursing Role Pain Management /g120Standardized Credentialing /g120Productivity Measures /g120DoD Joint 4.1.1 Standardized Pain Taxonomy Objective: Establish common pain taxonomy across the DoD and VHA. The Joint Commission's 2001 pain mana gement standards state that every pati ent has a right to have their pain assessed and treated (Joint Commission Web site). Any effectiv e pain assessment is predicated on a clinician's understanding of \"pain \" and pain-related terms, yet there is no st andardized DoD, much less DoD and VHA, pain taxonomy to use as a foundation for this asse ssment. Even among clinical experts in the field of pain medicine, it is challenging to come to a consensus on the exact definition of pain, let alone the many subsets and types of pain. A common pain vocabulary is fundamental to the creation and proliferation of a common un derstanding and approach to pain management among providers and patients throughout DoD and VHA. Figure 4: Fundamental Pain Words PainPain is an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with actual or potential tissue damage or described in terms of such damage. Pain is always subjective. Pain can be acute or chronic. Acute PainAcute pain is a normal physiologic response, usually time-limited, to a noxious stimulus that enhances survival by warning the individual of impending or potential injury or progression of disease. If the noxious stimulus pe rsists, changes in the peripheral tissues and both the central and peripheral nervous systems can lead to sensitizatio n that worsens and prolongs the pain from noxious stimulation. Appropriate management of acute pain may prevent the onset of the pathophysiologic processes that change the spinal cord and brain and lead to chronic pain. Chronic PainChronic pain continues beyond the normal time expected for healing and is associated with the onset of pathophysiologic chan ges in the central nervous system that may adversely affect an individual's emotional and physical well-being, cognition, level of function , and quality of life. Chronic pain serves no apparent useful purpose for the in dividual and may be diagnostically and therapeutically approached as a chronic disease process. FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS PAIN MANAGEMENT TASK FORCE 13 Public The military and VHA deliver care around the world to a population of providers and patients that is constantly on the move. Standardization across the DoD and VHA is necessary to ensure continuity of care across the continuum, as well as a common understanding and framework for provi ders and patients. Standar dization allows for improved Provider-Provider and Patient -Provider communication, better interpre tation and implementation of practice guidelines, and higher quality of data. As an example, the Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) Task Force developed a list of DoD and VHA TBI related terms and definitions. This proved to be a key step for further de velopment of DoD and VHA be nefits, care coordination, and transition between the variety of DoD and VHA health care settings, from in-theater to stateside. Furthermore, it helped establish and synchro nize a uniform language for TBI-related rese arch coming from both the DoD and VHA. A common pain taxonomy must be defined and integrat ed into the organization. The TF reached consensus on a list of definitions, including three fundamental wo rds - pain, acute pain, and chronic pain - in the pain taxonomy. These definitions were developed using accepted resources (International Association for the Study of Pain - IASP) and are recommended for integration into MHS policies and regulations. The entire list of pain taxonomy is included in Append ix B-1. The list should be distribu ted to all DoD and VHA health care sites, posted internally, and made av ailable to providers and patients on line. A readily available list of standardized pain terms will not only enhance user sati sfaction but also promote uniformity when discussing pain care throughout t he DoD and VHA. Recommendation 4.1.1.1 Establish a uniform understanding and use of key pain-related terms in the vocabulary of the DoD and VHA health care systems. Recommendation 4.1.1.2 Identify a process to Review, Revise, and Approve DoD and VHA definitions for pain, acute pain, and chronic pain. Recommendation 4.1.1.3 Integrate DoD and VHA definitions for pain, acute pain, and chronic pain into existing training, policies and regulations, and standards throughout DoD and VHA. 4.1.2 Standardized Pain Assessment Tool Objective: Describe a common language DoD and VHA pain assessment tool with visual cues and a common set of measurement questions. The most commonly used tool to measure pain in both civ ilian and military medicine settings is an 11-point, 0-10 Visual Analog Scale (VAS). During site visits, the TF received a great deal of negative feedback regarding the use and perceived value of the VAS Pain Scal e. A majority of the doctors, nurses, ph ysical therapists, medics and other clinicians who were interviewed repo rted similar negative feelings abou t the VAS Pain Scale, including: /g120The VAS Pain Scale is inconsistently administered. /g120The VAS Pain Scale is regarded as very subj ective and had no functional anchors. /g120The VAS Pain Scale assessments recorded in patient medical records ar e considered to have little value by clinicians at all levels. These findings were of great concern to the Task Force. In the MEDCOM alone, there ar e approximately 42,000 outpatient visits per day, the majority of wh ich include a pain assessment (Army Me dicine Web site). These pain FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS PAIN MANAGEMENT TASK FORCE 14 Public assessments are subsequently recorded in the patients' medical records. TF findings indicate that because of the noted VAS Pain Scale failings, this information is of little value and represents a missed opportunity to capture useful, consistent, and actionable information about a patient's pain. Wh en factoring in the impact of these shortcomings across the rest of DoD, the imperative to improve and standardize this pain assessment is clear. The Pain Task Force determined that a new DoD and VHA Pain Assessment Tool was needed to obtain actionable information at every patien t encounter across the MHS. The new Pain Assessment To ol must be: 1. Validated: A. Able to measure pain intensity, mood, stress, biopsychosocial impact, and functional impact; 2. Objective and useful in evaluating treatment effectiveness: A. Practical and adaptable to multiple clinical settings and scenarios throughout the continuum of care (e.g. battlefield, transport, combat support ho spital, primary care, medical center, pain medicine specialty services); B. Easily adapted and int egrated into DoD and VHA co mputer medical databases; C. Standardized into all levels of medic al training across all roles of care (e.g. useful for the medic, the ward nurse, the primary care provider, the pain researcher, a nd the pain management specialist); and 3. Consistent with current validat ed pain research tools. Using these attributes as a guide an d pairing them with the best availabl e pain scale research, the Task Force selected references and ex pert opinion, to develop a ne w Pain Assessment Tool for testing and refinement with the goal of achieving its widespread use in the DoD and VHA (Appendix B-2). Figure 5: Defense and Veterans Pain Rating Scale In the MEDCOM alone, there are approximately 42,000 outpatient visits per day, the majority of which include a pain assessmentFINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS PAIN MANAGEMENT TASK FORCE 15 Public This new tool combines the validated 11 -point pain scale used by clinical researchers with a simple green, yellow, and red scale suitable for combat medi cal conditions. Furthermor e, this tool anchors each numeral on the 11-point scale with standardized ' experiential' and ' functional' language, greatly enhancing clarity for both patients and providers when discussing pain le vels and treatment effectiveness throughout the care continuum. The new Pain Assessment Tool requires add itional resources, including: /g120Linguistic and graphic support; /g120AHLTA / VISTA Essentris integration: - Enterprise-wide patient and provider re -education efforts in both DoD and VHA, - DoD and VHA multicenter research study to validate the tool (see Appendix B-2), - Establish metrics for traini ng success and practice that are evaluat ed annually, driven by research from a central pain management advisory board, and used to update and continuously improve the Pain Assessment Tool. The tool also includes four supplemental questions for clinicians at all levels to evaluate the bi opsychosocial impact of pain. Questions include the im pact of pain on general activity, mood, level of stress and sleep. These supplemental questions, when combined with the functionally anchored 11-poi nt scale, will provide a potentially powerful clinical tool in evaluating a patient's pain, c onsidering treatment goals, and establish ing the most appropriate treatment plan. Figure 6: Defense and Veterans Pain Supplemental Questions The impact of this tool on patient care is likely to be very si gnificant. By approving, validat ing, and implementing this tool, the DoD and VHA health care systems should improve both the quality and quantity of objective pain data in what is currently considered to be a mo stly subjective and difficult to interpret part of medicine. This tool will impact every aspect of clinical medicine and increase the qu ality and consistency of pa in evaluation and outcomes FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS PAIN MANAGEMENT TASK FORCE 16 Public measurement. The reduction in variability of pain evaluati ons should greatly enhance patient care and exceed the spirit and intent of the Joint Commission's 2001 pain standard. The current lack of standardized pain assessments, pain data col lection, and pain coding throughout DoD and VHA adversely impacts pain management along the entire care continuum and imp edes the effort of military, VHA and civilian research to identify the most effective pain management strategies. As a result, DoD still does not possess large databases that would enable medici ne, through large prospective blind ed clinical trials, to test the effectiveness of many of the pain medicine interventions used routi nely today, particularly the effectiveness of combined treatments. Without actionable data, it is more difficult to determi ne best practices or the most effective treatments for reducing specific types of acute and chronic pain. Any movement toward a common DoD and VHA pain strategy should begin with a common pain assessment and th e eventual development of a de-identified data registry. Recommendation 4.1.2.1 Review and approve the new DoD and VHA common Pain Assessment Tool validation plan. Recommendation 4.1.2.2 Validate Pain Assessment Tool in DoD and VHA facilities. Recommendation 4.1.2.3 Integrate the Pain Assessment Tool, upon validation, into training, clinical practice, and data collection of pain management in DoD and VHA. 4.1.3 Pain Management Survey Objective: Establish a common baseline of pain care capabilities across DoD and VHA by creating a modified version of the 2009 VHA Pain Management Survey to distribute to all DoD MTFs. It is very difficult to make accurate compar isons between MEDCOM MTF pain ma nagement capabilities. The MTF data call survey conducted by the Task Force at the start of its evaluation indicated that there was no common baseline for understanding pain management concepts, approac hes, and capabilities. It is even more complicated to attempt to compare MTFs across DoD, and another level of complexity is added when making comparisons with the VHA. Collaborating on future pain management priorities and initiatives will require common assessments of pain management capabilities. The VHA administered a pain managem ent capability survey to 100% of its MTFs in 2009. The creation of a modified version of this survey for Do D facilities would leverage the da ta already collected by the VHA and standardize measurement across the DoD and VHA conti nuum, enabling the identificati on of best practices across care settings and identifying future research topics. Representatives from each of the Services reviewe d the VHA survey and assisted with revisions to make it more applicable to DoD, repl acing VHA-specific data elements with DoD data elements. Each Service representative will be provided the opportunity to incl ude Service-specific questions. This approach will help identify common capabilities across DoD and VHA and assist with t he measurement of progress when implementing pain management strategies. Task Force-recommended definiti ons should be incorporated into the survey to ensure its future validity following implementation of TF recommendations on standardizin g DoD and VHA orientation to pain. FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS PAIN MANAGEMENT TASK FORCE 17 Public Recommendation 4.1.3.1 Administer a modified VHA pain survey across DoD MTFs to establish a baseline of pain care capabilities. Recommendation 4.1.3.2 Continue to periodically administer the survey to track improvements at DoD MTFs to ensure a standardized measurement of pain longitudinally and across organizations. 4.1.4 Nursing Role in Pain Management Objective: Evaluate the utilization, potential roles, and certification requirements for Nurses in the DoD pain management strategy. The American Nursing Association defines Nursing as: \"The protection, promotion, and optimization of health and abilities, prevention of illness and injury, alleviation of suffering through the diagnosis and treatment of human response, and advocacy in the care of individuals, families, communities, and populations.\" Nurses comprise the largest health care profession and have been the traditional bearers of the patient advocacy torch. Pain is the most frequently used nursing diagnosis in all delivery of care models, and the assessment and management of pain is significant to every professional registered nurse. Their unique qualifications and relationships with patients make nurses an essential component of any pain management strategy. Nurses provide hospitals and patients with a capable, professional workforce adept at measuring, monitoring, evaluating, and documenting pain interventions and outcomes. Nursing staff interviewed during TF site visits included Registered Nurses, Licensed Practical Nurses, Nurse Practitioners, Advanced Practice Nurses, and Nursing Assistants. Their responses to the interview questions paralleled those from other health care professionals. The most common observation made by nurses concerned their inability to identify any rationale behind the variability in pain management practices among providers. Nurses are most often the ones responsible for assessing pain, administering pain medications, and communicating pain management issues to a patient's provider. They frequently expressed an inability to understand the underlying principles that would explain the lack of a standardized approach to pain care amongst providers. There were similar percentages of nurses concerned about the over- and under- medication of patients. Pain is only one of many areas where the use of Nursing Case Management would be very appropriate and beneficial. Warrior Transition Unit (WTU) case managers have demonstrated their value in locations with integrated pain management teams. The Task Force recommendation to adapt a disease management approach to pain care will require a corresponding assessment of the impact on nursing education, staffing, and utilization. As with other advanced-practice nursing specialties, the scope of practice may be broadened to provide a wider approach to optimal care and outcomes in pain management, with increasing levels of education, certification, and licensure. The MHS executes its health care mission with a combination of military and civilian nursing professionals, and they are present in virtually every patient care setting. A revision for the utilization of advanced-practice pain nurses, Clinical Nurse Specialists, Nurse Practitioners and in some cases, Certified Registered Nurse Anesthetists needs to be part of the DoD pain management strategy. The TF members concurred with the need to refer this issue to the Senior Nursing Executives in DoD and VHA for comments and recommendations on the expanded and redefined roles and utilization of nurses in pain management across the health care continuum. Additionally, these recommendations should be referred to the DoD multidisciplinary advisory board for evaluation and integration into the DoD pain management strategy. Pain is the most frequently used nursing diagnosis in all delivery of care modelsFINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS PAIN MANAGEMENT TASK FORCE 18 Public Recommendation 4.1.4.1 Request that the Federal Nurse Advisory Board evaluate the impact of certified pain nurses on patient outcomes and satisfaction. Recommendation 4.1.4.2 Request that the DoD and VHA Nurse Executives evaluate the role of certified pain nurses in patient care delivery (military and civilian). Recommendation 4.1.4.3 Determine the future role and potential use of certified pain nurses across the care continuum. Recommendation 4.1.4.4 Build the population of certified pain advanced-practice nurses (graduate education, board certification, short courses, and career field designation) to maximize the value and utilization of their critical skill sets. Recommendation 4.1.4.5 Integrate approved TF recommendations into Core Nursing Competencies, Clinical Transition Program (CTP), and other Nursing training programs. Recommendation 4.1.4.6 Utilize the DoD multidisciplinary pain management advisory board to evaluate and integrate recommendations from the Federal Nurse Advisory Board into the DoD pain management strategy. 4.1.5 Standardized Credentialing Objective: Establish a process to standardize a Military Health System credentialing process for pain medicine. The Task Force found that minimum training, certification, and skill requirements for providers delivering procedural pain care were not consistent between MTFs or across health care professions. Examples of procedural pain care include, but are not limited to, fluoroscopically-guided epidural steroid injections, fluoroscopically-guided invasive treatments of spinal arthritis, spinal manipulation, and acupuncture. The expansion of treatment modalities, to include integrative medicine approaches to pain management, necessitate an MHS-wide process for standardizing the credentialing for these modalities. Establishing MHS-wide credentialing guidance for these treatment modalities and providers would provide a uniform standard of quality across the MHS and eliminate the burden on local commands to develop these credentialing standards. A credentialing document that features a three-tiered certification scheme is currently used in credentialing some physicians to match training and skill levels to the complexity and risk of approved procedures. This document or a system with similar detail should be used for all professionals offering procedural pain care, including physicians not currently credentialed under the tiered document. Training and skill of providers should be confirmed or measured. Examples of measurement would include documented completion of an approved fellowship, Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) board certification, or experience and skill as confirmed by observation of a provider credentialed at that level or higher. Standards regarding minimum training, certification, skill requirements, and scope of practice for providers delivering procedural pain care should be consistent across the MHS and developed with assistance from both the physician and non-physician Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) for these areas, usually the Consultants to the Uniformed Service Surgeons General. FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS PAIN MANAGEMENT TASK FORCE 19 Public Support for the TF recommendations regarding expanded availability of multimodal and interdisciplinary pain care will require additional credentialing by MHS facilities. Standards need to be developed in order to ensure the growing number of acupuncturists, massage therapists, and other integrativ e medicine practitioners are safe, effective, and qualified to practice in hospitals and clinics. It is impractical to place the burden on individual commands to develop credentialing criteria for this expanding number of integrative medicine practition ers and procedures. The MHS needs to develop standards for credentialing integrative medicine provide rs and procedur es for use at local MTFs. This standardization would support the recommendations to decrease vari ation between MTFs and Services. Recommendation 4.1.5.1 Use specialty consultants to determine procedures to standardize MHS pain credentialing. Recommendation 4.1.5.2 Standardize minimum training, certification, skill requirements, and scope of practice requirements for providers delivering procedural pain care across MHS. Develop requirements with assistance from both physician and non- physician subject matter experts. Recommendation 4.1.5.3 Consolidate specialty consultant recommendations into standard credentialing documents and approve DoD-wide. 4.1.6 Productivity Measures Objective: Reexamine the use of productivity measures (Relative Value Units) in evaluating primary care. A common contention among clinicians in the MHS is the perceived \"disconnect\" between what they are asked to do and how they are assessed on performance. Clinicians feel process-oriented measures of their \"productivity\" are not compatible with the highest quality of patient care espoused by leadership. In fact, the resource-based Relative Value Unit (RVU) is a reimbursement tool that does not consider outcomes. Clinicians are convinced that this process-based approach to productivity measurement is a barrier to the integrated, multimodal, interdisciplinary models that will yield the best outcomes in complex chronic diseases, such as chronic pain. The barrier to quality presented by RVU-based productivity metrics is most visible in the primary care setting. RVU metrics reward high throughput of acute minor illnesses but punish the holistic approach needed to sort out the complex and nuanced needs of chronic disease patients, particularly chronic pain patients with biopsychosocial complexity, including comorbidities. The critical outcomes of quality chronic pain management - return to work; improved quality of life; satisfaction with care; decreased Emergency Room visits; decreased unscheduled admissions; decreased medication misuse, abuse, and diversion; decreased adverse domestic issues - play no role in assessing the quality and effectiveness of the MHS primary care practice. Moreover, an integrated team approach to chronic disease management in primary care that includes appropriately trained nurse case managers, behavioral health providers, and clinical pharmacologists generally fails to generate the RVUs necessary to justify their use of resources. For example, a group of clinicians acting as part of an integrated care team to evaluate a patient's treatment plan can only claim workload credit for one of the team members. This is a huge disincentive to providing integrated patient care. A common contention among clinicians in the MHS is the perceived \"disconnect\" between what they are asked to do and how they are assessed on performanceFINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS PAIN MANAGEMENT TASK FORCE 20 Public Another area of RVU 'disconnect' is in pain medicine specialty practice. Selective integrated biopsyschosocial rehabilitation, which has a comparatively strong evidence basis in terms of outcomes effectiveness amongst all treatments for chronic pain, is given little value, where as interventional procedures are accorded very high RVUs. Thus, pain medicine specialists and institutions are incentivized (consciously or unconsciously) to perform procedures while indirectly discouraged from using other effective clinical modalities. This will likely not change unless a greater emphasis is placed on outcomes. One approach to fixing this issue is to de-emphasize the role of RVUs in favor of adopting outcomes-based metrics in assessing a clinical practice. Forward thinking commands within the MHS have already suspended the use of the RVU metric of productivity while transitioning to a patient-centered medical home model of delivering health care. Evidence-based models can be used to resource primary care practices and drive delivery of safe, integrated coordinated care to yield the best patient-oriented clinical outcomes. The TF believes a patient-centric, outcome-based measure of productivity can decrease resource utilization and improve patient and provider satisfaction. Recommendation 4.1.6.1 Establish patient-centric clinical outcome measures of productivity. Recommendation 4.1.6.2 Modify the Relative Value Units metric to include a patient-centric outcome standard. 4.1.7 DoD and VHA Pain Care Standardization Objective: Develop a patient-centric approach to recovery, rehabilitation, satisfaction, and pain control, with greater attention to opioid control and minimizing abuse. Enhancing standardization of pain care between the DoD a nd VHA has the potential to re volutionize the way patients perceive and receive their health care . Pain permeates every discipline of medi cal care and is a complaint of many patients. There is currently a lack of coordin ation between DoD and VHA pain se rvices at both the inpatient and outpatient levels of care. Better institutional patient coordination ma y lead to decreased medication use (particularly opioids) and transition to an effective pain treatment plan. The majority (>52%) of Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) and Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) Service Members report experiencing a myriad of pain symptoms as they move between the DoD and VHA or retire into the VHA system for care (Office of Public Health and Environmental Hazards, 2010) Presently there is no mechanism to communicate patient pain issues throughout the care continuum. An electronic pain record of care is essential to prov ide DoD and VHA providers with a common communication tool that would assist physicians in the care of patients during the transition from the DoD system into the VHA health care system. One possible solution in development is the Joint Regional Anesthesia and Analgesia Tracking System (JRAATS - see section 4.1.15). The JRAATS electro nic pain record would pr ovide DoD and VHA clinici ans with a detailed pain management history of the patient while that patient was under the Federal health care system. This database would also provide a powerful tool to evaluate treatment trends and outcome measures. One example of the existing disconnect involves DoD patients who have had to discontinue an effective regimen of acute regional anesthesia to maintain pain control prior to air evacuat ion to a VHA site. In stead of continuing the proven and effective treatment me thod, patients are often forced to rely on \"as needed\" IV morphine or short-acting oral opioids for the flight. It is difficult to gauge the onset of pa in and the need for these med ications during transfer. FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS PAIN MANAGEMENT TASK FORCE 21 Public Most patients end up taking high er doses of opioids than they need, when greater benefit would have been derived from continuing their peri pheral pain catheters of local anesthetic. Similarly, patients transitioning from one inpatient facility to another may be forced to change their oral medications because the new facility does not have the same medic ations available on formulary. This may cause an unnecessary wait time, resulting in an undue spike in pain. Then the patient must adapt to a different pain medication, resulting in pain, po tential complicati ons, and new side effects throughout the transition. Finally, individuals transitioning from the outpatient DoD facility to the outpatient VHA upon retirement may have to wait for an examination prior to obtaining refills at the VHA. Once again, justification for a medication that is not on the VHA formulary may be required and the patient may experi ence unnecessary wait times, resulting in undue pain. Differences in DoD and VHA formularies and pain management capab ilities make the transition of these patients especially difficult from a pain perspective. Better discharge planning and care coordina tion would optimize the adjustment of pain medication regimens and outpatient recovery. An individu al who has been medically retired from DoD may face special challenges, including inconsiste ncies in follow-ups, pain care coordination, management, transition, and prescrip tion renewals. Standardizing pain care between the DoD and VHA will require project management along with policy and process decisions coordinated through a central pain management advisory board, and must address: /g120Coordinated discharge pain care planning for those patients with documented pain management issues, those with polypharmacy combinatio ns requiring pharmacist consultatio n, and those identified as \"at risk.\" This is necessary for inpatient-to-inpatient transfers, inpatient-to-outpatient discharges, and outpatient-to- outpatient transfers. This will require case managers and better provider-to-provi der communication. /g120Establishing DoD and VHA joint form ularies to maintain effective treatment pl ans during transitions to a new facility. /g120Ensuring availability of successful therapies (physical therapy, occupational therapy, behavioral health, medication, regional an esthesia) at the new facility. /g120Developing acute pain service ca pabilities at the Poly trauma VHA sites. This ensures that patients with effective regional pain control are able to air evacuate with their pain under control, enabling earlier transfers with significantly less patient anxiety. /g120Establishing a pain medications transition policy for individuals on pain me dications transit ioning from Active Duty to Retired. By implementing a standardi zed line of pain care for the DoD and VH A, patient rehabilit ation, recovery, satisfaction, and pain control will likely be enhanced. Improved care standardization will lead to bett er opioid control and will minimize abuse. Improved care standardization will also lead to higher provider satisfaction. Pilot projects should be established at DoD and VA facilities that share a high flow of Active Duty and Retirees, such as Tampa or Richmond and Walter Reed Army Medical Center (WRAMC), or Palo Alto and Balboa. An outstanding example of policy changing to meet Warrior needs has already been developed. As a result of inadequate pain control during transfers, patients transitioning from i npatient DoD sites on the east coast to the Palo Alto VA Medical Center on the west coast now air evacua te through Travis Air Force Ba se. Based on patient and Family complaints about poor pain contr ol throughout the transfer, and the diffic ulty regaining pain control upon arrival to the VHA, the patients are now requ ired to spend the night at Travis AFB to re gain and maintain pain control. These transfers are now coordinated via vi deo teleconferences, pho ne calls, and emails. Since the change in policy, there have not been any serious complaints about pain care or management during transfer. FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS PAIN MANAGEMENT TASK FORCE 22 Public Recommendation 4.1.7.1 Establish a uniform DoD and VHA formulary. Recommendation 4.1.7.2 Integrate specific pain management \"at risk\" criteria into existing discharge planning coordination for transitioning patients. Recommendation 4.1.7.3 Establish similar pain care capabilities at DoD and VHA sites of similar size. Recommendation 4.1.7.4 Conduct pain management pilots to measure improvements in transfers. 4.1.8 DoD and VHA Joint Formulary Objective: Establish a joint formulary to facilitate smoother transitions and minimize pain throughout the continuum of care. One specific area of standardization between the DoD and VHA is the formulary. About 90-95% of pain medications are formulary to both the military and VHA. Pain management issues arise with restricted drugs and those with criteria for approval. When pain regimens are properly titrated to the patient's satisfaction, the outcome is optimal. Sub-optimal care occurs when the regimens are changed and providers and systems do not communicate and coordinate, resulting in increased pain, dissatisfaction, poor continuity of care, increased opportunity for drug diversion, misuse or abuse, increased patient safety risk, and excessive costs. Both the VHA and the DoD have formulary decision-making committees. They operate independently of each other and sometimes drugs approved for DoD will not be found on the VHA formulary for continued therapy. Both decision-making committees may have drugs in non-formulary status with criteria that must be approved prior to a patient receiving the drug. The problem has been that the criteria for approval was different in each system, which resulted in a Service Member who was already approved for the drug in the DoD system having a delay in continuing the drug in the VHA system because a subsequent approval in the VHA system was required. Formulary findings identified during site visits: /g120Service Members incurred at least a 2-3 month wait time between leaving the military and their first appointment within the VA medical system. As a result, Service Members and Veterans may run out of their maintenance pain medications. Military MTFs do not have consistent medication discharge planning practices nor do they communicate with VHA liaisons to create care transition plans. /g120Service Members stabilized on pain medications within the military MTFs sometimes have their pain regimen changed due to formulary inconsistencies between the VHA and the military. The VHA has criteria for use of medications such as sustained-action oxycodone, gabapentin, pregabalin, duloxetine through the \"medical necessity\" or \"prior authorization\" approval requirement within the MTF system and are transferred to the VHA system are required to re-submit paperwork for the approval of the same drug or drugs (e.g., duloxetine and pregabalin). /g120Service Members admitted to the VA Polytrauma Centers are discharged on pain medications that are non- formulary under the Uniform Formulary system. A Medical Necessity Form requesting continuation of the medication can be submitted to the MHS, but there are inconsistencies among MTFs. Service Members have had their pain regimen changed to conform to the formulary agent(s) available, medical necessity aside. FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS PAIN MANAGEMENT TASK FORCE 23 Public /g120Service Members have been transferred from military MTFs to VA medical centers on epidurals, PCAs or pain balls and have been unable to continue their pain regimen because of a lack of medications, staff education on the devices, and equipment. /g120The lack of uniformity in pain practice exists throughout the DoD health care system and into the VHA. Pain plans established at one facility are often changed for no other reason than lack of familiarity with the pain medication or technology used at the transfer facility, resulting in unnecessary patient discomfort. This issue is exacerbated by the lack of a clear understanding of who is responsible for managing pain at each node of care. For example, it is very common for continuous peripheral nerve block catheters to be removed during evacuation because providers at the next treatment node are either unfamiliar with the technology or do not have personnel responsible for pain management. There are several groups coordinating on DoD and VHA joint formulary issues: /g120Pain Management Task /g120DoD Pharmacy & Therapeutics Committee /g120Defense and Veterans Pain Management Institute (DVPMI) /g120Healthcare Executive Committee (HEC) Pharmacy Workgroup /g120VHA and DoD Chronic Opioid Therapy Clinical Practice Guidelines Panel /g120VA Pharmacy Benefits Management (PBM) /g120VA Medical Advisory Panel (VA MAP) /g120VA National Formulary (VANF) The TRICARE system allows Service Members with prior authorization or medical necessity approval to continue their pharmacy care wherever they go, in any of the three points of service - MTF, retail or mail order - enabling continuity of care. When patients transfer to the VA system, VA policy that stable pain regimens for military members should not be changed unless medically necessary. Recommendation 4.1.8.1 Standardize pharmacy benefits between DoD and VHA, and make them reciprocal, without delay or challenge. Recommendation 4.1.8.2 Evaluate the safety and effectiveness of prescriptions renewals process for Service Members transitioning to VHA care. Recommendation 4.1.8.3 Establish a common DoD and VHA policy to support state of the art and science practices, such as the use of non-narcotic pain balls, PCA pumps, and epidurals, with associated common education content.

There is a lack of data within the United States health care system concerning the appropriateness and effectiveness of many pain management pro cedures and techniques. Additionally, the exceedingly comp lex nature of the pain disease process requires pain medici ne providers to delve into all the biopsychoso cial aspects of a patient's pain issues. This can be remarkably difficult in the limited ti me allotted for provider a nd patient interaction that is characteristic of modern medicine. The lack of a DoD and VHA pain data screening and outco mes repository causes difficulty in making responsible decisions on the myriad of possible treatm ent modalities. This lack of pain data makes counseling patients on pain procedure efficacy a challenge. It also presents barriers to greater patient involvement in decisions about care, makes longitudinal comparison of chan ges in pain difficult, and may limit av ailability of option al pain management techniques and medications. This situation inhibits DoD and VHA pain speciali sts from providing outcomes- and evidence-based clinical pain med icine solutions to Warriors and Famili es. At its core, the lack of a shared interagency pain data repository impacts patient safety and pain care quality, and contri butes to variability throughout the care continuum. The Task Force has determined that the DoD and VHA health care systems require a Pain Assessment Screening Tool and Outcomes Registry (PASTOR) clinical information and data system. This information technology solution will gather information from patients an d provide summaries for providers, leaders, and researchers to use for decision support. This information will be vital in minimizing cli nical variation in pain care delivery among providers and medical treatment facilities. The University of Washington (UW) health care system has developed a computer-based patient pain information and diagnostic system called \"My Pain Profile\" (MPP). The UW computer system guides pain patients through a series of questions concerning patient demogr aphics, pain characteristics, medic ation use, substance abuse, and other pain variables. Information is provided by the pat ient prior to the clinical visit and is summarized for the FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS PAIN MANAGEMENT TASK FORCE 25 Public provider in a computerized form. Efficient for both patient and provider, the system generates information that can assist the provider in enhancing care by providing indica tors of real or potential pain-related health problems. Traditionally, this level of pati ent information could only be obtained after a long series of clinical visits using inefficient paper-based surveys. MPP ha s also provided UW a unique too l for outcomes assessment, research, and program self-assessment. The UW solution will be one system th at guides the developm ent of the DoD and VHA PASTOR system. PASTOR will incorporate military-specific demographic and diagnostic information to enhance the value of the information for Warrior and Beneficiary pain issues. The PASTOR system will also integrate with other Task Force recommendations, such as the DoD and VHA Pain Assessment Tool, Pain Centers of Excellence, and the establishment of a central pain management advisory board. Additional resource requirements: /g120A computer-based system that facilitates self-reported patient data entry from both the clinic and the patient's home using the Internet. /g120Full integration with the Medical Home concept of care. /g120Full-time IT personnel and equipment support. /g120Full integration with existing and future DoD and VHA medical information systems (within a year, or an interim standalone system will be adopted). /g120A central pain management advisory board to defin e and develop PASTOR conte nt and maintain data repository. /g120Large educational component for use by primary care providers and pa in specialists thro ughout the DoD and VHA health care systems. The DoD and VHA PASTOR will serve as the primary source a nd an international model for outcomes-driven pain research and resource allocation decision support. PASTOR will collect and provide the necessary data for determining best pain practices, determining DoD and VHA pa in care standards, and enh ancing patient pain care. The opportunities for population-based research on pain treatments an d safety-related issues are enormous and hold great potential for improving pain medicine. Recommendation 4.1.9.1 Jointly fund the development of a Pain Assessment Screening Tool and Outcome Registry under the direction of a central pain management advisory board. Recommendation 4.1.9.2 Integrate and mandate a Pain Assessment Screening Tool and Outcome Registry with DoD and VHA IT systems. Recommendation 4.1.9.3 Implement and mandate a Pain Assessment Screening Tool and Outcome Registry across DoD and VHA. FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS PAIN MANAGEMENT TASK FORCE 26 Public 4.1.10 Battlefield Pain Care Continuum Objective: Incorporate scientific advances in battlefield surgery and medical technology to improve the delivery of pain care across the continuum. The TF did not conduct any interviews or site visits in Iraq or Afghanistan. The fo llowing findings and recommendations were developed with assistance from TF members with recent deployment experience, as well as from interviews with returning providers and cl inicians from the current theater of operation. While battlefield medicine has experienc ed significant advances and outcome improvements over the last 20 years, these have not always been accompanied by equivalent advances in battlefield pa in management. The variation in practice and capabilities that is evi dent in the care provided in MTFs is mirrored, to some extent, on the battlefi eld. Many Warriors do not receive the most advanced pain care due to a lack of equipment and inadequate provider training in pain management. There is no \"Theater Pa in Management Practice Guid eline,\" resulting in an overreliance on opioid-based pain solutions, from point of injury throughout the care continuum. This emphasis on opioid pain therapy at all levels has likely factored into the improper use of these medicati ons among Wounded Warriors. Military medicine prides itself on investing in the prev ention and treatment of many combat injuries, as well as disease and non-battle injury condi tions. The recent increase in the number of behavioral health providers deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan wa s planned after an assessment by senior leadership indicated that behavioral health issues on the battlefield were better handled by specialty providers further forward. Similarly, pain should be recognized as a disease process that, if poorly managed, adversely impacts every as pect of a Warrior's recovery and rehabilitation. Successful pain manage ment on the battlefield demands a pain medicine champ ion far forward.

Recommendation 4.1.10.1 Adopt the Joint Theater Trauma System Clinical Practice Guideline as policy for pain management. Recommendation 4.1.10.2 Establish acute pain medicine services across the continuum of care, consisting of pain-trained providers who are responsible for pain consultation and management within the MTF. Recommendation 4.1.10.3 Establish a DoD central pain management advisory board as the battlefield pain management proponent and consultant organization. 4.1.11 Tele Pain Objective: Expand telemedicine capabilities to incorporate pain management initiatives. Advanced pain management expertise is often limited on the battlefield and in remote MTFs. Patients being treated for chronic pain conditions often travel l ong distances to be seen, at a considera ble expense. Many pain follow-up visits do not necessarily require the physician and the patient to be in the same physical space to check on treatment plan progress, answer patient qu estions or concerns, and plan for futur e physician-patient interactions. Telecommunication technology is avai lable and would enhance patient and health care provider access to pain consultation regardless of geogr aphic location. Pain consults can be performe d by pain management experts using video conferencing technology. With the establishment of Tele Pain clinics as part of Regional Pain Centers of Excellence (RPCoE - see section 4.4.4), distant sites within the TRICARE reg ion would have routine access to specialty pain consultation. Primary care physicians could conduct initial consultations without having to send the patient to the RPCoE, enhancing communication betw een primary care and pain specialists, increas ing efficiency, and po tentially reducing the number of unnecessary or improper patient specia lty visits. From a personnel perspective, Active Duty pain patients using this service will be absent from their missi on for shorter periods of time and travel costs should be less for the command. Several VA hospitals have ongoing telemedicine initiatives to assist with the management of patients with chronic diseases. The VHA has been able to us e technology to improve the remote ma nagement of patients with diabetes, hypertension, congestive heart failure, or chronic ob structive lung disease. The VA Medical Center (VAMC) in Salisbury, North Carolina uses telemonitors to monitor pati ent blood pressures and o xygen levels. Patients are also able to communicate how they are feeling or if they are ha ving problems with medication via an electronic device. Without the patient having to come int o the hospital, Primary care and spec ialty providers are often able to adjust patient appointments, alter treatments, and communicate with the patients. This technology has great potential for the management of chronic pain or complex acute pain. FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS PAIN MANAGEMENT TASK FORCE 28 Public Additional resources would be required: /g120Establish RPCoEs within each TRICARE region and Pa in Departments at medical centers throughout the DoD. /g120Create Tele Pain sites within the RPCoE and participating MTFs. /g120Resolve issues from Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). /g120Leadership commitment to develop new policies governing primary care support and productivity metrics /g120Reallocate personnel and resources. /g120Commit information technology support and ex pand DoD Internet bandwidth infrastructure. /g120Leverage existing DoD and VHA tel emedicine infrastructure to include pain management programs. This approach will likely improve pain consultant access, reduce physical pa tient clinic visi ts, reduce health care costs, and improve patient satisfaction. Recommendation 4.1.11.1 Establish Tele Pain sites at Regional Pain Centers of Excellence and MTFs throughout DoD and VHA. Recommendation 4.1.11.2 Develop an enterprise strategic communications plan on the availability and benefits of telemedicine. Recommendation 4.1.11.3 Develop metrics to evaluate the effectiveness and costs of providing enhanced telemedicine for pain medicine. Recommendation 4.1.11.4 Develop new telemedicine technology applications for pain management uses. 4.1.12 Joint Theater Trauma Registry Objective: Add a Joint Theater Trauma Registry module to capture, define, and characterize Wounded Warrior pain issues throughout the care continuum, from the battlefield to MTFs. The Joint Theater Trauma Registry (JTTR) is the primary military combat casualty care data collection repository. Currently, the registry does not collect any information on ca sualty pain. After eight years of conflict, this has been a tremendous missed oppo rtunity to define and characte rize Wounded issues throu ghout the care continuum. Theater-specific and longitudinal information would im prove the understanding of the pain care needs of Wounded Warriors. It would enable the measurement of treatment e ffectiveness across facilities and settings, the development of pain care policy, and the identification of pain care resour ce gaps, as well as offer the opportunity to establish pain research priorities. The new DoD and VHA Pain Assessment To ol will provide a unique way of defining a patient's pain in terms of function. Combined with the four supp lemental questions on activity, mood, stress, and sleep, the Pain Assessment Tool will provide a powerful research and outcomes me asurement tool when incorporated into the JTTR system. Additional resource requirements: /g120Inclusion of the 11-point DoD an d VHA Pain Assessment Tool into the JTTR database. /g120A central pain management advisory board to be res ponsible for routine analys is and trend modeling. FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS PAIN MANAGEMENT TASK FORCE 29 Public This database will serve as the source for objective, populat ion-based information on pa in management outcomes and will guide pain management decision making and resource al location for the battlefield and evacuation chain. The database will be important in evaluating the succe ss of new pain medications, Task Force recommendations, and technologies deployed far forward. Recommendation 4.1.12.1 Establish the Standardized Pain Assessment Tool as an integral part of the Joint Theater Trauma Registry database. Recommendation 4.1.12.2 Maintain routine analysis, management, and reporting of pain data through a central pain management advisory board. 4.1.13 Electronic Pain Order Set Objective: Develop an electronic pain order set to assist health care providers in selecting evidence-based, individually tailored pain management plans. The majority of patient pain issues are handled by prima ry care providers. As discussed earlier, there is wide variability in health care provi der pain management training based on the health care provider's specialty and experience, leading to variability in pain management. Because pain is no t a main focus for the primary physician writing the orders, medications are often based on the phys ician's residency experie nce and not on the latest evidenced-based pain recommendations. The DoD and VHA need to establish guidelines to assist health care providers in delivering a more consistent approach to pain management for their patients. The guide lines should be integrated into the DoD and VHA medical information systems. Su ch guidelines are not intended to prevent or replace physician judgment in developing patient pain orders, but rather to influe nce provider practice patterns with DoD- and VHA-wide guidance based on best current evidence on pain management. Additional resource requirements: /g120Development and inclusion of pain order sets in all DoD a nd VHA medical information systems (AHLTA, Essentris and VISTA). /g120A central pain management advisory board to be respons ible for development and maintenance of all pain order sets and policies. /g120Annual review of pain guidelines. Upon completion of the pain order set, the physician or prescriber will have creat ed an effective plan for each patient that is consistent with the best DoD and VHA evidence-base d data for pain treatment. While these recommendations do not preclude a provider from exercising his or her own cl inical judgment, they do ensure that all prescribers of pain medications at least consider DoD and VHA recommendations for best pain prescribing. It is like ly that this policy will result in a de-emphasis on opioids in pain management plans. Electronic pa in order sets will also prompt primary care physicians when specialty pain ma nagement consultation is needed. Add itionally, commande rs should be able to monitor providers who consiste ntly practicing outside of the re commended guidelines. An example of pain medication orders developed for the WRAMC Essentris system is provided in Appendix B-4. Variations of this theme could be develop ed through a central pain manage ment advisory board for all levels of MTFs within the DoD and VHA systems. FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS PAIN MANAGEMENT TASK FORCE 30 Public Recommendation 4.1.13.1 Establish DoD and VHA electronic pain order sets in all electronic medical records. Recommendation 4.1.13.2 Conduct an annual review and update electronic pain guidelines. 4.1.14 Standardized Medical Equipment and Personnel in the Deployed Setting Objective: Standardize medical equipment, personnel support, and training across the continuum of pain care. There is no current standard equipment or personnel requ irement for pain managemen t throughout the continuum of care. Wounded Warriors are often not given advanced pain management technologies far forward due to unavailability of advanced pain management med ications and equipm ent. Battlefield pain co ntrol is euphemistically discounted as a non-issue because pa in management is considered to be everyone's responsi bility. In actuality, responsibility for pain mana gement is highly uncertain. This issue is presently most conspicuous at OIF and OEF Level III facilities. Level III equipment lists do not include standard supplies needed for routine pain management pr ocedures. Personnel are often willing and available to manage trauma pain but are ill equipped to do so unless the medical officer brings his or her own supply. Wounded Warrior care depends on who is present and what suppli es are available at the Combat Support Hospital (CSH). Therefore, MEDCOM must deploy a uniform set of advanced pa in management medications and equipment. A proposed CSH pain medication set is included in Appendix B-5. Beyond having the appropriate supp lies and equipment, successful pain management on the battlefield requires dedicated personnel assigned to the unit pain mission. A Level III facility, for example, would have a medical officer assigned the duty of pain consulta tion and management within the facility. This officer, usually an anesthesiologist, would coordinate pain ma nagement plans with assigned pain nurse representatives from each CSH ward. The number of personnel required for acute pain services will be dictated by the size an d scope of a facility's health care mission. The establishment of an acute pain service at every Level III facility and also throughout the care continuum will greatly enhance Warrior pain care. Pilot programs in Iraq and Afghanistan have demonstrated the success of Level III acute pain services. Additional resources requirements: /g120Development of acute pain services and inclusion of pain equipment sets in all Level III facilities. /g120Adoption of the tier system of pain care throughout the care continuum that defines medical officer responsibilities, resource requirem ents, and equipment for pain management at all levels of care. /g120Extensive education and training effort and policy gene ration at all levels of care. Warrior and Beneficiary care will be positi vely influenced throughout the care co ntinuum. A standa rdized equipment set is required to deliver uniform pain ma nagement throughout th e care continuum. FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS PAIN MANAGEMENT TASK FORCE 31 Public Recommendation 4.1.14.1 Establish comprehensive acute pain services in the deployed setting. Recommendation 4.1.14.2 Standardize equipment sets for the deployed setting. Recommendation 4.1.14.3 Establish requirements and authorizations for pain management specialists across DoD to identify and implement best practices from the VHA. Recommendation 4.1.14.4 Develop training program modules to support pain management in the deployed setting. 4.1.15 Joint Regional Anesthesia and Analgesia Tracking System Objective: Leverage advances in regional anesthesia techniques by integrating the data through an existing, sanctioned joint tracking data system. During the course of OEF and OIF, many Se rvice Members have been severely wound ed and their pa in care has been a challenge. The military an esthesiology community develop ed regional anesthesia techniques and other advanced pain care technologies that have revolutionized pain management. Advanced pain care technologies, such as continuous peripheral nerve blocks, epidurals, patient-controlled analgesia, and ketamine infusions require close management at all times, whether the patient is in a hospital bed or in the evacuation system. Leadership quickly recognized that an electronic system for following patients and transmitting vital pain information to their accepting physicians was needed if these important techn iques were to be used safely throughout the care continuum. In response to this need, Army anesthesia specialists working through the DVPMI de veloped a Regi onal Anesthesia Tracking System (RATS) to monitor patients using advanced pain tech nologies as they traveled through the military health care system. RATS is a stand-alone information sy stem that allows medical pr oviders to document pain management notes on a central serve r and notify receiving providers about patients in transit with regional anesthesia. It does not connect to or share data with any of the MHS electroni c health record system s, such as the Theater Medical Data Store (TMDS) or AHLTA. The military medical community has recognized the importance of the data collected in RATS and has requested that RATS fu nctionality be incorporated into a MHS electronic health record system. The Joint Regional Anesthesia and An algesia Tracking System (JRAATS) is under development to meet this medical information requirement. Once integrated into the TMDS, this system will give pain medicine providers at all Levels of care a key communication tool for the safe and effective implementation of advanced pain care throughout the care continuum. The JRAATS Concept of Operations (CONOPS) document is provided in Appendix B-6. Additional resource with JRAATS. JRAATS information system throughout the care continuum. /g120Extensive education, training effort, and po licy generation at all Levels of care. FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS PAIN MANAGEMENT TASK FORCE 32 Public This approach will maintain the advantages of RATS and focu s on the three most important and basic sets of pain notes: procedure, clinical, and transfer. The integration of the JRAATS into the DoD sanctioned TMDS will improve the safety and pain care of Wounded Warriors. This appr oach will enhance opio id management across the pain care continuum to include the VHA system, and provide a tremendous data source for pain outcomes research. Recommendation 4.1.15.1 Complete the Joint Regional Anesthesia and Analgesia Tracking System. Recommendation 4.1.15.2 Implement the Joint Regional Anesthesia and Analgesia Tracking System. Recommendation 4.1.15.3 Assign program, data, and content responsibility for the Joint Regional Anesthesia and Analgesia Tracking System to a central pain management advisory board. 4.1.16 Standardize Identification of Subs tance Abuse Patients Objective: Identify substance abuse patients in Warrior Transition Units by embedding the necessary resources to develop and implement a coordinated care and monitoring plan. Substance abuse disorders are not uncommon in soci ety or the military. According to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMSHA), an estimated 20.1 million Americans aged 12 or older were illicit drug users in 2008 (SAMSHA National Survey on Drug Use and Health Report, 2008). The National Institute of Drug Abuse 2008 study, \"Monitoring the Future, \" found that 9.7% of 12th graders in the U.S. abused Vicodin in the past year and 4.7% abused Oxycontin. Drug abuse in the military has paralleled the civilian sector. The 2005 Pentagon Health Survey found that 15% of Service Members admitted to prescription drug abuse in the previous year, with 4% in the past month. The 2008 survey reported 22% admitting use in the previous year and 13% in the previous month. Prescription drug abuse is increasing. The risk of opio id abuse and dependence increases for those who are receiving controlled substanc es for the treatment of chronic pain. Opio id dependence in chronic pain patients is often associated with poor outcomes, in cluding occupational difficulties, disciplinary problems, social problems, disability, and death. OIF and OEF have placed tremendous strains on militar y personnel and their Families. The number of prescriptions written for pain medicatio ns has increased and the correlation between suicid e and prescription pain medication abuse is of deep concern to DoD. As such, a two-day meeting with the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) and VA was held in January 2009. The meeting focused on addressing substance abuse and associated mental health problems in mili tary personnel, Veterans and their Families. More than 20 years of research has identified many of the biological variabl es and social circumstances that foster or protect against drug abuse and addiction. NIDA is actively su pporting research that strives to help people, across the lifespan, develop an d apply the skills and resources they need to stop problem behaviors before and after they begin. The issue is two-fold for military medicine. While there is an increased ri sk of addiction in pain patients who are receiving controlled substances for th e management of pain (or not receiv ing controlled drugs and instead self- treating with illicit drugs), there is no routine or standardized screening for those at risk, nor is there a system to FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS PAIN MANAGEMENT TASK FORCE 33 Public share this information, when known, th roughout the health care continuum. In other word s, there is no reliable means of connecting the dots. Many barriers make it difficult or imp ossible to share information among health care providers: /g120Systems do not communicate. /g120Within the military, there are intra- and inter-Service restrictions on the releas e of certain information. /g120Under a new test program in select locations, sol diers can, without the comma nder's knowledge, self- refer to Army Substance Abuse Program (ASAP). /g120Some Soldiers seek treatment outside of the military establishment and some deliberately seek to not disclose this information, making it difficult for he alth care providers to be fully informed. For these reasons, screening is critical, as it represents a fail-safe way to identify those with, or at risk for, substance abuse disorders and initiate early in tervention efforts. Currently, the Drug and Alcohol Management Information System (DAMIS) tracks those enrolled in ASAP, but the system is closed to military medical providers. It is estimated that 45% of patients who are present for care are affected by substance abuse disorders that are ro utinely unrecognized by health care providers (Military Health System, 2009). It is imperative th at addiction risk be assessed as early as possible, preferably at the very first encounter with the health care system, irrespective of whet her controlled substance s are being considered or not. This is the proverbial \"golden time\" for substance abuse preventio n and/or detection. Undoubtedly, the best approach to reducing substance abuse is prevention. Early and effective screening for substance abuse patients would sav e untold direct and indirect costs an d suffering. It is a proven fact that research-based drug abuse prevention programs are co st-effective. Each dollar invested in prevention achieves a savings of up to $7 in areas such as substance abuse treatment and criminal justice system costs (NIDA, 2007), not to mention their wider impact on the trajectory of young lives and their Families. Each year, drug abuse and addiction cost taxpayers nearly $534 billion in preventable health care, law enforcement, crime, and other costs (NIDA, 2007). Early detection and intervention would reduce soci etal costs and prevent the adverse personal consequences of substance abuse. WTU patients often have complex pain issues that require pa in specialty consultation and close pharmacologic monitoring. Many have co-existing disorders, such as PTSD, TBI, depression, insomni a, and substance abuse. Obtaining an appropriate history a nd understanding the impact of these co-existing disorders is necessary to formulating an appropriate treatment plan. Evaluating these patients in clos e collaboration wit h the primary care physician allows for a coordinated care plan that can redu ce the length of time a patient is held in the WTU, reduce the risks inherent in fragmented care, and facilitate the early detection of aberrant pain behavior in this high risk population. The Task Force recommends that a tri-service and VH A working group, representing subject matter experts from primary care, behavioral health, and pain management, make a recommendation for a standardized substance abuse screening tool. The tool would monitor the de velopment of problems for individuals and identify those individuals who are either with, or at risk for, substance abuse. This tool should allow for initial intake evaluation and periodic follow-up rescr eening in both a paper form (that can be quickly implemented) and Web-based. This tool, when added to pain assessment and outcom e registry tool, would give providers a comprehensive view of the individual, incl uding their proclivities. Knowing this information from th e outset would enhance care and management. After analysis, the wo rking group would make a recommend ation that would then go to the VHA and the Service Surgeons General for final review. The best approach to reducing substance abuse is preventionFINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS PAIN MANAGEMENT TASK FORCE 34 Public A standardized screening tool for substance abuse along wi th a standardized informed consent that explains risks, benefits, and alternatives to chronic opioid therapy for the treatment of chronic pain co nditions are necessary. Poor access to pain subspecialty care and lack of a widely accepted tier ed or stepped model of pain care has resulted in an overreliance on opioid medication which contributes to the increase in opioid abuse and dependence. Recommendation 4.1.16.1 Establish a tri-service and VHA working group that will recommend a paper form and Web-based interactive tool, designed for general medical settings, as the standardized tool to identify substance abuse patients. Recommendation 4.1.16.2 Incorporate the screening tool into the Pain Assessment Screening Tool and Outcome Registry. Recommendation 4.1.16.3 Implement use of the tool during the initial patient visit to obtain a baseline assessment. Recommendation 4.1.16.4 Enhance the communication of the patient's plan of care among primary care, specialty care, and substance abuse providers. Recommendation 4.1.16.5 Develop a strategic communications plan on the use of a standardized substance abuse screening tool. 4.1.17 Risk Management in Ch ronic Pain Medical Management Objective: Mitigate the risk of prescription drug abuse and dependence in pain patients, with a focus on those receiving controlled substances for the treatment of chronic pain. Current accepted treatment for opioid dependence in cludes both an abstinence-based approach and a pharmacologic approach. While an abstinence-based approach is clearly id eal, there is a significant relapse rate with the abstinence-based approach that is associated with incr eased morbidity and mortality. Early recognition of patients with risk factors for a buse and dependence will lead to closer monitoring and consultation with a pain specialist and beha vioral health specialist when considering the use of opioids for the treatment of chronic pain. Once opioid dependence has be en identified, appropriate tr eatment can be arranged. There has been limited success with the use of naltrexone in patients who have co mpleted detoxification, but the long term compliance rate is low, much as compliance with An tabuse is low among patients with alcohol dependence. Until the Drug Abuse Treatment Act of 2000 (DATA 2000 ), the only opioid ag onist treatment available for opioid dependence was methadone. When used fo r opioid dependence, methadone can only be obtained from a licensed methadone clinic. Opioid agonist therapy is ass ociated with increased co mpliance, reduced criminal behavior, increased social and occupational functioning, and re duced morbidity and mortality. DATA 2000 allowed for office-based op ioid agonist treatment using the medication buprenorp hine/naltrexone in a tightly regula ted manner. Although buprenorp hine/naltrexone is being used in the treatment of patients with opioid de pendence within se veral military medical treatment centers and is prescribed for some patients receiving treatment in the network, buprenorphine/naltrexone is not a covered benefit under TRICARE. Thus, it is extremely difficult for patients to continue therapy followi ng discharge from the network treatment facility. The patients referred to civilian in patient treatment programs and started on b uprenorphine/naltrexone are often the FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS PAIN MANAGEMENT TASK FORCE 35 Public patients with the most severe forms of opioid dependence a nd are at the highest risk of relapse. Failure to continue the therapy used to stabilize their opioid dependence increases their likelihood of relapse after discharge. In addition, there are some high functioning patients who have been on opioids for the treatment of chronic pain for a long period of time but for whom the medic ation has ceased to provide benefit. Some of these patients have trouble stopping secondary to withdrawal symptoms that result in protracted discomfort, difficulty sleeping, difficulty with concentration, and irritab ility. These patients often have a stable home life, function well at work, do not experience disciplinary problems, and may not need a formal substance dependence treatment program. It is acceptable to treat these patients in an office-based setting with close monitoring and appropriate pain medici ne, behavioral health, and primary care support. Over time, these patients may be successfully tapered off the opioid agonist therapy. The TF recommends implementing standardized screen ing tools, using a steppe d care approach to pain management, increasing access to speci alized pain care, offering alternatives to chronic opioid therapy, and implementing pain education programs to address and redu ce the reliance on opioid medications. For patients who have developed prescripti on opioid dependence, there should be ready referral for appropriate substance abuse treatment and the use of office-based opioid agonist treatment should be available as an option for selected patients who would benefit. Recommendation 4.1.17.1 Implement a stepped care model for pain care. Recommendation 4.1.17.2 Develop a strategic communications plan on DoD and VHA guidelines for chronic opioid therapy and the VHA Opioid Pain Care Agreement. Recommendation 4.1.17.3 Educate providers and chronic pain patients on the signs and symptoms of opioid dependence, addiction treatment options, and stigma issues. Recommendation 4.1.17.4 Ensure that appropriate treatment for opioid dependence, including the use of office-based opioid agonist therapy, is available for those patients who have developed an opioid dependence as a result of pain treatment. Recommendation 4.1.17.5 Ensure that patients with chronic pain who demonstrate, or are deemed at risk for, aberrant behavior have access to structured pharmacy management programs that support opioid and medication pain management. FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS PAIN MANAGEMENT TASK FORCE 36 Public Research Figure 9: A Summary of Categories for Research Provide Tools and Infrastructure that Support and Encourage Practice and Research Advancements in Pain Management Research/g120DoD and VHA Pain Research Strategy /g120Research Strategic Communications /g120Clinical Practice Guidelin es for Pain Management 4.1.18 DoD and VHA Pain Research Strategy Objective: Develop collaborative pain research strategies that advance Warrior pain care and rapidly translate effective findings into practice. The theoretical criteria for se lecting analgesics for pain proced ures and other treatment include /g120Efficacy /g120Overall effectiveness /g120Side effects and complications /g120Onset of symptoms /g120Drug interactions /g120Abuse potential /g120Practical issues such as cost and availability of the drug, as well as the severity and type of pain Social and cultural issues, such as t he time and location of the provider's tr aining, mentor prefe rences, and the influence of pharmaceutical marketing and advertising also play a role. There are still other factors relating to prescribing medication, including availa bility of the compound and cost. At any gi ven time, the order of choice in the decision-making process can ch ange. Wide variation in the treatm ent of pain is the result. Qualitative and quantitative evidence-based research is the best way to inform the pain management process and translate new information (e.g., techniques) into clinical practice. Data analysis yields the most unbi ased results and informs the selection of future lines of research. This is the best way to advance pain care and standardize clinical variation, while minimizing patient pain and suffering. Research can inform pain treatment modalities, decrease cost, identify ways to prevent addiction, and ensure the research priorities match the actual need. Currently, research information outcomes are not widely ava ilable and there are inad equate processes for the implementation of knowledge in the form of transfer to cl inical practice. There is in sufficient funding for pain Research, Development, Test & Evaluation (RDTE). Research productivity must be increas ed, with a goal of higher quality, improved patient care. Battlefiel d pain care drives the DVPMI agenda. T he field of pain care would be advanced if the same need-based approach were adopted across the enterprise and suff icient resources provided. It is critical to communicate issues of systematic evaluation and ongoing care of chronic or persistent pain, and provide information about the scientific ba sis of recommended procedures in order to eliminate variatio n and improve care. Research and guidelines could be expected to in crease patient compliance, dis pel miscommunications among providers and patients, manage reasonable patient expectations, and form the basis of a therapeutic partnership between the patient and the provider. FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS PAIN MANAGEMENT TASK FORCE 37 Public The MHS must leverage TF discoveries to ensure research in pain management addresses current medical knowledge and the technology ne eds of the MEDCENs and VA hospitals to care for Wounded Warriors. Pain management is one of the most costly medical care funct ions MEDCENs perform. Deve loping better medicines and techniques to manage pain more effectively has the potential to significantly decrease costs and result in better health care overall. The Surgeon General's lead for conducti ng medical research and devel opment under the Army's RDTE program, United States Army Medical Research and Materiel Command (MRMC), maintains or ganizations and core funding for pain management. In 2008, MRMC established the Clin ical and Rehabilitative Medicine Research Program (CRMRP) to focus investments on Wounded Warrior care. Pa in management RDTE is assigned to CRMRP. CRMRP identifies objectives and priorities for pain mana gement research through a jo int, interdisciplinary clinical panel - the Pain Management Scientific Steering Committ ee (SSC) - of stakeholders from all Services, appropriate DoD elements, National Institute of He alth (NIH), and VHA. The Pain Ma nagement SSC esta blished research objectives and priorities in April 2009 but discoveries of the TF regarding technologies, techniques, and guidelines applied to pain management indicate a need to reexamine those issues and communicate revisions to CRMRP for incorporation into its RDTE strategic plan. CRMRP accomplishes research objectives by leveraging other research programs, laboratories, and the global medical science base, including ac ademia and industry. Once objectives and priorities are known, CRMRP issues solicitations. CRMRP uses an interdisciplinary team to re view proposals from these solicitations for scientific merit, programmatic compliance, and affordability. Sel ections are then funded by CRMRP. Beginning in Fiscal Year 2010, the RDTE Core Program includes funding for the DVP MI's science programs. This core funding establishes the first organization solely focused on pain management and enhances DoD's capability and capacity to conduct RDTE specifically for pain management. Pain Management RDTE competes with all other research and science needs for the medical care of Wounded Warrior s. The Pain TF found that of all DoD Medical RDTE investments over the next 5 years, pain management research is programmed to receive < 2%, or $54.6M. However, in CRMRP's portfolio, pain managem ent is presently ranked second, behind musculoskeletal injury rehabilitation. Pain management investments are seriou sly underrepresented in DoD's resear ch investment strategy, given the high cost of pain management in Wounded Warriors, and the ub iquitous nature of acute and chronic pain in trauma patients. Widespread patient dissatisfaction with pain co ntrol and other outcomes meas ures suggest an urgent need for a change in strategy. The organization must leverage TF recommendations and the core RDTE organizations to validate pain management research objectives, recom mend priorities, and reset as needed. The DVPMI is assembling the best pain management expertise avai lable in the DoD and VHA. This body of expertise appears ta ilor-made to enable CRMRP to establish strategic objectives and priorities for pa in management RDTE. Next, the organization must widely disseminate knowledge and technolog y objectives through the Research Strategic Commun ications initiative and resource the implementation of strategic communications (STRAT COM). CRMRP will evaluate risks in meeting critical pain management research outcomes and propose right-size funding for Fiscal Year 2012 and beyond. Pain management RDTE priorities are established at high le vels within DoD and Army. Significantly increasing investments in pain management will require approval at the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs and Assistant Secretary of the Army Acquisition, Logistics, and Technology level. Thus, a strong statement by the Services Surgeons General will be important in rig ht-sizing investments in pain management RDTE. Pain management investments are seriously underrepresented in DoD's research investment strategy, given the high cost of pain management in Wounded Warriors, and the ubiquitous nature of acute and chronic pain in trauma patientsFINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS PAIN MANAGEMENT TASK FORCE 38 Public Recommendation 4.1.18.1 Develop a pain medicine research strategy to ensure evidence-based medicine guides clinical decisions. Recommendation 4.1.18.2 Ensure research in pain management incorporates emerging medical knowledge and technology needs to care for Wounded Warriors. Recommendation 4.1.18.3 Implement proposed solutions to ensure pain management research objectives, priorities, and resources enable MRMC to satisfy current, validated medical technology and information needs. 4.1.19 Research Strategic Communications Objective: Improve military pain research strategic communications. The MHS can improve STRATCOM related to military pain rese arch opportunities and research outcomes to improve translation of innovative pain management practices and technologies in to clinical practice. The DoD's research and development (R&D) busi nesses use a formal process (prescribed by Department of Defense Instruction 5000) to develop and then communicate and translate new materiel innovations into Table of Organization and Equipment (TO&E) (i.e., battlefield) militar y operations. DoD's Medical R&D businesses follow these same processes to translate new medicines and me dical equipment onto the battlef ield. Processes used to broadcast progress and outcome s (i.e., technologies and knowledge) to battlefield military medical users are managed by the United States Army Medical Department (AMED D) Center and School or other Service Combat Developers and Logisticians. Historically, medical R&D businesses within DoD have focused on battlefield technology development. In 2008, the MRMC established CRMRP to focus R&D sp ecifically on \"resetting\" care for severely Wounded Warriors to enable their reintegration into society or reintroduction into servic e. CRMRP is responsible for developing new technologies, including pain management technologies, to treat Woun ded Warriors. The CRMRP diffe rs from other medical R&D programs by having, as its principal customers, clinicians within t he Table of Distribution and Allowances (TDA) (i.e., sustainment base) MEDCENS and VHA, instead of those in TO&E MTFs. From a military medical R&D perspective, this difference is a game changer. Many of the establis hed TO&E processes for preparing the users and then translating innovations into practice do not apply to the TDA base. Therefore, fu ture pain mana gement innovations that focus on MEDCEN and VHA care for Wounded Warriors may not reach the right au dience(s) unless a new STRATCOM plan is developed and implemented. New pain management knowledge and technologies ar e acquired by CRMRP using a formal process that includes an objectives definition, solicitation for pr oposals, and awarding funds to perfo rm scientific work. To enable CRMRP to satisfy its objectives, pain management researchers must be aware both of the unmet needs (i.e., objectives) and of funding opportunities (i.e., solicita tions). They must then have the ability an d resources to prepare high quality proposals judged through a competiti ve, formal process. When solicitations fail to reach the best researchers, or if the best researchers are not able to prepare a high -quality proposal, then advanc ement of knowledge and technologies in pain ma nagement will falter. Formal mechanisms for communicating pain-related research opportunities and outcom es (i.e., technologies and knowledge) to researchers, care providers, and policy-makers in the military health care sustaining base and in the VHA are needed. Mechanisms must be created that en sure awareness and action by MEDCEN and VHA care providers in defining requirements, assist in relevant resear ch, and translate research innovations into practice. FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS PAIN MANAGEMENT TASK FORCE 39 Public Creating an Army and Joint Forces appr oval process for acquiring, tra nslating, and sustaining new technologies for TDA use would greatly enhance opportunities for success. Recommendation 4.1.19.1 Encourage collaboration among MRMC, CRMRP, and the AMEDD Center and School to institutionalize strategic communications and dissemination of innovation in pain management technologies and knowledge. Recommendation 4.1.19.2 Secure funding to support the acquisition of information system technologies. Recommendation 4.1.19.3 Secure funding for a central pain management advisory board. Recommendation 4.1.19.4 Task MRMC and CRMRP to provide a central pain management advisory board access to shared information platforms acquired by MRMC to fill research information needs. 4.1.20 Clinical Practice Guidelines for Pain Management Objective: Standardize the practice of pain medicine with pain management clinical practice and clinical management guidelines. Clinical Practice Guidelines (CPGs) are do cuments developed to guide the diag nosis, treatment, and management of specific diseases and conditions. Based on best available evidence, CPGs are educational tools and can be used to align medical practice patterns with the available evidence. Many CPGs have been developed through collaborative efforts between DoD and VHA. Three out of the twenty-three CPGs available on the Therapy /g120Lower Pack Pain /g120Post-Operative Pain Providers interviewed during site visits consistently expressed a need for impro ved clinical guid elines for pain management. It was often explained th at providers would be less likely to refer pain patients for specialty care if they felt more comfortable that they were doing the right thing for these patients in their respective clinics. Additionally, they further explained that it is difficult to determine what \"ri ght\" looks like when evaluating the wide variance in treatment plans used by other providers acr oss the medical continuum. There are pain management guidelines available for providers but the Task Force analysis indicat ed several variables limiting th eir influence and use within the current practice of pain management in the MHS and VHA: /g120Lack of provider awareness of CPGs related to pain management. /g120Current format of CPGs not easily used or integrated into provider practice. /g120Need for new CPGs developed to specifically address requirement to standardize practice of pain medicine in DoD and VHA health care systems. A majority of the providers interview ed were unaware of the existence of these CPGs. This is regrettable because these VA and DoD CPGs were developed thro ugh an extremely resource-inten sive process involving multiple senior clinicians and researchers and a rigoro us examination of the medical evidenc e. Additional efforts are required to expand their visibility and use throughout the MHS and VHA and should be a focus of the DoD comprehensive pain strategy. FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS PAIN MANAGEMENT TASK FORCE 40 Public Of the providers who stated that they were aware of CPGs, specifically the VHA and DoD CPGs, many felt that in their current format, they were too long, cumbersome, and difficult to integrate into their daily practice. For example, the length of the CPG for chronic opioid therapy is 111 pages for the full document, 32 pages for the summary, and 4 pages for the \"pocket card.\" In addi tion to expanding provider awareness of CPGs, current and future CPGs should be evaluated for ease of use for providers. Where possib le, they should be integrated into the computerized patient medical record to provide an automated decision su pport tool to providers and ul timately an increased standardization of pain managemen t practice across the enterprise. New CPGs should be developed to incorporate the best availabl e medical evidence in pain medicine that will address the unique needs of military patients. The triad of comorbid pain, post-concussive syndrome (mTBI), and PTSD require additional clinical guidance and support for providers. A central pai n management advisory board should develop a list of priorities for pain related CPG development. As stated earlier, these new CPGs should be developed in a format that encourages pro vider utilization and is in tegrated into the computerized medical record. All future CPGs should be developed as a part of the larger DoD comprehensive pain management strategy. Recommendation 4.1.20.1 Incorporate Clinical Practice Guidelines into STRATCOM plan to ensure maximum awareness of pain related Clinical Practice Guidelines by DoD and VHA providers. Recommendation 4.1.20.2 Integrate Clinical Practice Guidelines into computerized medical record. Recommendation 4.1.20.3 Utilize a central pain management advisory board to develop priorities for future pain-related Clinical Practice Guideline development. FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS PAIN MANAGEMENT TASK FORCE 41 Public 4.2 Build a Full Spectrum of Best Practices for the Continuum of Acute and Chronic Pain, Based on a Foundation of Best Available Evidence The second objective calls for building a full spectrum of best practices for the continuum of pain care, from acute to chronic, which is based on a foundation of the best available evidence. This can be accomplished through the adoption of an integrative and interdisciplinary approach to managing pain. Despite the best intentions of clinicia ns, pain and symptom control is often sub-optimal because the entire health care system has been designed around cu re of disease rather than palliation (Max, 1990). There have been many demonstrations of major improv ements in pain treatment within health care organizat ions, but programs that institute such improvements must redesign many aspects of the way care is de livered (Jacox et al., 1994). Essential ingredients in such improved progra ms include th e following: /g120Physicians, nurses, patients, a nd Families must be educated about pain treatment, and materials to guide treatment must be readily available to assist clinicians in writing orders. /g120The organization and all of its profe ssionals must make themsel ves accountable to all of their patients - ranging from newborns to the elderly - for attentive treatment of pain. /g120Pain must be made \"visible\" in the organization - routinely charted as a \"fifth vital sign\" so that unrelieved pain triggers a prompt response. /g120Quality improvement activities should be used to en courage steady improvement in the treatment of pain in the organization. /g120Expert consultants and \"high technology\" pain treatment interventio ns, such as patient-controlled analgesia and epidural catheters, must be availab le (either within the health care organization or by referral) for the minority of cases in which simpler measures do not suffice. /g120Policies on reimbursement for health professionals, medications, and other palliative treatments (e.g., counseling, cognitive treatment for symptoms, and other supportive care), and contro lled substance regulations must be designed so that they do not create barriers to symptom treatment. /g120Patients' and Families' values an d preferences regarding care must be respected. Implementation of program components such as these will require an organizational commitment to identify opportunities for improvement and offer guidance to close organizational gaps across the enterprise, including deficiencies in: /g120Interdisciplinary staffing, trai ning, and education /g120Space and workflow organization /g120Coordination of care and support services /g120Clinical practice standardization /g120Technology /g120Communication barriers to effective and efficient service Such an organizational reset will re quire an examination of program capa city, effective non-traditional services, and resources needed fo r enhanced pain ma nagement services. FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS PAIN MANAGEMENT TASK FORCE 42 Public An Integrative and Interdisciplinary Approach Figure 10: A Summary of Categories for an Integrative and Interdisciplinary Approach Build a Full Spectrum of Best Practices for the Continuum of Acute and Chronic Pain, Based on a Foundation of Best Available Evidence An Integrative and Interdisciplinary Approach/g120Complementary and Integrative Pain Treatment Medicine /g120Osteopathic Manipulation /g120Primary Care Pain Management /g120Stepped Care Model /g120Musculoskeletal Action Plan 4.2.1 Complementary and Integrative Pain Treatment Medicine Objective: Incorporate integrative and alternative therapeutic modalities into a patient centered plan of care. The etiology of pain is multimodal and complicated, affecting every aspect of the individual: physical, emotional, and spiritual, as well the Family and community. There is no simple solution to this complex problem. Thus, the treatment needs to be interdisciplinary and multimodal in its ap proach. But more than that, it needs to incorporate all the aspects of the individual, Family, and commun ity and not just focus on the etiology itself. One way to achieve an interdisciplinary, multimo dal and holistic approach to pain management is by incorporating comple mentary and alternative therapies into an individualized pain management plan of care. The current medical model is a provider-to-patient relations hip. This is known as provider-based care where the team leader is the provider. This model is oft en one of \"doing something to the patient\" instead of having the patient participating in his or her own care. In the case of pain management, the patient presents a compl aint of pain to the provider. Many times the treatment is a pr escription for a medication and a brief description of precautions, lim its, and possibly some exercises. Rare ly does the patient do anything other than take the medication and return for a refill. The patients become devoid of ownership of the condition when they are a passive participant in their own care. This leads to rec urrent cases of poor outcome s, problems with multiple prescriptions, and some patients' disillusion with the medical system. Stress is a significant contributor to pain conditions. In fact, by definition, pain has an emotional component. Further, chronic pain leads to increased stress wh ich leads to a vicious cycle. Therefor e, pain cannot be managed without addressing its relationshi p to stress. Research is showing that our though ts and perceptions influence our ability to heal. Mindfulness or the ability to be in the moment brings a greater awareness to the unconscious and its affect on emotional, physical, and spiritual health. Mindfulness focuses the mind's ability to heal the body. This interaction is often missed in the disease based treatment model. The terms complementary medi cine and alternative medicine are often used interch angeably, but the y do in fact differ from each other. Complementary medicine is used together with conventional medicine. An example of a complementary therapy is using aromatherapy (the scent of essential oils from flowers, herbs or trees) to help lessen a patient's discomfort following sur gery. Alternative medicine is used in pl ace of conventional medicine. An example of an alternative therapy is using a sp ecial diet to treat cancer instead of undergoing surgery, radiation, or chemotherapy that has been recommend ed by a conven tional doctor. The patients become devoid of ownership of the condition when they are a passive participant in their own careFINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS PAIN MANAGEMENT TASK FORCE 43 Public The Integrative model emphasizes the patient -centered care model of treatment. In this model, the patient is the team leader with the providers acting as consultants and guides to the patient. Taking this a step further, Integrative Health and Healing teaches the im portance of self: self-care, self-responsibi lity, and self-awareness. In February 2009, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) acknowledged patient-c entered care as one of the fi ve critical dimensions of high-quality care. Further, research shows that focusing the health care system around the patient can improve patients' satisfaction with care, as well as their clinical outc omes. Patient-centered care empowers the patient to be responsible and participatory in his or her health and healing process. However, the change from the current model will require a significant paradigm shift. Over the past twenty years, patients have led this shift. They are seeking out \"alternative medicine\" to help address their individual needs. They often do this without the guidance of professionals. In fact, sometimes the patients withhold the fact they are using other treatments from their conventio nal health care providers. The medi cal community needs to be part of the patient's journey, promoting each patient's individual health goals. To best ad dress the goal of patient-centered care, providers must work in partnership with pati ents and Families in providing health pr omotion options wh ile maintaining efficacy and safety standards. This integration needs to be method ical, appropriate, and eva luated throughout the process to ensure the best potential outcomes. Just as patients can be active or passive participants in their treatment, that treatment can be active or passive as well. The difficulty with all treatment, regardless of whether the treat ment is conventional or integrative, is that it can allow the patient to remain a passive participant. For exam ple, weekly acupuncture perf ormed on a patient can allow the patient to return each week without taking ownership and responsibilit y for the pain. Thus, it is imperative that one of the end goals of any treatment is patient particip ation. Clearly a patient with significant diabetes needs medications for control; however, evidence shows that the patient also needs to maint ain a proper diet, exercise regimen and self-care. If the patient only takes medications for the diabetes, the outcome will not be optimal. Likewise, teaching the pati ent the points for self-directed acupressure, while performing acupuncture for a pain condition, incorporates the patient into the treatment. This changes the treatment from passive to active and improves the outcome, decreases provider dependent care, and empowers the patient with a sense of control over his or her condition. The Task Force site visits included an assessment of the scope of CAM modalities offered at each MTF. CAM experts, if they existed, were interviewed, as were providers and, where practical, patients and/or Family members. The literature on Complementary and Alternative Medici ne was reviewed, along wi th the MHS policies and procedures. Various experts in the field of Mind Body a nd Complementary and Alter native Medicine were also visited or interviewed. Additiona lly, the Task Force consulted with the Samueli Institute, a non-profit research organization that supports the scientific investigation of healing and its role in medicine and health care. The Samueli Institute has been working on several research projects related to military and Veterans' pain management. In 2005 the DoD Survey of Health Related Behaviors among Active Duty Military included questions on CAM usage among Service Members. These data, reflecting 19 CAM ty pes in the five recognized CAM treatment categories are reported in a manuscript currently un der review for publication (Samueli co mmunication). The CAM subgroup of the TF studied the issues surrounding credentiali ng and licensing of CAM providers. The tiered structure represents a hierarch y of implementation based on cu rrent accepted literature supporting efficacy, safety, and widespread use or acce ptability. Addition ally, licensing and creden tialing concerns were taken into consideration in the development of the recommen dations. Within the tiers, acti ve and passive treatments are identified to allow for an understanding of how passive treatments can become active treatments to avoid the pitfalls of passive patient participation. Most passive treatments require a provider to perform the treatment or guide the participant in the activity. On the other hand, active treatments typically require some level of patient education up front to ensure patients are using the modalities correctly and safely; only then should the treatment become patient self-directed. Some active treatment s are portable with in dividualized equipment. The TF recommends adopting a tiered approach for the effective integration of Integrati ve Modalities to augment pain management.

Medical science acknowledges that there are many accepted practices that are utilized without evidence from well-designed research and data in both complementary and traditional western medicine. CAM practices, in pa rticular, are often debunked as ineffective or merely effective due to the placebo effect. Excitin g research in neurobiological imaging is showing that the placebo effect is indeed a \"real\" one to be clinically exploi ted, given its efficacy and safety margin. Many of these gaps in evidence for CAM therapies remain since funded research on these therapies is one of the newest areas recognized by National Institutes for Health. The National Center for Complementar y and Alternative Medi cine (NCCAM) started as an Office of Alternative Medicine (OAM) in 1992 and expanded to a center in 1998 with a current budget of $122 million (NCCAM Web site). FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS PAIN MANAGEMENT TASK FORCE 45 Public Recommendation 4.2.1.1 Adopt a tiered approach for the effective integration of integrative modalities to augment pain management for military and Veteran populations. Recommendation 4.2.1.2 Establish integrative pain medicine capabilities at RPCoE's and DoD sites (Army, Navy, and Air Force) to champion integrative pain care with a focus on the best clinical practices, education, and research.

Recommendation 4.2.1.6 Develop and fund pilot programs across DoD in the delivery of integrative pain. Recommendation 4.2.1.7 Request Health Affairs undertake the evaluation of integrative medicine modalities in Tier I for inclusion as covered TRICARE benefits. 4.2.2 Osteopathic Manipulation Objective: Leverage embedded osteopathic and physical therapy resources in the provision of manipulation therapies for musculoskeletal pain. Manual medicine or manipulation is well accepted by patients, has proven successful for treating many musculoskeletal pain syndromes, and is well suited for integration into the primary care and physiatry workflows. The goal of manual medicine is to restore the entire body to a state of homeostasis. Manual medicine employs palpation using the providers' hands to detect sources of pain and dysfunction within the skin, fascia, muscles, ligaments, and tendons. Once these areas of dysfunction are identified, manual medicine should be used to decrease muscle spasms, neural facilitation, improve local circulation of blood and lymph, improve range of motion, and decrease pain. There are several barriers to widespread adoption of manual therapies; however most of these barriers can be overcome with adequate command support: /g120Inadequate clinic set up: - requires flat treatment tables, not lithotomy tables - preferably two rooms per provider to improve patient flow - inability of the RVUs (productivity metrics) to track success of manual therapies - inability to have flexible appointment lengths FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS PAIN MANAGEMENT TASK FORCE 46 Public The AMEDD has a significant number of Osteopathic physicians on staff and in Graduate Medical Education (GME) training programs. However, there is inconsistent application of osteopathic modalities and continuing training at the GME and Continuing Medical Education (CME) level. Physical therapists are also trained to perform manual therapies and could provide them under a structure similar to what the TF is suggesting for Osteopathic Manipulative Treatment (OMT). The Army should take the initiative to use and continue training their embedded (wearing the uniform) resources. Many Active Duty Medical Corps Officers and Physical Therapist in the Medical Specialty Corps have been previously trained to provide manual medicine. These Active Duty assets are able to provide comprehensive medical care in addition to their manual manipulation skills. The TF recommends using these organic resources, rather than outsourcing and spending money, amongst other resources, on hiring chiropractors who are only trained to provide manipulation. GME training and program implementation policies will be required to implement manual manipulation programs at the MTF level. A GME level training program must be developed and implemented. This will enable residents to continue using and improving upon the skills they learned in medical school and increase their efficiency with treatment. Once these residents become staff, they will be able to successfully incorporate manual medicine into their daily clinic flow. A GME OMT training program should include a GME Manipulation Clinic with staff oversight, an education series on OMT, and a \"hands-on\" review of manipulative therapies. For non-osteopathic residents and staff, the GME program will serve to teach them improved diagnostic skills, educate them on which patients are appropriate for referrals for manual medicine, and teach them hands-on manual medicine they can use in their own clinics. A GME manual medicine program will also enhance the comprehensive care that all participating physicians provide to their patients. Additionally, GME OMT clinics would need longer appointment slots to encourage education and oversight by staff physicians. Staff physicians who have training in manual therapy will usually be able to see their patients in the course of their normal appointment slot lengths when indicated. On occasion, they may need to bring a patient back for a longer appointment slot to address more complicated and involved pathology. Staff physicians should be encouraged to use manual therapies as part of their comprehensive care process. Their success has the potential to be measured in patient satisfaction, decreased medications dispensed, decreased profiles written, improved return to duty, less referrals for musculoskeletal complaints, and decreased office visits for the same complaint. The main resource requirement for a staff physician to employ manual medicine skills is a flat exam table. There are some relevant best practices within the Army and these should be studied as possible best practices to replicate in other facilities. There are scattered training programs with various successes across the AMEDD. Figure 13: OMT Practices Training Programs Selected Best Practices GME /g120Ft.

Belvoir Family Medicine Residency Program /g120Walter Reed Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Service FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS PAIN MANAGEMENT TASK FORCE 47 Public CME should be available at MTFs for providers who have been trained in manual medicine. The resource requirement for this is minimal. Essentially, any individual provider with manual therapy knowledge would be able to provide presentations and hands-on demonstrations and review of the manual therapy techniques. In addition to these presentations, a room in which to provide the training is necessary. Providers should be encouraged to attend annual CME training provided by professional organizations to enhance their knowledge and skill sets. An example is a young Active Duty patient who has mid and low back pain who is seen for back pain after wearing gear and carrying large loads. Figure 14: OMT Options for Active Duty Patients Option 1 Option 2 The patient receives a profile, a referral to physical therapy, quarters or convalescent leave, medication, and possibly, consults for more invasive procedures. These all lead to decreased productivity for the military from this active duty patient (lost work days, decreased productivity when at work, potential interaction of medications with ability to work). In addition, resources are needed to track this patient's profile and medical care. The patient has an appointment with a primary care provider for the back pain and receives OMT during his visit. The treatment takes less than twenty minutes. The patient then leaves and returns to duty, without a profile, no medications, and no referrals. This option costs less money initially and subsequently less money is lost in productivity and use of assets. When you look at the many brigades full of young active duty soldiers only experiencing back pain, using OMT to treat musculoskeletal conditions could result in a significant cost savings to the military in addition to improved satisfaction and function for the patients. Resource requirements are minimal and include use of existing space for training clinics, two patient exam rooms per provider with OMT (simply flat or adjustable) tables. IT requirements include documentation and coding solutions (recommended AHLTA AIM forms, SOAP templates (Subjective, Objective, Assessment, Plan), Common Procedural Terminology (CPT) encounter templates, and Evaluation & Management (E&M) dispositions documentation) and training and use of MAPS (MEDCOM AHLTA Provider Satisfaction) tools (such as Dragon and As-U-Type). An extended list of OMT related issues can be found in Appendix B-7. Potential research pilot projects might include: /g120OMT Clinic (GME) which tracks the residents to see which residents continue to use OMT in their comprehensive practice once they are staff physician and tracks the number of residents. /g120Survey of Osteopathic Physicians and Physical Therapists who are Active Duty to establish those who use manipulative therapies in clinic /hospital / deployed setting, what the barriers to use are, amount of CME in manipulative therapies available at their site, interest in participating in a clinic specific for manipulation with other providers or why they chose not to use their unique skill set. /g120Auricular (battlefield) acupuncture pilot program in the WTU clinics. /g120Improved clinic resources with an adapted workflow - to accommodate in-clinic OMT visits: - Two rooms per provider for patient flow. - Manipulation tables. /g120AHLTA business processes. /g120Qualitative and Quantitative examination of the impact of OMT on acute and chronic pain syndromes. /g120Down range use of OMT down range to prevent chronic complications from acute problems. It is ideal for the military to facilitate beneficiaries having their musculoskeletal concerns addressed by OMT during the course of an office visit. Referrals to other providers (either civilian network care or to other military providers) have their costs, such as time for providers and patients, lost patient work productivity in their military jobs, and availability o f FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS PAIN MANAGEMENT TASK FORCE 48 Public appointment slots for other patients. By facilitating osteopathic manipulation in primary care clinics, some of these costs could be minimized and recouped (especially if the civilian network referrals are decreased). Validation and measurement should focus on reduction of acute and chronic musculoskeletal pain, as measured on the 0-10 point Pain Assessment Screening Tool, and prevention of chronic pain syndromes through the routine application of osteopathic manipulative therapies. Patient satisfaction could be measured using the new Pain Assessment Tool and analyzing for trends, reduced medication utilization, prevention of chronic pain syndromes, and improvement in the provider utilization rate. Reduction of acute and chronic musculo skeletal pain and prevention of ch ronic pain syndromes through the routine application of osteopathic manipulative therapies are achievable goals. Recommendation 4.2.2.1 Support osteopathic manipulation in staff clinics. Recommendation 4.2.2.2 Survey Active Duty Osteopathic Physicians and manually trained Physical Therapists to understand the uses, practices, and barriers of manual medicine. Recommendation 4.2.2.3 Implement and support Osteopathic Manipulation Graduate Medical Education during primary care and physiatry residency programs to utilize and continue developing current Army resources. Recommendation 4.2.2.4 Implement and encourage the use of osteopathic manipulation (or manual medicine) in theater. Recommendation 4.2.2.5 Incorporate osteopathic manipulation therapy referrals into case management in WTUs. Recommendation 4.2.2.6 Improve metrics, such as RVUs, which are used to measure the success of providers in treating patients but do not actually measure patient improvement. 4.2.3 Primary Care Pain Management Objective: Integrate pain management into primary care, consistent with the Patient Centered Medical Home Model. According to the American Academy of Pain Management (AAPM) Web site, pain is the number one reason patients seek medical care. One out of two Americans is in pain and one in four has persistent or chronic pain with the leading cause being low back pain. One hundred billion dollars is spent annually on pain care, yet very little progress has been made in treating pain and suffering. In managed organizations, pain affects more people than heart disease, hypertension, diabetes, or cancer. The majority of pain care is delivered by primary care practitioners because they are often the first point of contact. Further, there are insufficient numbers of pain specialists to manage the millions of people suffering from chronic pain. Primary care providers are experienced in providing comfort and disease management for conditions that have no cure. Primary care providers have a strong, sustaining patient relationship. With the proper training and system support, primary care FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS PAIN MANAGEMENT TASK FORCE 49 Public providers are in the best position to longitudinally coordinate pain management from early intervention to long-term continuity of care, on to end-of-life care. A patient-centered approach to pain management with an integrated pain team or clinic in primary care will impact the greatest number of patients. Utilizing both medications and non-drug therapies within a biopsychosocial model that emphasizes self-management will lead to the best results. Both chronic pain as a disease and the suffering of the patient must be addressed. Early education, early risk stratification, and early interventions to improve outcomes and safety will result in a greater relief from pain, a decrease in suffering, increased function, and safe prescribing of opioids for a greater number of patients. The goal is to prevent pain from becoming a disabling disease. The demand for effective pain treatment is growing among patients in the United States. Despite advances in the treatment of pain, the quality of pain care remains far below the potential for optimal care. Fragmentation of pain care is perpetuated by the consecutive, and even concurrent, lack of integrated evaluation and management of complex pain disorders. Primary care often promotes fragmented care for patients with chronic pain conditions by utilizing a succession of referrals to specialists and subspecialists rather than implementing the biopsychosocial model of best-practice pain management. Multiple physicians may contribute to a patient's \"pain management\" with limited focus or goals, duplication of testing or unnecessary invasive testing, and with either limited interventions, or large variance of interventions available. This compartmentalized approach makes it difficult to identify a single provider to advocate for the patient's overall care by treating the patient as a whole human being with often multiple chronic conditions - all affecting each other. The overall quality of treatment of pain is unacceptable for patients with acute and persistent pain leading to suffering, abuse, addiction and sometimes even more serious consequences. For example, abuse of prescription drugs is now the second leading cause of accidental death. Death caused by prescription pain drugs is higher than deaths caused by cocaine, heroin, and methamphetamine combined and health care costs are eight times higher for opioid abusers than non-abusers (SAMSHA, 2008). Clinicians are faced with a dilemma - how to safely incorporate opioids into treatment plans that maximize the possibility of successful pain control while minimizing the risk of misuse or abuse. The dilemma is heightened for primary care providers who shoulder most of the burden of pain management, despite having received little specific training in pain medicine or substance abuse, and generally being constrained to brief visits for evaluating and managing complex problems. Opioids are not the only answer to treatment of moderate or severe pain, but in the current system, often this is all that is offered. Providers find it much quicker to write a prescription than to manage the pain appropriately. The opposite may also occur, as pain may be undertreated due to provider's discomfort, or even fear, of using opioids because of possible legal sanctions. Also of concern is the practice of providing opioids for chronic pain without following standard practice guidelines regarding assessment and monitoring, which can lead to negative outcomes. There are other barriers for providers to practice good pain care: /g120Lack of training for primary care providers to manage pain /g120The wide variance of provider beliefs about pain treatment /g120Lack of timely access to comprehensive pain medicine consultation /g120Poor monitoring of care for patients with chronic pain, who may receive treatment from multiple providers, without a coordinated care plan, including multiple prescribers of opioids Providers who prescribe opioids to treat pain are often caught between their professional obligation to relieve suffering and their desire to avoid contributing to the public health problem of non-medical consumption of controlled substances (i.e., prescription drug abuse). The challenge is to curtail the abuse and diversion of prescription opioids while ensuring their availability for patients who benefit from their use. The key to managing a patient's opioid intake lies in screening for abuse potential and carefully monitoring the progress of treatment. In the mobile military Pain is the number one reason patients seek medical care and there are insufficient numbers of pain specialists to manage the millions of people sufferin g from chronic painFINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS PAIN MANAGEMENT TASK FORCE 50 Public population, strategies for optimizing pain management need to address military medicine's challenges with continuity of care, oversight of medication, enhanced physical functioning, and promotion of return to duty (see section 4.3.1). The solution to this issue begins with a health care organization that is designed to provide a comprehensive, integrated, patient-centric approach to the full spectrum of primary care, including - and most especially - care of patients with chronic disease, such as chronic pain. In addition to the Primary Care Manager and appropriate support staff, it seems clear that a successful organizational design will include, at a minimum, organic behavioral health providers and clinical pharmacologists, with additional assets based on population needs. The MHS is currently piloting the Patient Centered Medical Home (PCMH), which provides a comprehensive, integrated approach to primary care. PCMH incorporates a number of principles that facilitate a holistic approach to patients with simple and complex medical needs and also facilitates partnerships among individual patients, their personal physicians, and when appropriate, the patient's Family. These principles, adapted from Patient Centered Primary Care Collaborative (PCPCC), can be found in Appendix B-8. Interdisciplinary pain clinics have the strongest evidence for improved pain outcomes. This is best implemented into pain management by developing a pain team or clinic integrated into primary care that is accessible and provides face- to-face coordination and communication with the primary care managers. Interdisciplinary pain team members may include: /g120Primary Care Provider /g120Medical Director /g120Mental Health Clinicians (psychologists, social workers, chemical dependency) /g120Rehabilitation Clinicians (physical therapists, occupational therapists, exercise physiologists) /g120Nurses /g120Case Manager /g120Pain Educator /g120Vocational Rehabilitation Counselors /g120Pharmacist Consultant, and access to consultant specialty physicians in pain medicine and other specialties as indicated (neurology, physiatry, psychiatry, addiction medicine) This primary care pain clinic would benefit all involved, especially the patient. The goals of the clinic: /g120Reduced pain intensity and suffering /g120Enhanced physical functioning /g120Improved access to pain treatment /g120Controlled medication usage (safe use) /g120Improved psychological functioning /g120Pain education for patient and Family /g120Promotion of meaningful life such as return to work Most patients with chronic pain should have a clinical evaluation that would include establishing their functional status, identifying comorbid conditions, evaluating psychosocial factors, setting goals, developing a goal-oriented management plan, and determining when to consult or refer. Before initiating long-term opioid therapy, a psychological evaluation should also be completed, which would include an opioid risk assessment, screening for potential drug abuse or addiction, identification of comorbid mental health issues, and determination of the patient's readiness to engage in self-care behaviors. The benefits of increased integration and coordination between the pain clinic and primary care will enhance patient and provider satisfaction, improve patient outcomes, and decrease health care costs. It would also provide an opportunity to identify and intervene in many problems to prevent development of significant pathology. FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS PAIN MANAGEMENT TASK FORCE 51 Public Using the chronic care model as a framework, optimal pain care requires an interdisciplinary pain care clinic integrated in primary care with a stepped-care pain treatment approach similar to the VHA program (see section 4.2.4). In an integrated pain clinic the patient will feel like someone is listening to him, his symptoms are explainable and controllable, and someone cares. The primary care model will provide timely and appropriate access to pain management services for all Beneficiaries. The clinic will provide early intervention, including educational programs that may reduce the likelihood of disability, improve the under-treatment of pain, provide individual tailoring of treatment plans, and serve as a liaison for patients transfers between MTFs or VA facilities. It will also provide access to pain-trained medical expertise and deliver a safe, effective, and evidence-based continuum of care. The MHS should move forward briskly with implementing a Patient Centered Medical Home, fully resourced with adequate support staff and IT, with embedded Behavioral Health and Clinical Pharmacology. The MHS should simultaneously move to outcomes-based performance metrics that recognize and capture the quality and safety benefits of a holistic, patient-centric approach to health care. The next step is to establish interdisciplinary pain care clinics, integrated in primary care, with a stepped-care pain treatment approach similar to the VHA program. Recommendation 4.2.3.1 Implement a fully resourced Patient Centered Medical Home. Recommendation 4.2.3.2 Develop outcomes-based performance metrics that recognize and capture the quality and safety benefits of a holistic, patient-centric approach to health care. Recommendation 4.2.3.3 Identify a workgroup from DoD and VHA to ensure that DoD interdisciplinary pain care clinics, integrated with primary care, correctly adopt a stepped care pain treatment approach. 4.2.4 Stepped Ca re Model Objective: Adopt the VHA Stepped Care Model to ensure timely access to collaborative care, reduce pain and suffering, and improve quality of life for Warriors and their Families. A continuum of effective pain care for Warriors, from the moment of injury on the battlefield or the onset of disease, to recovery or chronic pain management back home, is a core principle of the military's pain management strategy. Effective implementation of this strategy presumes competent care at every level of need, regardless of the setting, whether emergency management far forward on the battlefield and during transport, definitive treatment at military medical facilities, or an open-ended commitment to provide continuity of care in military and VA facilities back home as Service Members and Veterans reintegrate with their Families and communities. Establishing competency of care at each level of need in this continuum and in each setting presents the following organizational challenges fo r the MHS and VA: /g120Establishing an organized and systematic process of care with clearly delineated responsibilities and a chain of command /g120Assuring a systematic method of monitoring and conti nuously improving quality of care through outcomes measurement and patient feedback /g120Providing appropriate staffing at each level with adequate ly trained and skilled pe rsonnel to meet the needs of Service Members, Veterans and their Families FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS PAIN MANAGEMENT TASK FORCE 52 Public Lessons can be learned from organiza tional models in both civilian and Vet erans' health systems. As previously discussed, the Veterans Health Administratio n initiated a National Pain Mana gement Strategy in 1998 to establish Pain Management as a priority in the VHA's national health system. The overall objective of the national strategy was to develop a comprehensive, multicultural, integrated, system-wide approach to pain management that reduces pain and suffer ing and improves quality of life for Veterans experiencing acute and chronic pain associated with a wi de range of injuries and illnesses, in cluding terminal illn ess. Quality of life is now accepted by the medical fi eld as a standard outcome measure of effectiveness of treatment, including treatment of pain, and includes such fa ctors as level of physical and psychosocial functioning (e.g., in roles at work and home) and treatment satisfaction. However, implementing such a strategy to improve pain management in a large health system proved challenging due to the way health care is organized to manage pain. A new model for the VHA was proposed that emphasizes early, evidence-based biopsychosocial treatment in primary care, supported by pain medicine spec ialty treatment and community support (Gallagher, 2008; Gallagher, 1999). Support for implementing such a model increased with do cumentation of the high rates of pain in returning OIF and OEF veterans entering the VHA (43% in 2007; 52% in 2009 ); the increasing rates of chronic pain (>50%) and increasing pain-related costs an d disability in older Veterans' cohorts, as they accrue risk for dise ases and conditions causing chronic pain; and the high rates of comorbidities, such as PTSD, depression, su bstance abuse and persistent post-concussive syndrome (Kang et al., 2007; Gironda et al., 2006; iderman et et al., 2007; Kerns et al., 2003; Lew et al., 2009). Figure 15: VHA Stepped Pain Care Model FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS PAIN MANAGEMENT TASK FORCE 53 Public On October 28, 2009, the VHA published a Directive (VHA DIRECTIVE 2009- 053; Appendix B-9), which directs the medical treatment facilities and Veterans Integrated Se rvice Network (VISNs - regional health systems) of the VHA to establish an integrated, biops ychosocial Stepped Care Mode l of Pain Management that provides for the care of most pain conditions in the primary care setting. The Biopsycho social Model in pain takes the position that the causes and outcomes of many illnesses, including pain, often involve the interaction of physical and pathophysiologic factors, psychological traits and states, and social-environmental factors (Engel, 1980; Gallagher, 2004). Effective treatment planning accounts for the sali ence of these factors in the precipitation and pe rpetuation of illness and illness-related disability (Gallagher, 1999). This model includes, and is supported by, timely access to secondary consultation and collaborative care from pain medicine and when indicated, mental health, physical medicine and rehabilitation, and other specialties (Dubois, 2009). Access to palliative ca re may ultimately be needed; access to tertiary care advanced diagnostic, medical management and rehabilitation services might also be required for complex cases in volving comorbidities, such as mental health disorders and traumatic br ain injury (Lew et al., 2009). The Pain Task Force believes the pr inciples of Stepped Care apply to the mi litary's pain management challenges, beginning in the field. Evidence from studies of trauma indicates that ea rly and aggressive pain intervention in animal models and in emergency ro om patients reduces the in cidence and morbidity of chronic pain (Gallagher, 2006; Castillo et al., 2005), and experience in the cu rrent OIF and OEF conflict indicates that aggressive pain management in the theatre, after injury, lessens care bur den and stress (Stojadinovic et al., 2008, Buckenmaier et al., 2009). Thus, the military should implement a Stepp ed Care model that incorporates field-based management added to the primary care and secondary and tertiary care consultation model in the medical home. Figure 16: VHA Continuum of Stepped Care FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS PAIN MANAGEMENT TASK FORCE 54 Public Stepped Care is instituted as a strategy to provide a continuum of effective treatment to a population of patients suffering from acute pain caused by injuries or diseases to longitudinal management of chronic pain diseases and disorders that may be expected to persist for more than 90 days, and in some instances, for the patient's lifetime (Dubois, 2009). Components of Stepped Care have been implemented in VA settings fo r several p opulations in primary care including chronic low back pain with and withou t depression and patients wi th chronic pain at risk for substance abuse (Dobscha et al, 20 08; Dobscha et al, 2009; Ang et al., al., 2007; Meghani et al., 2009; Trafton et al., 2010). The challenge for any health care system, including the military and VHA, is the development of standardi zed, cost-effective care through a co mpetent provider workforce and effective health care system support. The First Step in implementing an adapted model of Stepped Care in the MEDCOM and MHS is appropriate Emergency Care and primary care. This call s for embedding the resources to pro vide pain care far forward in the war zone and potentially remote sites where military pers onnel are operating, and transport to medical facilities appropriate for the level of need is contingent. The care de stination might be a field hospital or clinic, and in some cases a tertiary care facility in the Unites States. This requires: 1. The development of competent field-based emergency car e (including behavioral health and primary care provider workforce to manage injur ies and common pain conditions); 2. Consultation with pain medicine with competency in mana ging complexity, severity and risk, as well as other specialties as needed; and 3. Advanced pain medicine diagnosti cs and procedures and severe comorb idities requiring interdisciplinary, intensive pain rehabilitation services, including inpatient settings as required. Recommendation 4.2.4.1 Implement the VHA Stepped Pain Care model. Recommendation 4.2.4.2 Leverage the VHA Directive Action Plan as a template for better coordination between MEDCOM and MHS. 4.2.5 Musculoskeletal Action Plan Objective: Integrate the prevention, early identification, and treatment of injuries as a component of the comprehensive pain management strategy. Effective pain management will require efforts across the vast a nd complex pain continuum. The importance of injury prevention and early intervention efforts to minimize the adverse effects of pain on the Armed Forces is difficult to overstate. The TF recognizes the Musculosk eletal Action Plan (MAP) as another critical piece of a comprehensive pain management strategy. In 2008, there were 2,697,597 medical encounters, including hosp italizations and outpatient visits but excluding any visits to the Battalion Aid Stations. Of tho se, injuries accounted for 30.6% of all medical encounters (n=825,429), more than twice as many encounters as the second le ading cause, mental disorders (n=370,233 or 10.8%). Furthermore, injuries affected 242,478 Soldiers (21.7%), ov er two times more individuals than the second leading diagnosis group, ill-defined signs and symptoms (n= 121, 078) (OTSG Decision Support Cell). According to the Brigade Combat Team Physical Therapy Gui de, six of the top ten reason s for a medical evaluation board are musculoskeletal, wi th the top one being degenerative arthritis. In a deployed setting, musculoskeletal non- battle injuries account for 87% of all com bat injuries. Non-combat related muscul oskeletal injuries are estimated to occur 6.5 to 7 times more frequently than combat related in juries. More than 75% of all med ical evacuations from the FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS PAIN MANAGEMENT TASK FORCE 55 Public OIF and OEF Theater of operations were due to non-combat mu sculoskeletal injuries associated with back, knee, foot, ankle, shoulder, hand, wrist, and neck pain. The typic al Soldier medically evacuated from OIF and OEF was a 29-year-old Soldier in need of additional musculoskeletal care, resulting in a negative impact on operational capabilities. Injuries not only place an enormous dr ain on the medical system, but adversely imp act the operational readiness of the force. Without an increased emphasis on prevent ion, early identification an d management, and proper rehabilitation and reintegration, the Army and DoD will continue to expend enormous amounts of money on Service Members with acute and chronic musculoskeletal injuries and related pain. Leadership within PR&R at OT SG, in collaboration with partners inside and outside of DoD, devel oped the Musculoskeletal Action Plan (MAP). The MAP consists of thre e initiatives: injury prevention, early identification & managem ent, and rehabilitati on & reintegration. Over the course of the last year, the MAP working group developed several products to mitigate the impact of injury on Soldiers. In a move very similar to tha t seen with behavioral health providers, the Army has decided to move physical therapists into the brigade combat teams in order to ensure that injury prevention and treatment capabilities are forward on the battle field. To support the Brigade Co mbat Team Physical Therapists (BCT PT), the group developed the Buildi ng the Soldier Athlete (BSA) program, as well as a reconditioning program designed for Soldiers on profile. In addition, the group developed a BCT PT short course that provides information on how to conduct injury prevention, along with human performance optimization programs and information on how to collect meaningful metrics or outcomes that commanders can use to assess the fitness level of their unit. Other products include development of a functional capacity evaluation that better correlates to the Soldier's military occupational specialty. This is an ongoing project between PR&R and those involved with the disability system. The ongoing Aquatic Pilot progr am standardizes aquatic rehabilitation and Warrior exercise and will provide valuable feedback on pain and function of Soldiers enrolled in these programs as part of their rehabilitation and recovery from injury. The outcome of this program eva luation will determine th e funding required for these programs across the enterprise. Future initiatives include a project wit h Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) on the best utilization of either athletic trainers or the Musculoskeletal Action Team (MAT) to decreas e injuries, optimize performance, and ultimately decrease attrition in initial military training. Another in itiative between Forces Co mmand (FORSCOM) and MEDCOM looks at how augmenting the BCT PT wit h a MAT impacts readiness and depl oyability by decre asing injuries and optimizing performance in garrison, and how that carries over into the deployed environment. The paradigm shift from a disease model health care system to one centered on wellness and prevention is no small matter. It requires hard work and proper resourcing. Without an increased emphasis on prevention, early identification and management, and proper rehabilitation and reintegration, the Army and DoD will continue to expend enormous amounts of money on Service Members with acute and chronic musculoskeletal injuries and related painFINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS PAIN MANAGEMENT TASK FORCE 56 Public Recommendation 4.2.5.1 Develop an education and STRATCOM program focused on musculoskeletal injury prevention and human performance optimization, early identification, and management, rehabilitation, and reintegration.

FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS PAIN MANAGEMENT TASK FORCE 57 Public 4.3 Focus on the Warrior and Family - Sustaining the Force The third objective requires a renewed emphasis on sustaining the Force by focusing on Warrior and Family Member pain care and management. This is at the heart of the wartime medical mission and it must be a primary objective to which all necessary resources are applied. In fact, it's understood in all the other objectives that taking care of the Warrior is the primary mission of military medicine. The organization must serve Active Duty military, their Beneficiaries, and Veterans with acute and chronic pain due to injury through state of the art clinical care, innovative clinical research initiatives, and educational programs. It is easy to make the connection between improving care to Warriors and sustaining the force. However, the connection between improving care for Families and sustaining the force is not as universally understood. Family Members with significant pain management issues can be a constant source of stress and distraction for a Soldier and can interfere with duty performance while at home station or while deployed. Providing improved care to Family Members can be the difference between a Service Member deciding to separate from the military or to reenlist. Healthcare professionals need to monitor and assess ea ch patient for opioid complian ce to ensure the safety and efficacy of the pain treatment. The focus should be on pain relief and improving physical fu nction and quality of life. Regional pain centers of excellence, a standardized pain care approach throughout DoD, and educational programs will improve pain care to Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen, and Marines. Those in the WTU often have complex medical issues, are taking multiple medications, and experience pain management challenges. Embedding or co-locating pain management specialty care and support services and collaborating with the Warrior Transition Command should be priorities. Pain management plans should be incorporated into the Comprehensive Transition Plans. Warrior and Family Care Figure 17: A Summary of Categories for Warrior and Family Care Focus on the Warrior and Family - Sustaining the Force Warrior and Family Care/g120The Safe Use of Opioids /g120Embed Pain and Pharmacy Resources /g120WTC Pain Survey Collaboration 4.3.1 The Safe Use of Opioids Objective: Implement a drug abuse assessment strategy to ensure the efficacy of pain treatment and reduce aberrant behavior, abuse and addiction with opioids. In the early 1980's opioids began to be used in the treatment of nonmalignant chronic pain, not just cancer pain. By the 2000's, increased prescribing, the av ailability of new opioids, and the fail ure to teach about chronic pain and addiction, along with a zeal to do good, created a back drop for the growing problem of prescription drug abuse. The increase in the illegal diversion of prescr iption pain medication is a threat to public and personal health that must not be ignored. It is necessary to take any and all steps to help block the flow of opioid pa inkillers into the hands of nonmedical users, many of whom are yo ung people and first-time abusers. FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS PAIN MANAGEMENT TASK FORCE 58 Public Trauma-induced anxiety, whether conscious or unconscious, is a powerfu l stimulus to seek relief from disturbing memories and often may lead to abuse of drugs and alcohol . The highest risk patients for unsafe behaviors have a \"trio diagnosis\" of psychiatric disease, substance abuse, and pain. These factors ar e interrelated and mutually reinforcing. This often describ es many of our Soldiers returning from Iraq and Afghanistan. In some studies, the prevalence of comorbid PTSD, TBI and pain exceeds 40% in the VA (Clinical Practice Gu ideline for Management of Opioid Therapy for Chronic Pain, 2010). When a trio dia gnosis is present, all three conditions must be treated simultaneously. These patients are complex and need multid isciplinary evaluations. People living with chronic pain have in creased rates of attempted and completed suicides, especially during times of stress and loss. Patients receiving higher doses of prescribed opioids are at increased risk for overdose, which underscores the need for close supervision of these patie nts (Unintentional and unde termined poisoning deaths, 2004). Often patients, especially with a history of impulsivity or medication misuse, will choose to use lethal medication as a means of suicide. Suicides may be caused by poorly treated se vere pain, intentional or unintentional overdose of opioids usually in combinati on with alcohol, benzodiazepine s, or other pain medications. Misuse of opioids may be classified as aberrant behavior, a buse or addiction: 1. A behavior is considered aberrant if it deviates from the accepted medical treatment plan. Forty percent of the general population may exhibit aberra nt behaviors (Webster and Dove, 2007). 2. Abuse is the use of any substance for a non-therapeut ic purpose or the use of medication for purposes other than those for which the agent is pres cribed. Approximately 50% of patient s with at least one aberrant behavior can be classified as abusers (Webster and Dove, 2007). 3. Addiction is a primary chronic neuro biologic disease influ enced by genetic, psychosoc ial and environmental factors. The development of addiction requires a predetermined genetic framework with repeated exposures. This leads to impaired control over drug use, compuls ive drug use, and continued drug use despite harm and because of craving. Only 1-2% of pa tients who abuse opioids are addi cted to the drug and will engage in multiple aberrant behaviors (Webster and Dove, 2007). Failure to treat addiction when it is present can encourage a person to continue destructive and potential ly deadly behavior. Abus e can usually be managed and addiction can usually be predicted. Knowing in advance whether a patient possesses these risk factors can assist a clinician in monitoring the progress of treatment and prevent abuse. The early recognition and treatment of mental disease are vital to the prevention of prescription opioid abuse. However, physicians, nurses, psychologists and others frequently report that they had little formal teach ing about pain and even less teaching about addiction. Training on pa in and addiction is almost non-existent. Medical providers need two sets of skills to use opioids safely and effectively - prescribing opioids and minimizing the risk of abuse. Most problematic opioid use d oes not stem from the disease of addiction but from several other causes including uncontrolled pain, fear of withdrawal symptoms, an untreated mental disorder, or recreational use to achieve a 'high.'

Each patient must be monitored and reassessed at each visit for his or her response to opioid tre atment, including meeting goa ls that are personal to the patient. The focus should be on: /g120Physical function /g120Pain relief /g120Quality of life A full list of safety proposals can be found in Appendix B-10. Figure 19: Increasing the Safe Use of Opioids Early InterventionAppropriate early intervention in the treatment of acute pain, such as physical therapy, will help decrease the need for narcotics. Utilizing physical therapy in troop medical clinics, primary care clinics, and the emergency room will improve the treatment of acute pain and decrease its translation to chronic pain. Research is needed to determine the risk factors that influence this transition from acute to ch ronic pain, such as genetics, environment and behaviors. Screening Complete an assessment of drug-abuse risk in a ll patients on chronic opioids or preferably before initiating opioids. Know ing in advance whether a patient possesses risk factors can assist a clinician in monitoring the progress of treatment. Awareness will result in better clinical outcomes and fewer instances of dru g abuse. The goal is not to deny pain treatment to any patient but to set and maintain a level for monitoring that is proportionate to the individual's risk. Recognize and Treat Substance- use DisordersCurrently, the poor continuity of care is a barrier to identification of problematic drug use. The visibility of patients with aberrant behaviors or previous history needs to be documented longitudinally. The number and pers istence of aberrant behaviors is likely to be indicative of greater probl ems with managing opioid intake. If pain treatment with opioids is to be successful, prescription misuses must be managed. To accomplish this, it is necessary to monitor, chart over time, and address a patent's aberrant drug-related behaviors. Prescription Monitoring ProgramsApproximately seventy percent of DoD prescriptions are now filled in the civilian community (Joint Forces Pharmacy Seminar, 2009). Military Me dical Facilities and VAs should utilize state prescription monitoring programs for additional safety monitoring. DoD needs to encourage states to provide this information to practitioners to help identify high-risk patients, \"doctor shopping ,\" and compliance. Urine Drug Screening Urine drug testing is part of the effort to monitor the clinical efficacy of treatment, determine compliance, evidence of unsafe illicit drug use, and to serve as a deterrent to inappropriate drug taking. An abuser of street drugs is at increased risk for abusing prescription medications. As a clinical monitoring tool, urine drug screenings conf er significant benefits as long as the limitations in interpreting results are well understood. Screening is recommended when aberrant be havior is suspected or co nfirmed, when changes in treatment are being made, and when pain persists despite aggressive treatment. FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS PAIN MANAGEMENT TASK FORCE 60 Public Recommendation 4.3.1.1 Implement a drug abuse assessment strategy in primary care as part of routine practice to set a level of monitoring proportionate to the individual's risk. Recommendation 4.3.1.2 Use a written opioid treatment agreement that outlines patients' rights, expectations, and specifies the consequences of noncompliance, and informed consent for all chronic opioid patients. Recommendation 4.3.1.3 Mandate that only one provider and his or her surrogate may prescribe for patients on chronic daily opioids and that the program is supported by the pharmacy department (Sole Provider Program). Recommendation 4.3.1.4 Mandate that all MTFs and VA Hospitals become active in the state prescription-monitoring programs to facilitate medication reconciliation and the safe prescribing of opioids (standard of care). Recommendation 4.3.1.5 Educate providers on pain and addiction, contraindications to opioid therapy, and the goals of a treatment plan. 4.3.2 Embed Pain and Pharmacy Resources Objective: Provide appropriate pain management and clinical pharmacy oversight in Warrior Transition Units. Pain management is a primary issue for the Warrior Transition Unit patient population. WTU patients often have complex pain issues that require pain specialty consultation and close pharmacologic monitoring. Many of these patients have co- existing disorders, such as PTSD, TBI, depression, insomnia, and substance abuse. Obtaining an appropriate history and understanding the impact of these co-existing disorders is critical to formulating an appropriate treatment plan. Evaluating these patients in close collaboration with the primary care physician allows for a coordinated care plan that can reduce the length of time that a patient is held in the WTU, reduce the risks inherent in fragmented care, and facilitate the early detection of aberrant pain behavior in this high risk population. Embedding pain and pharmacy resources in the WTU on a periodic basis will also lead to improved pain management skills among primary care physicians in the WTU as a result of close collaboration over time. Pain patients who would benefit from interventional pain management or other techniques can be referred directly for that care by the embedded pain physician. WTU patients, especially those with other co-existing disorders (PTSD, TBI, etc), are at higher-than-average risk for adverse outcomes, including accidental overdose and death. Pain is the primary issue for many patients in the WTU. It is critically important to address pain issues quickly, which can in turn facilitate return to duty or transition to the VHA system for care. Embedding pain and pharmacy resources can be expected to result in faster delivery of pain care, early identification of aberrant pain behavior, and reduced length of stay in the WTU. Pharmacists' value to the health care delivery team is evidenced throughout the literature by the wide variety of innovative Medication Therapy Management Services (MTMS) currently being delivered at both local and regional levels. It has been demonstrated that MTMS, appropriately employed, can lead to a reduction in overall health care expenditures through optimizing therapeutic outcomes, reducing adverse medication events and reducing emergency room visits and hospital stays. Medication Therapy Management (MTM) is a partnership of the pharmacist, the patient or their caregiver, and other WTU patients, especially those with other co-existing disorders (PTSD, TBI, etc), are at higher-than-average risk for adverse outcomes, including accidental overdose and deathFINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS PAIN MANAGEMENT TASK FORCE 61 Public health professionals that promotes the safe and effective use of medications and helps patients achieve the targeted outcomes from medication therapy. If a pain physician and a pharmacist were embedded in the WTU on a periodic basis they could see patients referred by primary care physicians. The schedule frequency of working in the WTU would be determined by the number and complexity of patients to be seen. Patients with urgent pain issues that could not wait until the next scheduled WTU pain clinic would be seen in the regular pain clinic. For facilities that do not have a pain medicine subspecialty trained physicia n, a primary care physician or other specialist with an interest in pain and additional training in evaluating pain patients may serve this purpose. That physician should have readily available consultation from a Regional Pain Center of Excellence. MTM encompasses a broad range of professional activities and responsibilities within the licensed pharmacist's scope of practice. These services include, but are not limited to, the following, according to the individual needs of the patient: /g120Performing or obtaining necessary assessments of the patient's health status /g120Formulating a medication treatment plan /g120Selecting, initiating, modifying, or administering medication therapy /g120Monitoring and evaluating the patient's response to therapy, including safety and effectiveness /g120Performing a comprehensive medication review to identify, resolve, and prevent medication-related problems, including adverse drug events /g120Documenting the care delivered and communicating essential information to the patient's other primary care providers /g120Providing verbal education and training designed to enhance patient understanding and appropriate use of their medications /g120Providing information, support services and resources designed to enhance patient adherence with their therapeutic regimens /g120Coordinating and integrating medication therapy management services within the broader health care- management services being provided to the patient Recommendation 4.3.2.1 Provide access to a Pain Management Provider at all WTU clinics. Recommendation 4.3.2.2 Provide a clinical pharmacist capability to all WTUs based on each WTU's individual need for clinical consultation and medication reconciliation. 4.3.3 WTC Pain Survey Collaboration Objective: Collaborate with the Warrior Transition Command to revise the satisfaction survey to incorporate pain metrics. The Army's Medical Holdover (MHO) Satisfaction Survey Progr am began in August 2006. In February 2007, issues at WRAMC resulted in a modificati on and expansion of this survey instrument. In June 2007, the MHO survey transitioned to the WTU Survey, with the goal of providin g current, actionable data to leadership. The survey included questions about the Case Manager, Provider and Platoon Sergeant, as well as detailed questions about Medical Care, the Medical Evaluation Boards (MEB) and Physical Evaluatio n Boards (PEB) process, and living quarters. One of the trends in these surveys has been relat ively low satisfaction amon g the WTs with their \"pain control.\" No other details about pain control or pa in management were available from these surveys. FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS PAIN MANAGEMENT TASK FORCE 62 Public The WTC is revising the WTU survey. Task Force members met with representatives from the WTC and developed some additional questions regarding pain management. These addition al questions (Appendix B-11) will provide WTC leadership and MEDCOM with an incr eased amount of actionable info rmation to improve delivery of pain management services to the Warrior population and will assist the TF with measuring impact of implementation of Task Force recommendations. Recommendation 4.3.3.1 Incorporate recommended Task Force pain questions into the WTU Satisfaction Survey. FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS PAIN MANAGEMENT TASK FORCE 63 Public 4.4 Synchronize a Culture of Pain Awareness, Education, and Proactive Intervention The organization must synchronize a culture of pain awareness, education, and proactive intervention. This requires a unified approach to content, education, and training, as well as leadership and organizational adaption on issues of pain management into the future. Patients and providers do not typically stay in one place for their careers. In the course of receiving their medical care, patients are treated in a variety of clinics and hospitals that cross regional, Service, and network boundaries. Likewise, many providers are as mobile as their patients. To the extent possible, the military should aim to standardize the orientation to and understanding of pain and pain management in order to manage the expectations of patients, providers, and leaders. The resources involved in synchronizing the pain orientation of providers and patients will likely be significant. Realigning existing efforts into one larger and more effective education program under a STRATCOM plan is a logical first step in this process. The likelihood that this would transform the DoD and VHA into a model organization for pain management that influences the practice of medicine, decreases unnecessary suffering, and improves overall readiness makes this a worthy investment. Strong leadership is required to develop a new vision of organizational pain management with new goals. The organization must examine all viable options for improving acute and chronic pain care, implement proven treatment modalities and process changes, measure results - learning from both successes and failures - and communicate the mission's new priorities through the chain of command across the enterprise. A major organizational reset with regards to acute and chronic pain care will require the following: /g120Standardization of pain management capabilities at every level, as well as care from medical education to pain care delivery /g120High level integration and prioritization of pain management recommendations that complement issues identified in other Task Force reports and initiatives /g120Development of an interagency pain management educational campaign that comprehensively addresses pain care issues among a wide variety of stakeholders /g120Establishment of integrated, interdisciplinary and appropriately resourced pain medicine departments across the enterprise /g120Standardization of requirements for Pain Medicine Consultants to the Surgeons General at the highest level /g120Creation of a DoD and VHA central pain management advisory board to drive policy and curricula development, analyze data and coordinate research, as well as inform practice and establish future lines of inquiry to advance the field of pain medicine. The importance of this last recommendation - creation of a central pain management advisory board - cannot be understated. An evidence-based, analytical approach to measuring treatment efficacy that leverages standardized pain assessment tools, patient registries and a wealth of longitudinal patient data, holds the potential to advance pain research and unify pain care well into the 21st century.

Pain management receives very little attention and is i nadequately developed in th e curricula of many U.S. medical and allied health professions schools. TF members met with Dr. Director of Pain Education, Johns Hopkins University Sc hool of Medicine, to discuss curr ent trends in medical school pain curricula. Dr. stated that the typical medical sc hool may provide four ho urs of pain content on the topics of basic pain phy siology, opioids, non-opioid therapies, and back pain. While some of the components necessary for an adequate pain curricu lum are available, the content is seldom organized in a manner that makes it possible for students to successfully integrate th e knowledge acquired in a classroom into clinical practice. There is little evidence that medical scho ols have specific mechanisms to foster competence in providing comprehensive care for patie nts, which includes clinical skills, such as assessing a patient's emotional state. The lack of a congruent approach to pain ma nagement education results in a variation in pain management understanding and practice th at is evident in all of the medi cal professions. The military medical training programs consistently mirror these deficiencies. Health care professional programs at most major medi cal educational and traini ng sites do not include a dedicated pain management curricul um. Many health care professionals ha ve little or no training in pain management and are unable to effectively respond to pa tients' reports of pain. Unde rtreated pain, failure to prevent development of chronic pain, and unsafe use of opioids may lead to: /g120Unnecessary suffering /g120Duplicative or ineffective treatments /g120Increased economic costs or loss of productivity /g120Poor quality of life /g120Development of comorbid di sease such as depression /g120Increased caregiver burden /g120Increased physician visits /g120Costly health care utilization in the form of Emergen cy Room visits, specialty care, and prolonged hospital stays /g120Unintentional death New methods of teaching health care professionals about pain care are req uired to provide the most effective acute pain, chronic pain, and end-of- life pain care to patients. Currently, most clinicians' knowledge about pain assessment and management is derived from clinical experience rather than medical schooling, but effective and standardized treatment requires t hat pain medicine become part of a core curriculum on ch ronic disease. (b) (6)(b) (6)FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS PAIN MANAGEMENT TASK FORCE 65 Public This requires leadership, in cluding deans of medical and other he alth professional schools, directors of residency training programs in specialties and subspecialties that pr ovide primary care, professional societies, and other stakeholders to ensure every trainee and he alth practitioner has the skills to assess and treat pain effectively, including chronic pain. Pain permeates many aspects of patient care and ever y medical discipline including medics, nurses, anesthesiologists, neuro logists, emergency physicians, physiatrists, pediatric and adult primary care providers, pharmacists, psychologists, physical therapists, social workers and others. As health professionals graduate and treat patients of their own, they should know how to assess, diagnose, triage, and treat pain. This education should start in the health pr ofessionals' schools and continue through their post-graduate train ing (residencies and fellowships) into clinical practice with ongo ing, staff educational opportunities. The DoD and VHA are involved in the medical training of many of those providing the pa tient care in DoD and VHA medical facilities. The Uniformed Services University of Health Sciences (USUHS), AMEDD Center and School, and DoD GME programs are responsible for training everyone from combat medics to battlefield surgeons. Upon completi on in 2011, the Medical Education and Training Campus (METC) led by tri-service leadership will c entralize all Army, Navy and Air Force basic and specialty enlisted medical trai ning. The VHA trains health profes sionals in many different specialties, both at undergraduate and post-graduate (GME) levels. These trainees may end up in the VHA, DoD, or civilian sectors as employees. In addition, the VHA routinely develops educational CME programs to advance the medical and clinica l knowledge of their providers. The TF determined that existing DoD-contr olled education and tra ining programs lacked a consistent approach and orientation to teaching our providers about pain. The education curri cula fell short in structuring the didactic content in a manner that allowed the students to inte grate a comprehensive understanding of pain into their clinical practice. One exception noted by the TF was the U.S. Army-Baylor University Doctoral Program in Physical Therapy. This program's cu rricula exemplified several of the concepts recommended by the TF. The Army-Baylor PT program successfully relates the pain -related content in its didactic training (e.g. pathophysiology, anatomy, and pharmacology) to its clini cal practicums. In addition to \"connecting the dots\" for in their pain-related curriculum, the PT do ctoral program placed a special empha sis on patient involvement in the effective management of pain. Synchronizing the pain education and train ing within DoD- and VH A-managed institutions is an essential step in implementing a comp rehensive pain management strategy. The pain-related curricula fo r all of the DoD and VHA education and training programs should be structured to create an enterprise-wide group of providers and staff with a similar vision, orientation, and understanding of pain. This comm on orientation should be reinforced at every level of medical trai ning and at every point on the vast conti nuum of medical care managed by the military and the Veterans Administration. Recommendation 4.4.1.1 Establish a core curriculum specific to pain management to be integrated into all DoD graduate medical education and advanced medical training programs. Recommendation 4.4.1.2 Integrate core pain education and training content into AMEDD training courses (68W, Office Basic Course, Combat Casualty Care Course). Pain permeates many aspects of patient care and every medical discipline including medics, nurses, anesthesiologists, neurologists, emergency physicians, physiatrists, pediatric and adult primary care providers, pharmacists, psychologists, physical therapists, social workers and othersFINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS PAIN MANAGEMENT TASK FORCE 66 Public 4.4.2 Integration of Pain Management Recommendations Objective: Integrate TF recommendations and STRATCOM with other related DoD and VHA programs. The Pain Task Force is only one of the many programs or initiatives undertaken to improve quality of life and maintain readiness of the Armed Forces. Examples of the programs and initiativ es that appear to share a common interest with the Pain TF are: /g120Comprehensive Soldier Fitness /g120Behavioral Health Task Force /g120Army Suicide Prevention Task Force /g120Traumatic Brain Injury Task Force /g120Behavioral Health Campaign Plan /g120Musculoskeletal Action Plan /g120Patient Centered Medical Home The Pain TF invited representatives from these initiativ es to its working meetings and/or consulted with their representatives when developing recommendations. Contin ued collaboration and coordination between these very complementary processes are para mount to reducing duplication of effort, minimizing conflict ing messages, and maximizing effectiveness of the Pain TF recommendations. The Pain TF recognizes the synergy involved in synchroniz ing related messages across a continuum of programs. For example, the Army's Comprehensive Soldier Fitness (C SF) program's mission is to \"develop and institute a holistic fitness program for Soldi ers, Families, and Army civilians in or der to enhance performance and build resilience.\" The Pain TF evaluated pain management along a continuum of care from prevention to early identification and treatment to resolution. Resilience certain ly plays a role in successful pain management, therefore the prevention components in the education and training plans developed for the compre hensive pain management strategy should echo the messages from CSF. The effort to \"connect the dots\" between programs with similar interests should lead to more effective and efficient communication of the respective program messages. Recommendation 4.4.2.1 Develop pain management STRATCOM in collaboration with DoD and VHA programs with related interests. 4.4.3 Pain Education Campaign Plan Objective: Develop a pain management education plan that addresses the full spectrum of stakeholders and issues. The sweeping changes recommended in this report will require the MHS and VHA to undertake an extensive re- education and training initiative for medical staff, patients, leaders, and Family Members. The current variation in orientation, understanding, and practice of pain management throughout DoD and VHA will not easily be corrected. In fact, the TF members have described the required action as essentially performing a massive \"re-boot\" on the military and VHA health care system's orientation to pain management. While certainly a challenge, it is well within the capabilities of these org anizations to make this happen. The first step in this process will require the Uniformed Services and VHA to agree on a series of common core approaches, standards, and messages that will become the key to standardizati on across DoD and VHA. Ideally, the Task Force recommendations will be the template for this strategy. The starting point is the Task Force's goal of FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS PAIN MANAGEMENT TASK FORCE 67 Public providing a standardized Do D and VHA vision and approach to pain management to optimize the care for Warriors and their Families. The core components of the pain management strategy should support, reinforce, and co mplement the existing pain- related strategies and initiatives in DoD and VHA (e.g., Comprehensive Soldier Fitness a nd Army Suicide Prevention Task Force). This will require a complex series of conti nuing coordination and staffing among the Uniformed Services and VHA. Careful attention should be made to ensuring proper \"handoffs\" and continuity of messages and strategies that are related but exter nal to medical commands (e.g. resilience, safety, addiction). Conversely, these non-medical but related initiatives should complement and reinforce the co re messages from the pain strategy. Standardizing the core messages and or ganizational orientation to pain mana gement across DoD and VHA will not only better manage the expectations of patients and staff, but also drive improvements in satisfaction and outcomes. Because of the overwhelming amount of variance in the un derstanding, approach, and practice of pain management across DoD and VHA, the \"re-boot\" necessit ates an aggressive and highly visibl e campaign and education plan. This will require resource-inten sive STRATCOM, marketing, and education efforts that cross all organizations. Again, while efforts are undertaken to reorient and educate medical staff to this strategy and approac h, a simultaneous effort must occur to educate patients, Families and l eaders. This will involve more than dissemination of new policies or presentations and should be given the attention and empha sis commensurate with the seriousness of the issue to DoD and VHA. As organizations implement this new strategy, it will need to be supported and sustained by a robust education and training program. Under th e guidance of a central pain manageme nt advisory board, a curriculum should be developed that addresses the full scope of pain-related education and training needs of patients, staff, Family Members, and leaders. The minimal requirements for the Pai n curriculum are outlined in Figure 21 and a detailed curriculum can be found in Appendix B-12.

While there is variability in pain services between the DoD and VHA health care systems, there is also no consistency in pain management from MTF to MTF. This lack of consistency results in considerable patient and provider frustration and a disruption of pain care plans as the highly mobile patient population mo ves from facility to facility. MTF commanders are given no gu idance on what pain services they s hould be providing or what resources they should be obtaining. Many pain providers believe this lack of a consistent approach to pain care at all levels within the DoD and VHA systems has negatively impacted many Soldier health issues, such as opioid abuse and misuse, patient suicide, PTSD, and TBI, among others. FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS PAIN MANAGEMENT TASK FORCE 69 Public A consistent approach to pain management throughout the continuum of care is vital to the health and safety of the Beneficiary population. This pain po licy must start at point of inju ry, continue throughout t he levels of care, and persist at all Contiguous United States (CONUS) MTFs. The policy must also extend into the VHA and community health systems to enable continuity of care as patients move outside the MHS. To begin the process of developing this consistent approach, issues in battlefiel d pain management should be prioritized. Next, CONUS MTFs should implement a tiered system of pain medicine. In support of the proposed tiered system, each TRICARE region will have at least one Regional Pain Center of Excellence (RPCoE) to serve as the pain consultation center for the regi on. Each RPCoE will work with the central pain management advisory board on coordination of pain care policy amon g TRICARE regions. RPCoE services are outlined in Appendix B-13. The creation of pain departments in MEDCENs will support a coordinated syste m of pain management services, including most of the RPCoE services except the Pain Rehabilitation Center. Tier I and II services are outlined in Figure 23. T he Tier System corresponds to the VHA Stepped Care Model (see section 4.2.4), which conceptualizes the process of care based upon patient need for intensity and ad ditional expertise. By providing a consistent structure linked to the VHA Stepped Care Model, the tiered system will ensure consistent delivery of pain medicine services throughout the DoD and serve as a m odel for integrated pain care in the nation.

This issue is central to the success of all other Task Force recommendations. Change of this magnitude will be difficult but DoD and VHA commitment to and leadership in this endeavor will likely be the benchmark for pain management in the United States for the rest of this century. Recommendation 4.4.4.1 Adopt the tiered system of pain care. Many pain providers believe this lack of a consistent approach to pain care at all levels within the DoD and VHA systems has negatively impacted many Soldier health issues, such as opioid abuse and misuse, patient suicide , PTSD , and TBI , amon g othersFINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS PAIN MANAGEMENT TASK FORCE 70 Public 4.4.5 Interdisciplinary Pain Management Departments Objective: Establish interdisciplinary pain management services to oversee optimum patient-centered, integrated pain care. The field of pain medicine encompasses patients with acute, chronic, cancer-related, and other forms of pain. Pain treatment services are provided by clin icians from various specialties including primary care physicians, anesthesiologists, physical me dicine and rehabilitation physicians, pain medicine subspecialists, neurologists, psychiatrists, psychologists, pharmacists, physical therapists, occupational therapists, complementary and alternative medicine practitioners, and other allied pa in-related specialties. The body of medical knowledge representing the field of pain medicine is beyond the focus of any one of thes e contributing specialties al one. Fragmentation of pain care is common without interd isciplinary collabor ation and care coordination, and was a common theme reported to the Pain Task Force during site surveys. Many sites were attempting to address pain needs in a subset of pain patients throu gh a multidisci plinary pain committee. Such committees typically meet per iodically to review care plans for high risk patients who came to command attention as a result of difficult-to-treat pain, high utilization of health care resources, and/or high risk pain- related behavior. These multidiscipl inary committees serve an important functio n by identifying and tracking high risk patients and making a concerted effort to treat and re fer them appropriately. Many members of these multidisciplinary comm ittees expressed disappointment with the quality of pain care resources available for referrals within their respective TRICARE region. Only a small minority of sites had co-l ocated pain care cl inicians providing interdisciplinary pain care. MEDCENs are tertiary referral medical center s resourced to provide advanced medical services above the services provided at the MTF level. Effective pain management wit hin the MEDCEN requires an interdisciplinary Pain Medicine Service that draws from multiple specialties but is philosophically independen t and works collaboratively to provide integrated pain care. Co-location of these se rvices in an Interdisciplinary Pain Center facilitates better communication and provides optimum patient-centered, integrated pain care. Poorly integrated pain services and fragmentation of care was a primary and consistent finding of the Pain Task Force. The risks inherent in not having pain prov iders co-located includ plans /g120Increased risk that aberrant pain behavior will not be detected in a timely manner /g120Increased risk of losing patients to follow-up /g120Unnecessary variation in care provided /g120Decreased efficiency of pain specialists Individually and collectiv ely, these risks lead to a decreased total nu mber of pain patients treate d within the MEDCEN and an increased overall cost to the MHS. Command leadership must be responsible for ens uring that the Interdiscipli nary Pain Medicine Service is appropriately resourced to meet its vital mission. This requires balancing inter-specialty competition for resources that may arise as the MEDCEN is tasked to meet the dual tertiary medical care and ope rational medical missions inherent in the MHS. The integration afforded by this cons olidation and co-location of pain assets will allow for improved outcomes-based metrics for determining best practices . Development of a co nsistent pain clinical structure will reduce variability between DoD facilities and improve patient transitions into the VHA or community health systems. This approach will improve provider satisfaction, expand outcomes data collection, enhance patient safety and, most importantly, improve patient care and satisfaction. Failure to a ppropriately address and resource these requirements will increase fragmen tation of pain care and risk of adverse outcomes in patients. FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS PAIN MANAGEMENT TASK FORCE 71 Public The TDA for each MTF should re cognize the need fo r pain care appropriate to facility size, with each MEDCEN resourced for an Interdisciplinary Pain Medicine Service. One medical center in each TRICARE region should be designated a TRICARE Regional Pain Center of Exce llence (RPCoE). The RPCoE will represent the fullest expression of the Interdisciplinary Pain Me dicine Service concept (i ncluding co-location of pain care specialists into an Interdisciplinary Pain Medi cine Center), serve as the regional pain consulting activity (Appendix B-13), and provide telemedicine pain support for t he entire TRICARE region. Each RPCoE will coordinate with the central pain management advisory board on DoD- and VHA-wid e pain issues and research activities. Additional resource requirements: /g120Creation of a new Interdisciplinary Pa in Medicine Service within each MEDCEN. /g120Designation of one Interdisci plinary Pain Medicine Service within each TRICARE Region as the RPCoE. /g120Establishing an interdisciplinary pa in committee at each MTF and establishi ng a telemedicine link to that TRICARE region. /g120Standardized cr edentialing. /g120Updated productivity metrics that support the integra ted model for delivery of pain care. /g120Reallocation of personnel and resources to staff pain RPCoE. Recommendation 4.4.5.1 Establish TRICARE Regional Pain Centers of Excellence networked to every MTF in that region. Recommendation 4.4.5.2 Establish an Interdisciplinary Pain Medicine Service at each major DoD MEDCEN. Recommendation 4.4.5.3 Define local capability requirements in establishing the tiered system of pain care delivery. 4.4.6 Pain Medicine Consultants to Military Leadership Objective: Develop requirements for Service pain consultants to reflect an interdisciplinary, integrative approach to pain management. Army, Navy, and Air Force Surgeons General have cons ultants from the wide spectrum of medical specialties to assist them in making informed decisions. MTF commanders rely on subject matter experts within their commands for advice. Most recently, Army and Navy have added the position of Pain Consultant to their respective Surgeons General and the Air Force is considering a similar ad dition to their group of Sur geons General Consultants. The current Army and Navy Pain Consultants are Anesthesiologists and graduates of pain medicine fellowships. The TF recommends transforming pain management in the MEDCO M and MHS into an interd isciplinary and integrated specialty. It is essential to transform the current sele ction criterion of the Service pain consultants to reflect this expanded perspective of pain management. This recommend ation should not be interpreted as an attempt to dilute the qualifications of this essentia l consultant position. Pain Medicine is currently a re cognized medical subspecialt y with board certification throu gh the American Board of Medical Specialties (ABMS). Board certifica tion requires successful comple tion of an Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) inte rdisciplinary pain medic ine fellowship, demonstrated expertise in the evaluation and treatment of acute, chro nic, and cancer pain, and the achie vement of a passing score on the board examination. Although the in tellectual background and clinical practice of pain medi cine is derived from several traditional specialties (e.g., anesthesiolo gy, neurology, psychiatry, Physical Med icine ially restricted to anesthesiolo gists. As a result, these FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS PAIN MANAGEMENT TASK FORCE 72 Public fellowships have traditional ly been focused on training in pain procedu res and the vast majo rity of fellowship-trained specialists are anesth esiologists. The American Board of Pain Med icine (ABPM) was formed in 1993 to provide a standardized credential, and has credentialed more than 2, 000 physicians who now practice pa in medicine. The standar dized credential for pain medicine specialists with ABM S board certification from these other specia lties was based on a broader examination that was more representative of the practice of comprehens ive pain medicine. Begi nning in 2001, ACGME fellowships began opening to Neurologists, Psychiatrists, and Physiatrists. More recently, in recognition of the weaknesses of the current training emphasis on procedur es, fellowships have attempted to become even more comprehensive and integrated in their approach to pain medi cine, despite the limitations of a one-year experience. Recently, at an American Medical Assoc iation-sponsored Summit on Pain Medicine Practice and Training, representatives from all medical specialties reached the co nsensus that training was inad equate and that in order to provide more uniform standards in pain medicine care, training needed to be lengthened to at least two years with eventual development of separate residency training as a specialty. Pain Medicine Consultants shou ld represent the integration concepts identi fied by the TF as critical to the success of pain management. The Pain Medicine Consultant should: /g120Practice comprehensive pain care /g120Have up-to-date knowledge of the expansive field of pain medicine /g120Be involved in and/or knowledgea ble about current pain research /g120Have experience leading an interdisciplinary pain team Completion of a Pain Fellowship is a sign ificant accomplishment in the field of pa in medicine, but it should not be the sole discriminator for pain consultant se lection. The Pain Medicine Consul tant should be Board Certified in their primary medical specialty and be the mo st qualified person for that position. The VHA has established a National Program Director for Pain Management, and a Deputy National Program Director for Pain Management, in the VHA National Pain Management Program Office at the VA's Central Office (similar to the Service Surgeons Generals Offices). Illustrating the diverse nature of the field of pain medicine, the National Program Director is a clinica l Psychologist (PhD) and the Deputy National Program Director is a certified Pain Medicine Specialist by both the ABMS and the ABPM from a background of primary care and Psychiatry (MD). The American Academy of Pain Medicine, American Pain So ciety, and the International Association for the Study of Pain are all examples of large profess ional organizations dedicated to the practice, education, and research of interdisciplinary pain medicine . All of these organizations choose their leadership from a vari ety of the disciplines involved in comprehensive pain medicine. The formation of a Pain Medicine Departm ent (as discussed in Section 4.4.5) will ensure that the comprehensive and interdisciplinary nature of Pain Medicine maintains the ultimate goal of effective patient care. It will encourage Pain Medicine specialists to focus on goals of the Pain Medicine Department a nd not be obligated to the departmental needs of their individual parent specialties. The Chief of each medical facility's Pain Medicine Department will not be from the same specialty, but will be a strong leader in the field of pa in medicine. This variability is secondary to the diverse field of pain medicine but also to the diverse nature of the military. Given the tiered structure of military medical facilities, not every facility will have the same specialties represented. For example, the Chief at one facility might be a fellowship trained interventio nalist while at another facility the Chief might be from Behavioral Health. Recommendation 4.4.6.1 Develop pain medicine consultant selection criteria to identify the candidates who best represent the integrative and comprehensive nature of pain medicine. FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS PAIN MANAGEMENT TASK FORCE 73 Public 4.4.7 Central Pain Manage ment Advisory Board for DoD and VHA Objective: Establish an effective pain management advisory board for DoD and VHA. The scope and magnitude of changes recommended by the DoD Pain Task Force require a central pain management advisory board to ensure effective implemen tation and stewardship of al l pain care improvements throughout the care continuum. The TF identified numerous critical tasks that should be managed by a central pain management advisory board (see Figure 25). The board w ill provide the necessary po licy development, research, and curriculum development to move pain care for all DoD and VHA Beneficiaries forward to a new, more patient- centric level. It will also establish a pain continuum of care from onset of pain (battlefield or at home) through DoD health care centers to VHA centers and the community. The central pain management advisory board will operate as a center of excellence and will provide a \"central point of contact\" for establishing and maintaining pain care clin ical standards, managing pain provider education programs, and providing recommendati ons for pain research priorities. No current DoD program is tasked with this responsibility despite the co rrelation of pain with PTSD, suicide, and other mental and physical health issues identified in virtually every task force report since the beginning of OIF and OEF. Figure 24: Proposed Central Pain Management Advisory Board Structure The Defense and Veterans Pain Management Initiativ e (DVPMI) currently exists as a Congressionally-sponsored program that has historically focused on battlefield anesthesiology-related acute pain issues. Formally known as the Military Advanced Regional Anesthesia & Analgesia (MARAA) program, DVPMI has functioned as a tri-service collaborative group of anesthesia prov iders focused on battlefield pain managem ent. They have spearheaded many recent battlefield advances in pain care, such as the military pain infusion pump, epidurals and continuous peripheral FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS PAIN MANAGEMENT TASK FORCE 74 Public nerve blocks in theater and on military evacuation aircraft, as well as the use of novel battlefield pain infusions such as ketamine. The Pain Task Force recommends that the DVPMI, after expandin g its membership to reflect the interdisciplinary and integrated nature of pain medicine, becomes the DoD and VHA central pain management advisory board. Based on recommendations of the Task Force, the D VPMI will have a greatly expanded mission for the Services and the VHA in representing all medical specialties involved in acut e and chronic pain management for Warriors and other DoD Beneficiaries.

As the Defense Pain Center of Excellence (DPCoE), the DVPMI will be responsible for assessing the effectiveness and safety of pain care. This initiative will seek to improve pa in care communication among health care providers throughout the ca re continuum, particularly as it relates to the control of opioid use and prevention of abuse. The DVPMI will provide a research foundation to stud y how current and future pain care technologies and medications impact Soldiers from battlefield injury to evac uation and throughout recove ry and rehabilitation. The interdisciplinary program will examine the influence of pain on PTSD, Soldier suicide, social re-integration, trauma rehabilitation, disease progression, and other interrelated issues. The DVPMI will provide an administrative structure for a Military Pain Medicine Board of Directors (MPMB D) consisting of Air Force, Army, Navy and VHA senior expert clinicians and researchers experienced in the managem ent of acute and chronic pain. The proposed DVPMI charter is provided in Appendix B-14. Additional resource requirements: /g120The DVPMI will require an annual budget to support its DoD-wide clinical, ed ucational, and research mission. Personnel requirements for the DVPMI are outlined in the DVPMI Charter. DVPMI goals are consistent with establish ed goals of the DCoE. /g120The strategic pain mission of the DVPMI, which encompasses both the DoD and VHA health care systems, necessitates placement of the DVPMI at the level of the MHS. The Services Surgeons General would have to recommend placement of the DVPMI through the Senior Military Medical Advisory Council. /g120Possible \"homes\" for the DVPMI include: Uniforme d Services University; Defense Centers of Excellence, Institute for Surgical Research. Establishing the updated DVPMI will greatly enhance pain care throughout the continuum and help break down inconsistencies in pain care delivery between the Se rvices and MTFs. Partnership with the VHA in pain management will contribute to a seamle ss transition of patients from DoD faciliti es to VA hospitals and back into their community. The DVPMI will reinforce the DoD Medical Services' le adership role in clinical pain management, education, and research and will ensu re that Pain Task Force recommenda tions result in lasting improvements in pain care. The DVPMI will continue to advance the care that DoD Beneficiaries are receiving, ensuring adoption of the latest and best pain management techniques and modalit ies from military and VHA health care facilities. This effort will positively impact all aspects of a patient's care, recovery, rehabilitatio n and return to a productive life. Recommendation 4.4.7.1 Establish the Defense and Veterans Pain Management Initiative (DVPMI) as the DoD and VHA central pain management advisory board for pain medicine issues. Recommendation 4.4.7.2 Task the DVPMI with the responsibility to establish pain care clinical standards, manage pain provider education programs, and provide recommendations for pain research priorities. FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS PAIN MANAGEMENT TASK FORCE 76 Public V. THE WAY AHEAD Pain management has essentially cha nged very little since the discovery of morp hine in 1805. Morphine remains the battlefield pain management standard, de spite identification of significant side effects in the most advanced medical setting, much less a field environment. The military should continue to focus on improving the delivery of pain medicine by increasing the support and investment in research and technology efforts. It is imperative to minimize the current variation in pain management structure, practice, and orientation across the MEDCOM, MHS, and VHA. Overcoming these challenges will require a significant reorganization, education, and training effort that will be most effective if pursued as a part of a DoD and VHA partnership. The Uniformed Services boast an impressive group of pain medicine physicians who receive d training in a variety of pain fellowships and traini ng programs, both inside and outside of the military. These pain subje ct matter expe rts have been integral in ensuring that military pain medicine keeps pace with advances in practice and techno logy. Unfortunately, there are relatively small numbers of these specialists in the MHS therefore demand for their services will likely continue to exc eed supply. In addition to en suring there are continued efforts to grow and retain pain medici ne specialists, the MHS must develop a supporting team of clinicians and staff to assist specialists in addressing the pain management needs of their patients and staff. Pain medicine should be mana ged by integrated care teams which empl oy a biopsychosocial model of care. The standard of care should have objectives to decrease overreliance on me dication driven solutions and create an interdisciplinary appro ach that encourages collaborati on among providers from differing specialties. Efforts should be undertaken to eliminate stove-piping of pain care. The DoD should continue to responsibly explore safe a nd effective use of advanced and non-traditional approaches to pain management, conduct ongoing research, and provide ongoing educat ion for providers and patients. Once integrative medicine approaches to pain have been pilote d and documented as safe, effective, and cost efficient, they should become covered benefits for beneficiaries. There has been a systemic failure to establish pain as a priority beyond the narrow scope of the JC 2001 directive. The MHS and VHA are in a position to exceed the standar d. Leadership must establish pain as a priority, with an urgency that leads to practice changes. The lack of a common understanding of, and orientation to, pain among providers and medical staff prevents a unity of effort, resulting in suboptimal care as well as lost synergies and missed savings. The focus should be on prevention, followed by prompt and appropriate treatment that seeks to relieve acute pain and eliminate progression to chronic pain when possible. The MHS can ne ver keep up with the demand for specialty pain care unless it optimizes the pa in management in primary care. Although there are many reco mmendations specifically targeting pain, the TF is convinced that one of most effective ways to improve pain management care and outcomes would be to improve he alth care delive ry in the primary care setting. The medical home model allows for improvements in primary care, diagnosis and treatment management, early identification of injuries and disea se, rapid and appropriate follow up, and specialty referrals. The VHA Stepped Care model should be adapted for use in DoD. Pain management has essentially changed very little since the discovery of morphine in 1805, and morphine remains the battlefield pain management standard, despite identification of significant side effects in the most advanced medical setting, much less a field environmentFINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS PAIN MANAGEMENT TASK FORCE 77 Public Finally, the TF believes mu ltiple synergies can be realized with the in corporation of a joint DoD and VHA strategy. Warriors and Beneficiaries need and deserve a unity of effort across MHS and VHA. A synergistic approach provides for practice improvement and outcome management re search, which uses data to inform best practices and create the next generation of clinic al practice guidelines. With this approach, there is no Army, Navy, or Air Force pain. Including the VHA in this strategy is esse ntial and obvious. In addition to t he number of MHS patients who eventually qualify and elect to receive care at VA facilities, there are many active duty Service Members who are in and out of the VHA system prior to separating from the military. The two organizations should cooperate and share common educational materials, venues, protocols, and formularie s. A common standard would demonstrate the power of a unified effort and expedite ac hievement of the common goal: providing a standardized DoD and VHA vision and approach to pain management to optimiz e the care for Warriors and their Families . This goal can be realized.PublicAPPENDICES APPENDICES PAIN MANAGEMENT TASK FORCE A-1 Public Appendix A: Task Force Recommendations 4.1 Provide Tools and Infrastructure that Support and Encourage Research Advancements in Pain Management Standards and System Improvements 4.1.1 Standardized Pain Taxonomy Establish common pain taxonomy across the DoD and VHA. 4.1.1.1 Establish a uniform understan ding and use of key pain-related terms in the vocabulary of the DoD and VHA health care systems. 4.1.1.2 Identify a process to Review, Revise, and Approve Do D and VHA definitions for pain, acute pain, and chronic pain. 4.1.1.3 Integrate DoD and VHA defin itions for pain, acute pain, and chr onic pain into existing training, policies and regulation s, and standards throug hout DoD and VHA. 4.1.2 Standardized Pain Assessment Tool Describe a common language DoD and VHA pain assessment tool with visua l cues and a common set of measurement questions. 4.1.2.1 Review and approve the new Do D and VHA common Pain Assessme nt Tool validation plan. 4.1.2.2 Validate Pain Assessment Tool in DoD and VHA facilities. 4.1.2.3 Integrate the Pain Assessment Tool, upon validation, into training, clinical practice, and data collection of pain ma nagement in DoD and VHA. 4.1.3 Pain Management Survey Establish a common baseline of pain ca re capabilities across DoD and VHA by creating a modified version of the 2009 VHA Pain Management Survey to distribute to all DoD MTFs. 4.1.3.1 Administer a modified VHA pain survey across Do D MTFs to establish a baseline of pain care capabilities. 4.1.3.2 Continue to periodically ad minister the survey to track improvements at DoD MTFs to ensure a standardized measurement of pain longitudinally a nd across organizations.

APPENDICES PAIN MANAGEMENT TASK FORCE A-12 Public Appendix B: Supplement to Findings and Recommendations B-1 Standardized Pain Taxonomy Figure B-1.1: Pain Definitions PainPain is an unpleasant sensory and emotional experien ce associated with actual or potential tissue damage or described in terms of such damage. Pain is always subjective. Pain can be acute or chronic. Acute Pain Acute pain is a normal physiologic response, usu ally time-limited, to a noxious stimulus that enhances survival by warning the individu al of impending or potential injury or progression of disease. If the noxious stimulus persi sts, changes in the peripheral tissues and both the central and peripheral nervous systems can lead to sensitization that worsens and prolongs the pain from no xious stimulation. Appropriate management of acute pain may prevent the onset of the pathophysiolo gic processes that change the spinal cord and brain and lead to chronic pain. Chronic Pain Chronic pain continues beyond the normal ti me expected for healing and is associated with the onset of pathophysiologic changes in the central nervous system that may adversely affect an individual's emotional and physical well-being, cognition, level of function, and quality of life. Chronic pain serves no appa rent useful purpose for the individual and may be diagnostically and therapeutically a pproached as a chronic disease process. Figure B-1.2: Extended Taxonomy List AddictionAddiction in the context of pain treatment wit h opioids is characterized by a persistent pattern of dysfunctional opioid use that may involve any or all of the following: /g120Loss of control over the use of opioids. /g120Preoccupation with obtaining opioids, despite the presence of adequate analgesia. /g120Continued use despite physical, psycholog ical, or social adverse consequences. CentralCentral pain is a result of a primary lesion or dysfunction in the central nervous system (brain or spinal cord). Examples include pain from stroke, spinal cord injury, multiple sclerosis, or fibromyalgia. DependencePhysical dependence on an opioid is a physiolo gic state in which abr upt cessation of the opioid, rapid tapering (e.g. when a patient forgets to take th e medication), or administration of an opioid antagonist results in a withdrawal syndrome. Physi cal dependency on opioids is an expected occurrence in all individuals in the presence of continuous use of opioids for therapeutic or for non-therapeutic purposes. It does not, in and of itself, imply addiction. NeuropathicNeuropathic pain is a result of a primary lesi on or dysfunction in the peripheral and/or central nervous system(s). Symptoms may include numbness, tingling, burning, sharp, shooting, and/or aching. (continued on next page) APPENDICES PAIN MANAGEMENT TASK FORCE A-13 Public PeripheralPeripheral pain is a result of a primary lesi on or dysfunction in the peripheral nervous system (peripheral nerves - nerves outside the brain or spinal cord). Examples include direct nerve trauma, post herpetic neuralgia, carpal tunnel syndrome, or diabetic neuropathy. Phantom Phantom pain may be categorized as phanto m pain or phantom se nsations. Phantom pain is experienced as pain, tinglin g, itching, or numbness in the place where the amputated part used to be. Phantom sensation is the feeling that the amputated part is still there, but the sensations felt in the amputated part ar e not uncomfortable or painful for the individual. PseudoaddictionPseudoaddiction describes patient behaviors that may occur when pain is undertreated. Patients with unrelieved pain may become focused on obtaini ng medications, may \"clock watch,\" and may otherwise seem inappropriately \"drug seeking.\" Even behaviors, such as illicit drug use and deception, can occur in th e patient's efforts to obtain relief. In contrast to true addiction, in pseudoaddiction, the beha viors resolve when t he pain is effectively treated. Misunderstanding of this phenomenon may lead th e clinician to ina ppropriately stigmatize the patient with the label 'addict.' In the setting of unrelieved pain, the request for increases in drug dose requires careful assessment, renewed efforts to manage pain, and avoidance of stigmatizing labels. Pseudotolerance Pseudotolerance is defined as a need to increase dosage due to factors other than tolerance (a diagnosis of exclusi on), such as disease progression, new disease process, increased physical activity, lack of compliance, change in medi cation, drug interaction, or deviant behavior. RadicularRadicular pain is radiating pain and parest hesias (neuropathic pain) in the distribution of a specific nerve root. It may be associated with sensory loss or motor dysfunction in the distribution of the same nerve and paraspinal muscle spasms. ReferredReferred pain is pain that is felt at a locatio n different than that of the injured or diseased part. The area where the pain is felt is us ually innervated from the same spinal segment as that of the injured or diseased structure. Exam ples include angina (f elt as left shoulder, arm, or jaw) or gallbladder (fel t as right shoulder pain). SomaticSomatic pain is a well localized pain (\"pin point\") which results from activation of nociceptors located in the skin, deep soft tiss ues, muscles, bones, and joints. This pain is often described as aching or nagging and examples include pain associated with bruises, fractures, or wounds. ToleranceTolerance is a form of neuroadaptation to the effects of chronically administered opioids (or other medications), which is manifested by the need for increasing or more frequent doses of the medication to achieve the initial effect s of the drug. Tolerance may occur both to the analgesic effects of opio ids and to some of the unwanted adverse effects, such as respiratory depression, sedation, or nausea. The appearance of tolerance is variable in occurrence, but it does not, in and of itself, imply addiction. VisceralVisceral pain is a poorly lo calized pain which results from ac tivation of nociceptors located in the thoracic, abdomina l, or pelvic viscera. This pain is usually poorly localized aching or cramping, which may be referred to cutaneous sites, increasing the difficulty of localization.

Sample A total of 400 patients would be a good target. Eligibility criteria should in clude: 1) ability to read and understand English, 2) newly combat injured Soldiers, 3) older Veterans who have military-related injuries or other pain issues (e.g., chronic nonmalignant pain including a range of conditio ns [e.g., lower extremity arthritis, non-specific LBP], cancer-related pain, post-surgical pain, and ot her acute pain), 4) inpatients, and 5) outpatients. The sample should in clude a balance of those with acute pa in and chronic pain and inpatient and outpatients. Of these patients, every 10th patient should be asked to parti cipate in the descriptor validation (need about 40). 2. Setting Walter Reed Army Medical Center and selected VA Me dical Centers (if willing to participate). 3. Design Cross sectional, one-time pain assessment. Patients will be asked to complete the DoD and VHA Pain Assessment Tool and the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) 7 interference items. Items 1, 2, and 4 are duplicative of the BPI. Written instructions on completing the tools shou ld be provided to participants. Every 10th patient (forms should be numbered) should be given the DoD and VHA pain intensity scale without the descriptors and be asked to select the number corresponding to their pain, and then match scrambled de scriptors to the numbers. 4. Demographic Data Age, gender, ethnicity, war veteran (e.g., OIF / OEF, Gulf War, Korean War, WWII), military status (e.g., active duty, retried, honorable disc harge), type of pain (acute, chronic), can cer-related pain, inpatient vs. outpatient, length of hospitalization at the time of the interview, and dur ation of pain, as well as occupational status and marital status. 5. Statistical Analyses Measures of central tendency (mean, median and mode ) will be calculated for subgroups (e.g., acute pain, chronic nonmalignant pain , cancer-related pain, newly injured OIF and OEF, inpatient vs. outpatient. Correlational statistics will be use d to demonstrate the magnitude of the relation between the mean BPI interference subscale score and pain intensity for the entire sample and selected var iables. Independent rater content validation methods (qualitative analysis) will be used to validate the ability for respondents to correctly match the intensity descriptors to the pain intensity rating or Adult Faces Rating Scale. APPENDICES PAIN MANAGEMENT TASK FORCE A-18 Public B-3 Joint Theater Trauma System Clinical Practice Guideline 1. Goal Provide standardization of pain care for Wounded Warriors evacuating from Level III facilities. Establishment of a physician pain consultant at all Level III facilities in Theater. 2. Background The physiologic response to battlefield trauma and surgery involves a \"s ympathetic surge\" or stress response. The stress response involves a well- established sequence of physiologic and molecular events that include fever, tachycardia, tachypnea, hypertension, gastrointestinal ileus, hypercoagulability, protein catabolism, and immunosuppression, among other undesirable conseq uences that delay or prevent a Wounded Warrior's full rehabilitation and recovery. Effective pain management requires coordination of all medical providers throughout the evacuation system to provide a multimodal approach to analgesia. The mu ltimodal approach to analgesia involves using several different drug mechanisms of action and pain technologies which facili tates dose reductions of all pain medications used and theref ore increases patient safety.3 This approach to pain care requires the establishment of an Acute Pain Service (APS) at all Level III (and above) health care facilities directed by a physician trained in pain management. 3. Evaluation and Treatment A. The Level III facility Commander will appoint a physician (usually an anesthesiologist) to head the facility APS who is trained in pain management. This officer is resp onsible for managing APS activities, delegation of APS responsibilities, and maintenance of APS equipment. The APS physician will serve as the Commander's consultant on all facility issues related to pain management. B. All patients should have their pain assessed upon arrival and reassessed frequently using the DoD and VHA Pain Assessment Screen Tool. C. All patients should have a pain care pl an established as part of their routine care. D. The patient's primary physician should consult the guidelines when develo ping a pharmacologic plan for managing pain. E. The patient's primary physician should consult the AP S for complex pain issues or when advanced pain care technology or procedures are ind icated (e.g. continuous peripheral nerve block, epidurals, pain drug infusions). F. Pain nursing is a vital component of every APS. Each health care facility patie nt ward will assign a member of the nursing staff to service as the ward pain nurse. The ward pain nurse will coordinate with the APS physician on all ward pa in related issues. G. Effective pain management using multimodal tech niques should not inhibit the timely diagnosis of compartment syndrome. In the case of combat trauma patients, if the surgeon is concerned about the possibility of compartment syndrome co mplicating a wound, the compartmen t should be surgically opened. The APS will work with the patient's primary physici an to develop a pain ma nagement plan that facilitates early recognition of compartment syndrome. There is no evidence that supports the exclusion of any pain management technique due to co ncerns of compartment syndrome. APPENDICES PAIN MANAGEMENT TASK FORCE A-19 Public H. Use of advanced pain manage ment techniques should be encourag ed, including, but not limited to, continuous peripheral nerve block, ep idurals, pain medication infusions, and patient contr olled analgesia. The APS physician is responsible for coordinating pati ent pain care issues and plans with the evacuation flight surgeon and receiving APS physician at the next receiving health care facility. Documentation of all advanced patient pain care techniques into t he patient's electronic medi cal record is mandatory. I. The Military Advanced Regional Anest hesia and Analgesia handbook will serve as the APS reference text for pain care standards and issues ( www.bordeninstitute.army.mil or www.DVPMI.org ). J. Tri-service policies for pain management can be found at www.DVPMI.org . Strategic issues on evacuation pain management should be referred by the health care facility APS physician to the Defense and Veterans Pain Management Initiative organization ( www.DVPMI.org ). 4. Responsibilities The health care facility Commander is responsible for est ablishing the APS and effective patient pain care services. APPENDICES PAIN MANAGEMENT TASK FORCE A-20 Public B-4 Electronic Pain Order Set Pain Medication Orders 1. PURPOSE To provide established guid elines for the safe and effectiv e administration of pain medications at WRAMC and to educate and remind physicians and nu rses of the appropriate pharmacologica l interventions to best manage the different types and levels of pain. Upon completion of the order set, the physician will have created an effective plan for each individual and particu lar patient. This app endix is meant to accompan y and not override any previous guidelines on medi cation administration and do es not preclude the use of clinical judgment when ordering pain medications. 2. APPLICABILITY This is applicable to all providers orderi ng and administering medications at WRAMC. 3. RESPONSIBILITIES A. Physician: 1) Identify candidates for Pain Medications. Respons ibility lies with the attending physician. 2) Complete orders. 3) Evaluate orders every 72 hours to determine if changes are necessary. 4) Counsel patient and family or significant others on the purpose of the medication. B. Registered Nurses: 1) Provide patient education for sel ected patients using established patient teaching guidelines and document accordingly. 2) Initiate, maintain, change, and disc ontinue the medication therapy according to physician orders. C. Pharmacy Service: 3) Provide educational resources for pati ents, Families, and he alth care providers. 4) Ensure proper accountability, procurement, and wastag e of pain medications, including providing a mechanism to restrict me dications for individuals de signated as using pain medi cations inappropriately. 5) Alert physicians and providers to potentia l drug-drug and drug-food interactions. 6) Ensure appropriate analgesics, incl uding opioids, are maintained on nursing units/wards, as required. 7) Monitor physician orders to ensure that only one lo ng-acting or delayed rele ase opioid is prescribed at one time and the use of meperidine (Demerol) is lim ited and appropriate (precautions about meperidine are necessary due to the toxic central nervous system effects of its active metabolite, normeperidine). 4. PROCEDURE A. Opioids Orders for Surgical or Injury Site Pain / Breakthrough Pain Orders Physicians should consider these re commendations for the initial pain management for all routine inpatients. For the purposes of this document, mild pain is considered to be a visual analogue scale (VAS - zero = no pain; 10 = worst pain imagined) score of 1-4, moderate pain is a VAS of 5-7, and severe pain is a VAS of 8- 10.

Purpose During the course of Operations E nduring Freedom and Iraqi Freedom (OEF and OIF), many Service Members have been severely wounded. Pain management for the severely Wounded Wa rriors has been a challenge. However, the military anesthesiology community developed regional anesthesia techniques that have revolutionized pain management of the Wounded Warriors. These regional anesthesia techniques require close management at all times, whether the patient is in a ho spital bed or being transporte d to another hospital. This appendix to the Theater Integration CONOPS descri bes requirements for a Regional Anesthesia Tracking System to allow for the required monitor ing of Wounded Warriors who are benefit ing from the advanced regional anesthesia pain management techniques. 2. Current Status The Army anesthesia specialists recognized the need to closely monitor Wounded Warriors who were receiving specialized regional anesthesia for pain control, es pecially during transportation. Therefore, they developed a Regional Anesthesia Tracking System (RATS) to monitor region al anesthesia patients as they traveled through the military health care system. RATS is a small, ad hoc information system. It allows medical providers to document pain management notes on a central server and notify receiving providers concerning patients with regional anesthesia that are being transported. RATS is a stand-alone system. It does not connect to or share data with any of the Military Health System (MHS) electronic health record systems, such as the Theater Medical Data Store (TMDS) or AHLTA. The anesthesia community has recognized the importance of the data collected in RATS. They have requested that RATS functionality be incorporated into a MHS electronic health record system. 3. Planned Improvements This Appendix includes requirements for incorporatin g the RATS functionality into TMDS. When included in TMDS, it will be renamed JRATS. 4. Scenario . A. An airman working at a Forward Operating Base (FOB) is in jured during a blast caused by a mortar round. The blast severs the airman's left leg at his knee leve l. The airman is quickly stabilized at the scene and evacuated to the local Expedi tionary Medical Supp ort (EMEDS) hospital. B. Surgeons at the EMEDS stop the bleeding and st abilize the wound. While in the Operating Room, the anesthesiologist installs a Co ntinuous Peripheral Nerve Block (CPNB) catheter in the left leg to stop the pain from the traumatic amputation. The CPNB is connected to a Patient Controlled Bolus (PCB) device so that when the airman begins to feel pain, he can add more medication to the CPNB. C. After the surgery and installation of the CPNB, the ane sthesiologist logs on to JR ATS. The anesthesiologist searches for the airman in JRATS using the airman's last name and Social Security Number (SSN). After finding the airman, the anesthes iologist completes a Peripheral Nerve Block Procedure note. D. The EMEDS surgeon determines the airman needs to be evacuated to Landstuhl Regional Medical Center (LRMC) for more definitive treatment. The evacuation clerk logs on to TRAC2ES and completes a Patient Movement Request (PMR). In a few hours, the EMDS surgeon learns (through TRAC2ES) the airman will be evacuated in two days. APPENDICES PAIN MANAGEMENT TASK FORCE A-25 Public E. The next day, after evaluating the airman's condition, the anesthesiologist determi nes the pain is well controlled with the CPNB. The anest hesiologist then logs in to JRATS, finds the airman's record and documents a Clinical Note. When the anesthesiologist opens the Clinical Note, information from the anesthesiologist's procedure note is \"copy forwarded\" into the Clinical Note. The anesthesiologist completes the clinical note with any changes to the airman's status. F. On the day of the airman's evacuation, the anesthesiologist logs on to JRATS, finds the airman's record and documents a Transfer Note. When the anesthesiologist op ens the Transfer Note, the previous day's Clinical Note is \"copy forwarded\" into the Transfer Note. The anesthes iologist documents an y changes in the Transfer Note. Within the Transfer Note, the surgeon cl icks the \"New Location\" button which populates the Transfer Note with the airman's receiving location (LRMC). The \"New Location \" button also triggers an email to be sent to the LRMC Pain Management Team notif ying them of the impendin g arrival of the airman with advanced pain management technologies on board. G. The designated member of the LRMC Pain Mana gement Team logs on to JRATS, finds the airman's record, and reviews the pain management notes entered by the EMEDS anesthesiologist and su rgeon. LRMC Pain Management Team uses the JRATS pain management note s to prepare for continuing care for the airman. H. After evaluating the airman at LRMC, the LRMC sur geon determines the airman needs to go to Walter Reed Army Medical Center (WRAMC) for further treatment an d rehabilitation. The LR MC surgeon and Pain Management Team further determine the CPNB s hould remain during transport of the patient. I. The LRMC anesthesiologist logs on to JRATS, finds t he airman's record and documents a Transfer Note. When the LRMC Pain Management Team clicks the \"New Location\" button, an email is sent to the WRAMC Pain Management Team alerting them to the airman's impending arrival. J. The designated member of the WRAMC Pain Man agement Team logs on to JRATS, finds the airman's record, and reviews the pain management notes. The pain management not es assist the WRAMC Pain Management Team to prepare for continuing care for the airman. K. Two days after arriving at WRAMC, the surgeon determi nes the CPNB can be disco ntinued. When the Pain Management Team member discontinues the CPNB, a clinical note is documented in JRATS with this information. L. The WRAMC surgeon determines the airman shoul d be transferred to a VA Poly Trauma Center for rehabilitative care. The receiving VHA provider is able to view (v ia Bidirectional Health Information Exchange) all of the theater notes documented on the airman, including the pain management notes entered through JRATS. Using these notes, the VHA provi der is able to establish a continuing pain management plan during the airman's rehabilitation. 5.

Each patient has an ongoing relationship with a personal physician trained to provide first contact, continuous and comprehensive care. 2. The personal physician leads a team of individuals, at the practice level, who collectively take responsibility for the ongoing care of patients. 3. The personal physician is responsible for providing for all of the patient's health care needs or taking responsibility for appropriately arranging care with other qualified professionals. This includes care for all stages of pain care: preventive care, acute care, chronic care, and end of life care. 4. Care is coordinated and/or integrated across all elements of the complex health care system (e.g., subspecialty care, hospitals, home health agencies, nursing homes) and the patient's community (e.g., family, public and private community-based services). Care is facilitated by registries, information technology, health information exchange and other means to assure that patients get the indicated care in a culturally and linguistically appropriate manner when and where they want and need it. 5. Enhanced access to care is available through systems such as open scheduling, expanded hours and new options for communication between patients, their personal physician, and practice staff. 6. Quality and safety are hallmarks of the medical home: A. Practices advocate for their patients to support the attainment of optimal, patient-centered outcomes that are defined by a care planning process driven by a compassionate, robust partnership between physicians, patients, and the patient's Family. B. Evidence-based medicine and clinical decision-support tools guide decision making. C. Physicians in the practice accept accountability for continuous quality improvement through voluntary engagement in performance measurement and improvement. D. Patients actively participate in decision-making and feedback is sought to ensure patients' expectations are being met. E. Information technology is utilized appropriately to support optimal patient care, performance measurement, patient education, and enhanced communication. F. Practices go through a voluntary recognition process by an appropriate non-governmental entity to demonstrate that they have the capabilities to provide patient centered services consistent with the medical home model. G. Patients and Families participate in quality improvement activities at the practice level. 7. Assessment of practice success appropriately recognizes the added value provided to patients who have a patient- centered medical home. The productivity metric structure should encompass the following in its framework: A. Reflect the value of physician and non-physician staff patient-centered care management work that falls outside of the face-to-face visit. B. Account for services associated with coordination of care both within a given practice and between consultants, ancillary providers, and community resources. C.Support adoption and use of health information technology for quality improvement. D. Support provision of enhanced communication access, such as secure e-mail and telephone consultation. E. Recognize the value of physician work associated with remote monitoring of clinical data using technology. F. Recognize case mix differences in the patient population being treated within the practice. G. Recognize and quantify savings from reduced hospitalizations and emergency services associated with physician-guided care management in the office setting. H. Recognize and reward achieving measurable and continuous quality improvements. APPENDICES PAIN MANAGEMENT TASK FORCE A-29 Public B-9 Stepped Care Model and VHA Directive VHA DIRECTIVE 2009-053 Pain Management 1. PURPOSE This Veterans Health Administration (VH A) Directive provides policy and implementation procedures for the improvement of pain management consistent with the VHA National Pain Management Strategy and compliance with generally accepted pain management standards of care. 2. BACKGROUND A. The VHA National Pain Management Strategy, initiat ed November 12, 1998, established Pain Management as a national priority. The overall objective of the na tional strategy is to deve lop a comprehensive, multicultural, integrated, system-wide approach to pain management that reduces pain and suffering and improves quality of life for Veterans experiencing ac ute and chronic pain associ ated with a wide range of injuries and illnesses, including terminal illne ss. VHA employs a stepped-care model of pain care that provides for management of most pain conditions in the prima ry care setting. This is supported by timely access to secondary consulta tion from pain medicine , behavioral health, physical medicine and rehabilitation, specialty co nsultation, and care by coordination with palliative care, tertiary care, advanced diagnostic and medical management, and rehabilitation services for complex cases involving comorbidities such as mental health disorders an d traumatic brain injury (TBI). B. Definitions 1)Stepped Care. Stepped care is instituted as a strategy to pr ovide a continuum of effective treatment to a population of patients from acute pain caused by in juries or diseases to long itudinal management of chronic pain diseases and disord ers that may be expected to persist for more than 90 days, and in some instances, the patient's lifetime. i. Step One, Primary Care. Requires the development of a competent primary care provider workforce (including behavioral health ) to manage common pa in conditions. To accomplish this, primary care requires the availability of system supports, family and patient education programs, collaboration with integrative ment al health-primary care teams, a nd post-deployment programs. ii. Step Two, Secondary Consultation. Requires timely access to specialty consultation in pain medicine, physical medicine and re habilitation, Polytrau ma programs and teams, and pain psychology; occasional short-term co-management; inpatient pa in medicine con sultation; and the collaboration of pain medici ne and palliative care teams. iii. Step Three, Tertiary, Interdisciplinary Care. Requires advanced pain medicine diagnostics and pain rehabilitation programs accredited by th e Commission on Accredit ation of Rehabilitation Facilities (CARF). 2)Quality of Life. Quality of life is now accepted by the medica l field as a standard outcome measure of effectiveness of treatment, including treatment of pain . The concept includes such factors as level of physical and psychosocial functioning (e.g., in roles at work and home) and treatment satisfaction. 3)The Biopsychosocial Model. The Biopsychosocial Model takes the position that the causes and outcomes of many illnesses often involve the inter action of physical and pathophysiologic factors, psychological traits and states, and social-environm ental factors. Effective treatment planning accounts for the salience of these factors in the precipitation and perpetuation of illne ss and illness-related disability. APPENDICES PAIN MANAGEMENT TASK FORCE A-30 Public 4)VHA National Pain Management Strategy Coordinating Committee. The VHA National Pain Management Strategy Coordinating Committee, a mu ltidisciplinary Field Advisory Committee, was established to support the National Pain Manageme nt Program Office in meetin g its responsibilities. The Committee is comprised of representatives from key clinical disciplines involved in provision of quality pain care as well as representatives from other VHA offices, including, but not limited to, the Employee Education System (EES), Office of Research and Development (ORD), Mental Health, Geriatrics and Extended Care, Primary Care , Nursing, Rehabilitation , and Pharmacy Benefits Management. C. Specific Objectives The updated VHA National Pain Management Strategy aims to: 1) Establish expectations for a ttitudes, knowledge, and skills in pain management in primary, secondary, and tertiary care. 2) Create system-wide VHA care standards for pain ma nagement, appropriate to setting and professional roles that reduces suffering a nd improves quality of life. 3) Ensure that pain assessment is performed in an appropriately timely, reg ular, and consistent manner along the continuum of care from acute to chronic pain in all VHA settings. 4) Ensure that pain treatment is prompt and strives to achieve pain management objectives along the continuum of care from acute to chronic pain in all VHA settings. 5) Include patients and families as acti ve participants in pain management. 6) Provide for appropriate level a nd frequency of monitoring for impro vement in outcomes of pain management including pain control, phys ical and psychosocial function , quality of life, and complications. 7) Provide for an interdisciplinary, multimodal approach to pain management that emphasizes optimal pain control, improved function, and quality of life. 3. POLICY It is VHA policy that VHA's National Pain Management Stra tegy and the on-going work of the VHA National Pain Management Program Office and Coordi nating Committee is to be used to guide the development of local policies related to pain management. 4. ACTION A. VHA National Pain Management Program Office.

This plan evaluates the effectiveness of the VHA in meeting the objectives of the Strategy; it includes working with the appropriate VHA offices to establish target goals, mechanisms for accountab ility, and a timeline for implementation for a comprehensive, integrated VHA National Pain Management Strategy. APPENDICES PAIN MANAGEMENT TASK FORCE A-31 Public 3) Coordinating the de velopment and dissemi nation of state-of-the-art treatment protocols for pain management that are appropriate for different facility types (e.g., neuropsychiatry facility, teaching facility, and community based outpatient clinic). 4) Identifying VHA pain manage ment expertise and resources at each facility and VISN. 5) Facilitating a national and regional referral s ystem to ensure that all eligible Veterans have timely and appropriate access to pain management services. 6) Collaborating with the EES, Primary Care Program Office, and the several other relevant program offices, as appropriate, to develop, implement, and disseminate education and training tools to assist VHA clinicians in acquiring t he skills necessary to provide high -quality pain assessment and treatment. This includes funding to: i. Establish performance expectations; ii. Develop facility and VISN self-assessment tools; iii. Develop effective educational programs and tools including distance learning; iv. Evaluate the performance of these programs an d tools in improving clinical care; and v. Establish feedback mechanisms for clinical improvement. 7) Collaborating with ORD in identifying pain rese arch opportunities and priorities and facilitating collaborative research efforts. 8) Collaborating with the Office of Acade mic Affiliations in assessing the current state of pain management education in health professional train ing programs (\"gap analysis\") and in exploring the development of innovative educational interventions for enhancing pain management. 9) Establishing a plan for both B. Veterans Integrated Service Network (VISN) Director. The VISN Director is responsib le for ensuring that: 1) All facilities within the VISN estab lish and implement current pai n management policies consistent with this Directive. 2) A pain management Point of Contact (POC) is appo inted and supported at the VISN level who is an appropriately trained and experienced clinician credentialed in pain medic ine, pain management, or another credential appropriate to the clinical discipline. 3) Tertiary interdisciplinary pain care services are availa ble at the VISN level that include the capacity for advanced diagnostics and advanced integrated and int erventional pain medicine, as well as functional rehabilitation for complex cases (e.g., chronic pain wi th comorbidities, such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), TBI, and substance abuse). NOTE: Each VISN is expected to have at least one CARF-accredited tertiary, interdisciplinary pain ca re program no later than September 30, 2014. 4) The implementation of the VHA Pain Manageme nt Strategy is evaluated a ccording to performance measures established by the National Pain Management Program Office. C. VISN POC.

FOLLOW-UP RESPONSIBILITY The Office of Patient Care Services (11), Medical-Surgic al Services (111) is responsible for the contents of this Directive. Questions may be referr ed to the National Program Director for Pain Management at (203) 937-3841. 7. RESCISSIONS VHA Directive 2003-021 dated May 3, 2003, is rescinded. This VHA Directive expires October 31, 2014. STANDARDS OF PAIN MANAGEMENT The accepted standards of pain management are: 1. PAIN ASSESSMENT AND TREATMENT Procedures for early recognition of acute and persistent pa in and the design of prompt, longitudinal, and effective treatment must be implem ented at each medical facility. A. VHA has implemented \"Pain as the 5th Vital Sign\" in all inpatient and ou tpatient clinical se ttings to ensure consistent recognition and assessment of pain int ensity and pain's effects on function and quality of life. NOTE: A toolkit for implementation of this standard is available at the VHA pain management Web site at: www.va.gov/pain_management . APPENDICES PAIN MANAGEMENT TASK FORCE A-33 Public B. Routine assessment for the presence of pain is r equired for non-communicative patients, as well as for patients who communicate well. Asses sment in this circumstance requires an approach that involves a range of methods including: direct observation by clinical staff, input from family members, and close monitoring of the effects of pain management interventions. NOTE: A consensus statement that provides additional guidance for pain screening in the non- communicative patient is available at the VHA pain management Web site at: www.va.gov/pain_ management . C. Once pain symptoms are recognized, a timely an d appropriate comprehensive pain assessment is performed, a pain treatment plan is developed and implemented, and reassessment of the effectiveness of the plan is completed. Each of these parameters must be documented. NOTE: To ensure consistency of documentation and to facilitate pain outcomes monitoring, all facilities are strongly encouraged to use the pain reminders and dialogs sponsored by the VHA National Pain Management Strategy Coordinating Committee. These reminders and dialogs can be downloaded from the Clinical Reminders Web page at: vista.med.va.gov/reminders . D. Patient and family education regarding pain and pain management is included in the treatment plan. NOTE: Patients are encouraged to be activ e participants in pain management. E. Evidence-based, to the degree possible, pain managem ent protocols are implemented in all clinical settings. 1) Using guidelines. Published clinical practice gui delines and related resources providing information regarding these pain management protocols are available on the VHA pain management Web site at: www.va.gov/pain_management and at: 2) Patient participation in deci sion-making. Most uncomplicat ed pain conditions, for which the responsibility for assessment and management rests with the primary care provider or team (trained to implement a stepped care approach, as needed), respo nd best to one or mo re of several therapies readily available and coordinated in primary care settings. These therapies emphasize continuing patient participation in decision -making and clinical pl anning, patient instructi on in self-management, and appropriate levels of family participation. NOTE: Standards for training in the use of these therapies in a prima ry care and other settings is available on the VHA pain management Web site at: www.va.gov/pai n_management . 3) Implementing steppe d, consultative care i. Integrating behavioral health in primary care of chronic pain is essentia l to optimize clinical outcomes and provide essential su pport to the medical care of pat ients. Chronic pain can be a complex, biopsychosocial conditi on involving cognitiv e, psychosocial, and substance abuse issues as well as medical and mental health comorbidities. The complexity of chron ic pain management is often beyond the expertise of a single practitio ner, especially for patients whose pain problems are complicated by homelessness, PTSD, cognitive impairment from TBI and other conditions, including depression, combat injuries, Polytrauma, substa nce abuse, and other complex psychosocial issues. The experience of pain both impacts and is affected by social and family functioning. Veterans with complex chronic pain conditions are best served by a comprehensive, interdisciplinary appro ach within a continuum of care that is informed by a biopsyc hosocial model. APPENDICES PAIN MANAGEMENT TASK FORCE A-34 Public NOTE: The VHA Pain Management Program is presen tly developing models of pain care through inter-program collaboration with various VHA pro gram offices, as listed below. Educational programs are being planned and executed through Employee Education System (EES) to present such collaborative clinical plan ning. New program models to achieve the objectives of this Directive will be found on the VHA pa in management Web site at www.va.gov/pain_ management as they are implemented. ii. Primary care providers must have access to pain consultative and treatment sources to effectively evaluate and manage these com plexities. Access must be timely to the needs of the Veteran. These sources include Pain Medicin e specialists, interdisci plinary pain clinics and centers, Hospice and Palliative Care Services, Mental Health services, Social Work services, and Clinical Chaplaincy services, among others. If such consult ative services are not readily available at a specific facility, the facility Director, or designee, is responsible for arranging with the VISN Director reasonable and timely access to these consultati ve services through inter- facility collaborations within the VISN or through community resources, as appropriate. iii. At least one tertiary, interdisciplinary pain re habilitation program must be available in each VISN to manage more complex cases. iv. Acute pain management is expected in every environment, including provision for seamless pain management during transportation from primary care and secondary care facilities to tertiary care. F. Effective pain management often requires consideratio n of the use of one or more of several different classes of medications and other treatment modalities prescribed simultaneously. Treatment may become particularly complex in the context of several causal or perpetuating mechanisms and co morbidities. The potential for each modality for improving pain treatment outcomes is weighed agai nst the potential for drug- drug and drug-disease interactions, side effe cts, and toxicities. Patients with cognitive deficits from disease or TBI are particularly vulnerable wh en drug regimens increase in their complexity. Evidence-based stepped care treatment algorithms for managing different types and complexities of chronic pain and its comorbidities is readily availa ble to providers as is training ap propriate to their practice setting. G. The safe and effective use of opioid an algesics for the management of pain, particularly complex chronic pain conditions, requires special attenti on to personal and public health risks. 1) Risks include adverse side effects of these medications, development of addiction, and risks to the public through diversion of prescribed medications. 2) The potential for fatal overdose either by accid ent or in a suicidal attempt in patients suffering from multiple disorders or with polypharmacy must be considered in prescribi ng opioids and other medications, including prescribing for pain patients on opioid substitution programs. NOTE: Published guidelin es for chronic opioid t herapy, pain polypharmacy, an d management of pain in the post-operative setting are avai lable to guide the use of thes e medications. These guidelines are available at www.healthquality.va.gov and on the VHA pain management Web site at www.va.gov/pain_management . Completion of a written opioid pain care agreement is strongly encouraged to document provider-pati ent discussion of potential risks and benefits of opioids, provider and patient responsibilities rela ted to their use, and the parameters fo r continued use. In this context, other methods such as ra ndom urine drug monitoring, frequent clinic visits and opioid renewal clinics may be useful to ensure adherence and safe ty. Further information about how to manage opioid treatment agreements can be found at www.healthquality.va.gov and on the VHA pain management Web site, www.va.gov/pain_management . APPENDICES PAIN MANAGEMENT TASK FORCE A-35 Public H. As pain management is an integral part of palliative and end-of-life care, the expertise of hospice and palliative care clinicians needs to be available to all patients with a serious , life-limiting illness. I. Patient satisfaction with pain management is monitored on an on-going basis. 2. EVALUATION OF OUTCOMES AND QUALITY OF PAIN MANAGEMENT A. A multidisciplinary pain managem ent committee must be es tablished at each VHA facility to provide oversight, coordination, and monitoring of pain management activ ities and processes to facilitate the implementation of the VHA Pain Ma nagement Strategy in compliance with eviden ce-based standards of pain care and adherence to requirements of external accrediting bodies. In some facilities, this function may be the responsibility of an overarching clinical practice comm ittee. In each facility, processes will be developed and implemented to evaluate the success of meeting the goals of the VHA National Pain Management Strategy on a regular basis, at least yearly. B. The quality of pain assessment and the effectiveness of pain management interventions must be monitored. Measures may include: adherence to published clinical practice guidelin es, timeliness of pain treatment, adequacy of pain control, medication safety, appropriate use of stepped care treatment including behavioral health and pain medicine consultation and treatment, and clinical outcomes such as improvements in pain control, patient satisfaction, physical and psychosocial functioning, and quality of life. NOTE: A VHA Pain Outcomes Toolkit is available at www.va.gov/pain_mana gement/docs/outcomes.doc . C. All elements of pain management must be documented in the patient record, often in the initial visit or in subsequent visits as clinically indicated over time. NOTE: For clinical tips, clinicians may want to consult www.va.gov/pain_manage ment/docs/outcomes.doc and www.va.gov/pai n_management . Elements of pain management include: 1) Medical History. The patient's prior experience of pain and pain-related diseases, disorders, injuries and comorbidities. 2) Routine Screening for Pain. Routine screening for the presence and intensity of pain using \"Pain as the 5 th Vital Sign,\" or a validated altern ative tool for special populations, must be documented. This must be accomplished in association with outpatient or home visits and in resi dential and inpatient settings at a frequency that is appropriate to th e specific clinical setting and pro blem. Screening for pain in non- communicative patients must be documented by the use of the code \"99,\" which indicates the pain assessment occurred in lieu of a verbal assessment. NOTE: It is important to appreciate that the goals of this method include the timely monitoring of pain treatment effectiveness, and the identification of new or previously undetected pain concerns. 3) Comprehensive Pain Assessment. NOTE: Use of pain reminders and di alogs is encouraged. 4) Individualized Pla n of Care. An individualized goal-oriente d, prioritized pain management plan of care that may include, but is not limited to: i. Pharmacologic interven tions, including: a. The use of mechanism-specific and condition-specific treatment algorithms, APPENDICES PAIN MANAGEMENT TASK FORCE A-36 Public b. Appropriate trials of individual medications to determine effectivene ss (pain control and function), and c. Cessation of medica tion without effectiveness. ii. Prescribing opioid analgesics for regular use, documentation of: a. An opioid pain care agree ment, which is strongly encouraged, if not mandated (according to local facility policy), b. Effectiveness, including pain control, function, and quality of life, and c. Safe storage and management in the home. iii. Non-pharmacologic interven tions, to include: a. Educational interventions to improve self-management; b. Psychological interventions, including established psychotherapies for chronic pain and associated sequelae (e.g., Cognitive-Beha vioral Therapy), in conjunction with other treatments as appropriate, particularly for patients with unremitting chronic pain that demonstrate limited response to other treatment approaches; c. Family interventions and community supports; d. Rehabilitation therapies; e. Complementary therapies as available; and f. Pain medicine specialty proc edures, such as injections, ne rve blocks, ablations, and neuromodulation. 5) Evaluation. Periodic evaluat ion of adherence, response to in terventions, and achievement of time- limited therapeutic goals in the pain management plan, should include: i. Moderation or alleviation of pain; ii. Satisfaction with current treatment plan; iii. Stabilization or improvement in physical and psychosocial function; iv. Stabilization or improvement in salient comorbidities and overall health status; v. Adherence to opioid pain care agreement, if used; and vi. Adherence to pain management plan of care. APPENDICES PAIN MANAGEMENT TASK FORCE A-37 Public 6) Education. Pain education for family and pati ent that may include the availability of pain specific programs, such as: formal pain school; pain releva nt Web sites; printed pain management patient education materials at or below the ninth grade literacy level; and hosp ital video networks. Veterans' learning needs, readiness, preferenc es and barriers should be cons idered to ensure that messages are presented in an understandable format which the Vete ran finds helpful. This education needs to occur: i. During hospitalization, as soon as clinic ally appropriate and acc eptable to the patient. ii. At discharge from hospital or facility. iii. In all outpatient treatment settings when pain is assessed or treated. 3. CLINICIAN COMPETENCE AND EXPERTISE IN PAIN MANAGEMENT A. All clinical staff (e.g., physicians, psychologists, nurses, pharmacists, therapists, and chaplains), should have orientation related to the principles of pain as sessment and management upon being hired, as well as ongoing education and train ing. While general prin ciples of pain management app ly to all VHA clinicians, each staffing group must clearly delineate its specific pa in management responsibiliti es and abilities and ensure that all its members receive training adequate to meet these responsibilities and to maintain these abilities. Education and training must be relevant to the specific needs of the patient population and clinical setting that provider groups serve , and should include, as appropria te, pharmacologic (especially opiates and including educ ation regarding physical dependency, ps eudoaddiction, tolerance, and potential for addiction, overdose and/or suicide; appropriate titratio n; side effects and benefits) and non-pharmacologic (including psychological, physi cal, complementary, and spirit ual) treatment modalities. NOTE: Annual pain management education for clinical staff is highly recommended. Such education should include: for physicians , PAs, CRNPs, and nurses, 5 hours of continuing education in pain management, which can be obtain ed by attending continuin g medical education (CME) and continuing education unit (CEU) offerings, completing online self-studies for CME and CEUs, or earning the credits in other ways and submitting evidence of the credits to the educa tion staff at their fa cility. When feasible, facilities are encouraged to provide interactive \"w orkshop\" formats for learning specific cognitive and behavioral skills. Courses and educational tools for facilitie s can be found on the VHA pain management Web site at www.va.gov/pain_management . It is highly recommended that Pain Medicine Physician specialists obtain and maintain one or more of the following certifications: Pain Medicine specialty board certification by the American Board of Pai n Medicine; Pain Man agement subspecialty board certification by the American Board of Anest hesiology, the American Boar d of Physical Medicine an d Rehabilitation, or the American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology; Hospice and Palliative Care Medicine subspecialty board certification by one of the various ABMS boards granting this certification. It is recommended that they should also obtain yearly pain-rel evant continuing medical educati on. In addition, innovative training programs are being develop ed and evaluated to ensure the adequacy of the pain managem ent workforce for providing quality pain management to all Veterans regardless of location.

VHA standards for pain management will be communicate d by training faculty to al l medical students, allied health professional students, residents, a nd interns who provide patient ca re; appropriate education in pain assessment and management will also be provided to these students and trainees. APPENDICES PAIN MANAGEMENT TASK FORCE A-38 Public THERAPIES EMPHASIZING CONTINUING PATIENT PARTICIPATION Most uncomplicated pain conditions, for which the respo nsibility for assessment an d management rests with the primary care provider or team (trained to implement a stepp ed care approach, as needed ), respond best to one or more of several therapies readily avai lable and coordinated in primary care settings. These therapies emphasize continuing patient participation in decision-making and clin ical planning, patient instruction in self-management, and appropriate levels of family participation. NOTE: Standards for training in the use of these therapies in a primary care and other settings is available on the VHA pain management Web site at: www.va.gov/pai n_management . Therapies may include, as medically appropriate and indicated: 1. Medication management throu gh evidence-based algorithms; 2. Office-based procedures (e.g., myofascial injections); 3. Behavioral therapies (e.g., pain school, behavioral groups, support groups); 4. Physical therapy interventions (e.g., stretching, posture, exercis e, ice, and electronic stimulation), occupational therapy interventions (e.g., splinting, positioning, and adaptive equipmen t for modified activity, and chiropractic interventions (e.g., spinal manipulation); and 5. Complementary and alternative therapies based on availability (e.g ., acupuncture, massage, tai chi) may be considered.

Name The Defense and Veterans Pain Management Initia tive (DVPMI). Defense represents all United States Armed Forces personnel and dependents. Veterans represent the organization's commitme nt to enhancing the continuity of effective pain care of Veterans and retirees into the health care systems of the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) and the community. 2. Objective The DVPMI will serve the DoD and VHA as a clinical advisor of best integr ated pain medicine practice, a pain medicine educational resource, and a pain research and outcomes evaluatio n focal point. As the Defense Pain Center of Excellence (DPCoE), the DVPMI will be responsible for assessing the effectiveness and safety of pain care for DoD and VHA Beneficiaries. The DVPMI will pr ovide an administrative structure for a Military Pain Medicine Board of Directors (MPMBD) co nsisting of Air Force, Army, Navy an d VHA senior expert clinicians and researchers experienced in the management of acute and chronic pain on the battl efield, at sea, in the air, and at home through recovery, rehabilitation and reintegration. 3. Purpose Based on the best available eviden ce, the DVPMI will develop consensu s recommendations for the Air Force, Army, Navy, and VHA integrated pain managemen t communities for improvements in pain medicine practice, education, and research. The DVPMI will be the proponent of world class pain management services for military and VHA Beneficiaries. The organization will serve as an advisory board (MPMBD) to the individual service pain consultants to the Surgeons General a nd VA's Undersecretary for Health Director. The DVPMI will contribute directly to pain-related research, developme nt, tests, and evaluations (RDT&E) sponsored by the Services or the Defense Health Progr am, or by other Federal organizations that sponsor research, such as the Department of Veterans Affairs and t he National Institutes of Healt h. Direct contributions include proposing and executing clinic al and nonclinical trials as a Princ ipal Investigator and establishing clinical trial resources (e.g., clinical sites, subject recruitment, protocol develop ment and executio n, Institutional Review Board coordination, and analytical and report-writing capabi lities). The DVPMI will support the compilation, organization, assessment, and di ssemination of pain-related res earch information and outcomes. 4. History The DVPMI began as a congressionally directed program called the Army Region al Anesthesia and Pain Management Initiative in 2000. Upon recognition t hat pain issues required a tri-service approach, the organization was re-named the Military Advanced Regi onal Anesthesia and Anal gesia (MARAA) in 2005 to include Air Force and Navy partne rs in military pain medicine recommen dations. Finally, the acknowledgment that military and VHA Beneficiari es require an integrated response to acut e and chronic pain issues throughout the patient care continuum, led to the current DVPMI structure. The establishment year for the organization remains 2005 when it first became tri-service. APPENDICES PAIN MANAGEMENT TASK FORCE A-49 Public ARTICLE II: MANAGEMENT 1.
