Unfortunately, gum recession can cause gaps to form between your gum line and teeth, which can result in bacterial infections. Without gum recession treatment, the bone structures and supporting tissues of your teeth may be damaged, resulting in tooth loss. When it comes to receding gums, both you and your dentist can work together to remedy your gums. Professional treatment and lifestyle changes - such as incorporating essential oils into your oral hygiene routine - can help treat receding gums effectively. The Causes and Symptoms of Receding Gums Causes of Receding Gums Since gum recession occurs slowly over time, many people don't even realize what's happening until their gums have receded noticeably. There are a number of different causes of receding gums, such as: - Poor dental hygiene - Inadequate brushing and flossing can lead to plaque buildup and tartar. This type of buildup can cause gingivitis and receding gums. - Improper tooth brushing - Overly aggressive tooth brushing or brushing teeth in the wrong way may wear away the enamel on your teeth, which may cause the gums to recede. - Gum disease or periodontal disease - The most common cause of receding gums is gum disease, which may begin as gingivitis and progress into the serious stages of periodontal disease. Gum disease causes infection under the gums, and it can destroy not only gum tissue but also the supporting bone that keeps teeth in place. Approximately [three out of four adults](https://www.cda.org/Portals/0/pdfs/fact_sheets/receding_gums_english.pdf)have some type of gum disease, increasing their risk of receding gums. - Use of tobacco products - It is no secret that tobacco products are bad for your dental health. Using tobacco products can weaken your immune system, making it tougher for your body to fight off gum infections. If you already have periodontal disease and receding gums, smoking will increase and prolong the damage to your gums. According to the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/campaign/tips/diseases/periodontal-gum-disease.html), smokers have twice the risk of gum disease, and the longer they smoke, the higher that risk becomes. - Genetics - Just like with many other health conditions, it's believed that certain people are genetically predisposed to gum recession. In fact, [nearly 30% of the population](https://www.webmd.com/oral-health/guide/receding_gums_causes-treatments#1)may have a predisposition to gum disease. For these individuals, preventive measures are especially important. - Clenching and grinding your teeth - Clenching and grinding your teeth, a condition known bruxism, puts extreme force on your teeth, which may cause enamel to weaken and for your gums to recede. - Lack of vitamin C - Vitamin C deficiency can cause poor oral health, including receding gums. - Lip or tongue piercings - Tongue and lip piercing jewelry can continuously rub against oral tissues, like your gums. This can not only cause cracked or chipped teeth, but also receding gums. - Hormonal changes - Some medications, like birth control, can affect hormones in your body that also affect your gum health. High amounts of progesterone, for example, can cause swollen gums, gum irritation, and even gingivitis. Symptoms of Receding Gums The first step to treating receding gums is recognizing when they begin to recede. Gum disease is the most common cause of gum recession, and when left untreated it's been associated with a higher risk of health problems like obesity, heart attack, preterm labor, diabetes, and stroke. Here are the [common symptoms of receding gums](https://www.healthline.com/health/dental-oral-health-receding-gums#causes): - Tooth sensitivity - The appearance of longer teeth - Red, swollen gums - Bleeding when brushing or flossing - Loosening teeth - Pain at the gum line How Your Dentist Can Help If your gums are starting to recede, don't ignore it. Like tooth enamel, once your gum tissue begins to recede it can't grow back. This is why treating receding gums, and stopping their recession as fast as you can, is important. Gum recession has the potential to lead to tooth loss, so it's essential to discuss your receding gums with your dentist. There are two common solutions your dentist can offer you to treat receding gums include: - Periodontal Cleanings - Deep cleanings called [periodontal cleanings](https://www.vprestondental.com/dental-services/periodontal-care/periodontal-cleaning/)are more invasive and effect than typical bi-annual dental cleanings. Periodontal cleanings involve scaling and root planning and involve scraping off the tartar on teeth both above and below your gum line. Dentists may also use lasers to help eliminate tartar from your teeth. - Gingival Graft - In cases where deep cleaning and periodontal maintenance isn't a good treatment option due to excessive loss of bone, your dentist may recommend a gum surgery known as a gingival graft. This procedure repairs the damage that's been caused by gum recession. A gingival graft works to revive your gum tissue or the bone tissue holding your teeth. It involves placing a piece of tissue or synthetic tissue to enable your gums to grow back. - Scaling and Root Planing - [Scaling and root planing](https://www.vprestondental.com/dental-services/periodontal-care/scaling-and-root-planing/), often referred to as a \"deep cleaning,\" is a non-surgical periodontal treatment specifically designed to combat gum recession caused by periodontitis, an advanced form of gum disease. The procedure involves two main steps: scaling, where dental professionals meticulously remove plaque and tartar deposits from the tooth surface and below the gum line, and root planing, where the roots of the teeth are smoothed to eliminate any rough spots that might harbor bacteria. This thorough cleaning not only helps reduce inflammation and halt the progression of gum recession but also creates a clean, smooth surface for the gums to reattach to the teeth. For patients with early signs of gum disease or noticeable gum recession, scaling and root planing can be a crucial intervention to restore gum health and prevent further complications. Regular follow-up visits and stringent oral hygiene practices post-treatment further enhance its efficacy. Holistic Support for Receding Gums with Essential Oils Once you visit your dentist to plan out an effective treatment plan for your gums, you might want to consider what you can do at home on your own to support gum health: - Incorporating a robust oral hygiene routine is the cornerstone of gum health, which includes brushing your teeth twice daily using a soft-bristled toothbrush ( [preferably electric](https://www.vprestondental.com/dental-services/preventative-dentistry/oral-b-toothbrush/)) to prevent gum irritation, and flossing once a day to remove plaque from areas that a toothbrush can't reach. - Rinsing with an [antimicrobial](https://www.vprestondental.com/dental-services/periodontal-care/closys-mouthwash/)or fluoride mouthwash can further deter bacterial growth and fortify tooth enamel. - Apply any [topical antibiotics](https://www.vprestondental.com/dental-services/periodontal-care/arestin/)to your gums as prescribed by your dentist - Consuming a balanced diet rich in vitamins and minerals, especially vitamin C and calcium, supports healthy gum tissue and strong teeth. - Avoiding tobacco products, moderating alcohol consumption, and limiting sugary foods and beverages can significantly decrease the risk of gum disease. - Being mindful of grinding or clenching the teeth, known as bruxism, can prevent undue stress on the gums. If you regularly wake up with jaw and teeth pain, consider speaking to your dentist about a [nightguard to prevent grinding your teeth](https://www.vprestondental.com/dental-services/preventative-dentistry/occlusal-night-guards/). - Add essential oils to your oral hygiene routine (keep reading for our specific guidelines) With these practices in place, you'll bolster your gum health and complement the treatments received from your dentist, ensuring a lasting foundation for your teeth. Why Essential Oils Can Be Effective There's a lot of science to back up the use of essential oils for dental health and other holistic dentistry methods, like oil pulling. In fact, oil pulling with coconut oil or sesame oil has been shown to aid in the [prevention of oral disease](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19336860/), cavities, and even bad breath, which can be linked to other diseases like heart disease. Many essential oils have healing, anti-inflammatory, and anti-bacterial properties, which makes them effective at aiding the treatment of gum recession and other oral health problems. Here is a list of essential oils that can improve the health of your gums: - Frankincense - Frankincense essential oil has antiseptic properties that make it a natural solution to fighting the bacteria in the mouth that can cause plaque, tooth decay, and bad breath while supporting healthy gums. - Sage - Sage oil has strong antibacterial, antiviral, and antifungal properties that destroy and prevent the growth of bacteria in our mouths. This essential oil also accelerates wound healing and prevents swollen and bleeding gums. - Lemon - Lemon oil can help prevent receding gums and tooth decay by fighting bacteria. This oil also has properties known to stimulate tissue formation and can support healthy gums. - Yarrow - Yarrow essential oil is known as an anti-inflammatory oil that can help reduce inflammation of the gums which is often a symptom of receding gums. - Tea tree - Tea tree oil is antiseptic, antibacterial, antifungal, and antiviral and can help keep damaged, inflamed gums from getting infected. - Eucalyptus - Eucalyptus oil is an anti-inflammatory germicide that helps soothe receding gums and helps stimulate the growth of new gum tissue. - Peppermint - Peppermint oil's antiseptic and antibacterial properties can help prevent disease-causing bacteria from infecting susceptible gums. - Clove - Clove oil is known as a disinfectant oil, and has long been used to treat many oral diseases. The antibacterial and anti-inflammatory properties in clove oil can help fight infections from periodontal disease. How to Safely Use Essential Oils to Support Gum Health If you're considering integrating essential oils into your oral care routine, it's essential to approach their usage safely and responsibly. While essential oils can offer complementary support, they should not replace scientifically-proven oral hygiene products, especially those containing fluoride. - Oil Pulling - This Ayurvedic technique combines a carrier oil, like coconut oil or cold-pressed sesame oil, with a few drops of essential oils. Mix well and swish for 10-15 minutes before spitting it out. Use oil pulling as an adjunct to your routine to help support healthy gums and oral tissues. - Essential Oils with Approved Oral Care Products - Instead of creating DIY toothpaste or mouthwash which may lack essential components like fluoride and can be [dangerous if swallowed](https://www.colgate.com/en-us/oral-health/selecting-dental-products/should-you-use-homemade-toothpaste#), consider adding a drop or two of essential oils to your fluoride toothpaste or mouthwash. However, always ensure that the chosen essential oils are suitable for oral use. - Direct Application - Some oils, like clove oil, can be massaged directly onto your gums. However, it's vital to always dilute oils like eucalyptus with a carrier oil before application to the sensitive tissues of your gums. Remember, most essential oils should not be ingested. Fluoride plays an integral role in oral health, strengthening tooth enamel and reducing the risk of decay. It is crucial to maintain the use of fluoride-containing products to ensure the health and integrity of teeth and gums. Essential oils can be a supplemental part of gum health, but they should be used wisely and never replace proven oral hygiene practices. Get Help For Gum Recession in Raleigh, NC!
