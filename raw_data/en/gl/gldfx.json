We are on the front lines of supplying practitioners, managing Asian supply chain challenges, and the increase in demand for critical healthcare supplies,\" says Carl Schwartz, Lhasa's Chief Customer Officer. Due to the extremely positive response to these webinars, both organizations are considering offering additional dates and expanding webinar offerings to other related topics.
