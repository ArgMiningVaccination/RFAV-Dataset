Xiaorong Ding PhD L.Ac . Szent -Gy\u00f6rgyi Prize for Progress in Cancer Research BETHESDA , Maryland, January 24, 2012 What is Traditional Chinese Medicine? Traditional Chinese Medicine ( TCM) is rooted in the ancient philosophy of Taoism and dates back more than 2,500 years in China. Although the exact number of people who use TCM in the United States is unknown, it was estimated in 1997 that some 10,000 practitioners served more than 1 million patients each year. According to the 2007 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS), which included a comprehensive survey on the use of complementary health approaches by Americans, an estimated 3.1 million U.S. adults had used acupuncture in the previous year. The number of visits to acupuncturists tripled between 1997 and 2007 . (NIH, NCCIH) The ancient beliefs on which TCM is based include the following : The human body is a miniature version of the larger, surrounding universe . Harmony between two opposing yet complementary forces, called yin and yang , supports health, and disease results from an imbalance between these forces . Five elements \u2014fire, earth, wood, metal, and water \u2014 symbolically represent all phenomena, including the stages of human life, and explain the functioning of the body and how it changes during disease . Qi, a vital energy that flows through the body, performs multiple functions in maintaining health . How does it work? TCM focus on correcting imbalances by stimulating the body's natural ability to heal itself . In other words, TCM focus on ill body, not disease itself . The three main professionally applied methods of re-establishing balance are Chinese herbal medicine, acupuncture and moxibustion . Chinese herbal medicine. The Chinese Materia Medica (a pharmacological reference book used by TCM practitioners) describes thousands of medicinal substances \u2014primarily plants, but also some minerals and animal products. Different parts of plants, such as the leaves, roots, stems, flowers, and seeds, are used. In TCM, herbs are often combined in formulas and given as teas, capsules, liquid extracts, granules, or powders. Acupuncture. Acupuncture is a family of procedures involving the stimulation of specific points on the body using a variety of techniques. The acupuncture technique that has been most often studied scientifically involves penetrating the skin with thin, solid, metal needles that are manipulated by the hands or by electrical stimulation . Moxibustion . Moxibustion is a form of heat therapy in which dried plant materials called \" moxa \" are burned on or very near the surface of the skin. The intention is to warm and invigorate the flow of Qi in the body and dispel certain pathogenic influences. Moxa is usually made from the dried leafy material of Chinese mugwort (Artemesia argyi or A.vlugaris ), but it can be made of other substances as well.

Author information 1Traditional, Complementary and Alternative Medicine Department, Ministry of Health, Ankara, Turkey A total of 45 inpatients who underwent chemotherapy . Acupuncture was administered to the patients one day prior to chemotherapy, on the day of chemotherapy and one day after chemotherapy . The patients were evaluated on nausea, vomiting, pain, sleep quality and anxiety before the chemotherapy and on the 4th day of chemotherapy . This study showed that acupuncture has positive effects in cancer treatment patients who experience nausea, vomiting, pain, poor sleep quality and anxiety as side effects of chemotherapy . Chemotherapy - related side effects in cancer patients could be decreased by the concurrent use of acupuncture . How does TCM do for cancer patient? Based on Chinese medicine conception , the origin of cancer is considered to be mainly due to lack of \"Zheng Qi,\" immune system deficiency and accumulation of \"Xie Qi,\" pathogenic factors . TCM suggests that cancer is an outcome of an imbalance of body, mind, and spirit ; thus, it requires a multimodal treatment approach that involves lifestyle modification , herbal prescription, acupuncture, moxibustion , traditional exercise , and meditation to restore the balance . As showed above, experimental and clinical Chinese medicine therapies have demonstrated that TCM are effective for supporting patients going through in various stages . Clinical case B., female, 60yd, nurse. She was diagnosed with Stage IV Cancer on June, 2013. 2 large cancers were removed, one from the lung and another from the brain. The surgeries were followed by chemotherapy and radiation. Her body and mind felt like she was hit with a \" mach truck\". As she told, more than half with this diagnosis die within the first year and her prognosis is less than 4% for a 5 year survival rate. After her last Chemo, she began TCM treatment. Before acupuncture and herbs treatment, she felt fatigue, low appetite, insomnia, anxiety, depression. Post chemo, she suffered from neuropathy and her muscle tore easily. She began acupuncture twice a week for 5 weeks and then once every week for one year. Because she felt really well, she continued treatment once every two weeks until now (altogether 1 year and a half so far). Now her numbness stopped completely and burning and electrical activity in her hands and feet are much improved. Her energy, appetite, sleeping and emotion are all normal. She believes, considering the severity of her disease she will continue to benefit from both West and East medicine. "}
