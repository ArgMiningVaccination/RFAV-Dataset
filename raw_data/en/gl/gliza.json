The degree of vitiation of Tridosha is variable owing to magnitude of infection or individual Sharira Bala (immunity) of the affected person. Management (suggested supplement holistic techniques and not as a replacement for medical treatment) The standard protocol for management of the disease is performing Panchavidha Shodhanam (Panchakarma), administration of Rasayana (immunomodulatory supplements) and specific therapies.
