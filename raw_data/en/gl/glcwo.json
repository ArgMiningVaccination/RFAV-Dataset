But what are some things you can do to keep yourself healthy? While no vitamin or food can cure COVID-19, there is evidence that including some of the following foods and supplements into a balanced diet can help a person's overall wellbeing. Read below for suggestions that will help your body fight off a variety of illnesses, including those that can boost a person's respiratory health: Antioxidant-Rich Foods Research suggests that antioxidants may play a role in easing common cold or flu symptoms. Try adding these antioxidant-rich foods to your diet: - Salmon - Haddock - Spinach - Sweet potatoes - Asparagus - Almonds - Whole grains - Citrus fruits Vitamin C Generally, vitamin C can help you fight a cold faster. But, did you know that a person who takes vitamin C regularly can experience fewer respiratory symptoms should they get a cold or other illness? Vitamin C can also help reduce inflammation and is available through citrus fruits and cruciferous vegetables like broccoli and cauliflower. Supplements are also available to boost your intake. Vitamin D Vitamin D can help protect you from respiratory infection, but also maintain optimal blood levels of calcium. Most people get vitamin D through exposure to the sun's ultraviolet rays, but if you've been lacking in time outdoors, a supplement may be a good addition to your daily routine. B Complex vitamins Vitamin B6 is essential to keeping your immune system in top condition. Check the label on your multivitamin or get a supplement to make sure you are getting the correct amount in your diet. Zinc Taking zinc helps shorten the length of a common cold. Zinc also helps symptoms such as nasal congestion, nasal drainage, sore throat and cough resolve sooner. Want to learn more ways to stay healthy during a pandemic?
