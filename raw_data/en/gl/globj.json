More from Debbie Ford How It Works Each day, you will be guided through the distinctions of the 21-Day Consciousness Cleanse. I will share with you why this distinction is imperative for your spiritual and emotional evolution and then guide you in a four- to six-minute internal process that will support you in shifting your focus from the outer world to the inner world. The meditation will reconnect you with the force that fuels you and will allow you to unveil exactly what you need to do each day to live a life beyond your wildest dreams. When you finish this inner process, there will be a cleansing ritual that will support you in taking the actions necessary to make the internal and external shifts. And then you will be offered some soul food, a sentence or phrase to dwell in, meditate on and encode your consciousness with. Each of the 21 days will build upon the last, leaving you inspired, excited and confident about the future that awaits. The Past The first seven days of the consciousness cleanse are dedicated to clearing out the negative thinking, turbulent emotions, false assumptions, limiting beliefs and unresolved experiences from your past that have taken root inside your mind. You will be liberated from confusion, fear, guilt and self-doubt as you open up to new perspectives that will empower you, new actions that will support you in loving yourself and your life and a deeper connection with your soul as your guide. The Present Once you have released everything that has depleted your vitality and held you back, you will stand firmly in the present moment and take an honest look at where\u2014and who\u2014you are today, observing what is and what is not working in your life. You will uncover the powerful actions that will have you make the adjustments to stay on track for the best year of your life. You will tap into the emotions and the actions that will bring you fulfillment on a daily basis. The Future In this final phase of the consciousness cleanse, you will look into the future, unveiling the divine design that will be your new road map to success. You will partner with your highest self and take actions to bring forth love, contentment and compassion as you step into the brilliance of your soul's purpose. As you clear the container to your consciousness, you will remember the innocence of your youth, the clarity of an untainted mind and the joy of being present to all of who you are. You will create the space for inspiration, creativity and the genius of your soul to come through you. Let the journey begin.
