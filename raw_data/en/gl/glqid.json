The Project Team would like to thank the Alameda County Board of Supervisors and their staff, the P lanning Commission, the Public Health Commission, the Eden Municipal Advisory Council, the Castro Valley Municipal Advisory Council, and the many other County, government agency, and CBO staff who provided additional guidance, feedback, and content through out the development and adoption process. Their participation was invaluable to the creation of this Environmental Justice Element and will continue to be instrumental throughout its implementation. Acknowledgments County of Alameda Environmental Justice Element viii Land Acknowledgment The unincorporated communities of Ashland, Cherryland, Hayward Acres, San Lorenzo, and Castro Valley (the \"Priority Commu nities\" of this Environmental Justice Element) are located in the traditional Jalquin/Irgin territory of the Chochenyo - speaking Ohlone people. Ohlone is an umbrella term given to a collective of various tribes, bands, and territories of indigenous people. The land of the Priority Communities was and continues to be of great importance to the Ohlone people, often being the site of celebrations or religious ceremonies (Chabot College n.d.). Despite their forced removal from these unceded lands, many Ohlone pe ople continue to live in relationship with their ancestral land. Every member of the Priority Communities benefits from the use and continued occupation of this land. The County recognizes the importance of acknowledging this occupation and the continued impact it has on the native community. We acknowledge the land, the history, and the presence of the Ohlone people whose connection to this land still exists, who still live in our communities, and to whom this land belongs. As part of our effort to prioritize equity, we look to our work to correct the harms of the past. We stand in solidarity with all indigenous people and their right to self - determination and justice. We commit to working toward the healing of the generational trauma, theft, and dispossession native peoples have faced and continue to face.

Introduction section one Introduction Alameda County is joining many other jurisdictions throughout California in addressing environmental justice (EJ) , by preparing an EJ chapter or \"element\" in our County General Plan. A general plan is a long -range policy document to guide physical, economic, and environmental growth. State law requires all jurisdictions have a general plan that contains seven elements: Land Use, Circulation, Housing, Open Space, Conservation, Safety, and Noise. In ad dition to these seven elements, jurisdictions that meet certain criteria are also required to prepare an EJ element. The General Plan expresses the County's vision for the future and is the roadmap for achieving the community's desired quality of life. It is an assessment of current and future needs, and the resources needed to implement the goals and policies established in the General Plan. Alameda County's General Plan foc uses on the unincorporated portions of the county; cities within the county have th eir own, separate general plans. Introduction County of Alameda Environmental Justice Element 1-2 Alameda County recognizes that environmental justice (EJ) issues exist within our unincorporated communities. Environmental injustices often lead to disproportionate environmental burdens within low -income and Black, Indigenous, and People of Color ( BIPOC ) communities. These burdens affect health outcomes, food access, safety, economic opportunities, and many other integral asp ects of peoples' lives (California Environmental Justice Alliance 2018). This EJ Element, developed with extensive community and stakeholder input, contains goals, policies, and actions that reflect the values and needs of affected communities. In December 2015, the Alameda County Board of Supervisors (BOS ) approved the Ashland and Cherryland Community Health and Wellness Element ( CHWE ). The CHWE was created with input from the community in a partnership between the Community Development Agency (CDA ) and the Public Health Dep artment ( PHD ). This EJ Element serves as an update to the CHWE. Under this update, the EJ Element incorporates an expanded geographic area including census tracts in Hayward Acres, Castro Valley, and San Lorenzo in addition to Ashland and Cherryland. Build ing upon goals, policies, and actions outlined in the CHWE , this EJ element also presents additional topics identified through the community engagement processes. Definition of Environmental Justice The California Environmental Justice Alliance defines EJ as \"the basic right of people to live, work, go to school, and pray in a healthy and clean environment, regardless of race, gender, sexual orientation, age, culture, ability, nationality, or income\" (California Environmental Justice Alliance 2018). Bolded Term s All bolded words and acronyms throughout the EJ Element are defined in the Glossary at the beginning of this EJ Element, and some terms are also defined in sidebars for convenience. Introduction Environmental Justice Element County of Alameda 1-3 1.1 What Is Environmental Justice? Long before the term \"environmental justice\" became commonplace, low -income residents and BIPOC and immigrant communities experienced systemic oppression , bearing disproportionate impacts of environmental burdens and related health problems. Systemic oppre ssion is when the laws and regulations of a community result in the unequal treatment of a specific group, including, but not limited to, unequal access to health care, food, public transit, and safe and sanitary homes and neighborhoods. As Europeans colon ized the land now known as the state of California, they enacted systems of oppression and State -sponsored policies that continue to harm California's diverse native populations, damaging the centuries -long relationship between the local lands and their original indigenous stewards. In the late 19th century, Chinese descendants living in San Francisco were harmed by racially motivated policies , which sought to relocate them from their homes. This pattern of oppression carried on well into the 20th c entury. In 1913, the California Alien Land Law (also known as the Webb -Haney Act) primarily targeted Chinese, Indian, Japanese, and Korean immigrant farmers, denying them the right to own land in California. In 1942, President Franklin D. Roosevelt issued Executive Order 9066 resulting in the forcible relocation and imprisonment of tens of thousands of Japanese Americans throughout the Western states. During World War II, the then -unincorporated area known as Russell City was one of the only areas in Alamed a County where Black residents were allowed to live. Residents of Russell City, an area now part of the city of Hayward, were denied basic public infrastructure like water and sewer lines by County authorities. This denial of essential public services in l ow-income, BIPOC and immigrant communities compounded over time, producing disproportionate health burdens among residents throughout the area. The EJ movement began to gain public support in the 1980s when grassroots organizers in North Carolina revealed that low -income and BIPOC communities were more likely to live in areas that were environmentally hazardous. In 1992, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA ) began using the term \"environmental justice\" and established an EPA Office of Environmental Justice. In 1994, President Bill Clinton issued Executive Order 12898, directing federal agencies to consider EJ, and draw attention to the environmental and human health effects of federal decisions on minority and low -income populations. Systemic Oppression The National Equity Project describes systemic oppression as human created injustices that exist at the institutional level through established policies or practices. These injustices manifest throughout social, economic, and political realms of society (National Equity Project). Introduction County of Alameda Environmental Justice Element 1-4 1.2 Senate Bill 100 0 Recognizing the impact of planning policies on community health and equitable outcomes, California lawmakers approved SB 1000 in 2016 to incorporate EJ principles into planning documents and increase citizen involvement in public decision -making. SB 1000 requires cities and counties that have \"disadvantaged communities\" to incorporate EJ policies into their general plans. SB 1000 outlines a screening method that jurisdictions must use to identify disad vantaged communities for the purposes of the legislation. For more information about the screening process , see page 2-2. Based on SB 1000 criteria for determining EJ communities, as defined below, sixteen (16) unincorporated area census tracts in Alameda County have been identified as the focus of this EJ Elem ent. These 16 census tracts are located within five neighboring communities in urban unincorporated Alameda County: Ashland, Cherryland, Hayward Acres, San Lorenzo, and Castro Valley. The identified census tracts are referred to in this EJ Element as \"Prio rity Communities\" and described in detail in Section 2, Priority Communities , of this Element. SB 1000 requires that EJ elements identify goals and policies to reduce the unique or compounded health risks in disadvantaged communities , prioritize improvements and programs that meet the needs of those communities, and promote civic engagement in the public decision -making process . The policies and programs in this EJ Element are designed to meet the requirem ents of SB 1000 and address and correct the disproportionate environmental burdens faced by the Priority Communities. SB 1000 requires jurisdictions to consider six key topics to inform EJ policy development. These six topics form the \"pillars\" of EJ and s erve as a guide for the vision and goals of Alameda County's EJ Element and are defined in detail in Section 3, Existing Conditions . These pillars include: Pollution and Air Quality Access to Public Facilities Safe and Sanitary Homes & Neighborhoods Access to Healthy Food Health and Physical Activity Civic Engagement Census Tract All areas of a county are divided into census tracts. A census tract is a small area with a population size between 1,200 and 8,000 people. The purpose of a census tract is to provide a means to present and compare population data between areas of similar size (US Census Bureau n.d.). Introduction Environmental Justice Element County of Alameda 1-5 1.3 County EJ Initiatives The County has made progress over the past 20 years to address health burdens faced by residents in the Priority Communities through local initiatives and resources that improve residents' quality of life. The initiatives and programs outlined below are re cent developments in the Priority Communities that improve communication between community members, community -based organizations, and the County , drive equitable change, and provide access to resources for healthy lifestyle s. Ashland Cherryland Healthy Co mmunities Collaborative (established 2005) The Ashland Cherryland Healthy Communities Collaborative ( ACHCC ) includes over 30 local agencies and community -based organizations that provide services in Ashland, Cherryland, and neighboring urban unincorporated communities. The Collaborative's work has evolved over time in response to community priorities; initially called the Ashland -Cherryland Violence Prevention Collaborative (ACVPC), the name was changed in 2014 to reflect the group's goal of improving commu nity health and wellness through interdepartmental and interdisciplinary efforts. (For more information on the ACHCC, refer to the callout box on page 1-9.) Eden Area Livability Initiative (active 2004 -2019) Active in two phases from 2004 through 2019 , the Eden Area Livability Initiative ( EALI ) offer ed a shared vision to form and sustain a livable community in the urban unincorporated areas of the county . This initiative facilitate d partnerships between the community, the County, and the broader public sector organizations with a stake in the incorporat ed urban communities . Summary reports for EALI Phases I and II can be viewed at www.acgov.org/edenareavision/documents.htm . The following are some of the key achievements that emerged from or were catalyzed by the EALI initiative: REACH Youth Center (opened 2013). A youth center in Ashland was selected as a priority for immediate action during EALI Phase 1. After a decade of planning, the Ashland REACH youth community center opened in 2013 to local youth as a center for learning, empowerment, and healthy living. The dynamic 31,500 -square -foot facility includes a community clinic, library, day care, fitness center , and caf\u00e9. The site now offers youth from all over the unincorporated area a safe place to access vital resources for this historically under -resourced community ( reachashland.org ). The Ashland and Cherryland Community Health and Wellness Element (adopted 2015). The Ashland and Cherryland CHWE arose from a list of suggested projects of Phase I of EALI. The CHWE was adopted as an optional element of the Alameda County General Plan to address gaps in the county's existing public health policies with special consideration for the needs of residents in Ashland and Cherryland. This updated EJ Element builds upon goals, policies, and actions outlined in the existing CHWE along with additio nal topics identified through community engagement processes (Community Health and Wellness Element of the Alameda County General Plan, acgov.org ). Introduction County of Alameda Environmental Justice Element 1-6 My Eden Voice! (established 2018). Initially a project of County Supervisor Nate Miley's office and catalyzed by EALI Phase II, an indep endent 501(c)3 non -profit organization that advocates for policies that benefit the historically disadvantaged communities in the unincorporated areas of Alameda County. The organization campaigns on behalf of these communities to hold county decisionmaker s accountable for advancing policy changes that promote equity and justice ( myedenvoic e.org ). Cherryland Community Center (opened 2020). The Hayward Area Recreation and Parks District's Cherryland Community Center, which opened its doors in 2020, emerged from EALI Phase I. Adjacent to the Meek Estate in Cherryland, the Cherryland Community Center is a state -of the -art facility that houses mul ti-use and community rooms, a Pre -K activity room, an Alameda County Library Annex, a catering kitchen and a reception room . Dig Deep Farms (established 2010) and Dig Deep Farms Food Hub (established 2020 ) Dig Deep Farms was established in 2010 by the Ala meda County Deputy Sheriffs' Activities League ( DSAL ), a nonprofit created to encourage communication and collaboration between community members and the Alameda County Sheriff's Office ( acdsal.org/farms ). In recognition of the importance of food as medicine, the farming program operates six urban farms throughout Alameda County and trains and hires local residents to grow nutritious food and learn about permaculture and urban far ming. The Dig Deep Farms Food Hub is a certified community commercial kitchen, food aggregation, and distribution center that acts as the home base for DSAL's Food as Medicine and Food Recovery programs. With combined efforts from multiple community organi zations, Dig Deep Farms and the Food Hub offer workforce re -entry opportunities and provide nutritious food to those in need while reducing food waste. Eden Area Municipal Advisory Council (established 2020) The Alameda County BOS established the Eden Area Municipal Advisory Council ( Eden MAC ) in 2020 as a formal structure for public representation and engagement in the unincorporated communities of Ashland, Cherryland, Hayward Acres, and San Lorenzo. A MAC is a Brown Act body1 that represents an unincorpo rated area and advises a county BOS . MAC members are appointed by, and serve as an advisory body to, the Alameda County BOS on land use issues and other topics impacting their community. In urban unincorporated Alameda County, the community of Castro Valle y has had its own MAC since 1981, and the Fairview MAC was established in 2017. The 2020 establishment of the Eden MAC uplifts the voices of Eden Area residents and highlights the importance of civic engagement in the public decision -making process. 1 The Brown Act (California Government Code \u00a7 54950 et seq. ) was enacted in 1953 to guarantee the public's right to attend and participate in meetings of local legislative bodies . It governs local agencies, legislative bodies of local government agencies created by state or federal law and any standing committee of a covered board or legislative body, and governing bodies of non -profit corporations formed by a public agency. Introduction Environmental Justice Element County of Alameda 1-7 1.4 Relationship to Other General Plan Elements and Plans In accordance with state law, the goals, policies, and actions outlined in this EJ Element are consistent with all other elements of the Alameda County General Plan, as well as with other regional and l ocal plans, as described below. These documents are all accessible on the County's General Plan, Specific Plans & Ordinances webpage (https://www.acgov.org/cda/planning/generalplans/in dex.htm ). The County developed this EJ Element directly in advance of updates to its Community Climate Action Plan, Safety Element, and Housing Element. These and all future General Plan updates will be informed by the E J Element, ensuring that EJ considerations are incorporated, and that each element is consistent and mutually reinforcing. Table 1-1 describes several County and Community plans and initiatives and their EJ -related componen ts.

Introduction Environmental Justice Element County of Alameda 1-9 1.5 Community Engagement This EJ Element was developed through an extensive community engagement process . EJ-focused meetings with partner agencies, bilingual (Spanish/English) community EJ workshops, and a bilingual (Spanish/English) EJ community survey provided a variety of engagement options. The feedback the County received was key to identify ing priority EJ issues and guid ing the development of goals, policies, and actions in this EJ Element . The County also partnered with local community engagement experts including the Tiburcio Vasquez Cente r (TVHC ), whose Promotores peer educ ator team led a bilingual, grassroots effort to distribute the survey and advertise workshops in the Priority Communities. In response to the ongoing COVID pandemic, most partner agency meetings and community workshops were held virtually. These virtual en gagement meetings were informative and interactive, and provided opportunities for the develo pment of community -based solutions. The following provides information regarding community engagement activities; input received from community engagement is summa rized by EJ pillar in Section 3. Presentations and meeting materials, including summaries of each meeting, as well as the survey results, are provided in detail in Appendix A and are also posted on the County's website: https://www.acgov.org/cda /planning /generalplans /engagement.htm Communities Collaborative (ACHCC ) EJ Bucket me t in monthly virtual meetings over the course of the EJ Element planning process to guide the development of the EJ Element. In these interactive meetings, participating service provider staff shared informatio n, ideas, and perspectives that informed the development of the EJ Element and the Implementation Plan. The ACHCC EJ Bucket also helped the County develop community engagement strategies to increase Priority Community participation in the EJ process. Commu nity Workshops WORKSHOP #1 The first EJ Element community workshop was held on May 19, 2022. In response to ongoing public health concerns surrounding the COVID -19 pandemic, this was a virtual meeting with 55 participants in attendance and included consecu tive Spanish - language interpretation. The workshop introduced EJ principles and outlined key findings and data related to EJ topics and local The Ashland Cherryland Healthy Communities Collaborative (ACHCC) The ACHCC was established by Alameda County Supervisor Nate Miley in 2008 to coordinate efforts, build capacity, and leverage resources in Ashland and Cherryland. With an expanded geographic focus, today's ACHCC is a coalition of staff from County agencies, Special Districts, and loca l community -based organizations such as La Familia, Bike East Bay , Resources for Community Development, and others that provide services in the urban unincorporated communities of Ashland, Cherryland, Hayward Acres, San Lorenzo, and Castro Valley. The ACHC C is currently made up of two \"buckets\": a Basic Needs Bucket, which focuses on immediate needs like food distributions and vaccination clinics, and an E J Bucket, which focuses on long -range, upstream issues impacting community health and wellness. Throughout 2022, the ACHCC EJ Bucket met monthly to identify community needs and assets, co-create EJ policy recommendations, and provide feedback on how to effectively implement the EJ Element. Introduction County of Alameda Environmental Justice Element 1-10 concerns in the Priority Communities. During the workshop, participant feedback was gathered to help the County be tter understand how EJ issues affect the community members personally. Participants were asked questions related to each of the six pillars of EJ. Following the presentation, an open Q&A forum provided an opportunity for participants to ask general questio ns and provide comments. Feedback provided by the community at the workshop was used to confirm the data presented in Section 3 for each EJ pillar . Section 3 includes a summary of community input under the analysis for each EJ pillar . WORKSHOP #2 The secon d community workshop was held on August 25, 2022. This virtual meeting had 94 people in attendance and included consecutive Spanish -language interpretation. The meeting began with an introduction to the EJ Element workplan and schedule, followed by a descr iption of the County's responsibilities as they relate to SB 1000. The remainder of the workshop was organized into three different sections. Each section included a presentation of two EJ pillar s, including community concerns related to those pillars, fol lowed by small group discussions in breakout rooms. During the breakout discussions, facilitators used an interactive digital collaboration platform ( MURAL ) to organize discussions, record community concerns and potential policy solutions. After each breakout, facilitators shared out highlights from their breakouts. Feedback provided by the community at the workshop was used to inform the development of poli cies and actions presented in Section 4, Goals, Policies , and Actions . WORKSHOP #3 NOTE: This information will be added in the Final Draft after the final community workshop and public review period is completed. Community Survey The County gathered additi onal information about EJ issues of concern to Priority Community residents via an online survey. Community members were able to access the survey from May 1 through August 31, 2022, in either English or Spanish. The County received 29 responses in English , and 22 responses in Spanish. The survey responses were used to inform the issues presented in Section 3 for each EJ pillar, and to inform the civic engagement process. Section 3 includes a summary of community input received through the survey under the analysis for each EJ pillar. Introduction Environmental Justice Element County of Alameda 1-11 Introduction County of Alameda Environmental Justice Element 1-12 2 Environmental Justice Element County of Alameda 2. Priority Communities section two Priority Communities This section describes the methodology used to identify the five Priority Communities within unincorporated Alameda County \u2014 Ashland, Cherryland, Hayward Acres, Castro Valley, and San Lorenzo \u2014that are this EJ Element's focus. IT also describes the Priority Communities a nd establishes context in relation to this planning effort. Without their own municipal government s, unincorporated areas often lack the coordinated services available in incorporated cities and towns. The combination of environmental pollution, lack of ci ty government structure, and socioeconomic disparities impact s health and well -being in Alameda County's unincorporated Priority Communities. While the number of people living in poverty overall has decreased in the Priority Communities in the last ten years, the distribution of poverty still disproportionately impacts BIPOC community members (Alameda County Community Action Partnership 2022). This EJ Element seeks to address historical and environmental injustices in the Priority Communities through commun ity-driven policy and programmatic solutions. Priority Communities County of Alameda Environmental Justice Element 2-2 2.1 Methodology for Identifying Priority Communities The County identified the Priority Communities using the multi -step screening process described in the EJ Element guidelines released by the Governor's Office of Planning and Research ( OPR ) (OPR 2020). First, the County used CalEnviroScreen 4.0, a data tool developed by California Environmental Protection Agency's (CalEPA ) Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment (OEHHA ) (see definition and screenshot below in Figure 2-1). Table 2-1 lists the pollution burden and population characteristics used by the State to determine environmental impacts and to produce a numerical score for each census tract in the State (OEHHA 2022) . As defined in Senate Bill ( SB) 535 (de Leon 2012), a census tract that scores at or above 75 percent on the CalEnviroScreen tool is considered a disadvantaged community (also known as a \" DAC \"). Table 2-2 provides the total CalEnviroScreen score for each census tract in the Priority Communities (see the CalEnviroScreen 4.0 Percentile column). No census tracts in unincorporated Alameda County meet the SB 535 definition of a DAC. CalEnviroScreen CalEnviroScreen compiles many data sources to provide insight into the disparities between communities throughout the state. CalEnviroScreen uses Pollution Burden indicators and Population Characteristics to identify EJ communities. The resource is publicly available and offers planners and the general public an easily accessible way to understand the geographic distribution of various community and environmental characteristic s. Figure 2-1 dis plays a sample image of what the CalEnviroScreen 4.0 tool looks like when viewed on a desktop computer. Pollution burden represents the potential exposures to pollutants and the adverse environmental conditions caused by pollu tion. Pollution Burdens can impact public health, community exposure, and environmental quality (CalEnviroScree n). Population characteristics are indicators that represent biological traits, health status, or community characteristics that can increase pollution vulnerability (CalEnviro Screen). Percentiles vs. Percentages Percentages are different from percentiles . A percentage represents a number as a fraction of 100. For example, a student who takes an exam and answers 75 out of 100 questions correctly has earned a score of 75 percent (or 75%) on the exam. A percentile is a way of ranking things in ord er from 0 to 100. For example, a student that takes an exam and is placed in the 75th percentile means that the student earned a higher score than 75 percent of other students that took the same exam. Using percentiles is particularly helpful when discussi ng EJ, as it helps to understand which communities are more impacted than others and where injustices exist. This report uses percentile scores to compare conditions in one geographic area in relation to others. Communities in the top 25 percent of CalEnvi roScreen for a pollution burden mean that they score worse than at least 75 percent of other census tracts in the state.

As described in Chapter 1, 16 unincorporated area census tracts meet this definition and are collectively referred to as Priority Communities in this EJ Element. The Priority Communities are located within the central portion of the West County and represent all or portions of five distinct neighborhoods \u2014Ashland, Cherryland, Hayward Acres, Sa n Lorenzo, and Castro Valley . Table 2-3 provides a breakdown of how each census tract in these Priority Communities score for each pollution burden indicator. Score s of 75 or higher are highlighted in the table, as they indicate a disproportionate impact. As shown in Table 3-3, disproportionate impacts are found in pollution burdens related to cleanup sites , groundwater threats , hazardous waste , diesel particulate matter (PM) , traffic , and household lead contamination (see Glossa ry for definitions of each pollution indicator) . Section 3 discusses environmental impacts within the five Priority Communitie s associated with each of these pollution burdens.

Priority Communities County of Alameda Environmental Justice Element 2-6 2.2 Priority Communities Each of the five Priority Communities are described below and shown in Figure 2-2. Four of the Priority Communities \u2014 Ashland, Cherryland, Hayward Acres, and San Lorenzo - are in a region known as the \" Eden Area .\" This EJ Element compares data for the Priority Communities with data for Alameda County as a whole, including the fourteen incorporated cities, and, in the case of the Castro Valley and San Lorenzo Priority Communities, with data for the larger census desi gnated places (CDPs) . This comparison highlights disproportionate health outcomes and environmental burdens the Priority Communities face. Table 2-4 lists the tracts for each Priority Community. Then, where applicable, census tracts are paired with a CDP a nd/or the County (marked under the Reference Populations column). Overall, these pairings, or comparisons, serve as the framework that all tables and maps will use in Section 3. Ashland/Cherryland CDP data was collected for Ashland and Cherryland (not data by census tracts). Conversely, data by census tract was collected for Castro Valley, Hayward Acres, and San Lorenzo, as CDP statistics are unavailable. TABLE 2-4 Geographic Units for Priority Communities and Reference Populations Eden Area The Eden Area includes the unincorporated communities of Ashland, Hayward Acres , Cherryland, Fairview and San Lorenzo. While these areas vary widely in their populations and physical appearance, they have many commonalities , interconnected histories, and are interdependent economically (Eden Area General Plan 2010). Census Designated Place A CDP is a grouping of unincorporated census tracts locally recognized and identified by name (comparable to a city).

As shown in Figure 2-3, The community is roughly bounded by Hesperian Boulevard to the west, Interstate (I-) 580 to the east, 150th Avenue to the north, and San Lorenzo Creek to the south, where it meets the Cherryland community. Ashland is name d for the Oregon ash trees that once flourished there . In the 1890s , people could ride an electric streetcar from Oakland to Hayward, passing through Ashland's orchards and farms. By the 1930s, greenhouses and nurseries replaced most farms. The site of Bayfair Mall was once an automobile racetrack . Following World War II, the nurseries gradually led to housing developments for the community's booming population (Castro Valley/Eden Area Chamber of Commerce n.d.). In the 1950s, the Ashland, Cherryland , and San Lorenzo communities were divided by the construction of major inte rstate freeways, including I-580 and I-238, and State Route 185, which crosscut the community. The heavi ly trafficked freeways have exposed community members to pollutants and the resulting negative health effects \u2014a primary EJ issue for the Ashland communi ty (Final Report I-580 Design Alternatives Assessment 2020) . Today, Ashland is a diverse community. According to the American Community Survey, the area is home to a higher percentage of people who primarily speak a language other than English at home comp ared to the other Priority Communities (Alameda County Community Action Partnership 2022). Ashland has a population of about 24,000 people (as of the 2020 Census count), with the second -highest population density of the Priority Communities, after Hayward Acres (United States Census Bureau 2020). Ashland is primarily zoned for low- to medium -density residential with some areas of higher density; commerce is centered in the Ashland Cherryland Central Business District along the major arterial of E. 14 th Stre et. The REACH Ashland Youth Center is an active hub of the community, serving youth from all over Alameda County and playing host to several annual community events (Castro Valley/Eden Area Chamber of Commerce n.d.). Ashland is directly adjacent to the Bay fair Bay Area Rapid Transit ( BART ) Station, with direct lines to many nearby cities, including Oakland, San Francisco, and Fremont. Priority Communities Environmental Justice Element County of Alameda 2-9 SOURCE: ESA 20 23 FIGURE 2-3 Map of Ashland Priority Communities County of Alameda Environmental Justice Element 2-10 Cherryland Cherryland is an unincorporated community and CDP in Alameda County's Eden Area, directly north of Hayward. As shown in Figure 2-4, Foothill Boulevard borders the community to the east, San Lorenzo Creek to the north, the railroad tracks west of Meekland Avenue to the west, where it meets San Lorenzo, and A Street to the south. As with Ashland, the proximity of major freeways such as I-238 to the north, I-880 to the west, and I-580 to the northeast contributes to air and noise pollution , representing a primary EJ issue for Cherryland. Cherryland was named for the cherry orchards common in the area in the lat e 19th and early 20th cen turies. William Meek, whose historic mansion still stands on Hampton Road, owned the entire area from A Street to Lewelling Boulevard and Mission Boulevard to Meekland Aven ue, totaling almost 3,000 acre s. Around 1910, Meek's descendants began subdividing the property. Throughout the 1920s and 1930s, the orchards were replaced by homes with small orchards or chicken farms. Over the years, those small orchards and farms were sold to make way for more homes (Castro Valley/Eden Area Chamber of Commerce n.d.). Today, Cherryland has a population of 15,808 (U.S. Census Bureau 2020) . Like Ashland, Cherryland is home to a diverse population. A fter Ashland, Cherryland has the second largest percentage of the population who primarily speak a language other than English at home. Cherryland is zoned primarily for low - to medium -density residential with some areas of higher density; commerce is centered in the Ashland Cherryland Central Business District along the major arterial of Mission Boulevard. The Hayward Area Recreation and Parks District's new Cherryland Community Center features various community resources, including multi -use meeting spaces, a reception room, and a catering kit chen. Priority Communities Environmental Justice Element County of Alameda 2-11 SOURCE: ESA 20 23 FIGURE 2-4 Map of Cherryland Priority Com munities County of Alameda Environmental Justice Element 2-12 Hayward Acres Hayward Acres is an unincorporated community in Alameda County's Eden Area between San Lorenzo and the city of Hayward. The Hayward Acres Priority Community comprises a single census tract . As shown in Figure 2-5, Hesperian Boulevard borders the area on th e west, Hathaway Avenue on the east, Bartlett Avenue to the north, and West A Street to the south. The I-880 runs directly through the community in residential - zoned areas. As in Ashland and Cherryland, air and noise pollution exposure from I-880 are major EJ issues in the community of Hayward Acres (CalEnviroScreen 2022) . Hayward Acres is the smallest of all the Priority Communities yet has the highest population density. According to the 2019 American Community Survey, Hayward Acres has nearly 4,300 residents in only 0.24 square miles (Alameda County Community Action Partnership 2022) . Most of the community is zoned for medium -density residential at 12 units per acre, with some retail and commercial zoning on the western side of the community along Hesper ian Boulevard. Hayward Acres has the highest proportion of Latinx residents at almost 58 percent (Alameda County Community Action Partnership 2022). Priority Communities Environmental Justice Element County of Alameda 2-13 SOURCE: ESA 2023 FIGURE 2-5 Map of Hayward Acre s Priority Communities County of Alameda Environmental Justice Element 2-14 San Lorenzo San Lorenzo is an unincorporated community and CDP surrounded by Ashland and Cherryland to the east, San Leandro to the north, San Francisco Bay to the west, and the city of Hayward to the south. I-880 and Hesperian Boulevard run through the community's ea stern side. The San Lorenzo Priority Community comprises just one census tract, including the commercial core of San Lorenzo Village and surrounding residential development. As shown in Figure 2-6, the I-880 borders the community to the east, San Lorenzo C reek to the north, Washington Avenue and Via Alamitos to the west, and Via Manzanas and Hacienda Avenue to the south. San Lorenzo is located on the Rancho San Lorenzo Mexican land grant given to Don Guillermo Castro in 1841. From the mid -19th century to th e mid -20th century, San Lorenzo was mostly farmland and a significant center of production of fruit and flowers. Many early European colonizers were buried in Pioneer Cemetery, including Moses Wicks, who brought oysters from the East Coast to be \"planted\" in San Leandro Bay. In 1944, David Bohannon's Greenwood Company began constructing San Lorenzo Village, a planned community of two - and three -bedroom homes for workers in the East Bay's war industries. During much of the 1940s, the United States Navy began constructing much of the community in San Lorenzo, including planning for residential development, schools, churches, parks, and retail centers. The community has retained its legacy of a 'bedroom community' as it is mainly zoned for single -family residen tial uses. There are, however, commercial and retail zones along Hesperian Boulevard and industrial uses on the western side near the San Francisco Bay. The entire San Lorenzo CDP includes approximately 29,600 residents (U.S. Census Bureau 2021). The sin gle census tract that makes up the Priority Community includes approximately 5,543 residents. Over the last decade, San Lorenzo has seen the most dramatic demographic and economic changes out of the Priority Communities. These changes are characterized by an increase in Latinx and Asian populations and a simultaneous decrease in the poverty rate. The San Lorenzo Priority Community includes the commercial core of San Lorenzo Village and surrounding residential development. The San Lorenzo Library, located wi thin the San Lorenzo CDP just to the west of the San Lorenzo Priority Community, is a major hub for the community .

Priority Communities County of Alameda Environmental Justice Element 2-16 Castro Valley Castro Valley is the largest community in unincorporated Alameda County. It includes the urbanized Castro Valley CDP and the rural Castro Valley Canyonlands. As shown in Figure 2-7, the Castro Valley CDP is loosely bounded to the south by the unincorporated community of Fairview and the city of Hayward, to the west by Foothill Boulevard and I-580, to the north by Lake Chabot Regional Park and Cull Canyon Regional Recreation Area, and to the east by Crow Canyon, Eden Canyon, and Hollis Canyon . Castro Valley was known for ranching and chicken farming in the early 20th century unti l residential real estate development began urbanizing the community in the 1950s. As pictured in Figure 2-7, the census tracts cover ing the western and southern portions of Castro Valley have been identified as Priority Communities because they meet the d efinition of low -income areas particularly burdened by pollution. Almost half of all stationary sources of pollution in the Priority Communities are located in the Castro Valley priority census tracts, including gas stations and dry cleaners (Eden Area Com munity Profile 2013). Additionally, the I-580, running east -west through the Priority Community census t racts and north -south along the western boundary , contribute s to air pollution in the area. Today the entire Castro Valley CDP consists of approximat ely 66,500 residents ( U.S. Census Bureau 2021), and the census tracts that make up the Priority Communities include approximately 23,181 residents total . The community is primarily zoned for single -family residential homes and is mainly known as a commuter area, with many community members leaving daily for work, mainly in Oakland, Hayward, and San Francisco. Commuting from Castro Valley is assisted by the Castro Valley BART station. Many of those who work within the community are employed in the healthcare industry, particularly at the County's Fairmont Hospital and the Eden Medical Center and Hospital operated by Sutter Health. In addition to the many neighborhoods, the area also includes the Castro Valley Central Business District along Castro Valley Boul evard. In the Castro Valley Priority Community census tracts, the Castro Valley Library and Castro Valley Boulevard shopping areas are major hubs of community activity.

Priority Communities County of Alameda Environmental Justice Element 2-18 3 Environmental Justice Element County of Alameda 3. Existing Conditions section three Existing Conditions As the County seeks to address environmental and health hazards impacting the Priority Communities, it is necessary to first understand the population and socioeconomic conditions, as well as the existing environmental, social, and economic conditions, that affect community health and wellness. Historical inequalities have created unique issues and needs within the Priority Communities. This section presents an analysis of existing conditions in the Priority Communities, beginning with population and socioeconomic data, and then by EJ topic : Pollution and Air Quality, Public Facilities, Food Access, Safe and Sanitary Homes and Neighborhoods, Health and Physical Activity, and Civic Engagement. Existing Conditions County of Alameda Environmental Justice Element 3-2 Population and Socioeconomic Characteristics (Pre -pandemic) Population and socioeconomic characteristics are factors that often influence community health outcomes. Specifically, populations that face l ower educational attainment , linguistic isolation, poverty, unemployment, and housing burdens are often at a greater risk of experiencing poor health (California Environmental Justice Alliance 2018). Alameda County 's Priority Communities meet the state's EJ element criteria because they share some environmental, socioeconomic, and geographic factors. Many residents of the Priority Communities entered the COVID -19 pandemic already economically vulnerable. In particular, Ashland, Cherryland, and Hayward Acres had substantially higher rates of poverty and income deficiency, unemployment, and severe housing cost burden. More than 1 in 5 low -income households within Ashland, Cherryland, Hayward Acres, and the Castro Valley Priority Communities were paying more th an half of their income for housing costs. The Castro Valley Priority Community rates of poverty and income deficiency were also higher than the County average. It is important to note that these data were gathered between 2016 and 2020 ; therefore , the har mful economic impacts from the COVID -19 pandemic are not reflected in this section. This section makes a variety of comparisons between P riority Communitie s and Alameda County as a whole in order to highlight the disproportionate environmental burdens face d by the Priority Communitie s. This comparison process aims to show the immediate needs and changes required to thoroughly address all aspects of EJ. The data presented below also illustrate that although communities neighbor one another, community members experience dramatic differences in lifestyle, health, and overall wellbeing. Existing Conditions The existing conditions related to each of the six EJ topics are structured as follows: Context: Provides a brief introduction to the environmental justice topic to define what it is and why it is important for the Priority Communities. Existing Conditions: Describes the current impacts, burdens, and harms experienced by the Priority Communities incl uding health effects and access to resources. The existing conditions are separated into subsections that cover specific issues. Key Takeaways: Lists notable findings from the existing conditions analysis as they relate to each EJ topic. Information contained in this section informed the goals, policies, and actions in Section 4 of this EJ Element . Existing Conditions Environmental Justice Element County of Alameda 3-3 Population and Density The 2020 US Census found population gains in the Priority Communitie s that are roughly comparable to overall County growth. Figure 3-1 provides current population estimates and growth for the Priority Communitie s and Alameda County. As of 2020, the population of Alameda County was estimated to be 1,682,583, indicating a grow th of about 23.5 percent from 2000. In 2020, the combined population for the Priority Communities was 73,687, which is about 4.4 percent of the County's population. For the Priority Communitie s, growth ranged from about 7.8 percent in Castro Valley to abou t 25.4 percent in Hayward Acres.

NOTES: PC = Priority Community ; CDP = Census Designated Place FIGURE 3-1 Current Populations Estimates and Population Growth Race and Ethnicity Civil rights activist Benjamin Chavis coined the term \"environmental justice\" in 1982. The term refers, in part, to a form of systematic racism where the health hazards created from environmental policymaking disproport ionately impact BIPOC communities (Greenpeace USA). However, communities have experienced uneven impacts of environmental burdens and related health problems long before the creation of the term. Building upon extensive research in the field of public health and environmental science, the California Environmental Protection Agency's OEHHA and their CalEnvironScreen4.0 tool, exhibit the extent to which communities experience health problems due to their proximity and exposure to hazardous pollutants. The residents of the Priority Communitie s are predo minantly non -White, with a signifi cant concentration of Latinx peoples . Table 3-1 provides 2020 Census numbers for race and ethnicity in the Priority Communities and Alameda County overall . All the Priority Communities have higher percentages of Latinx residents than the County 's overall r ate of 23.4 percent ; the Latinx population represents the largest group in all Priority Communitie s except the Castro Valley census tracts, where most residents are White. Cherryland and Hayward Acres census tracts are predominantly Latinx with 58.1 percen t and 64.3 percent , respecti vely.

The African American population within the Priority Communitie s is also substantial, with the County rate of 9.8 percent , Ashland at 16.6 percent , and Hay ward Acres and the Castro Valley both at approximately 12 percent . While Asian residents represent a sizable portion of the population in most of the Priority Communitie s, they are a lower percentage than the County overall of 32.4 percent in all the Prior ity Communities , except San Lorenzo. Native Hawaiians and other Pacific Islanders are more prevalent in the Priority Communitie s than in the County overall. Educational Attainment Education al attainment refers to the highest level of education that a perso n has completed. Formal educational attainment, as measured by the final degree or certificate earned for those over 25 years of age, is highly correlated with better health outcomes. According to the OEHHA, pe ople with more educational attainment tend to have higher incomes and health insurance and tend to live in areas that are less affected by air pollution and other environmental toxins. Table 3-2 presents five educational attainment indicators for the Priority Communitie s, ranging from less than a high -school education at the lowest, through a graduate or professional degree at the highest. As shown in Table 3-2, the percentage of the population without a high school education is considerably higher than the overall County percentage of 11.2 in all but one of the Priority Communitie s (Castro Valley Priority Community and CDP Reference). About 22 percent of Hayward Acres residents, and about 26 percent of both Ashland and Cherryland residents , have not obtained a high school diploma, while for the San Lorenzo Priority Community , the rate was 12.9 percent . The Castro Valley Priority Communitie s rates matched the County rate of 11.2 percent of residents without a high school diploma.

Poverty and Income The Census Bureau's definition of poverty varies by household size. In 2022, the Federal Poverty level for an average family of four is $27,750, and $13,590 for a one -person household. Table 3-3 provides median income and estimates of the percentage of households living below the federal poverty line. According to the Census Bureau, the median household income for Alameda County was approximately $104, 888. Among the Priority Communities, median household incomes vary from $66,570 in Ashland to $106,667 in the San Lorenzo Priority Community. In data collected between 2016 and 2020, the percent age of the population with incomes below the federal poverty l evel in all the Priority Communities was higher than County overall rate of 9.3 percent , except the San Lorenzo Priority Community at 6.5 percent . Poverty was significantly higher than the County average in Ashland at 15.4 percent , and fairly high in Haywa rd Acres (14.4 percent ), Ashland (14.9 percent ) and the Castro Valley Priority Community (12.7 percent ). It is important to note that because these data were collected during 2016 -2020, they do not reflect the economic harm caused by COVID -19.

The Castro Valley Priority Community was somewhat higher than the County Average at 22.8 percen t. The San Lorenzo Priority Community rate was lower than the County rate at 18.3 percent . Severe Housing Cost Burden The U .S. Department of Housing and Urban Development ( HUD ) defines households paying 30 percent or more of their income for housing costs as \"Housing Cost Burdened\" and those paying 50 percent or more as \"Severely Housing Cost Burdened.\" HUD recognizes that the burden of housing costs has a larger impact on households with lower incomes ; therefore , Housing Cost Burden is usually reported within various income levels. Table 3-4 prese nts low -income households that are severely housing cost burdened. A higher percentile score translates to a greater housing cost burden. Low Income is defined as 80 perce nt of area median income ( AMI ), or $89, 600 for a family of four. The percent age of severely housing cost burdened low -income households was substantially higher than the County rate of 15.7 percent in all of the Priority Communitie s except the San Lorenzo tract, ranging from 20 percent in Cherryland to 23 percent in Ashland.

Existing Conditio ns County of Alameda Environmental Justice Element 3-8 Unemployment and Labor Force Participation According to the OEHHA, unemployment results in a lack of access to health care and insurance, leading to poor health. Poor health can make it harder to find a job, stay employed, and can be a source of financial and emotional stress. Generally, participation in the formal workforce is viewed through two measurements: 1. Labor Force Participation (how many of those eligible to work are working or seeking work) 2. Unemployment (how many of those participating in the labor force are out of work and looking for work) Table 3-5 presents unemployment rates for the Priority Communitie s and Alameda County as a whole . Labor force participation between Alameda County and the Priority Communitie s are roughly within the same range between about 70 percent and 80 percent . However, when looking at unemployment rates, residents in Ashland, Cherryland, and Hayward Acres experience higher unemployment rates \u2014nearly double that of the County. These data were gathered prior to the COVID -19 pandemic and , therefore , do not accurately reflect the impact from the pandemic on the current economy.

Existing Conditions Environmental Justice Element County of Alameda 3-9 Sensitive Populations CalEnviroScreen 4.0 defines sensitive populations as populations with physiological conditions that result in increased vulnerability to pollutants. Sensitive individuals may include those with impaired physiological conditions, such as people with heart disease or asthma. T he CalEnviroScreen 4.0 Sensitive Population Indicators identify higher rates of asthma, heart disease, and infants with low birth weight in the Priority Communities . Pollution exposure and limited access to health care, healthy foods, and physical activity are likely contributors to these outcomes. Data pertaining to the CalEnviroScreen 4.0 S ensitive Population Indicators throughout the unincorporated communities are included below. ASTHMA Asthma is a condition that can make it difficult to breathe. Some in dividuals with asthma may experience minor symptoms such as coughing while others could experience major problems that can limit their ability to enjoy daily activities. In severe cases , it can lead to life -threatening asthma attacks. Asthma cannot be cure d, but its symptoms can be treated. Air pollutants, exhaust fumes, and chemical irritants are thought to increase chances of developing asthma. Common triggers for asthma include exposure to air pollution and contaminants and physical activity. However, al though asthma inflames the airways, regular exercise can actually decrease inflammation and improve lung capacity. Table 3-6 shows rates of emergency department visits for asthma. These rates are substantially higher in Hayward Acres, Cherryland, and Ashland than in the overall County. The rate for the San Lorenzo Priority Community is slightly higher than that of the County and comparable to San Lorenzo as a whole. For the Castro Valley Priority Community, the asthma rate is lower than that of the County but higher than that of Castro Valley as a whole.

Several factors can contribute to cardiovascular disease such as poor diet or lack of access to healthy foods, smoking, lack of safe a nd affordable spaces to recreate, and exposure to air pollution. Table 3-7 provides the rates of emergency department visits for heart attacks, which are considerably higher in Cherryland, Hayward Acres, and the San Lorenzo Priority Communities than the County. The rate of cardiovascular disease in Ashland, while higher than that of the County, is lower than the other areas. The rate in the Castro Valley Priority Community is comparable to that of the County.

Existing Conditions County of Alameda Environmental Justice Element 3-12 Pollution and Air Quality Context Healthy environments, at home and in a community, contribute to our individual and collective health and wellbeing. A healthy environment is integral to the full enjoyment of basic human rights. According to the United Nations Environment Programme, air po llution is the world's largest single environmental risk to health (some 7 million people across the world die each year due to everyday exposure to poor air quality) (UN Environment Programme 2022 ). In the Priority Communities , air pollution ranks as the most significant source of pollution. Soil and water contamination also pose a risk to the Priority Communities , as discussed below. The concentration of a pollutant and its proximity to populations determine the level of exposure. Places next to high -traffic roads and industrial facilities typically have higher levels, or concentrations, of air pollutants. Places next to hazardous or solid waste facilities may have higher concentrations of soil and groundwater pollutio n. Community members within Alameda Co unty do not experience the exposure to or protection from hazards and contaminants in equitable proportions. Due to historic and existing discriminatory housing and planning policies, communities of color and low -income communities are more likely to be lo cated next to and directly affected by pollution and poor air quality. And not everyone reacts to air pollution the same way. Sensitive populations such as children, the elderly and those with prior health conditions are more vulnerable to the effects of p ollution. Exposure to pollution can cause, or worsen, negative health outcomes, making people too sick to go to work, go to school, or simply go outside. Reducing pollution and improving the quality of the air, water and soil are vital to ensur ing that hea lthy environments are accessible to all. Identifying sources, quantities , and types of pollution in a community is a critical step in creating policy that reduces pollution. This section explores local levels of air, water , and soil pollution, and the heal th risks associated with that pollution . It also provides perspectives from the community on this topic and describes existing policies and programs working to mitigate the impacts of pollution in the Priority Communities . Existing Conditions Environmental Justice Element County of Alameda 3-13 Air Pollution Air quality refers to how clean or polluted the air is. Air pollution is defined as the contamination of air due to the presence of a substance that has harmful effects. Air quality has a significant impact on a community's health outcomes. According to th e World Health Organization, exposure to air pollution can lead to serious conditions such as strokes, lung cancer, and heart disease. Often, pollution exposure is dependent on the distance between pollution sources and homes, workplaces, and transit route s. There are four types of air pollution sources : Mobile sources such as cars, trucks, trains, planes, and buses Stationary sources such as power plants, oil refineries, and industrial facilities Agricultural areas, cities, and wood -burning fireplaces Natural sources such as wildfires and wind -blown dust Many air pollutants are regulated by state, federal, and local agencies such as the Bay Area Air Quality Management District (BAAQMD ). The main pollutants of concern for the Priority Communities are dies el particulate matter (\"diesel PM\") and pollution resulting from traffic density. Figure 3-2 shows the three air pollution indicators by percentile : diesel PM, traffic impacts, and toxic releases . Diesel PM and traffic impacts are disproportionate in the Priority Communities and represent the key air pollution sources in the area. The Priority Communities are in the 85th percentile on average for diesel PM, while the overall County is in the 65th percentile for diesel PM. In other words: compared to all el igible census tracts in California, the Priority Community census tracts are within the top 20 percent for exposure to diesel PM. San Lorenzo, Castro Valley, and Ashland are in th e 95th, 75th, and 69th per centiles for Traffic Density/Impacts, respectively. By co ntrast, between the 47th and 52nd percentiles, toxi c releases in the Priority Communities average just below the state median and are not considered disproportionate as compared with the overall county . Existing Conditions County of Alameda Environmental Justice Element 3-14 SOURCE: CalEnviroScreen 4.0 NOTE: Statistics are presented as population -based weighted average of percentile data from CalEnviroScreen 4.0. FIGURE 3-2 Air Pollution Indicators by Percentile Diesel Particulate Matter Diesel PM is a complex mixture of extremely small particles and gases . Diesel PM pollution is made up of hundreds of different chemicals released into the air as exhaust from trucks, buses, trains, ships, and other equipment that use diesel engines. Exposure to diesel PM is most common in cities and industrial areas near ports, rail yards, and freeways. The smal l partic les can travel deeper into the lung s caus ing eye irritation, throat and heart disease, and lung cancer. Figure 3-2 shows Ashland in th e 97th percentile and both San Lorenzo and Hayward Acres in t he 90th per centile for diesel PM pollution ( CalEnviroScreen 4.0 2022). Children, the elderly, and people suffering from cardiopulmonary disease, asthma, and chronic illness are the most vulnerable to diesel PM exposure. Traffic Density Traffic density is a measurement that records the number of vehicles that utilize roadways. Measuring traffic density gives insight into the impacts that result from vehicle traffic , including air pollution. This pollution contributes to negative health ou tcomes for individuals living near areas with high traffic density. As shown in Figure 3-2, San Lorenzo, Castro Valley, and Ashland are placed in the 95th, 75th, and 69th percentiles for Traffic Density/Impacts, respectively (CalEnviroScreen 4.0 2022) .

Po llution from these sources can come from cleanup sites, hazardous waste facilities, and solid waste sites. Exposure to this type of pollution is a result of historical land use incompatibility and a high concentration of industrial facilities near resident ial areas, schools, parks, and healthcare facilities. Within the Priority Communities, there are two soil and water pollution indicators that are disproportionally higher than other census tracts in the state. These indicators are hazardous waste generator s/facilities and groundwater threats , as described in the following paragraphs . HAZARDOUS WASTE GENERATORS AND FACILITIES Hazardous waste comes from sites that contain waste that is dangerous or potentially harmful to human health or the environment. Hazar dous waste is generated from many sources, ranging from industrial manufacturing waste to batteries. This dangerous waste may come in many forms, including liquids, solids, gases, and sludges. EPA and the Department of Toxic Substance Control (DTSC) have s tandards for when waste materials must be treated as hazardous waste. Hazardous waste is typically stored in hazardous waste generators in permitted disposal/recycling facilities. DTSC has a public database, EnviroStor, that lists permitted facilities invo lved in treating, storing, and disposing of hazardous waste. WATER POLLUTION AND GROUNDWATER THREATS Water pollution occurs when harmful substances, often chemicals or microorganisms, contaminate a body of water, degrading the water quality and rendering i t toxic to humans or the environment. Although natural occurrences can cause water contamination, a considerable amount of water contamination originates from human activity. Some sources of water contamination that originate from human activity include se wage, pesticides, and chemicals from industrial operations (CDC 2022). Groundwater threats are an indicator of water pollution. Groundwater is water held underground in the soil or beneath the land surface. Common soil and groundwater pollutants include g asoline and diesel fuels at gas stations, as well as solvents, heavy metals, and pesticides. While the Priority Communities' drinking water does not come from groundwater but from surface water from the Mokelumne River watershed in the Sierra Nevada and supplied by the East Bay Municipal Utility District (EBMUD), EBMUD's service area, including the Priority Communities, overlies a groundwater basin known as the East Bay Plain Subbasin. This subbasin may act as a supplemental source of water supply to help p rotect EBMUD customers against severe water rationing in the event of a prolonged extreme drought or emergency, so groundwater threats in the area of the subbasin have potential to impact the Priority Communities and the larger region. Existing Conditions County of Alameda Environmental Justice Element 3-16 Like the County over all, the Priority Communities rank higher than much of the state for groundwater threats. Groundwater threats are significant in Ashland, Castro Valley, and Cherryland, ranging from the 70th to 80th percentiles. Figure 3-3 shows groundwater threats as a water pollution indicator by percentile alongside hazardous waste threats as a soil pollution indicator. CalEnviroScreen 4.0 groundwater threat scores are based on information about the type of site and how close it is to ne ighborhoods where people live. The Priority Community census tracts average at about the 71st percentile, meaning that these census tracts are within the top 30 percent of groundwater -threatened communities in the state.

Asthma rates are substantia lly higher for Hayward Acres, Cherryland, and Ashland when compared to the county as a whole. Groundwater threats within Ashland, Castro Valley, and Cherryland fall withing the 70th to 80th percentiles according to CalEnviroScreen 4.0, meaning that the thr eats faced by these communities are disproportionate when compared to the rest of the state. Existing Conditions County of Alameda Environmental Justice Element 3-18 Access to Public Facilities Context Senate Bill 1000 , the legislation that guides the development of this EJ Element, broadly defines \"public facilities\" to include \"public improvements, public services, and community amenities\" such as parks, public schools, public transportation, and basic infrastructure (see Table 3-9 for a more comprehensive list) . Public facilities provide communities with valuable opportunities that promote childhood development, safety, health, and community engagement. TABLE 3-9 Examples of Public Facilities PUBLIC SERVICES COMMUNITY AMENITIES PUBLIC IMPROVEMENTS Transit services and facilities Hospitals and emergency medical/trauma centers Emergency services and public safety Government buildings Parks, open space, trails, and greenbelts Recreation facilities (including senior and youth centers) and community centers Daycare centers Libraries, museums, cultural centers, science centers Water distribution, treatment, and drainage facilities Solid waste, liquid waste, recycling, and composti ng facilities Streets and roads Public utilities Flood control structures Compared to the rest of the County, the Priority communities have disproportionately low access to and utilization of public facilities (HPI) (2020) . Public facilities play an important role in the health and overall well - being of community members. Establ ishing equitable access to public facilities through policy and programmatic improvements can help ensure that all community members are able to experience their benefits. In order to create policy that makes a measurable impact, we must first understand t he issues surrounding access to public facilities in the P riority Communitie s. This section will discuss access to a range of public facilities in Alameda County . Access to parks, recreation and open spaces is described in the Health and Physical Activitie s section as it relates more directly to that topic. Existing Conditions Environmental Justice Element County of Alameda 3-19 Parks, Recreation, and Open Space Parks are natural or semi -natural open spaces set aside for outdoor recreation, leisure, or preservation. Parks are important because they provide community gathering spaces, valuable greenspace, and many more benefits to community members wellbeing. The Hayward Area Recreation and Park District ( HARD ) and the East Bay Reg ional Park District ( EBRPD ) provide parks, open space, and recreation services within the Priority Communities and in the surrounding area. As of July 2021, there were 19 officially designated public parks within or immediately adjacent to the Priority Com munities. Most of them are less than 12 acre s in size (roughly equivalent to 7 soccer fields) and are relatively small in comparison to parks in surrounding communities. The Castro Valley Priority Community census tracts are adjacent to two large regional parks, Lake Chabot Regional Park (approximately 1,755 acre s) and Don Castro Regional Recreation Area (approximately 101 acre s), both operated by EBRPD.

The California Healthy Places Index (HPI), a public database used in the field of public health to assess conditions contributing to health or disease by place, sets a standard of park proximity at 0.5 miles for al l residents. These standards may not be sufficient in low -income urban neighborhoods where other recreational opportunities are limited for residents and where physical and social barriers to pedestrian mobility frequently occur. For example, residents who live more than 0.5 miles from a quality park may experience the distance as a physical barrier (especially seniors, people with disabilities, and people without access to a reliable means of transportation). Low -income neighborhoods also have fewer resour ces than wealthier communities to subsidize recreational programs like intramural sports and organized recreational events like 5K races and maratho ns. Table 3-10 displays both park proximity (the percentage of residents living within 0.25 miles and 0.5 miles of a park) and park access (park acreage per 1,000 people) for the Priority Communities. More than 90 percent of residents of 3 of the 5 Priority Community census tracts live within 0.5 miles of a park, while Cherryland Existing Conditions Environmental Justice Element County of Alameda 3-21 (86.6 percent ) and the San Lorenzo Priority Community (79.2 percent ) fall below that mark.

NOTE: Parks under development or newer parks, such as HARD's Via Toledo Park, are not reflected in these data. Access to parks measured by park acreage per 1,000 residents tells us how much park land is available within each Priority Community. There are no parks at all within Hayward Acres or the San Lorenzo Priority Community, although there are parks nearby. Ashland offers 0.24 acre s of parks for every 1,000 residents, while Cherrylan d offers 0.74 acre s per 1,000 people. None of the Priority Communities meets the requirements for the Quimby Act (3 acre s of park for every 1,000 residents). HARD has initiated a community outreach process to solicit input on plans for four new parks along an approximately 1 .5-mile stretch of the East 14th Street/Mission Boulevard corridor, between 159th Avenue and Mattox Road in Ashland: the Ashland -Mateo Street Neighborhood Park, Ashland Common, Ashland -East 14th Street Park, and Mission & Mattox Park. Th ese new facilities will range in size from 0.8 to 2.6 acre s. HARD will also construct and operate a new community center in the Madrone Terrace housing development on East 14th, adjacent to the planned Ashland -East 14th Street Park. In addition, HARD is wo rking with the Alameda County Public Works Agency to confirm funding for a multi -use trail along San Lorenzo Creek that will connect the Bay Trail in the west to Don Castro Park in the east. Public Transportation Access Access to safe, reliable public tran sportation is essential to urban life and is especially important when automotive transport is not available or financially attainable for residents. For many, public transportation is necessary for commuting to work or school and for accessing essential s ervices such as medical care and shopping. Transit access has been linked to better physical and mental health, increased physical activity, lower unemployment, better access to medical care, and greater resilience during disasters. At the same time, quali ty public transportation lessens automotive dependency, decreasing greenhouse gas emissions and unhealthy automotive exhaust locally. Existing Conditions County of Alameda Environmental Justice Element 3-22 The Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) rail system is the main regional public transportation system in the Bay Area, providing direct access to San Francisco, Oakland, Fremont and other major employment centers in the Bay Area. Few residents of the Priority Communities are within walkable distance to a BART station. Figure 3-5 shows locations for BART stations and bus stops in an d near the Priority Communities. Table 3-11 identifies the percentage of the population of each Priority Community within 0.25 miles (approximately a 5 -minute walk) and 0.5 miles (approximately a 10 -minute walk) of BART and bus stops. The Bayfair BART station is located within the city of San Leandro, adjacent to the northern boundary of Ashland, and the Hayward BART station is within the city of Hayward, approximately 0.5 miles south of Cherryland. The Castro Valley BART station is near the cente r of the Castro Valley Priority Community. About one quarter of residents of the Castro Valley Priority Community live within 0.5 miles of the Castro Valley BART station, and 14 percent of Ashland residents live within 0.5 mile s of the Bayfair station. The remainder of the residents of the Priority Communities do not live within walking distance of a BART station. The Alameda -Contra Costa Transit District ( AC Transit ) is a public transit agency that provides bus service to western Alameda and Contra Costa Counties, including to the Priority Communities. The percentage of Priority Community residents within 0.25 mile s of an AC Transit Bus Stop ranges from approximately 77 percent in Hayward Acres to 95 percent in the San Lorenzo Priority Communities. In 3 of the 5 communities, less than 80 percent of the population live within 0.25 miles of a bus stop.

California Highway Patrol (CHP ) provides traffic enforcement on county roads, state routes, and interstate freeways in the Priority Communities, and the Hayward Police, San Leandro Police, and other neighboring jurisdictions provide mutual aid to the Sheriff for seri ous crimes in the Priority Communities . CRIME HOT SPOTS Crime activity, such as property theft and assaults, can have significant impacts on the health and well -being of communities. Crime activity is also associated with poor social cohesion and premature death rates. ACSO reports Alameda County crime data through the Alameda County Data Sharing Initiative Database. For the 2020 calendar year, ACSO reported 7,839 total crimes in the five Priority Communities . In ACSO's entire service area, which includes a ll unincorporated areas of Alameda County, ACSO reported 10,112 crimes in the 2020 calendar year. In other words, approximately 77 percent of crimes reported by ACSO in unincorporated Alameda County in 2020 occurred in the Priority Communities. Existing Conditions County of Alameda Environmental Justice Element 3-24 Table 3-12 identifies the number of reported crimes and crime rates for the Priority Communities and the overall ACSO service area , which includes all of unincorporated Alameda County. Data are presented at the CDP or community level (in the case of Hayward Acres), a nd Priority Community census tract data are not disaggregated for the purposes of this table.

Of the five communities, only Ashland and Cherryland have crime rates that are higher than those of the overall unincorporated ASCO service area (96 in Ashland and 77 in Cherryland as compared to 66 for the entire ASCO service area ). Castro Valley and San Lorenzo have crime rates that are significantly lower than ACSO's overall service area, while the rate for Hayward Acres is somewhat lower . PROXIMITY TO LAW ENFORCEMENT STATIONS Proximity to law enforcement (Sheriff or Police) stations can have an impact on the health and wellbeing of communities. Living in a safe neighborhood, equitably protected by local authorities, can influence healthy choices and behaviors, increase the perception of community safety, and reduce the total crime rate across the community. While law enforcement may increase feelings of safety for some community members, the presence of law enforcement may also feel threating or oppressive, particularly for BIPOC community members and members of historically m arginalized communities. Figure 3-6 shows the nearest police stations and Sheriff stations to the Priority Communities. There are two law enforcement stations within a 1 -mile radius of the Priority Communities. The Eden Township Sheriff's Substation is located in the northwesternmost corner of Castro Valley's Priority Community, near Castro Valley's border with Ashland and the city of San Leandro. The Hayward Police station is located in the city of Hayward near the border of Cherryland. While not having patrol responsibilities in the Priority Communities, the Hayward Police jurisdiction is adjacent to the community of Cherryland and the Hayward Police department has a close working relationship with ASCO.

Alameda Coun ty's law enforcement landscape in the Priority Communities includes the Alameda County Deputy Sheriffs' Activities League (DSAL), a nonprofit organization that seeks to build trust by connecting Alameda County Sheriff's Office (ACSO) personnel, residents, and youth in positive experiences that enhance the health of the community. DSAL's approach to policing is guided by the Community Capitals Framework, which prioritizes strategic investments in the community's natural, human, social, economic, built, polit ical, and cultural capitals. Within the Priority Communities, DSAL provides free or low -cost programs related to health and wellness. Programs include a food hub and food distribution events, re -entry internships in urban farming and food production, a you th soccer league, and other sports, music, dance , and fitness classes held at local schools and community facilities. Existing Conditions County of Alameda Environmental Justice Element 3-26 Schools The Priority Communities are served by three school districts. The San Lorenzo Unified School District serves all of San Lorenzo a nd Ashland, the northern portion of Cherryland, and most of El Portal Ridge along the western boundary of the Castro Valley Priority Community. The Hayward Unified School District serves the southern portion of Cherryland and the Castro Valley Priority Com munity census tracts south of I-580. Castro Valley Unified School District serves the remainder of the Castro Valley Priority Community Census Tracts north of I-580. Safe, walkable routes to schools are important contributors to community health, providing physical activity daily to children and their parents as an integral part of the school commute, and reducing automobile trips to and from schools. As Figure 3-4 shows, there are large areas within the Priority Communities that are without walkable access to schools.

Existing Conditions County of Alameda Environmental Justice Element 3-28 Key Takeaways None of the Priority Communi ties, except for the Castro Valley CDP), meet s the requirements for the Quimby Act, which established a state standard of 3 acre s of parks for every 1,000 residents A majority of residents of the Priority Community do not live within a walkable distance to a BART station. In 2020 approximately 58 percent of crimes reported in Alameda County were in the Priority Communities , and the Priority Communities report almost 9 times more crimes than the County as a whole. There are three police stations within a 1 -mile radius of the Priority Communities ; however, none is stationed in any of the 16 census tracts. Existing Conditions Environmental Justice Element County of Alameda 3-29 Safe and Sanitary Homes & Neighborhoods Context Safe and sanitary homes, neighborhoods and living conditions are an integral part of healthy living environments. Housing location, quality, affordability, and stability are directly related to an individual's quality of life. Ensuring that all community m embers can live in safe and sanitary homes and neighborhoods is an important part of EJ. The Priority Communities experience exposure to and harm from unsafe and unsanitary housing conditions and neighborhoods. Hazardous building materials, inadequate insu lation, air quality and filtration issues, mold, and poor building maintenance, trash and unsanitary street conditions can lead to serious health concerns for these Alameda County residents. In order to create policy that improves the health and safety of homes and neighborhoods, we first must understand the conditions of homes and neighborhoods in the Priority Communities . This section will discuss housing characteristics and summarize community input pertaining to the topic of safe and sanitary homes. Existing Conditions County of Alameda Environmental Justice Element 3-30 Household Characteristics/Tenure Housing tenure refers to whether households own or rent their primary residence. Households that rent their homes have limited control over rent price changes, which puts the stability of their living situation at risk. Add itionally, renters have restricted influence when it comes to the quality and maintenance of their homes. In areas of high housing demand, some landlords may ignore making housing repairs in order to drive tenants out more quickly and resell or re -lease th e property for a higher profit. Because of these factors, areas with large populations of renters face issues of housing security, affordability, and safe living conditions. These impacts are important to acknowledge because they affect community mental he alth, physical health, safety , and quality of life. Table 3-23 provides the percentage of home owners and renters in the Priority Communities . The majority of the residents of the Priority Communities are renters, with the sole exception of San Lorenzo, where 75 percent of households own their home. The highest concentrations of renter -occupied homes are found in Hayward Acres (84.7 percent ), Cherryland (75.4 percent ) and Ashland (63.8 percent ). The Ca stro Valley Priority Community has a majority of renters at 56.9 percent . By comparison, County housing tenure overall is 53.5 percent owner occupied, and 46.5 percent renter occupied.

Existing Conditions Environmental Justice Element County of Alameda 3-31 Children's Lead Risk from Housing Lead is a toxic metal that has been used in many products over time. Even in small amounts, lead can have harmful effects on the body, which may lead to lifelong learning, behavioral, reproductive, cardiovascular, and other health problems. Children under six years old are at greatest risk of harmful health effects from lead poisoning, both because age -appropr iate behaviors are more likely to cause children to ingest lead and because lead impacts the development of the brain and nervous systems of growing childre n. Lead exposure is not equal for all children. In Alameda County, children from BIPOC and low -incom e households continue to bear a disproportionate burden of lead exposure primarily through contact with deteriorating lead -based paint from older housin g. The lead risk indicator consists of a score that combines the percentage of households within each Pr iority Community that have a likelihood of lead -based paint hazards from the age of housing with the percentage of households that are both low -income and have children under 6 years old. Higher scores indicate a higher lead risk to children . Table 3-24 summarizes the scores and percentiles for each geography. The percentiles, which rank the scores on a scale of 1 to 100, provide a useful means of comparing the relative risk of lead exposure between communities.

San Lorenzo and Castro Valley CDP Reference and Alameda County Reference are presented as household -based weighted average of census tracts within CDP or County boundary. With the exception of the Castro Valley Priority Community, children in the Priority Communities have a higher risk of lead exposure than in the County as a whole. All the Priority Community census tracts are within the top 30 percent statewide for children's lead risk. While the Castro Valley Priority Community ranks lower in risk than other Priority Communities, it has a substantially higher score than Castro Valley as a whole, suggesting key differences in the combination of older homes, low -income households, and young chil dren in the Priority Community census tracts compared to the reference population in Castro Valley. Existing Conditions County of Alameda Environmental Justice Element 3-32 Housing Overcrowding The Census Bureau defines overcrowded households as dwellings that house more than one occupant per room (excluding bathrooms). Dwellings housing more than 1.5 occupants per room are considered severely overcrowded . Overcrowded housing conditions contribute to poor health outcomes, deterioration of housi ng stock, lowered academic achievement in children, and other concerns. During the pandemic, overcrowded housing conditions are presumed to have contributed to the spread of COVID -19 in lower -income communities and communities of color in Alameda County. Overcrowded housing is quite common in the Priority Communities . Four of the five Priority Communities exceed the County average of 5 percent overcrowded households. Ashland and Cherryland more than double the County average. In Hayward Acres, there are thr ee times as many overcrowded units, per 100, when compared to the County overall. Only the Castro Valley Priority Community , at 4.6 percent , is below the County rate of 5 percent . Severe overcrowding occurs at comparatively high rates in Ashland, Cherrylan d and Hayward Acres. Table 3-25 provides the percent age of households that are overcrowded and extremely overcrowded. It is important to acknowledge that there can be a cultural component to overcrowding, as many cultures value multigenerational households .

Existing Conditions Environmental Justice Element County of Alameda 3-33 Key Takeaways The majority of the residents of the Priority Communities are renters, with the sole exception of San Lorenzo. Communities with high populations of renters face issues with housing security, affordability, and safe living conditions. With the exception of the Castro Vall ey Priority Community, all the Priority Communities have a higher lead risk to children than the County as a whole. Overcrowded housing is quite common in the Priority Communities. Four of the five Priority Communities exceed the County average of 5 percen t overcrowded households. It is important, however, to acknowledge that there can be a cultural component to overcrowding, as many cultures value multigenerational households. Existing Conditions County of Alameda Environmental Justice Element 3-34 Access to Healthy Food Context Healthy food access means that we can safely and easily get to sources of nutritious, high -quality food (e.g., fresh fruits and vegetables, meats with lower fat content, and wholegrains) that fit our cultural preferences and budgets. Healthy food is essent ial to the health, economy, and culture of thriving and sustainable communities. Access to both healthy and affordable food sources affect quality of life. And food access goes beyond just the physical ability to get both nutritious and culturally appropri ate food, but also the knowledge that access to these food sources is dependable. When we can't reliably get enough nutritious food, we may turn to the most affordable, accessible, and filling foods we can find, such as fast food or highly processed snack -foods and beverages, which tend to be high in calories, sodium, sugars, and additives and low in nutrients. These foods can put us at risk for chronic health conditions such as Type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease, hypertension, asthma, and some types of ca ncer. Creating consistent opportunities for people within the Priority Communities to buy, prepare, and eat healthy food is important in promoting equity. In order to create policy that improves access to healthy foods for the Priority Com munities , we must first understand the issues surrounding this topic for the Priority Communities . This section provides information related to food insecurity, access to grocery stores, and urban agriculture in the Priority Communities. Existing Condit ions Environmental Justice Element County of Alameda 3-35 Food Insecurity Food insecurity can be defined as a lack of consistent access to food for every person in a household to live an active, healthy life. Poverty, unemployment, race, and housing cost burden are associated with food insecurity, indicating that food security is likely to be a concern for some Priority Community residents. People impacted by food insecurity may not know when or where they will get their next meal and may need to choose between buying food and other critical expenses like rent or medic ine. According to the Alameda County Community Food Bank ( ACCFB ), \"Food insecurity and poor nutrition cause harmful outcomes in all stages of life, including poor physical, emotional and developmental outcomes.\" Food insecurity can exacerbate, or increase the risk of, diet-sensitive illnesses like diabetes and high blood pressure. An over -supply of unhealthy food options (foods high in calories, sodium, sugars, and additives) in a community can also contribute to higher rates of diet -sensitive diseases. Businesses offering unhealthy food items are often over -concentrated in BIPOC and lower -income communities, while these same communities are less likely to have access to outlets like grocery stores that offer healthy foods (fresh fruits and vege tables, whole grains, meats with lower fat content.) This disparity impacts community and individual health and wellness and can contribute to economic and public health challenges. Access to Grocery Stores One key indicator of healthy food access is the density of fuller -service food stores such as supermarkets or healthy food outlets like farmers' markets. Living near a supermarket or farmers' market can encourage better nutrition, lower costs of obtaining food, reduce chronic diseases, and lower the ris k of food insecurity. Figure 3-5 displays farmers' markets and fuller -service food stores such as supermarkets and grocery stores in and near the Priority Communities. There are notable gaps in the Castro Valley Priority Community and Cherryland. It is imp ortant to acknowledge that farmers' markets have limited hours and days of operations, and some of the food outlets on the map may not provide culturally appropriate foods that appeal to the entire diverse population of the area. Table 3-26 shows the perce ntage of residents living within 0.5 miles of a grocery store/ supermarket or fuller - service food store. Only 30.1 percent of Cherryland residents live within walking distance of a grocery store . That proportion is 60.0 percent in the Castro Valley Priority Community census tracts, and 76.7 percent in Ashland .

Existing Conditions Environmental Justice Element County of Alameda 3-37 Local Food Production Local food production in home gardens, community gardens, and urban farms can improve access to fresh fruits, vegetables and culturally appropriate foods and can increase household food and nutritional security. In addition to its direct benefits related t o food access, local food production is associated with many co-benefits including access to open space, improved mental and physical health, environmental and climate benefits, economic opportunity, and community connectivity. Residents of the Priority Co mmunities with access to land may also choose to grow food in their own yards or on private urban farm sites for personal use or for profit. Alameda County's zoning ordinance supports urban farming and gardening by allowing field crops, orchards, and garde ns as primary uses in all residential zoning districts. Priority Community residents who wish to keep livestock (chickens, etc.) in residential zoning districts may apply for an Animal Fanciers Permit through Alameda County Animal Services, a unit of the A lameda County Sheriff's Office. Existing Conditions County of Alameda Environmental Justice Element 3-38 Key Takeaways Only about 28 percent of Cherryland residents live within walking distance of a supermarket. In Castro Valley, that proportion is 55 percent for residents and in Ashland it is 77 percent . The Alameda County Community Food Bank (ACCFB) concluded that people of color and neighbo rhoods with high renter populations experience hunger disproportionately in Alameda County, which define the majority of the Priority Communities . Existing Conditions Environmental Justice Element County of Alameda 3-39 Health and Physical Activity Context Physical activity has a direct impact on the long -term health and wellbeing of community residents. Considering the importance of physical activity to the health and success of a community, it is important that opportunities to participate in such activiti es are presented equitably across Alameda County. People who are physically active are likely to have a higher life expectancy and lower risk for heart disease, stroke, Type 2 diabetes, some cancers, and other health -related illnesses. Engaging in physical activity is associated with better mental, emotional, and social wellbeing. Mental health refers to cognitive, behavioral, and emotional wellbeing \u2014it is all about how people think, feel, and behave, which determines their outcomes in life. Mental health plays a large role in daily life, relationships, and physical health. Preserving and encouraging a culture of sound mental health systems and foundations allows communities to have productive, efficient, and notably, happy or content residents. In t urn, this allows further opportunities for social interactions, which strengthens social cohesion, which then strengthens the social and cultural foundations for healthy, livable communities. In order to create policy that better promotes physical activity and supports the physical, mental and emotional health of the Priority Communities , we must first understand the barriers to health and physical activity. This section describes the role of the built environment and the existing conditions in the Priority Communities on this topic, as well as perspectives from the community . Existing Conditions County of Alameda Environmental Justice Element 3-40 The Built Environment The built environment plays an important role in determining how communities can perform physical activity. For example, communities with built environments that have ample green or open spaces, such as parks and fields, pedestrian/bicycle paths, and playgrounds, support healthy, active forms of transportation and exercise. A community's ability to perform physical activity then influences community health, pa rticularly relating to chronic diseases, which are long -term illnesses that often do not resolve readily or are not fully curable. Chronic disease includes asthma, cancer, diabetes, stroke, heart disease and hypertension, among others. Physical activity and active lifestyles, proper nutrition and reduced exposure to harm can help reduce the risk of chronic diseases (CDC 2022). In the Priority Communities , the built environment is negatively impacted by historical discriminatory land use practices (for examp le, redlining), and historical disinvestment. Combined with forms of harmful social structures (e .g., systemic racism ), these practices create an environment that can discourage physical activity, and thus, fewer opportunities for exercise and recreation. Convenient and safe, equitable access for all ages, races, and classes to these spaces has a direct correlation to increased exercise and physical activity. The Public Facilities section above provides information related to the Priority Communities' acces s to safe spaces and places to engage in physical activity. Life Expectancy & Mortality Rate Life expectancy is a good overall measure of health. It measures the average lifespan of the population at a particular point in time and is not predictiv e. Table 3-28 provides the life expectancy at birth for the Priority Communities. All but San Lorenzo have considerably lower life expectancies than Alameda County overall.

While multiple environmental, socioeconomic, and other factors influence mortality, the mortality rate presents an additional measure for comparison purposes between t he Priority Communities and the County as a whole. As shown in Table 3-29, the mortality rate for stroke is considerably higher than the County in all Priority Communities with the exception of Cherryland. The mortality rate for chronic lower respiratory d iseases is also considerably higher than the County for all Priority Communities.

In Priority Community census tracts with p opulations greater than 15,000, death rates ranged from 15 percent higher than the County rate in Castro Valley to 61 percent higher in Ashland.

Additionally, rates per 100,000 with a population of less than 20,000 should be interpreted with cau tion. Finally, Hayward Acres has a high death rate due to the number of long -term care facilities in the community. These disparities are not unexpected, given the racial/ethnic makeup of the populations in the Priority Communities, the relatively high poverty rates in those communities, and the enduring health impacts of systemic inequities. Disproportionately high Alameda County COVID -19 mortality rates among African Americans (210.6), Pacific Islanders (231.7) and Latinx (110.6) corres pond to national level data as well. Specific factors contributing to this disparity include lack of adequate access to health care, higher prevalence of underlying conditions such as heart disease and asthma, disproportionate levels of stress, greater lik elihood of living in overcrowded households, and disproportionate employment in sectors that require in -person work. Each of these factors disproportionately impacts African American, Latinx , and Pacific Islander communities due to inequitable access to he alth care, housing, and employment opportunities. Note that the mortality rate in Hayward Acres reflects the presence of long -term care facilities in that area along with a small overall population. Higher COVID -19 death rates are to be expected in those f acilities, since they house older, sicker patients in general. Existing Conditions Environmental Justice Element County of Alameda 3-43 Key Takeaways All of the Priority Communities, except San Lorenzo, have considerably lower life expectancies than Alameda County. The rates of emergency department visits for heart attack, a re notably higher in Ashland, Cherryland, Hayward Acres, and the San Lorenzo Priority Communities than in the rest of the county. (For data related to emergency department visits , see Sensitive Populations , page 3-9.) Among the Priority Communities, Ashland (6.2 percent ) and the San Lorenzo census tract (6.4 percent ) exceed the County rate of low birth rates, with other areas at or below that marker. ( For data related to emergency department visits , see Sensitive Populations , page 3-9.) Existing Conditions County of Alameda Environmental Justice Element 3-44 Civic Engagement Context Equitable and effective planning and decision -making processes prioritize the meaningful involvement of the community members that will be directly impacted. Civic engagement is a vital aspect of EJ, and it is a necessary inclusion in EJ Elements. Civic en gagement allows for the investment of the community in solution finding, while broadening opportunities to hold decision -makers accountable. Partnerships made with community groups will also allow for the success and advancement of EJ goals. In order to cr eate policy that promotes effective and inclusive civic engagement, we must first understand the barriers to and community preferences for engaging in community and public processes. This information has been captured in part from existing data sources, bu t the majority of findings have been identified from surveying community members who have attended County -run public meetings or have not attended due to various factors. This section presents information and community feedback to help inform the preparati on of goals, policies , and actions. Existing Conditions Environmental Justice Element County of Alameda 3-45 Linguistic Isolation EJ seeks to promote the participation of Priority Communities in public decision -making processes. Language is a barrier for many people. Without English fluency, it can be very difficult to easily access government and community programs and processes in Alameda County, and take part in decisions that impact ones' health, wellbeing, or financial/economic opportunity. Take t his document, for example. Who can read it? Who is able to access the ideas and concepts held in it, and who is then able to hold Alameda County accountable to making them happen? The County can take steps to remove linguistic, or language isolation , as a barrier , such as offering online translated versions of documents and providing translation services at public meetings. Table 3-6 presents the percentage of households that speak limited English, and the languages that those households speak. Ashland, Cherryland, and Hayward Acres have a significantly higher rate of households that speak limited English, ranging from about 10 to 18 percent compared to the Cou nty's rate at about 8 percent . Households speaking Spanish in Ashland, Cherryland, and Hayward Acres range from about 21 to 27 percent , while the County is reported at about 15 percent . Similarly, Asian and Pacific Island Languages range from about 20 to 3 5 percent , while the County is reported at about 24 percent .

Linguistic, or Language, Isolation Linguistic, or language, isolation is when there are households with individuals over the age of 14 that have limited English -speaking capability. Existing Conditions County of Alameda Environmental Justice Element 3-46 Key Takeaways All Priority Communities, with the exception of San Lorenzo, have more households with limited English speakers than the county as a whole. High rates of Spanish -speaking households are found in Ashland, Cherryland and Hayward Acres compared to the county as a whole. High rates of languages other than English and Spanish are found in Ashland, San Lorenzo, and Castro Valley compared to the county as a whole.

(Cal. Gov. Code, \u00a7 65040.12, subd. (e). The EJ Element is being prepared with consideration of the County's Safety Element , Community Climate Action Plan , and Housing Element update s which are all being updated o r created in 2022 and 2023 . The geographic focus for the all the aforementioned plans is the unincorporated areas of Alameda County . However, the EJ Element focuses specifically on the 16 low -income census tracts within the unincorporated area that meet the EJ Element screening criteria. The development of the EJ Element and the implementation of the c ommunity engagement is guided by SB 1000 (Levya, 2016 .) The key topic areas from SB 1000, commonly referred to as \"EJ Pillars\" are: Public Facilities Pollution and Air Quality Food Access Safe and Sanitary Homes Health and Physical Activity Civic Engagement About the Community Engagement Plan (CEP) Envirocom Communications Strategies, LLC (ECS) and Environmental Science Associates (ESA) worked together with the County's Community Development Agency (CDA) Planning Department and receiving input from Alameda County Public Health Department (PHD) staff, to create and implement a community engagement plan to inform and involve the broad base of local stakeholders and community members in the preparation , adoption , and implementation of the Environmental Justice Element. Envirocom partnered with Tiburcio Vasquez Health Center (TVHC), a well -known community -based organization (CBO) within the project area, to ensure greater success of reaching community members who might not otherw ise participate in such planning and / or government endeavors, or who have been historically excluded. This Community Engagement Plan (CEP) provides guidance for the EJ Element Project Team to ensure inclusive opportunities for local residents and others to be involved with the planning, development and implementation of the EJ Element. The CEP suggests public participation methods and strategies by which the EJ Element Project Team can receive input, coordinate engagement activities, and consult with the internal stakeholders and the public through out the development and adoption process of EJ Elemen t. Alameda County Environmental Justice Community Engagement Plan page 4 March 24, 2023 The strategies, methods and recommendations of this CEP incorporate the spectrum of inclusive engage ment developed by International Association for Public Participation (IAP2), and additional public engagement models, along with the experiential success of the Public Engagement consultant to highlight best practices and techniques for the EJ Element and any other project serving the unincorporated areas. The above chart is the Public Engagement Consultant's outline of the process to achieve authentic and collaborative community engagement for this plan . Priority Communities Stakeholder participation and community involvement are essential to developing specific goals, policies, actions , and implementation programs in the EJ Element and ensuring that such are responsive to and prioritize the needs of disadvantaged communities . The EJ Element and the Community Engagement Plan focus on the residents and neighborhoods in 16 low-income censu s tracts in the unincorporated communities of Ashland, Cherryland, Hayward Acres, and parts of San Lorenzo and Castro Valley . These neighborhoods comprise the \"Priority Communities\" for the EJ Element . The community engagement activities are intended to involve the Priority Communities in planning and implementing an EJ Element that responds to and prioritizes their needs in the context of the aforementioned \"EJ Pillars .\" Goals The goals of the EJ Element Community Engagement Plan are to: Establish best methods for public engagement and transparency in the Priority Communities . Create inclusive, familiar, and welcoming ways by which the public can actively engage in the public decision -making process . Inform stakeholders about the project, sco pe, schedule, and deliverables . Receive input on policy proposals, concerns, opportunities, and possible solutions from the people who live, work, or go to school in the Priority Communities . Consult with the Priority Communities throughout the process and empower them in the decision -making process . Coordinate and align community engagement efforts and receive input from internal County departments and affiliated organizations (Ashland Cherryland Healthy Communities Collaborative - ACHCC) to ensure efforts uplift and empower the Priority Communities . Audience The CEP is designed to engage and inform all members of the Priority Communities. There is an intentional focus on stakeholders in the project area who may not have engaged previously in such meetings or may have been excluded by the lack of inclusive strategies - such as language and geographic access. Assess and generate ideasInclude, involve and informConsult and collaborate Empower and share decisionmakingEvaluate and Revise Alameda County Environmental Justice Community Engagement Plan page 5 March 24, 2023 Key categories of stakeholders include: The general public, including residents who live, work, and go to school in the Priority Communities . Black, Indigenous and People of Color (BIPOC) who represent historically underrepresented groups . Community -based organizations (CBOs) representing neighborhood groups, advocacy groups, and non -profit agencies . Business organizations, housing and community development organizations, rental housing organizations representing individual s who have business interest s in the viability and livability of the Priority Communities and adjacent areas. Stakeholders addressed in the Stakeholder Engagement Plan (SEP) who primarily represent service providers and government -related organization. ACHCC and Stakeholder Engagement Plan (SEP) The Ashland Cherryland Healthy Communities Collaborative (ACHCC) is a group made up of County staff , various non-County agenc ies and community -based organizations (CBOs) that provide direct services to many in the Priority Communities. The group consists of many subject matter experts (SMEs) and direct service providers, affording the Project Team direct contact with and an oppo rtunity to collaborate and consult with \"on-the-ground\" service providers with professional expertise regarding the Priority Communities. Meeting frequently through the years, including during the pandemic, the ACHCC incorporates a topical group structure whose work ties directly to the work of the EJ Element. These topical groups are referred to as \"buckets\" . The members of the ACHCC Environmental Justice and Basic Needs \"buckets\" provide critical input, guidance, and expertise at key milestones as outli ned in the Stakeholder Engagement Plan as prepared by ESA. The Stakeholder Engagement Plan suggests the opportunities when the ACHCC EJ Bucket , the ACHCC Basic Needs Bucket and other community collaboratives, environmental groups or with local and state agencies such as the Bay Area Air Management Quality District and the California Air Resources Board AB 617 program should be engaged to he lp inform EJ Element development and ensure more inclusive voices. SECTION I - Developing Engagement - Using Best Practices The CEP document outlines key engagement activities for inclusive, equitable and accessible strategies . This document presen ts best practices and recommendations; highlights the lessons learned and the recommendations for future activities. T he CEP summarizes community engagement strategies performed to date towards the development of the EJ Element. This document also identifies the roles of the Consultants, County staff and departments, CBOs and other s for community engagement . Alameda County Environmental Justice Community Engagement Plan page 6 March 24, 2023 Establishing Equity and Inclu sion Equitable community engagement strategies must prioritize those segments of the community who are historically underrepresented in long -range planning processes. As a standard practice, equity -based public outreach and community engagement strategies should consider language , geographic l ocation , physical access , physical and spatial needs (such as equipment , meeting space ), along with the income and racial diversity of the participants as a determinant of transportation, education , literacy and other resources available to the participants. In order to develop authentic and meaningful engagement recommendation and strategies , the Project Team examined the Priority Communities through various sets of data and observations to determine the discrepancies and inequities with community resources as opposed to those in other communities. Key findings show disparities in area income, community services, education attainment, language fluency transportation access and other resources are reflected in the Community Profile of the EJ Element . These disparities can greatly influence the outcomes of public participation. The CEP attempts to address obstacles to participation and engagement in the 16 census tract communities by ensuring equitable engagement an d outreach with strategies that deliver inclusive and accessible public education, public awareness and public -input opportunities . The following are some measures to establish a more equitable engagement plan. Respond to Known Inequities To engage in equitable planning , the Project Team should aim to : Build trust through regular engagement with front -line service organizations (e.g., by participating in groups like the ACHCC. ) Secure the services of a trusted community -based organization to help with outreach and offer compensation for their help . Use the Community Profile and other data to identify inequities and define issues ; then , proactively consult or collaborate with CBOs and others w ith existing expertise in the issue area . For example, if data shows that there is a food desert in a community, the Project T eam may choose to work with organizations or consult on a community level with those groups that provide food distribution, or oth er solutions and engage the organizations in the discussions to identify solution s to include in the EJ Element. As the Project Team and consultant move on to other projects and priorities, work to ensure that the EJ Element policies are enacted , monitored , and revaluated over time . As a result of this community engagement, it is possible that an informed group of community members and stakeholders will stand out who will be able to provide institutional memory, historical and sustainable knowledge from this process so that participants can continue to track and build upon the plan into the future. These individuals could form a group that engages periodically with the County to ensure accountability and continuity of the community priorities identified in the EJ Element . Language Access and Accommodation English and Spanish are the predominant languages spoken in the Priority Communities . Any written promotional materials, public information , and educational materials for the EJ Element or subsequent projects impacting the Priority Communities should be created in Spanish and English. The ideal approach is to create a single product that shares the same information in both Alameda County Environmental Justice Community Engagement Plan page 7 March 24, 2023 languages . Alternatively, two separate products with the same information can be developed . Alternatively, a tagline can referenc e where readers can get information in another language , but it is considered a more equitable practice to have the two predominant languages equally emphasized on the same document. Spanish language interpretation should be standard for any public meetings (virtual, in -person, or hybrid) in the unincorporated communities . Custom has deemed the meetings to be in English with Spanish translation. But in some insta nces , when the majority of meeting participants have Spanish as their first language, the team should consider having the meeting in Spanish as the primary language and the interpretation in English. For future projects, the Project Team should evaluate current community conditions to determine need for language resources beyond S panish and English. Any telephone information lines used for the project should have a Spanish -language option. Lessons Learned and Best Practices: Build into the planning processes the inclusion of people with disabilities beyond American Disability Act (ADA) access. Build into the budget the services of subcontractors for language translation, ASL, and other accessibility measures to provide access t o all. Establish early relationships with American Sign Language (ASL) interpreters who could attend meetings should the project receive a reques t for such services. Given services available in Alameda County, such as the School for the Deaf in Fremont, or Deaf Counseling Advocacy and Referral Agency ( DCARA ) in San Leandro, it would be prudent for team members to work with such organizations . (The Co unty may also have resources available for contractors who provide ASL interpretation.) Similarly, establish early relationships with representatives of the visually impaired community so that they can be consulted with when designing meetings and material s. Provide simultaneous interpretation when possible. Simultaneous translation is done with earphones or other systems. In meetings # 1 and #2 translation was provided as consecutive interpretation - the English and Spanish done in tandem, one followi ng the other -- because this is currently the only Zoom option that allow s for callers using Zoom's 800 number to hear the information in Spanish . Consecutive translation takes more time in a public meeting whether on Zoom or in person . Simultaneous interpretation keeps everyone moving along at the same pace at the same time. Plan for engaging youth, seniors, people with disabilities, non-English speakers , and any other distinct groups with the same timing as the outreach to all other groups and individuals . Investigate and have prepared vendor s to assist with accessibility especially for virtual meetings . o For the visually impaired, there are assistive devices such as screen readers built into Adobe Illustrator and Word that can read a pdf and WordDocs while on computer. o To be more inclusive of the visually impaired, the Project Team should ensure that mate rial posted to the website is done with the accessibility features activated. Have a small number of hard copies of presentations and handouts available . While the general practice is to conserve paper, for in -person meetings it is good to have a few handouts available in large fonts for those individuals who may need materials in that format. Alameda County Environmental Justice Community Engagement Plan page 8 March 24, 2023 o A disability advocate who participated in the EJ Element community meeting #2 shared with the team that Zoom is more accessible than other platforms and also shared that virtual meetings are more accessible and inclusive than in -person meetings. o Use the close captioned tools available on different platforms to be more inclusive of those with hearing challeng es. There are artificial intelligence services that will provide the close d caption and transcribe in real time the meeting. o Include slides on how to access close caption tool should be part of the opening guideline or introductory segment of the meeting. o Assign a facilitator for breakout sessions to work with visually impaired participants when needed. This person can describe what is being shown on the screen d uring actual meetings and allow the participant to engage with the meeting and the material provided. Location Physical meeting locations must be accessible to all users , including ADA accessibility to the building and accessible displays, interactive exercises, and presenta tions. Physical meeting locations should be a place familiar to the intended audience , such as a community center , local park, library, or church that people are familiar with . Physical meeting locations should be central to the community and accessible via public transit , car, bike, or by foot. An equitable approach i n determining a physical location for a meeting is to consider which components of a meeting would make it easier or harder for a person perceived to have the least resources to attend. For example, if choosing between two similar locations, an equitable lens would suggest planning the meeting at a site that is accessible by public transportation. It is more likely that a person with a car w ould be able to attend a meeting regardless of the site location. Additional considerations should also be given to walkability and public safety perceptions when ch oosing a site . In response to COVID -19 public health concerns , public behavior has shift ed with regard to public meetings . Currently, many meeting s and gatherings are being planned for outdoor locations such as parks, end of the street cul-de-sacs, and building patios. Some more traditional indoor spaces, such as larger community rooms , can provide opportunities for gathering while maintaining recommended social distance between participants. Lessons Learned and Best Practices: Consider social connotations and connections w hen selecting a location because it could influence attendance. It is important to consider the positive or negative associations the community may have with specific space s that can impact their decision to attend . For example, m eeting places affiliated with local government or law enforcement , such as the Board of Supervisors' meeting chambers in Oakland or the County hearing room in Hayward, may not be perceived by all potential participants as welcoming or convenient spaces for community meetings. Addressing Public Health, COVID , and Virtual Public Participation A community engagement strategy must consider the impacts of current social events and public health concerns . As the project continues, the community engagement planning process must continue to evolve in response to the COVID -19 public health status. Alameda County Environmental Justice Community Engagement Plan page 9 March 24, 2023 At the start of the EJ Element project in 2021 , there was little opportunity for safe in -person interaction or outreach . All the Project Team meetings and public community meet ings were designed to be virtual. In Spring 2022, with fewer social restrictions in place, there was some i n-person outreach for outside meetings and activities , including t abling at community events and attend ing a local health fair . In March 2023, the Governor's Office manda ted a return to in-person meetings for government agency meetings ; consequently, the Project Team will adjust accordingly. Lessons Learned and Best Practices : Virtual community meetings remain ed the norm throughout the development of the CEP and the community engagement for the EJ Element. Virtual platforms will continue to be used until the Governor or County Board of Supervisors mandates the return to in -person meetings for all County meetings . Given the reliance on smart phones and computers for the virtual meetings, c ommunity engagement must take into consideration the fact that some individuals do not have access to technological equipment, often called the \"digital divide\". o Computer access is a barrie r for many residents of the Priority Communities, but many do have smart phones. Directions to join meetings must include how to join by phone for both smart phones and conventional telephones. o The conventional phone number should be local to the project area or an 800 number. o It is important to remember that Zoom is not currently capable of providing concurrent interpretation options for participants using the 800 number. Given both the \"normalization\" of virtual meetings, and the continuing concern s regarding public health precaution, a large number of participants may wish to only participate virtually. Therefore, a recommendation is to continue offering virtual or hybrid meetings. Consideration for Hybrid meetings: o To help address the digital divide, the Project Team should w ork with local CBOs to find time / place to accommodate people who don't have access to Zoom . A CBO could host a small gathering at their plac e with a shared big screen to facilitate participation . This is a strategy to employ with hybrid meetings or when some level of small group gatherings can be managed. o The Project Team (County leads) could seek nonprofits or community foundations for grants to support a lending library of tablets or other devices for participants to have access. o Addition al facilitation support is needed during a hybrid meeting to monitor the activity on screen (in the \"Zoom room\") while the key facilitator manages the physical room and incorporates the virtual activity. Make polling and surveying inclusive by also having \"p aper\" copies available so that people who may not be able to participate in the electronic polling can later submit or mail responses. Surveys can also be distributed by the community outreach partners , requiring additional planning to digitize the data upon collection. o The County's EJ Element Survey was created and conducted online using the Google Surveys platform. To facilitate survey participation, the Promotores conducted surveys on their individual smart phones while talking one -on-one with people during the outreach . Using a MURAL, MIRO, MENTI or other virtual interactive charting and documenting platforms. These virtual products mimic the use of poster sheets and illustration boards for individual prioritization, comments , dot exercises, etc. Because using the tool requires some skill with computers , individuals who are not familiar with the product may be hesitant to participate and Alameda County Environmental Justice Community Engagement Plan page 10 March 24, 2023 may become frustrated. Use by individual participants may have mixed results, but the tool can be easier for some participants to engage with when the interaction is guided by a team facilitator. Speci fic to Meetings on the Zoom Platform The Project Team has used Zoom for public meetings throughout the EJ Element outreach process . Many p articipants are already familiar with the platform and it is easy to download and use by computer, smart phone , or standard telephone. There are a variety of packages and service levels that can accommodate varying sizes of audiences , allowing for hundreds to be on the platform if needed. At this time, th e drawback with Zoom is that not all features are interchangeable or available with each the level of service. For example, the webinar level does not allow for breakouts; and the meetings do not allow f or translation channel access for people using standard phone lines. In designing the meetings, the Project Team must think through all aspects of a meeting to make sure needs are covered and must check with Zoom for any new enhancements between uses. The County Team opted for consecutive language translation in its 2022 Zoom community workshops because participants w ho join via the 800 number cannot access Zoom translation channel s for simultaneous translation. An alternative to consider if there is time and budget would be to have multiple meetings of the same subject matter (one in Spanish, one in English) to avoid missing phone participants . The facilitators and presenters must a llow for time with a pause when working with consecutive translation format , so that the interpreter can translate for the group. As a standard during Zoom community meetings, \"s potlight \" speakers and interpreters throughout a presentation so that attendees can easily find and view them in the gallery . Assign ing and divid ing facilitation roles ahead of time helps a virtual meeting run more smoothly. Roles to consider include monitor ing chat ; admit ting people from the waiting room ; monitor ing the microphone , camera , and chat for hate speech or other disruptive content; m anaging screen sharing ; record ing the meeting; providing chat tech support ; uplifting participant comments from the chat, and running the poll . In a bilingual Zoom meeting, it is important to assign a team member to manage and monitor the Spanish Language chat . Playing music during the initial moments that a virtual meeting is open and people are assembling and viewing the title slide s is welcomin g and will help set the tone of the meeting . If \"door p rizes\" are offered, consider including a \"must be present to win\" rule and announcing winners at the end to encourage people to stay for the full meeting . If utilizing a poll on Zoom, the Zoom manager should download the poll results before signing off. Poll results are not saved with the meeting. o Polling and other interaction thr oughout the meeting provides for good engagement . o If there's time, allowing for commen tary after the results are tallied might be helpful because it demonstrates validation of the poll and the individual's involvement. Promoting and Publicizing Public Participation Opportunities The most successful community engagement happens when community members and other stakeholders are directly involved in designing the community engagement strategies . The first step is to collect information from community through interviews, assessments , and surveys . For the initial outreach, this early assessment was completed by meeting with members of the ACHCC and through initial community surveys . The information gleaned resulted in a set of recommendations for equitable community Alameda County Environmental Justice Community Engagement Plan page 11 March 24, 2023 engagement activities , listed below . In response to the COVID -19 pandemic , these recommendations take into consideration remote engagement best practices and public health adaptations . Promotional and Meeting Materials Use inclusive, relevant messaging . Identify audiences and share information about why community members should be in volved. Make the information relevant and communicate what's in it for the participant: why they should care and why they should participate . Create easy -to-understand and user -friendly outreach materials (e.g., meeting announcements, fact sheets, and PowerPoint presentations ). Create materials in Spanish and English as a standard practice (see Language Access and Accommodation recommendations ). Translate all promotional materials - electronic and hard copy - into Spanish . Send a \"Save the Date\" and other announcements at least 3 -4 weeks ahead of the meeting . Allow time for staff to review and provide input on all EJ Element materials before release. Distribute meeting notices and announcements electronically and in paper forma t. Paper flyers can be distribute d at corner markets, small businesses , the library, etc . Follow up with the ACHCC member and other community partners who are helping with distribution and posting to remind them to do so by a certain time/date . Develop ou treach strategies that are appropriate for different audiences. For example, develop strategies to connect with youth, youth service providers, after -school, and sports programs to share announcements and drop off materials. For seniors, work with local se nior centers and homebound meal distribution programs. Consider using SMS text outreach to distribute information directly to individual's phones. A San Lorenzo School District partner shared that text outreach is more effective than other outreach methods (like the Peach Jar newsletter) in that district. Develop a social media toolkit to make it easier for partners to cross -promote materials. Additional publicity and promotion tools that have been used by team members but to date have not been used for this project are: o Public info kit o FAQ and Fact Sheets o Kiosk / Graphic boards that can be used remotely to receive input. Lessons Learned and Best Practices : Specifically with this project, messaging should include how this process will be different than other community planning processes because the community is frustrated with some of the previous County efforts, specifically around the pandemic recovery in t he Priority Communities. In addition to the community pulse of the moment, the messaging is necessary to build credibility and trust, and demonstrates transparency. The County should be as transparent as possible about what is and what is not in scope of t his and other projects and what residents can reasonably expect as outcomes . Connect the various pillars of EJ to real issues that the community experiences (such as concerns about employment or health, safety, asthma and air quality and timelines ). Talkin g points that explicitly make these connections can help outreach workers, such as the Promotores, be more successful with involving hard -to-reach participants. Alameda County Environmental Justice Community Engagement Plan page 12 March 24, 2023 Increase awareness and outreach with presentations, updates and workshops with established and existing County and government groups and committees such as Unincorporated Services Committee, Planning Commission, Municipal Advisory Councils , etc. These can be made more inclusive by sending meeting announcements and reminders to those stakeholders who are interested in the particular item - as opposed to having them have to track it. For example, when the EJ Element goes before one of these formal bodies, the Project Team can send an announcement to their GovDelivery EJ Project listserv. Likewise, if there is going to be a special hearing , consider the timing of the item to the extent possible - 1) the timing as in the placement on the agenda so that there is not a lengthy wait time while the board goes through \"routine\" items before the key topic is discussed; or 2) the timing of the meeting, as in the time of day , evenings generally being be tter than weekday mornings. Collaborating with a Community Partner as a \"Bridge Builder\" Engaging a community partner in local government outreach is an increasingly common strategy for inclusive engagement. A community partner is an organization that is familiar to, and works with, the focus audience and/or marginalized communities and has es tablished community trust. Most often, the relationship is one of a community network provider, connector or ambassador for the project. For the EJ Element outreach, Envirocom partnered with Tiburicio Vasquez Health Center (TVHC) and their team of \"Promoto res\", or community -based health educators. The Promotores assist in establishing rapport with community members by meeting one -on-one with residents to bring new voices to the table. TVHC's role not only provides local, on -the-ground - knowle dge to the Project Team but bridges the Project Team with the community. The services of TVHC as a partner on the project are compensated. The standard practice is to compensate community partners for the knowledge and added value they bring to the project outreach. Activities specifically of TVHC as the Community Partner with the EJ Element: Assist the Project Team with coordination and planning of outreach efforts to drive attendance at community meetings . Advise the County regarding cultural competency and appropriateness of an approach based on timing, community culture, and other factors unique to the Priority Communities. Assist with the development of some collateral material by reviewing for appropriateness and readability. Assist the Project Team with identify ing locations and community activities to conduct community outreach for the project such as food drives, health fairs, or other gatherings. Assist the Project Team with coordination, planning and supporting of small group or loc al community meetings in the project area. Mobilize outreach workers including Spanish language speakers (Promotores) to share information with residents and stakeholders , and to translate and interpret (informally) materials through individual contacts and networks. Using door -to-door, community meeting places, etc.) or distributing information. Alameda County Environmental Justice Community Engagement Plan page 13 March 24, 2023 Lessons Learned and Best Practices: It is important for the Project Team to properly train and provide project background information to the Promotores or other outreach / ambassador workers to make sure that they understand the project and can represent it. Talking Points are a useful tool for anyone promoting a project, including the Project T eam , Promotores, or community members. It is a best practice and a type of community benefit for the project to compensate or incentivize the work of outreach workers and partner organizations through a subcontract, grant funding , stipend , or gift cards . The Promotores established a method of conducting surveys on each of their smart phones. When they engaged with an individual, the Promotores collected the name and contact information of the individual , allowing TVHC to follow up with the person to remind and encourage the individual to attend the community meetings. Similar outreach strategies can be employed with \"person - on-the-street\" outreach and survey forms, or other electronic surveys. Providing the Promotores with TVHC gear (with caps, jackets and la nyards) brought credibility to their work and made them familiar to many, but we learned that at times such identifiers can cause concern. In the case of TVHC as the community partner, the organization manages a federally -backed health clinic. When the Promotores showed up to promote a community meeting at a health fair hosted at a physical site that is served by another clinic, the Promotores had to cover or remove all TVHC identifiers and clarify that they were not representing the TVHC Clinic but working on behalf of the County. Neither the TVHC staff nor the Promotores served in an official interpreter / translator role. Because of the technical nature of the subject matter, they declined that role and the Project Team brought in certified Spanish language translators. Encouraging Participation and Connecting wit h Hard-to-Reach Participants Outreach and Promotion Contact and work with faith -based organizations to inform members of their congregations and service area of the EJ Element project and the need for community involvement . Many churches provide direct community services and support , and some also engage in social justice activities. Collaborate with service providers organizations and faith -based organizations to \"invite\" or otherwise encourage participation of their constit uents and patrons through direct contact, or participation in establish meetings and programs. Establish relationships with credible messengers (trusted individuals) from local organizations to serve as liaisons, ambassadors, or other types of connectors to encourage participation from desired audience. Collaborate with local organizations and request time on their agenda of one of their existin g meetings. Request the local organization to help with the distribution of the information . Engage in \"pop-up\" and other activities t hat \"meet people where they are\" such as open houses, farmer s' markets, tabling, and participation in community festivals and events. Co-host outreach events with schools or merchant and business organiza tions . Alameda County Environmental Justice Community Engagement Plan page 14 March 24, 2023 For meeting preparation and participation Define the various audience / stakeholder interest groups and the best way to address. Design the meeting to address audience needs. Gather community i nput in phases - space the involvement over time ( don't attempt to do too much in one meeting) CBO s may have staff who can serve as co-facilitat ors for the breakouts during the workshops . This allows for the CBO representati ves to bring their local knowledge to bear in reviewing and co-developing materials. Lessons Learned and Best Practices : For this project, we did not employ focus groups but designed segments of the community meeting s to have breakouts to serve in that function and allow for individual responses to questions, concerns and expression of vision . Focus groups could be used in early assessments to test planning concepts and recomm endations . Depending on desired input , the Focus Group s could consist of a mix of stakeholders, such as business operators and residents. Or a focus group could be held for just youth, residents, etc. Working with the ACHCC also served a focus group function. School outreach and food distribution sites are good contacts to distribute hard copy meeting announcements. Host individual meetings and focus groups . o With internal stakeholders o With community organization and individuals Make sure attendees know how the findings from the community meetings will be incorporated into the EJ Element. Canvass \"door-to-door.\" The Promotores canvassed their neighborhoods as part of their outreach efforts to encourage participation in EJ Element community meetings . Host p ublic meetings in a town hall or community workshop format. Make arrangements for childcare and food for in -person meetings . o For evening and weekend meetings, it is a best practice to provide childcare. Childcare providers can be from other city or county departments who provide for childcare as their service, or from a CBO . There are also professional childca re services that staff public meetings and workshops. Project budgets should allow for the cost. o For on -site meetings, the physical space should accommodate childcare - in the same meeting location - such as the back of a large hall or an adjacent visible / audible room. \"Door prizes \" such as gift cards to local stores and vendors, tours of local facilities or coffee with local elected officials, ride on a Fire Truck or other items can be offered as incentives for participation . o In working with the Project Team, c larify the incentives and who will secure them . o Provide stipends and/or incentives to ensure equitable participation of frontline community members otherwise unable to volunteer their time, to generate robust and diverse community engagement. o Make sure the incentives and \"door prizes\" are not a gift of public funds . o Do not market door prizes as a \"raffle\" because of legal definitions of raffles . o Randomize the selection process . o Use local caterers or providers for catered food . o Use local CBO childcare providers (compensated) Alameda County Environmental Justice Community Engagement Plan page 15 March 24, 2023 Public Participation as a Community Benefit Community benefits can result from authentic p ublic participation and civic engagement . The benefits emerge and evolve through the involvement of community partners and the use of services from local vendors. As discussed, Best Practices call for the local expertise of community members and / or organizatio ns. Depending on the level of their involvement, these entities can be considered as bringing a level of valuable expertise and knowledge to the Project Team that should be compensated through stipends, subcontracts, grants, continuing education hours or o ther methods to demonstrate value or their participation and contribution.
