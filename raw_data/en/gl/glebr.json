From statins, anticoagulants, immunosuppressants to blood sugar pills, most people with comorbidities rely on maintenance medications to regulate vital functioning and thus, need to be used regularly. However, with the arrival of COVID vaccines, there also have been some unfortunate discoveries. The usage of blood-thinning medications and strangely enough, derma fillers have been brought to question since they have been found to trigger some unique immune responses. Predisposition to some conditions or routine medicines may also make some develop unusual rashes and swellings. [readmore](javascript://) 02/13Can you mix COVID-19 vaccines and medications? Missing out on a dose of your routine medicine can be potentially damaging. But, as we begin to grasp more knowledge about the vaccines, do we also need to worry about the medications we are taking? Can people risk avoiding or postponing getting vaccinated for now? We asked some doctors to weigh in on the medications that may and may not be safe to take with the COVID vaccines. [readmore](javascript://) 03/13People with comorbidities need to be vaccinated at the earliest Coronavirus can make a beeline for someone with frail immunity, which is a crucial reason why those with comorbidities should be inoculated at once. Even with research and studies underway, taking a jab may do more harm than good. According to Dr Rahul Pandit, Director-Critical Care, Fortis Hospitals Mumbai & Member-Maharashtra's COVID Taskforce, prioritized, fast vaccination is the key right now to slowing the COVID mortality rate. \"The high-risk vulnerable population - above 60 years and above 45 years with co-morbidities will bring down the mortality rate to 'very low', as currently, this group forms almost 90% of patients who succumb to the disease.\" [readmore](javascript://) 04/13Can medications alter COVID vaccine response? Is there a need to switch medications? COVID vaccines work to generate a robust immune response upon injection. The potential effectiveness of the vaccines may come down to how well your body responds to it. For the ones suffering from comorbidities, a slow immune response may be a possibility, in some extreme cases. Usage of some drugs may also make the body 'busy', leading to a delayed immune response to the vaccine. That being said, if you are someone enlisted to get the vaccine in the coming while, there are certain medicines and therapies which may make you want to double-check with the doctor or postpone an appointment right now.

However, the part of the immune system that's responsible for autoimmune thyroid disease is separate from the immune system that's responsible for fighting off infections. Therefore, most thyroid medication being used won't trigger off symptoms or make the vaccine less effective. However, if you have been put on steroids or immunosuppressive drugs, it may be helpful to get the medicine doses checked off from your registered physician first, before getting the vaccine.

However, Dr Pandit says that most medications, or antihistamines used by those suffering from allergies have been found to be safe when used with the COVID-19 vaccine. \"Vaccine is safe amongst those with food allergy and common allergic conditions like Asthma, Allergic Rhinitis and Allergic Dermatitis. Only people who have an Anaphylaxis (allergic reaction) to any of the vaccine contents, should NOT take the vaccine.\" [readmore](javascript://) 08/13Those with surgeries and vital organ damage Clinical studies conducted so far have observed that those with fatal complications can safely take their COVID vaccine, without suffering from side-effects. Dr Pandit agrees to the same and adds that people who have had cardiac problems in the past, suffered from heart attacks, renal failure or liver problems can tolerate the vaccine well with their drugs. Those on blood thinners should check the type of medication they are on, before administration. Doctors do suggest that people who develop a heart attack in the week prior to the vaccination date skip the dose since they are still in recovery and the heavy medicinal doses may cause abject reactions. If you are on a therapeutic drug used to support or treat the immune system, taking a vaccine after getting a go-ahead from the doctor will be a safer bet. [readmore](javascript://) 09/13Cancer care and immunotherapy medications Cancer is an immunosuppressing condition. People suffering from cancer are often put on heavy doses of immunosuppressants, which can cause the body to have an 'incomplete' immuno response, or have very poor tolerance after the vaccine is injected into the body. The response may be severely compromised for those who have non-functioning or bad immunity. According to IMA guidelines, those with active cancers, but yet to start treatment can safely take the vaccine, much like cancer survivors. The ones on chemotherapy should consider medical advice prior to the vaccination. Dr Bharat Agarwal, Consultant, Internal Medicine, Apollo Hospitals, Navi Mumbai suggests that chemo patients to schedule doses as per their cycles. \"Immunosuppressants are drugs that lower the body's ability to reject or have an incomplete immune response. Those undergoing Chemotherapy should seek an appropriate window for vaccination between the Chemotherapy cycles. Ideally, we suggest a patient wait for 4 weeks post-chemotherapy for the jab.\" Similarly, people who have had surgery need not take the vaccine immediately. They should consider waiting for two weeks atleast.

From what is being observed, those suffering from severe depression may display a slow response post-inoculation. While right now, there's not much research that has been done on the matter, doctors do recommend people suffering from mental illnesses, or disorders get a doctor's advice beforehand. Dr Bindroo adds, \"Some psychiatric and psychotic medications may cause anti-inflammatory reactions, which may not be desirable with vaccines. High doses may trigger neutropenia as well. A practising doctor's recommendation would work best for the patient.\" However, Dr Bharat Aggarwal does add a word of caution and suggests that even with the risks, the benefits of COVID vaccination may be better than the cons.

Blood-thinning medications, as researches have established may cause profuse blood loss, rashes and in some cases, unwelcome swellings too which take longer to heal. People suffering from bleeding disorders or heart conditions should first check on the type of anticoagulant they are on, before proceeding with the vaccine. Adds Dr Agarwal, \"Patients on blood thinners like Warfarin or newer anticoagulation agents have a small risk of injection site swelling. Patients who are on these newer agents can skip their morning dose, take the vaccine and continue the next regular dose.\" Dr Pandit also advises patients to follow some post-op vaccination care to prevent complications. rather advises patients to check for the type of blood thinners they may be on since they may be a bit more prone to clotting and blood loss after getting the jab. \"Those patients on blood thinners, ie. anti-platelets and anti-coagulants can take their vaccines safely. Just ensure adequate compression at the injection site, for a slightly prolonged duration and a finer needle to inject.\" [readmore](javascript://) 12/13Medications you shouldn't be taking before a jab While COVID vaccines are still subject to ongoing research, doctors, right now, warn beneficiaries to comprehend the risk factors associated with some steroid medications. Chronic steroids (such as the ones used for thyroid) can be taken as needed. However, steroid injections and medications for other therapies (including cancer, rheumatoid arthritis, HIV) which need to be taken regularly can pose problems. It's best to consult with your healthcare provider first to know the right way to proceed with the vaccination. Severe dose painkillers are also best avoided before vaccination, as they may cause unpleasant reactions. \"Wait until after the vaccination to take a painkiller like ibuprofen or aspirin to make symptoms subside\", says Dr Pandit.

However, alerting your vaccinator about your condition beforehand can help them (and you) better deal with any reactions or side-effects which may happen. Get the vaccine when you can. As a rule, inform your vaccinator if you suffer from any of these conditions: -Have any allergies. -Have a bleeding disorder or are on a blood thinner. -Are immunocompromised or are on a medicine that affects your immune system. -Are pregnant or plan to become pregnant.
