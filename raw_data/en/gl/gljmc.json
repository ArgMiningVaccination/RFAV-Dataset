ATTACHMENT 1 - STATEMENT OF REQUIRE MENTS 1. PR OJECT OVERVIEW 1.1 The Canberra Hospital (TCH) The Canberra Hospital is part of Canberra Health Services (CHS) which provides public healthcare for a population of more than 500,000 through a range of services including acute inpatient and day services, outpatient services, women's and children's services, and pathology. Canberra Hospital has the Territory's largest emergency department and operating theatre complex, and is the principal teaching hospital in the Territory, in partnership with the Australian National University (ANU) and the University of Canberra. T he Canberra Hospital campus is comprised of 28 buildings with a GFA of nearly 207,000 m2, connected by a network of roads, bridges and tunnels, as well as a multi -storey car park and helipad. 1.2 Surgical Procedures, Interventional Radiology a nd Emergency (SPIRE) project The ACT Government expects that community demand for health services is will increase rapidly over the next 15 years, and beyond. The ACT Government continues to implement its plans to reform health care and create a system des igned to respond to the community's needs over the next decade and beyond. The reform agenda recognises that an investment in infrastructure to support the health care needs of the community is essential as a complex mix of population ageing, changing tech nology, and provider and consumer expectations drive a significant increase in demand for health services. Th e SPIRE project responds to these service development drivers and is vital to realise the further implementation of these strategies. SPIRE will deliver integrated services from a modern facility in a way that delivers operational efficiencies together with an exemplary quality of care and improved patient experience. S PIRE is the most significant investment in the Canberra Hospital for decades and will create a future -proofed acute services building around which future developments on the campus will be planned. It represents a generational opportunity for the Canberra Hospital to position itself as a leading player in the delivery of acute tertiary healthcare services in Australia and beyond. It will deliver world -class facilities that respond to contemporary and forward -thinking models of care and will attract the best and brightest clinical staff from Australia and around the world to the Can berra Hospital. T he business case for SPIRE has been completed and approved and the concept design process is nearing completion. Major Projects Canberra in partnership with the Canberra Health Services are now focused on undertaking preliminary design in preparation for construction procurement during 2020. To facilitate this, it is necessary to engage a suitably qualified and experienced consultant to support the health planning requirements for the next phase of the SPIRE project. Th e SPIRE project represents a substantial investment (in excess of $500 million) in the ACT healthcare system and will deliver on the principal project objectives as outlined in Figure 1.

S COPE OF SERVICES 3.1 Engagement Overview Major Projects Canberra and Canberra Health Services are looking to engage a suitably qualified Health Planner to assist with the project definition for the SPIRE Centre Project. The successful consultant will be required to: \u00bbCritically review health planning documentation developed to -date, including the SPIRE Centre Detailed Business Case, draft Models of Care, Health Planning Unit Briefs and Proof of Concept design documentation ; \u00bbDevelop a Model of Service Delivery Framework consistent with the scope of the project. A Model of Service Delivery Framework will identify all the key elements of service delivery thatsupport patient care, set a vision for the future in line with CHS Clinical Service/Business Plansand demonstrate successful outcomes or approaches to delivering services and care using wellresearched supporting evidence and literature. The Model of Service delivery should support a p atient centric approach, optimal service provision, multidisciplinary integrated care and services, efficient use of resources and provide safe, quality care and services (potentially including community -based services) ; \u00bbResearch contemporary models prior to engaging with key stakeholders so all options can be canvassed.

Introduction In September 2016, ACT Government announced the construction of a Surgical Procedures, Interventional Radiology and Emergency (SPIRE) Centre to be built at Canberra Hospital (CH) . This infrastructure project is part of the ACT Government's 10 -Year Health Plan and is in response to the increasing demand on ACT hospitals and health services across the territory. The ACT Government 2017 Budget provided funding for the first stages of the SPIRE project which includes planning and the commencement of design. A Model of Care (MoC) is a planning document that broadly defines the way health services are delivered and outlines b est practice care for a person using this service. This MoC planning document has been developed for building design only and is required by the prospective design consultants to enable design development. For noting, a complete patient journey MoC is a s ubsequent piece of work. ACT Health engaged Healthcare Management Advisors (HMA) Pty Ltd to undertake the MoC development in collaboration with staff from Health Services Redesign and Building Health Service's Program. Development of this document occurred between February and March 2018 with internal ACT Health stakeholders who have been identified within this document. Outstanding issues that require resolution over the next design phases are noted at the beginning of this document. 2. Description of the s ervice CH is the major tertiary and trauma referral centre for the catchment , and manages trauma and emergency cases that cannot be provided by other facilities in the regi on. This means CH is in a distinctive situation compared to most other equivalent hos pitals in metropolitan settings; the hospital is significantly limited in its capacity to request initiation of bypass system in periods of high demand for surgery services . Perioperative s ervices is integral to the role of the CH as a Major Trauma Centre and Tertiary Health Facility for the ACT and the surrounding NSW region. CH perioperative s ervices is a role d elineation1 level 6 clinical service for most surgery and encompasses a Territory -wide and regional role. As a role delineation level 6 clinical service in most specialty areas, t his means: For the operating suite CH provides complex surgical procedures, manages patients at the highest l evel of surgical risk. Provides specialised surgery such as cardiothoracic surgery and/or neurosurgery For the anaesthesia and Post Anaesthetic C are Units (PACU) areas CH \"provide(s) anaesthesia for all levels of patient risk undergoing complex major surgical procedures.\" [There is] \"subspecialty anaesthesia on -site, such service related groups (SRGs ) where CH does not provide level 5 or 6 role delineation capability are transplantation (SRG 6 1) and extensive burns (SRG 62). T here is insufficient activity generated within the CH catchment to justify developing l evel 6 capability for transplantation or ongoing management of extensive burns. The CH perioperative services target population is the ACT and Southern NSW patients who require tertiary level surgical procedures. The CH provides capacity for surgical procedures to be undertaken 24 hours a day, seven days per week. The hospital provides elective and emergency surgical procedures , including organ and lifesaving surgery between 2100 and 0700 hours. 1 NSW Guide to the Role Delineation of Clinical Services 2016 (Second Edition, May 2017) 2 NSW Guide to the Role Delineation of Clinical Services 2016 (Second Edition, May 2017), p.11, p.13. MODEL OF CARE - Perioperative & Interventional Centre v 0.5 Page 5 of 29 Less complex elective and emergency adult surgical procedures and high volume short stay procedures are provided at Calvary Public Hospital Bruce (CPHB). The perioperative profiles and role delineations for the public hospitals delivering surgical services will be articulated in t he Perioperative Service Specialty Plan. 2.1. Surgery types The tertiary perioperative services p rovided at the CH include: cardio -thoracic dental ear, nose and throat (ENT) neurosurgery obstetrics oral-maxillary trauma urology vascular. 2.2. Classifications Surgery is classified on the basis of a patient's presentation and subsequent care ( not by time periods to surgery): Emergency surgery is surgery to treat trauma or acute illness subsequent to an emergency presentation. Emergency surgery includes unplanned surgery for admitted patients and unplanned surgery for patients already awaiting an elective surgery procedure (for example, in cases of acute deterioration of an existing condition). A request for emergency operating time classifies patients according to the following urgency categories: o category 1: Life threatening (operate <1 hour) o category 2: Organ threatening (operate <4 hours) o category 3: Non -critical but eme rgent (operate <8 hours) o category 4: Non -critical, non -emergent (operate <24 hours) o category 5: Subacute (operate > 24 hours <72 hours) . Elective surgery is planned surgery that can be booked in advance as a result of a specialist clinical assessment result ing in placement on a n elective surgery waiting list. A request for admission categorises patients according to the National Elective Surgery Urgency. Categories: o category 1 Procedures that are clinically indicated within 30 days o category 2 Procedures tha t are clinically indicated within 90 days o category 3 Procedures that are clinically indicated within 365 days . Caesarean Section surgery is the use of surgery to assist the birthing of a baby. Classifications for caesarean section surgical procedures are: o category A: Delivery within 30 minutes o category B: Delivery within 60 minutes MODEL OF CARE - Perioperative & Interventional Centre v 0.5 Page 6 of 29 o category C: Delivery within 6 hours o category D: D elivery to suit ORs and D/S. Other surgery : transplant surgery and planned obstetrics procedures . 2.3. Care s treams There are broad phases to the perioperative patient pathway: prior to a surgical procedure (preoperative care) conduct of the surgical procedure (intraoperative care) after the surgical procedure (post anaesthetic care) . 2.3.1. Preoperative care Surgical bookings The surgical b ookings unit is responsible for the management of the scheduling of patients on the CH Elective Surgery Waiting List that includes booking of patients on to a theatre list. This unit works in collaboration with the Central Waitlisting Service, as part of th e Territory Wi de Surgical Services (TWSS) team , who are mainly responsible for reviewing and assessing the Request for Admission (RFA) form and adding patients to the electronic waiting list. The management of patients waiting for elective surgery is in line with the Elective Surgery Access policy, which aims to ensure equity of access to all patients waiting for elective surgery based on identified clinical urgency timeframes. Pre-admission The p re-admission service conducts pre operative assessment for elective surgical patients as part of a multidisciplinary team. These services are provided for all people undergoing elective surgery. The aim of the service is to ensure patients are admitted in the best possible state of health, with all test completed prior to admission. The clinic is staffed by nursing and anaesthetic staff who complete a thorough health assessment in order to ensure the patient is ready for surgery. Dependent on various factors (e.g. patient co - morbidities and socio -economic characte ristics), this consultation may take place in the form of a face to face consultation or via telephone. The results of that assessment are made available to the treating specialist and General Practitioner (GP) . The service operates a High Anaesthetic Risk Patient (HARP ) clinic for people with complex needs and multiple comorbidities . Day of Surgery Admission (DoSA) DoSA describes the process whereby patients are admitted to CH and undergo surgery on the same day. This is the admission policy for most CH elective patients. Holding bay Nursing and anaesthetic assessments are undertaken in the holding bay, prior to entry to the operating theatres. Several patients are often in the holding bay area to ensure the next patient is always ready for theatre. 2.3.2. Intrao perative care The intraoperative area will consists of the existing operating theatres (13 including MRI), with the addition of 10 hybrid, complex/robotics, interventional radiology suites , and a shell for a future 10 hybrid/complex/robotic theatres . The hybrid operating suite will include operating rooms with angiography suitable for endovascular work e.g. cardiothoracic, neurological, and vascular. MODEL OF CARE - Perioperative & Interventional Centre v 0.5 Page 7 of 29 For space planning purposes it has been assumed that the ten room SPIRE suite will comprise: four hybr id operating rooms with angiography equipment requiring control and computer rooms initially for use in cardiac, cardio thoracic, vascular surgery (EVAR), neuro interventional , and trauma surgery four complex/robotic surgery operating rooms with garaging facilities for robotic tools for use initially in ENT, urology, gynae oncology, c olorectal, paediatric service s, and appropriate emergency cases one intraoperative roo m with direct access to an MRI scanning r oom one intraoperative room with direct access to s pecialised imaging equipment, yet to be determined (e.g. simulation theatre). Hybrid theatres have a fixed imaging platform designed to support minimally invasive surgery. Hybrid theatres enable surgeons to perform combined open, minimally invasive, image -guided and/or catheter -based procedures in the same operating room. The hybrid/complex/robotic theatres will include provision for robotic surgery, mobile robot arms and tactile feel technology systems. Hybrid /complex/robotic theatres require additional sp ace to house extra equipment as well as accommodate more staff who are present during a procedure. Initially it is expected that hybrid theatre activity will be focussed in the following four surgery specialties: interventional neurology o digital angiograph y is used for neurovasc ular surgery and spinal surgery o Computer Tomography (CT) scan or MRI scan is applied in brain tumour surgery neurosurgery/ orthopaedic surgery - the o-arm system is spec ifically used in spinal surgery vascular cardiothoracic. Use of hybrid theatre techniques is evolving rapidly. Other areas where hybrid surgery techniques could expand in the medium term include orthopaedics and trauma. 2.3.3. Post anaesthetic care PACU The PACU , operated by specialist nursing staff, is responsible for the management of patients ' immediate post -procedural period. Following conclusion of the surgical procedure there are typically three stages of recovery: Stage 1 recovery accommodates unconscious patients who require constant observation and monitoring with a o ne-to-one patient nurse ratio. Open planned bays are provided that can be observed from a staff station Stage 2 r ecovery accommodates: o patients who have regained consciousness after anaesthesia but require further observation o patients who have undergone procedures with local anaesthetic who may bypass recovery stage 1 o post-operative obstetric patien t needs including facilitating breast feeding as per the breast feeding -friendly hospital policy . MODEL OF CARE - Perioperative & Interventional Centre v 0.5 Page 8 of 29 Extended Day Surgery Unit (EDSU) EDSU is a flexible area where patients can have their entire episode of care within the perioperative environment. Bed allocation is for patients who meet the 23 hour EDSU admission criteria and do not require admission to an inpatient unit as they meet the admission criteria for the unit which ensures patient safety and have a planned discharge within 23 hours after the surgery/procedure. Stage 3 (discharge lounge) Stage 3 (discharge lounge) provide s comfortable chairs for patients who are awake and ready to discharged, generally to their home. 2.4. Care needs 2.4.1. Additional needs CH makes provision for perioperative patients identified as having additional needs (e .g. physical disabilities, medical conditions, mild learning disabilities or profound cognitive impairment, developmental dela ys, and emotional vulnerabilities) . Patients may require additional planning and resource allocation coordinated via a multidisciplinary approach for their perioperative journey. This planning and support is required across the various phases of perioperat ive care including pre - admission clinics, pre -operative care and post -operative care. Justice Health d etainee patients requiring a surgical procedure also need consideration given to additional resourcing e.g. separate areas in recovery. 2.4.2. Needs of Aborigina l and Torres Strait Islander People It is important that perioperative care is delivered in culturally safe and competent ways. To overcome the evolving barriers to lifelong care that Aboriginal people may experience, perioperative services need to work in partnership with Aboriginal health care providers to tailor care to achieve optimal perioperative health outcomes. In particular, this should include a demonstrated commitment to building trust with Aboriginal people to ensure assessment, planning, referral and follow up processes are tailored to the individual. 2.4.3. Paediatric, obstetrics and miscarrying gynaecology p atients The patient journey for paediatric patients and women who are miscarrying is to be sensitive , and to acknowledge the special needs of these group s. Children and women will need/want support and there will the ability to facilitate this. P aediatric , obstetric and miscarrying gynaecology patients require appropriate s treaming for each cohort from Do SA through the operating theatres and int o PACU. Separation of miscarrying women from surgically assisted birth ing women is required in both DoSA and PACU . Parent access to stay with children as long as possible is required in appropriate areas of the operating theatres Appropriate post anaesthet ic care environments are required for each cohort including the ability for an optimal first breast feed for post caesarean women and their babies. 2.5. Changes to m odel An integrated booking system Perioperative Information Management System (PIMS) will be introduced to manage and streamline bookings and the waiting list, with the ability to differentiate between elective and emergency surgery Centralised pre -admission for all elective surgery MODEL OF CARE - Perioperative & Interventional Centre v 0.5 Page 9 of 29 Dedicated areas for different patient cohorts will facilitate a p atient centred journey, where the environment is appropriate the cohort - such as paediatrics etc. facilitat ing communication that is targeted, appropriate and informed Waiting space for relatives Commencement of the discharge planning from the time of adm issions with the establishment of a Discharge Planning Unit (DPU) Allocation of a dedicated nurse for the duration of care within the perioperative suite to facilitate the patient journey and decrease the length of stay Onsight S terilising Services Departm ent (SSD) will increase efficiency in pre and sterilising processes . 3. Care/service s etting Perioperative care will be provided in dedicated fac ilities at the CH . Existing perioperative services are located at the CH site in Woden , in Building 12, Level 3 , with the exception of the pre- admission unit located on Level 2 . Perioperative services are an inpatient service type. Perioperative services include preoperative, intraoperative and postoperative activity. Facilities utilised within the perioperative services will depend on the individual's requirements. The scope of perioperative services covered by this MoC is: Operating Suites, comprising: surgical and proc edural clerical admissions holding areas high volume surgery operating /procedure suite conventional surgery operating/procedure suite hybrid / complex / robotic operating suite . Interventional Radiology Suite holding area Interventional Radiology/Angiography rooms Perioperative support areas, including : DoSA unit Day Surgery/Procedure Unit - preoperative and postoperative PACU recovery, dedicated paediatric area EDSU . Anaesthetics Services SSD. 3.1. Environmental considerations The aim of health care is not only to treat disease, but also to create a healing environment for patients that is safe and free of psychosocial elements created through poor design. To this end the environment and design is to support the MoC. Noise has been linked with poorer outcomes and increased levels of stress, for both p atients and staff. Noise leads to communication difficulties, and may impede on an individual's privacy. Therefore strategies for combating noise levels within perioperative services should be included. This includes, but is not limited to: sound absorbing ceiling tiles ceiling battens . MODEL OF CARE - Perioperative & Interventional Centre v 0.5 Page 10 of 29 Lighting is to be consistent with the AHFG 0520 - Operating Unit 3.5 . Interior d\u00e9cor should be chosen that does not alter the observer's perception of skin tones. Infectious, custodial and/or other patients with privacy need s will require an appropriate environment ensuring a balance between privacy and observation, given that this space will be multi -purpose. Regardless of specific environmental considerations, the design is to support a balance between line of sight and pri vacy of patients in treatment areas and waiting areas from staff areas, specifically staff stations . 4. Care provision continuum and workforce 4.1. Philosophy and p rinciples of c are Effective perioperative care is relian t on the following key elements: The perioperative process prepares the patient, support people for the patient, for the who le surgical/procedural journey All patients require pre -admissio n review using a triage process Pre-procedure preparation optimises and supports management of the patien t's perioperative risks associated with their sur gery/procedure and anaesthesia The multidisciplinary team collects, analyses, integrates and communicates information to optimis e patient centred care Each patient's individual journey should follow a planne d sta ndardised perioperative pathway Support safe, efficient person -centred care, supported by evidence -based practice, and enhance patient experiences and outcomes . Workflow improvement will be facilitated by : Greater specialisation of some operating rooms for: elective and emergency/ non-elective surgery greater specialisation of theatres for specific surgery types e.g. cardiac, urology, vascular and neurosurgery relocation of the majority of the urology case load to procedure rooms Improved patient fl ows in the pre, intra and post -operative phases of perioperative care More efficient movement of equipment and consumables (including clearer d elineation of clean and dirty zones in the perioperative space) . Perioperative care delivers knowledge sharing to support patient centred care. This involves the collation, analysis, integration and communication of information relevant to a number of domains: patients: preferences, expectations, concerns needing to be addressed medical information: health status, so cial support, recent investigations GPs/ primary care: address concerns, expectations surgery: staffing, equipment and other resources required to deliver a procedure anaesthetic requirements: to optimise care for each patient, consideration must be given to staffing, equipment, assistant for procedures, resourcing for pre -operative anaesthetic care, technical backup for high -risk patients hospital: resources, targets, process indicators and health outcomes an important aspect of perioperative services is partnering with patients and their support people; this optimises shared decision making for the whole perioperative journey patient -centred perioperative care involves a comprehensive team. This comprises: the patient, their support people, GPs , surgeons, proceduralist s, anaesthetists, nurses, administrative and MODEL OF CARE - Perioperative & Interventional Centre v 0.5 Page 11 of 29 clerical staff, allied health professionals, clinical support and operational support personnel (e.g. theatre technicians and cleaners), primary care providers, Aboriginal health workers, and multicu ltural and diversity health workers. The SPIRE centre and refurbished perioperative services in Building 12 will provide an environment that seeks to decrease unnecessary patient stresses whilst streamlining the care pathway and facilitating the separation of patient flows for complex and high volume short stay surgery , day procedures , paediatrics, obstetrics and miscarrying gynaecology patients , interventional radiology, and interventional cardiology. Facilities must be provided to enable staff to have breaks/timeout without leaving the unit. 4.2. Business rules There is a hierarchy of p olicies and business rules that are relevant to P erioperative services. The overarching standards at a national level are provided by the Australian Commission on Safety and Q uality in Healthcare. These standards seek to improve the quality of health service provision in Australia. National specialty bodies specify standards relevant to their interest area e.g. Royal Australian College of Surgeons (RACS) Surgical Education and Training (SET) requirements, the Australian and New Zealand College of Anaesthetists (ANZCA), and the Australian College Operating Room Nursing (ACORN) Standards, Recommended Practices , and Guidelines , Infection Control in Endoscopy, Gastroenterology Socie ty of Australia (GESA) . ACT Health and C H Perioperative related policies, standard operating procedures, and guidelines . 4.3. Patient pathway A key function of perioperative service s is to ensure the patient is optimally prepared for their complete surgical/procedural journey and that this occurs in a safe, efficient and patient -centred manner. The patient's procedural journey begins with the patient at home (or other location in the community) and ends when the patient is safely returned to their pl ace of residence. There are multiple points of entry to perioperative services. These include via: Emergency department (ED) Pre-admission and D oSA, for elective patients From other areas of the hospital including the intensive care unit (ICU) , inpatient u nits, outpatient clinics, Hospital In The Home, and retrieval service s Centenary Hospital for Women and Children (CHWC) patients who have undergone procedures with local anaesthetic who may bypass recovery stage 1. The actual patient pathway through PACU varies according to the nature of the procedure conducted . EDSU is a flexible area where patients can have their entire episode of care within the perioperative environment. Bed allocation is for patients who meet the 23 hour EDSU admission criteria and do not require admission to an inpatient unit as they meet the admission criteria for the unit which ensures patient safety and have a planned discharge within 23 hours after the surgery/procedure. Based on the summary description of pre, intra and post -oper ative processes presented above, this section presents an o verview of the CH perioperative patient flows ( see Figure 1 on the next page). MODEL OF CARE - Perioperative & Interventional Centre v 0.5 Page 12 of 29 Figure 1: Patient pathway for perioperative services at CH MODEL OF CARE - Perioperative & Interventional Centre v 0.5 Page 13 of 29 4.4. Workflow and work processes Overall staff workflows are guided by the patient pathways through perioperative services . Perioperative services involve a wide -ranging number of specialised staff. A perioperative management structure supports efficient and effective fiscal, human resource, and materials management practices for both elective and emergency streams. This includes utilisation of an Operating Room and Anaesthetic Management System. Information management unit staff support the provision of sound data for planning and analysis. Figure 2 - Organisational structure for perioperat ive services at CH l MODEL OF CARE - Perioperative & Interventional Centre v 0.5 Page 14 of 29 4.4.1. Variations to workflow and proces s: the impact of procedure type The category of operating room and surgical subspecialty required varies in the intraoperative phase according to a range of characteristics, including: the body part involved and procedural complexity e.g. simple d ay procedure s (e.g. closed reduction of a fractured bone ) compared to a more complex operating room procedure (e.g. hip replacement) the degree of invasiveness and associated procedural techniques e.g. minimally invasive techniques using endoscopy, open surgery equipment needed e.g. lasers, hybrid theatre imaging equipment, robotic surgery number of surgeons or other proceduralist involved, which can vary from one to several for a complex trauma or organ retrieval case. The procedural characteristics determine the numbers of anaesthetic, nursing and technical staff together with non -clinical staff in the intraoperative phase e.g. more wardspersons are required to assist with patient movement in multi trauma surgical cases . 4.4.2. Preoperative care: overview of work process The overall work processes and staff involved in the immediate pre-operative phase of perioperative care are described below . Prior to elective surgery the relevant surgical consultant or registrar on - call will undertake a surgery assessment, including medical examination and review of test requirements . For emergency cases this assessment is often undertaken within ED at the same time as the request for emergency surgery is prepared. Anaesthetist/ anaesthetic r egistrar The anaesthetist/ anaesthetic registrar undertakes an anaesthetic assessment, in preparation for tailoring the anaesthetic to the individual patient's medical history and the type of surgical procedure planned. They assess requirements for appropriate post -operative care to maximise patient safety. Intraoperative care: overview of work process . Lead Surgeon Prior to surgery the lead surgeon will assess the surgical approach, including assessment of resource availability to support the procedure and the position for procedural access. Patient care during the intraoperative period is the responsibility of the surgeon or proceduralist, the anaesthetist, and the operating theatre nursing team. Operating Room Coordinator (ORC) The ORC is supernumerary to the provision of anaesthes ia. The anaesthetist ORC works in close collaboration with the nursing Patient Flow Coordinators in the allocation of defined resources to provide to each of the surgical and medical subspecialties and the respective ideal utilisation of OR and interventio nal suite capacity according to agreed requirements and sudden temporary variation in demand. Any change/optimisation of the workflow and process is aligned with the patient centred MoC . Perioperative Patient Flow Coordinator The Perioperative Patient Flow Coordinator provides resource assessment. This involves coordinating the staffing, equipment and consumable resource requirements , including: booking and scheduling the operating room and team, including surgical, anaesthetics, nursin g c apability and necessary technical support e.g. perfusionist, radiographer (the precise team mix will depend on the nature of the procedures on the surgical list) coord ination of resource supports such as equipment, stores, implants and prosthetic s MODEL OF CARE - Perioperative & Interventional Centre v 0.5 Page 15 of 29 prosthetic, tissue , bone , and other implants require d additional coordination may be required for specialist equipment or pro sthetics from interstate , in consultation with Perioperat ive resource nurse, hospital supply and equipment loan staff. In underta king scheduling and resource coordination the Patient Flow Coordinator adher es to patient categorisation rules, underlying demand for emergency and elective sessions, and any additional support requirement s needed (e. g. for organ retrieval) . 4.4.3. Intraoperative care: overview of work process Surgeon and surgical team Surgery involves a range of work. For instance, it may include excision, resection, ligation, grafts, and insertion of prosthetics, stoma creation, arthrodesis and debridement.

The level of theatre throughput can be affected by teaching and research responsibilities. 4.4.4. Post anaesthetic care: overview of work process Anaesthetist The anaesthetist is responsible for the patient transfer from the operating theatre to the P ACU until the transfer to the recovery area is complete . They provide written and verbal instructions to the PACU nursing staff , based on pre -determined clinical criteria. They negotiate accept ance of the patient to the post peri operative destination and, wher e relevant, facilitate transport and clinical handover to the inpatient unit . The anaesthetist is responsible for authoris ing the patient's discharge from the recovery area. Discharge responsibilities may be delegated to a specialist PACU nurse . MODEL OF CARE - Perioperative & Interventional Centre v 0.5 Page 16 of 29 PACU Clinical Nurse Consultant (CNC) A CNC is responsible for the PACU. There is a ratio of one nurse to each patient in Stage 1 who has not recovered protective reflexes or consciousness. The ratio is 1:2 for Stage 2 recovery . EDSU/DSU CNC A CNC is responsible for lounge . There a 1:4 nurse: patient ratio in EDSU/DSU . 4.4.5. Service leads The medical and nursing clinical leads steer the frontline multidisciplinary team (see below). These leaders are responsible for developing the service framework and overseeing work processes, including: the coordination of integrated perioperative multidisciplinary care the identification, communication and management of perioperative patient risk the establishment of local guidelines efficient and effe ctive use of perioperative facilities measurement, benchmarking and reporting of outcomes to support continuous quality improvement. SPIRE development will generate a significant investment in theatre capacity and associated support services. Consideration could be given to the development of a dedicated clinical director and director of nursing of perioperative services in response to the growing scale of CH perioperative services. 4.4.6. Team members The perioperative s ervice is comprised of a frontline multidisciplinary team of surgeons, anaesthetists , nurses and other proceduralists , allied health clinicians and clerks ( responsible for liaising and facilitating the work of key stakeholders who manage the patient's surgical/procedural journey). Other team members include: Technical staff, including scientists Wardspersons /theatre technician/clinical support persons Theatre cleaners . Patient flows will be facilitated by wardspersons/theatre technicians / clinical support persons. These roles undertake a varie ty of tasks including direct and inpatient care. Dedicated wardspersons to facilitate patient flow into OR are required for an expanded holding bay and for provisioning transport for patients to IPU post peri- operative journey completion. Structures and p rocesses of the frontline perioperative s ervice are in place to facilitate their roles and responsibilities to patients and their support people. At different stages of the patient's perioperative journey, different team members more closely provide patie nt centred care , depending on the individual patient's progress along the patient care pathway and workflow processes described in Section 3. Typical team member involvement along the care pathway are: Before and after hospital admission: primary healthcare providers Preoperatively: the anaesthetist, the medical officer with the surgical team and the nurse with the clerk who spend most time with the patient and their support people During the intraoperative phase the surgeon, the procedural anaesthetist and the operating theatre nursing team, technicians, clinical support perso nnel MODEL OF CARE - Perioperative & Interventional Centre v 0.5 Page 17 of 29 Post anaesthetically the patient is primarily cared for by the anaesthetist and nursing staff in the PACU During all phases of care members of the perioperative team, including th e broader multidisciplinary team, can be called upon to contribute their expertise to patient centred care. At all times in the revised MoC there should be real time access to updated documentation on each patient's aggregated health and social status , via there electronic medical record . At all stages all members of the multidisciplinary team are responsible for checking that the patient information shows consistency e.g. the RFA, the consent form, correc t site surgery, the ward notes and medications. They must also ensure patient identification and procedure matching requirements are fulfilled . Details of staffing levels for perioperative services will be considered in development of the perioperative health service plan. 4.4.7.

Workforce Based on the description of pre, intra and post -operative staff and processes presented a bove, the CH perioperative staffing and work processes will be provided in the detailed Business Case. Projected staff profiles require development to inform future stages of planning and will be subject to adjustment both in numbers and classification as better clarity is gained around service delivery models. Staff profiles are subject to review by the Workforce Policy and Planning unit. Future workforce requirements will be determined using relevant College standards e.g. Australian College Operating Room Nursing (ACORN) Standards for Perioperative Nursing; 14th Edition. 4.6. Changes to workforce model The continued evolutio n of procedural activity types will see ongoing changes to areas of perioperative care where there is a need for anaesthetic services. Clinical areas where there is a growing need for anaesthetic services are: Diagnostic Imaging ; brachytherapy ; gastroenterology ; mental health unit for electroconvulsive therapy ( ECT); pre-admission clinics ; High Risk Anaesthetic Patient (HARP) clinic; the acute pain service ; use of e xtracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO ); emergency surgery disaster management; and the PACU. The changing mix of procedural activity will generate greater demand for interventional radiology within the atres and an associated requirement for extra anaesthetic staffing. There is an emerging trend for anaesthetic provision outside the operating room environment . This will generate demand for additional anaesthetic and nursing staff and safe provision of care with medications and resources. There is a requirement for 24/7 anaesthetic staffing to facilitate acute pain reviews and epidural insertion in labouring women . A registrar and on -call consultant will be available overnight. 4.7. Training, education and r esearch A major function of perioperative se rvices is to support training , education and research within the perioperative services, to enable and support the delivery of a high quality service to both adults and children. Ongoing training is a major focus of perioperative services into the future. Perioperative s ervices will continue to train large numbers of junior medical officers each term, in addition to registrars training in streams of surgic al and anaesthetic specialties. Facilities will be required to facilitate onsite nursing and medical training. Programs include facilitation of clinical updates, undertaking of research , quality improvement and accreditation programmes, mandatory training for medical and nursing staff, Basic and Advanced Cardiac Life Support and training, in -service education and training programs for all s taff, mock scenarios , competency assessments, undertaking of vivas fo r medical staff, orientation of new staff, conducting and supporting the Transition To Practice (New Graduate) program annually, and more. To support education, training and research, perioperative services maintains a strong focus on education and researc h through structured positions and portfolios and contributes to teaching students from the Australian National University (ANU) Medical School, University of Canberra, Australian Catholic University, and the Charles Sturt University. MODEL OF CARE - Perioperative & Interventional Centre v 0.5 Page 19 of 29 5. Service support elements 5.1. Essential equipment and technology Bedside data entry Staff will need access to computers at each bedside, staff stations, in consultation, treatment and procedure rooms. Clinicians (nurse, allied health, doctor, etc.) should have a tablet device to e nter relevant patient information, order tests, review results, send outpatient referrals, provide discharge emails (to patient and GP). This should include entering information in a real time medical record, that all involved in the patients care can see. These handheld devices should also be the communication method between staff within and outside the ED, and may be best used when plugged into wall mounts. Access is required to a mobile device platform (computer on wheels) for the purpose of data entry. One device will be used between two bed spaces. Wi-Fi Provision for medically safe wireless networking throughout the clinical area Wi-Fi internet access will be provided throughout the Department (including lounge/wait areas) for use by staff and visito rs unless contraindicated in specific areas for patient safety reasons . Printer Printers are required at the staff station in each stream, at reception/triage and in close proximity to the ambulance entrance. Space is required for equipment relating to ele ctronic medication/pathology/wristband/programs. Hearing loop Hearing loop is to be available at triage/reception and scattered through the streams. Each stream will have at least one area with hearing loop installed; this will include interview, consult and meeting rooms. Patient monitoring Patients should be issued with Electronic wristbands that provide real time tracking ability, can be scanned by clinician devices to confirm identity and provide alerts for allergies etc. Patient monitoring at bed spa ces, and selected other spaces (e.g. procedure rooms) will be configured for monitoring at a central location with real time reporting. All resuscitation beds are to have haemodynamic monitoring and ventilation equipment. Central monitoring will feature in all streams. All monitoring modalities will be compatible with other critical care areas within the hospital including ICU/CCU and Interventional Suite. Patient be dside entertainment in DoSA, EDSU/DSU/DPU Where appropriate and required, patient entertainm ent (i.e. TV) will be provided. Bedside data entry for clinical staff will be provided by an alternate system. Patient entertainment will be available in all paediatric areas. TV in lounge/wait areas providing access to entertainment and health information. MODEL OF CARE - Perioperative & Interventional Centre v 0.5 Page 20 of 29 Telemedicine/Video conferencing Selected clinical spaces will be configured to provide remote telemedicine, these facilitie s can be located in either the education room or a communal office area. Communication The most appropriate latest techn ology will be required for: communicating during systems fail or in disaster response audible communication in all clinical and non -clinical areas of perioperative s ervices with access to points in multiple locations communication will be via real time direct smart phone/tablet device leading to minimal landline or overhead paging use . 5.2. Information, Communication and Technology (ICT) Introduction of a dedicated Surgery Management and Anaesthesia Information System (SMAIS ) will be introduced as part of the SPIRE development. This will increase overall workflow efficiency within perioperative services. S MAIS integrates inventory systems, scheduling, anaesthesia activity records, documentation, and patient data. The SMAIS must lin k to patients' electronic medica l record and ACT Patient Administration System (ACTPAS). 5.3. Environmental and supply services Food services Patients in recovery areas need access to light refreshments. Staff working in the sterile areas of operating rooms nee d access to appropriate food services and refreshments that are accessible 24 hours. Draping The range of operating room gowns/ draping is extensive ( e.g. surgical garments include scrub suits, surgical gowns, and uniforms), sheets, large storage areas are required to support access to non - sterile supplies, especially as surgery services function 24 hours per day. Bed linen is a key consumable. Stores A range of store room areas are required, including for: sterilisation services, surgical garments/draping's , anaesthetics, dirty linen, cleaning stores, sterile medical supplies, an d chemical stores. Business support services Easy access to appropriately qualified translators . Dedicated cleaners will be allocated to perioperative s ervices. Administrative support staff Clerical staff will be located in Clerical Admissions. Clerical staff will require access to variou s ICT modalities including facsimile . In addition clerical staff will be distributed throughout the perioperative services . MODEL OF CARE - Perioperative & Interventional Centre v 0.5 Page 21 of 29 Volunteers Not applicable Waste Management The range of waste materials that require standardised processes for categorisation is extensive. Waste should be categorised into three groups: reducing, reusing and recycling. This categorisation should apply to used medical supplies, wrappings, devices, waste pharmaceuticals, blood and other fluids, tissue, contaminated gowns and drapes, cardboard and other paper, glass, plastic, and used disinfectants. 5.4. Core services 5.4.1. Anaesthetics and Perioperative Medicine The Department of An aesthesia and Perioperative Medicine provides a 24 hour service encompassing pre -anaesthesia assessment, intraoperative anaesthesia, post operative anaesthetic support, anaesthesia services to units outside of the operating suites, and tertiary trauma care . The department also supports and manages the Acute Pain Management Unit. ACT Health Anaesthetic and Perio perative Medicine services are providing anaesthetic services for all elective and emergency surgery at the Canberra Hospital and Calvary Public Hospital Bruce. Anaesthetic services at the Canberra Hospital are provided in many locations outside the operating suites including Diagnostic Imaging; brachytherapy ; gastroenterology ; mental health unit for electroconvulsive therapy ( ECT); pre-admission clinics ; High Risk Anaesthetic Patient (HARP) clinic; the acute pain service ; use of e xtracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO); emergency surgery coordination ; Cardiac Catheterisation Electrophysiological trauma; medical emergency disaster management; and the PACU. 5.4.2. Diagnostic Imaging The use of Diagnostic imaging in the theatres is increasing. This is in part due to the trend towards less invasive procedures. Provision for a range of equipment is needed, including: mobile imaging such as image intensifiers, general x -ray, ultrasound, video laryngoscopes fo r t racheal intubation, stereotactic equipment and in some instances, mobile CT fixed imaging such as C -arms, angiography, CT, ultrasound and - in limited circumstances - MRI mo bile equipment needs storage in a dedicated location when not in use. New technology, such as mobile CT s is very large , requiring extensive space in hybrid environments, the fixed imaging unit ideally should have a location away from the sterile field. This makes the room more flexible when th e technology is not in use additional radiographer full time equivalent ( FTE) is needed to man age the increased imaging requirement for emerge ncy patients. 5.4.3. Pathology A range of pathology related activitie s are needed to support the operating rooms, including: point of care testing frozen sections whereby a fresh tissue specimen is taken in the operating room, reviewed by an anatomical pathologist and then results provided to the surgeon within a 20 minute timeframe.The results are relayed from the pathologist back to the surgeon, so the surgical procedure cancontinue other tissue specimens that are not time critical are placed in a fixation agent and sent to th e p athology department for preparation and examination. Most samples are transported in pre - filled specimen containers. Larger specimens require decanting and a suitable exhaust ventilation s ystem is needed to manage fumes MODEL OF CARE - Perioperative & Interventional Centre v 0.5 Page 22 of 29 Pathology and blood specimens are currently transported from operating rooms to pathology v ia v acuum tubes. 5.4.4. Pharmacy Central storage for medications is nee ded within the perioperative suite, including provision for appropriately stored S4D and S8 drugs in a locked safe. Remaining medications t o be accommodated in accordance to legislation. Decentralised storage is needed to support the DoSA unit and PACU, which will experience increased patient flows as a result of projected increases in patient surgical activity and the SPIRE development. Each operating room needs proximate access to a drug safe in either the anaesthetic or operating room. Ideally, refrigerated medications will be centrally stored within the operating suite so they can be accessed as required with cold chain monitoring to a central assessment point where temperature excursions are monitored, identified and mitigated. An automatic pharmaceutical ordering system is required to improve efficiencies and to support the 'just in time' delivery of medications to the patient. 5.4.5. Bone bank and other tissue An area to receive and store allogenic bone and other tissues (e.g. skin grafts) is required to s upport surgical procedures. 5.4.6. Clinical engineering A room for equipment testing and repair is required because of the large number of theatres in SPIRE and Building 12. This room will be accessed by clinical engineering staff who require benches for equipmen t testing. Space is needed for storage of equipment and consumables. This includes space for medical gases and a range of perioperative equipment, including back -up anaesthetic machines. Hybrid /complex/robotic theatres, because of their extensive equipment use, require additional space for a range of technical support staff. 5.4.7. SSD Rinsing and sterilising of surgical e quipment occurs in the SSD. The rinsing process removes organic material of instruments immediately after surgery by rinsing instruments under w arm running water, prior to sterilisation. Sterilisation is currently undertaken on site to support a significant proportion of Building 12 theatre needs for sterilised tools and equipment. The pre -rinse and sterilising functions within the operating theatre suite are to be retained in the redevelopment. It is proposed this function be renamed from Pre Rinse Sterilising Unit (PRSU) to the SSD, to reflect the extensive roles it undertakes. The SSD must have the capacity to deliver decontamination of used ins truments together with capacity for steam, ethylene oxide and dry heat sterilisation. Dedicated space is needed for undertaking checking, packing and storage of sterilised items. SSD in the future will be significantly automated . 5.4.8. Security Detainee patient s may present, in conjunction with two c orrectional officers. If a patient requires resuscitation or continuous physiologic monitoring, they will be managed in the most clinically appropriate area. Otherwise patients will be managed in single rooms or isolation rooms where possible. The rooms should be large enough to enable the patient to be accompanied by two correctional officers, should be located to enable ease of supervision and provide minimal MODEL OF CARE - Perioperative & Interventional Centre v 0.5 Page 23 of 29 disturbance to other patients, protect the privacy and dignity of the patient and consider paths of access to and from the rooms . 6.Benefits ( service innovation and e fficiency) Overall theatre capacity will be increased , along with pre and post -operative patient holding and recovery areas. Hybrid /complex/robotic theatres will potentially lead to improvements in the patient experience, a reduced length of stay in hospital and p eri-operative hospital stays . Fewer procedures will require general anaesthesia during patient treatment ; some procedures will only require sedation - these procedures should be considered for completion outside the major theatre environment . Traditional boundaries of the surgical space will blur. Endoscopic and endovascular procedure s will replace certain surgery types. Many currently performed surgical procedures will only require an ambulatory setting, increasing demand for ambulatory/overnight facilities. 6.1. Qualitative benefits Qualitative benefits of the SPIRE development include: increased access to single patient rooms with enhanced privacy and increased patient safety , improving Infection Preve ntion and Control (IP C) outcomes reduced waiting periods for both elective and emergency surgery because of increased perioperative capacity fit for purpose day surgery areas will streamline the admission process for day surgery, paediatric and miscarrying women provide greater privacy and general comfort levels e.g. access to more toilets an enhanced D oSA will enable separation of adult and paediatric patients , gynaecologic al m iscarr ying women from pregnant/ surgically assisted birthing women additional theatre capacity will enable more theatres to have a specialised, streamlining theatre set-up, intraoperative procedural efficiency, access to the required equipment and more efficient post -opera tive cleaning e.g. dedicated theatres for emergency vascular procedures, digital subtraction angiograms greater staff satisfaction associated with improved working environment amenity increased ability to attract and retain quality multidisciplinary staff because of the enhanced facilities. 6.2. Quantitative benefits Quantitative benefits of the SPIRE development Building 12 refurbishment include: greater surgical throughput due to greater capacity and streamlined patient flows to different theatre types (and supported by additional post procedural bed capacity), which will also reduce the number of procedure postponements enhanced support amenit ies reduced length of stay due to use of less invasive surgical techniques enabled by hybrid theatres (this may be offset by greater willingness to undertake surgical interventions for higher risk patients) reduced hospital acquired infections (and associated hospital readmissions) because of the greater number single rooms and improved hospital layout, enabling better s eparation of sterile and non -sterile areas in the perioperative suite reduced surgical waiting times MODEL OF CARE - Perioperative & Interventional Centre v 0.5 Page 24 of 29 improved perioperative patient flow improved preoperative opportunities to optimise surgical, anaesthetic and perioperative nursing care . 7.

Appendix 8.1. EDSU Model of Care Admission Criteria The Extended Day Surgery Unit (EDSU) is an open surgical unit catering for Day Surgery and Extended Day Surgery patients. Patien ts who are identified as requiring an overnight stay, which does not exceed 23 hours, can be accommodated in EDSU. EDSU is a 12 bed unit with the capacity to flex up to 14 if required. Patients can be booked onto the Elective or Emergency Theatre lists. EDSU is managed and funded by the Division of Surgery and Oral Health. EXCLUSION CRITERIA RATIONALE 1. Length of Stay( LOS) exceeding a 23 hour stay To facilitate effective patient flow through the peri -operative unit, patients booked into EDSU should require only 1 night post operative stay. 2. Patient's Age (<15 years) Patients less than 15 years old should be booked to the adolescent unit in WYC. The parents/carers may request to stay overnight with their child. 3. Non surgical patients 4. -with the exception of Medical Imaging patients.(2) Patients not requiring a surgical procedure should be admitted into an appropriate unit to facilitate optimum patient care. Exception: 2 x Post procedural Medical imaging patients requiring an overnight stay can be allocated to EDSU as per agreement between SaOH and MI. 5. Infectious patients As per the infection control policy; Patients with an MRO require single room accommodation with MRO precautions. 6. Patients with co -morbidities affecting their ADL's Patient's w ith a complex medical history which affects their daily living activities require additional support and post operative care . Assessment and Consideration into: Mobility/Falls risk/Lifter equipment Cognition/Delirium/Dementia Vision Respiratory Cardiac Complex wounds/wound management regime Chronic Pain Swallowing issues Pressure Injury/Skin integrity May affect the suitability of the patient to be admitted into EDSU 7. Major pre and post operative patients Major pre and post operative care require additi onal clinical support and resources which cannot be accommodated within the environment and required functionality of EDSU. 8. Pre op patient's with a lower limb fracture Lower limb fractures have a tendency to swell prior to theatre resulting in delayed su rgery time and extended stay in EDSU. (Can be reviewed on an individual basis for patient anticipating surgery that day) 9. Patient's under guard Patients requiring additional security cannot be accommodated in EDSU due to the open environment and decreased ability to provide privacy. The confined area of the MODEL OF CARE - Perioperative & Interventional Centre v 0.5 Page 26 of 29 bed spaces in EDSU cannot accommodate an additional person to remain overnight. 10. Patient's with Mental Health issues Mental health clients can be unpredictable in their behaviours. The open environment of EDSU can be intimidating and distressing which can exacerbate their existing condition. 11. Patient's with an intellectual disability Patients w ith an intellectual disability can be unpredictable in their behaviours. The open environment of EDSU can be intimidating and distressing which can exacerbate their condition. They will often require a known carer to assist them throughout their stay. 12. Bariatric patients >140kgs Bariatric patients cannot be accommodated in EDSU due to their required specialised equipment. Specialised equipment such as lifters, bariatric commodes and wheelchairs are not available in EDSU. The trolleys and toilets in EDSU d o not have the weight tolerance to accommodate bariatric patients. Bariatric patients also have contributing health issues and co - morbidities, which increase their LOS. 13. Gynaecological patients Patients having gynaecological procedures requiring an overn ight stay should be booked into WYC to receive the required specialised post operative care. 14. Patients requiring a carer to stay, 15. (or 'special') Patients requiring an additional care person cannot be accommodated in EDSU due to the open environment and decreased ability to provide privacy.

Introduction In September 2016, ACT Government announced the construction of a Surgical Procedures, Interventional Radiology and Emergency (SPIRE) Centre to be built at Canberra Hospital (CH) . This infrastructure project is part of the ACT Government's 10 - Year Health Plan and is in response to the increasing demand on ACT hospitals and health services across the territory. The ACT Government 2017 Budget provided funding for the f irst stages of the SPIRE project which includes planning and the commencement of design. A Model of Care (MoC) is a planning document that broadly defines the way health services are delivered and outlines best practice care for a person using this service . This MoC planning document has been developed for building design only and is required by the prospective design consultants to enable design development. For noting, a complete patient journey MoC is a subsequent piece of work. ACT Health engaged Healthcare Management Advisors (HMA) Pty Ltd to undertake the MoC development in collaboration with staff from Health Services Redesign and Building Health Service's Program. Development of this document occurred between February and March 2018 with internal AC T Health stakeholders who have been identified within this document. Outstanding issues that require resolution over the next design phases are noted at the beginning of this document. 2. Description of the service The role of the Emergency Department (ED) at the CH is to provide timely, accessible and appropriate health services to people with acute illness or injury. The ED will receive, triage, stabilise and provide acute health care to patients. This includes patients requiring resuscitation and those wi th emergent, urgent, semi -urgent and less -urgent conditions. The ED also requires the capacity to deal with mass casualty and disaster situations. The Department is integral to the role of the CH as a Major Trauma Centre and Tertiary Health Facility for the ACT and the surrounding NSW region. The CH ED is a Role Delineation 1 Level 6 Tertiary Service and Trauma Centre, with a Territory -wide and regional role. The Australasian College for Emergency Medicine has additional guidelines which designates Eme rgency Departments according to level 1 -4. Under this classification, the CH ED has been designated as a level 4 Emergency Department (formerly classified as \"major referral ED\"). The ED is attended by both adult and paediatric patients who present with a wide range of conditions of varying urgency and complexity. Presentation occurs via 'walk in', private vehicle, ambulance , police , helicopter and correctional services . There are particular patient types seen in the Emergency Department that may have spec ific psychosocial and treatment needs. These include: major trauma patients, elderly patients, children and adolescents, patients with physical and intellectual disabilities, victims of child abuse, domestic violence, or sexual assault, patients with menta l health illness or mental health 1 NSW Guide to the Role Delineation of Clinical Services 2016 (Second Edition, May 2017) MODEL OF CARE - EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT v0.7 Page 5 of 32 disorders , patients with infectious diseases or who are immunocompromised, custodial patients, patients affected by chemical, biological or radiological contaminants . A child requiring a multi organ Paediatric Intensive Care Unit admission and individuals with a major burn, or spinal injury may bypass the CH and be transported to an appropriate facility for definitive care. However, these patients are more likely to present and require initial management prior to transfer. 2.1 Change to model A significant key change in the MoC relates to the initial 'front of house' waiting area. This area will be minimalistic, with the aim of transferring patients rapidly to a sub -wait area within each stream. In general, patients will not be expected to wait in the 'front of house' waiting area. For the majority of time, this waiting area will be utilised by families and carers. Patients will be rapidly assessed at the co -located triage and clerical area; patients will then be directed onwards to the relevant clinical stream. Within that stream, the patient will be immediately placed in an assessment space if available. If there is no available assessment space, the patient will be placed in the \"sub- waiting\" area which is an integral part of each stream. With the exception of the resuscitation stream, the sub -waiting rooms will be attached to, or located within each stream. Patients requiring transfer to the resuscitation stream will move directly from triage into the clinical space. Each waiting area is to be designed as an integral part of the stream. Each sub- wait area is to be designed with the capacity to observe patients with ease and to provide timely physical interaction within the stream as a whole. The south -side Canberra hospital ED located at Woden will be integrated with the north -side Canberra hospital ED. Both ED services will create a Territory -wide Emergency Service, referred to as the Canberra ED - north campus and south campus. Staffing, patient flow and governanc e links will enhance patient- centred care and service delivery. In accordance with the patients' clinical treatment requirement, an enhancement to the patients' journey may include ambulance and ambulant arrivals being directed to the appropriate ED. The Australasian College for Emergency Medicine recommends an integrated Network approach. Nurses, allied health staff and doctors will utilise a hand held tablet device to enter relevant patient information, order tests, review results, send outpatient referr als, and provide discharge emails to the patient and the patients General Practitioner. The aim is to enter real time information into the patients' medical record system so that all staff involved in the patients' treatment and care will have timely access to relevant information. The handheld devices should also have the capability to be utilised as a communication system between ED staff and staff outside of the ED environment. An integrated medical imaging (CT, x -ray, ultrasound) service will be physically located within the ED to assist with timely access to imaging diagnostics. This will enhance clinical decision making for the care of high and low acuity patients and decrease the patients' length of stay in the ED. Provision will be made for a clinic space/registrar review space as part of, or adjacent to, the ED complex. Geographical separation of this space would assist in facilitating the coordination of patient care, thereby enhancing patient flow and workflow throughout the department. Patients appropriate for triage in this area include low acuity patients referred from specialist teams for admission either within the hospital or transferred from other hospitals. Review time frames, ongoing medical treatment and specific patient care issues wou ld be determined by the inpatient MODEL OF CARE - EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT v0.7 Page 6 of 32 teams, and will be the responsibility of those teams. These patients would therefore not be in the ED or impeding access to beds for the undifferentiated cohort of ED patients. A second cohort of patient considered to be a ppropriate for the clinic space/ registrar review space includes patients that have been reviewed in the ED and assessed by a senior ED doctor as appropriate for discharge. This cohort of patient would then be discharged from the ED to the clinic space/registrar review area in order to be reviewed by the treating teams' registrar. A simple notification would be provided to the relevant treating team to advise that the patient has been referred. This area would operate in accordance with the function of the registrar review clinic/ specialty registrar review of the patient before discharge. This model will enhance the efficiencies for those teams as their patients would be co -located in the same area. 3.Care/service setting The Tertiary wide ED services w ill be provided at the CH site located in Woden, and will be integrated with the ED services provided at the North Canberra hospital site. Service delivery within the ED is based on a multidisciplinary team model, led by senior medical officers and senior nursing staff. Patients will be treated within different streams within the ED according to their acuity and clinical needs. Patients may be seen within different areas or streams within the ED according to their acuity, triage category and clinical requ irements. These include: Resuscitation Adult Acute Adult Emergency Medicine Unit (EMU) Paediatric Acute Paediatric EMU Fast Track Clinical Forensic Medicine Unit (CFMS) Mental Health in the ED, including Behavioural Assessment Rooms In a ddition, the Mental Health Short Stay Unit (MHSSU) is located adjacent to the ED, however this unit sits under the governance of Mental Health Justice Health Alcohol and Drug Services (MHJHADS). 3.1 Environmental considerations The aim of health care is not only to treat illness and injury, but also to create an environment conducive to healing, safety and free of psychosocial elements; this environment can be enhanced through creative design. 2 To this end, the environment and d esign is to support the MoC. Noise has been linked with poorer health outcomes and an increase in stress levels for both patients and staff. Noise leads to communication difficulties, and may impede on an individual's privacy. Therefore strategies for mini mising noise levels within the ED should be included. This includes, but is not limited to: single rooms ( three walled bays with curtains) 3 ACEM Emergency Department Guidelines V3.0 Oct -14 MODEL OF CARE - EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT v0.7 Page 7 of 32 sound absorbing ceiling tiles ceiling battens soft floor covering where appropriate . L ighting levels and exposure to lighting is linked to the wellbeing of patients. It is important to access natural lighting and have the ability to control local artificial light levels. As such, all lighting in clinical treatment areas should be manually controlled in order to enable d imming or brightening as appropriate. Specific requirements related to care of the elder patient with dementia should be taken into account. When designing an environment for this patient cohort, consideration should be given to bed location, natural lighting, and calming colour schemes. It is also important to consider the availability and access to support staff such as volunteers and dementia friendly activities. Treatment spaces are to be adaptable and appropriate for treatment needs, for example, if appropriate and comfortable, treatment may be provided to a patient whilst they are positioned in a chair. The elder person's multidisciplinary team (MDT) pro -actively manage the elder person in a patient centric and holistic manner. This care delivery model would also include access to a geriatrician on an on -call basis. In most circumstances, families and carers are integral to the wellbeing of a patient- centric model within the ED. Where clinically appropriate, the patients family and/or carer will accomp any the patient into the allocated treatment space. The ED treatment spaces are to be designed with space allocated to enable families and / or carers to be with the patient. Quiet rooms will be allocated within the ED to s upport the patients' family and/ or carers during times when the patient requires intensive treatment. There will be appropriate rooms designed for sensitive and difficult conversations including the requirement to allow families and carers to grieve. Patients presenting to the ED may hav e psychological needs in addition to their physical treatment needs. Examples of patients requiring psychological support may include; domestic or family violence, sexual assault, palliation and miscarriage. With consideration to privacy and the requiremen t for clinical observation, vulnerable patients presenting with psychological care need should be allocated to an appropriate space within the ED, this space will flexible and multi - purpose. Regardless of specific environmental considerations, the design i s to support a balance between line of sight and patient privacy in treatment areas and waiting areas, from the staff area, specifically staff stations. 4.Care provision continuum & workforce 4.1 Philosophy and principles of c are Emergency Department Mission St atement: To provide compassionate, high quality patient-centred care , in a timely and equitable manner. To support a culture committ ed to academic excellence in teaching and research, and to be leaders in the specialty of emergency medicine and emergency nursing . A workforce culture committed to supporting an environment that fosters personal and professional pride, satisfaction and growth. A commitment to the delivery of a patient- centred approach which aims MODEL OF CARE - EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT v0.7 Page 8 of 32 to ensure patients , carers and families are well informed and provided with the opportunity to be involved in patient- centred care. Along with maintaining the best practice aspects of the current model, the MoC for the future will include the key changes outlined below. The focus of ED patient care is to provide streamlined patient assessment and subsequent timely access to the most appropriate area for patient treatment. Key features of the MoC include: co-location of the triage nurse and the registration clerk in order to streamline communication upon patient arrival and following triage, patients will be accompanied to the appropriate stream. Each stream will incorporate a waiting room. This will facilitate rapid movement of patients away from the 'front of house' waiting areas and into an appropriate clinical area, this will enable clinical staff to assess, treat and observe the patient. territory wide community hospital diversion and avoidance strategies. These strategies are to be integrated with the northern and southern Canberra ED network waiting areas within streams may be utilised for patients awaiting results and waiting for access to a tr eatment space within the stream. multidisciplinary teams, including allied health professionals will be accessible and provide a service within all clinical treatment areas early identification utilising priority indicators for patients requiring allied he alth assessments movement of patients between streams in response to clinical need; early involvement of a discharge liaison nurse with key populations increased use of care plans and pathways e.g. elderly or chronic illness volunteers engaged in service p rovision medical , nursing and allied health students within teams providing opportunities to learn within a supportive structure focused assessment by teams allowing for early referral to an inpatient team, commencement on a pathway or admission/ transfer to a defined clinical area external to the ED. Pathways allow for a more efficient way of managing common presentations right skill mix in the right place at the right time balance between maintaining privacy and facilitating line of patient sight timely access to turnaround diagnostics flexibility in design to enable changes of function and facilitate potential changes in MoC. appropriate and timely access to information technology, digital solutions, devices and resources to assist with communications, di agnostics, monitoring and treatment delivery. The ED must accommodate rapid flows between functional areas and be designed t o avoid congestion. In addition to dedicated patient bay/bed areas , provision is required to accommodate patient surges for extraord inary events through temporary utilisation of appropriate spaces . 4.2 Business rules Australian and international design guidelines for ED include but are not limited to: The Australasian College for Emergency Medicine (ACEM) - Emergency Department Design Guidelines (version 3, last updated October 2014) [1] NSW Health - Emergency Departments Model of Care, July 2012 [2] MODEL OF CARE - EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT v0.7 Page 9 of 32 International Federation for Emergency Medicine - 2012 International Standards of Care for Children in Emergency Departments [3] CHHS Operational Procedure - Emergency Department and Mental Health Interface, April 2017[4] College of Emergency Nursing Australasia (CENA) [5] A comprehensive list of Policie s, Guidelines and Standards are provided within this document under the heading of References. 4.3 Patient pathways Patients may arrive at the ED via a number of avenues including: walk - such as self- referral, GP or other ACT Health service recommendations emergency services, such as Ambulance, Police or other retrieval source e.g. helicopter inter -hospital transfer. Patients are assessed and triaged in accordance to their clinical urgency as described by the National Triage Scale ( Table ). Patients assessed as Triage category 1 and 2 are seen first. Triage category 3, 4, 5 patients are generally seen in order of arrival. Table 1: National Triage Scale ATRS category Acuity (Maximum wait time) 1 Immediate Resuscitation Immediate 2 Emergency 10 minutes 3 Urgent 30 minutes 4 Semi -urgent 60 minutes 5 Non -urgent 120 minutes Source: Policy on the Australasian Triage Scale, ACEM July 2013; Guidelines on the implementation of the Australasian Patient entry into the ED will be via an ambulant entrance point or the ambulance bay entrance point. Patients arriving via the helicopter retrieval service will have a dedicated entrance point into the ED. This entry point must provide timely access into the resuscitation area. Ambulant e ntry There will be a single point of ambulant public entry for those attending ED (who have not been involved in a contamination incident). Patients who have been involved in a contamination incident will have a dedicated entrance enabling direct access to the decontamination shower. Ambulance entry Ambulance services will have a dedicated entry. The ambulance area will be a self -contained stream outside and adjoining the ED, which will be accessible without obstructing access to the ED. The Zone will enable ambulance staff to perform data input (Ambulance Communications Centre) and cleaning and restocking of their vehicles as required. When patients arrive at the ED via ambulance they will be wheeled into the ambulance trolley bay where they will be triaged a nd streamed into the appropriate stream. Both the ambulant entry and the ambulance entry patients may be in need of resuscitation, and therefore these entries must be immediately access to the reception/triage area, and the resuscitation area. MODEL OF CARE - EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT v0.7 Page 10 of 32 Reception an d triage The reception and triage are situated in the same area; this is the focus of the initial presentation and associated clerical/administrative functions. Patients who are deemed stable may be interviewed across the desk. Those patients with more com plex conditions requiring a physical examination or discrete questioning will be transferred into the triage office or bay and assessed by a nurse. The triage process occurs within 3 -5 minutes of the patient arrival and determines the most appropriate pa tient pathway within the ED setting. Triage takes into account the following considerations: the need for medical and allied health assessment and the appropriate treatment stream collateral history provided by family, carers or other agencies legislative requirements e.g. S309 / Emergency Action. [5] Triaging will involve a brief patient history and observations as required. Both the administration and the triage nurse will interview the patient concurrently. Triaging should oc cur in such a manner that patient confidentiality is maintained. The design of the triage area is to be appropriate for taking observations and examining the patient/providing basic first aid in an adjoining treatment area. Patients arriving by ambulance will be assessed in a dedicated ambulance triage bay within the ED. Following triage, the patient will be directed to the appropriate stream/sub wait area. The focus is to move away from one centralised waiting area. Patients will be seen according to a com bination of clinical urgency and their time of arrival. The patient journey following triage is outlined below in Figure 1. Figure 1: Patient flow within ED A description of the various streams are noted below: MODEL OF CARE - EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT v0.7 Page 11 of 32 Resuscitation The most seriously ill or injured patients will be treated in the resuscitation stream. Both paediatric and adult services will be provided. During resuscitation up to 15 people, along with significant amounts of equipment, may attend each patient at the same time. Both ambulant, and ambulance, arrivals may require immediate triage to the resuscitation area. Adult Acute Adult patients with severe or potentially severe conditions will be treated in acute assessment beds. Patients will be dressed in a gown, connected to central monitoring and undergo diagnostics, investigations and interventions. Patients who are mid treatment and stable, or considered suitable for relocation pending results , may be transferred to chairs within the acute sub- waiting room. Generally, p atients will be transferred to either another area of the hospital, including EMU or home. Adult EMU EMU will provide ongoing management, care and observation of patients requiring assessment and short stay admissions. Discharge from the EMU is to be within 24 hours. Patients awaiting an inpatient hospital specialty bed will not be transferred into EMU. Fast Track The Fast track Stream will enable rapid assessment, investigation, and treatment of lower acuity patients. A Fast track Stream will provide ready access from the waiting and reception areas. Generally, patients will be discharged home from this area, but if the patient requires internal transfer, the destination is usually into EMU or an inpatient unit. Medical staff, physiotherapists, and other nursing staff will staff this stream. Registrar Review A proposed area adjacent to the ED for patients that have been reviewed/assessed by senior ED doctor in the ED and determined that discharge is appropriate with outpatient follow up. The area will be open seven days a week with extended hours. Notification will be provided to the relevant treating team that the patient has been referred to the team. This area would perform many of the roles of the registrar review clinic / specialty registrar review before discharge thereby placing the onus on the speciality teams for timings of review. The highest volume patients in this group would be adult and paediatric patients awaiting orthopaedic and plastics review . This MoC would improve efficiency for those teams as patients woul d be located in the same area. Paediatric Acute The Paediatric Stream will consist of both Paediatric Acute Assessment Beds and Paediatric EMU beds. These areas will operate separately due to the differing patient characteristics and it must be clearly defined which are acute and which are EMU beds, however they will be co -located and share facilities. Paediatric Acute Assessment will provide care for children with severe or potentially se vere conditions. Paediatric EMU Paediatric EMU will provide ongoing care for children for up to 24 hours. Children will be moved into the paediatric EMU from the Acute stream, resuscitation and following procedures. Children waiting for other inpatient hospital specialty beds will not occupy EMU. Access to a dedicated paediatric outdoor courtyard is desirable . MODEL OF CARE - EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT v0.7 Page 12 of 32 Women's Assessment Centre The WAC is a discrete outpatient unit located adjacent to the ED for the provision of care for women experiencing issue s or difficulties in the early stages of pregnancy up to 20 weeks gestation, as well as women experiencing gynaecological issues. The unit will be staffed by appropriately trained obstetrics/gynaecology staff and will be under the governance of the divisio n of Women Youth and Children. The unit will be staffed from 0800 to 2200 hours by registered midwives' with Women's Youth and Children medical staff rostered as required. As demand increases the staffing model and operational hours may change. At this sta ge of planning it is anticipated that the unit will be closed from 2200 to 0800 and all presentations will be assessed in the ED. When presenting problems obviously present as gynaecological/obstetric issues in line with agreed guidelines, patients once triaged will be discharged from the ED and transferred to the WAC. Alternatively if symptoms are ambiguous patients will be accessed by ED staff. Once transferred to the WAC, patients will be removed from the Emergency Department Information System (EDIS) and be transferred to the CH ACT Patient Administration System (ACTPAS). Examples of presenting problems include but are not limited to: Early pregnancy foetal loss bleeding and hyperemesis medical management of ectopic pregnancies Gynaecological issues heavy menstrual bleeding endometriosis/pain management Pelvic inflammatory disease Bartholin's cyst gynaecological lesions or rashes. Clinical Forensic Medical Service - CFMS The CFMS will be used by services to assess and collect evidence in cases includin g: adult sexual assaul t c hildhood sexual abuse childhood physical abuse victims of general assault including domestic violence traffic medicine and collection under the Road Transport Act for the purpose of police bloods other forensic assessment services Patients appropriate to this service, who present to the ED, will be triaged. Patients requiringmedical treatment will be streamed to the appropriate area depending on the severity of theirinjuries. When clinically stable, the patient will then be assessed within the CFMS area. In order to facilitate best forensic evidence collection practice, and to enable more than one patient to be seen at a time, flow within this unit will be one way . Initially there is to be a lounge/waiting area where fami ly and friends can provide support and police to conduct interviews. The waiting room will then flow into a staff administration space and from there into the consultation area. A CFMS staff member will see the patient in the dedicated CFMS consultation su ite for forensic evidence collection. The only people with access to the consultation room will be the patient, staff members and appropriate support persons. Preventing contamination of forensic specimens is paramount. All surfaces within the consultation room undergo cleaning to an infection control and forensic standard and are cleaned MODEL OF CARE - EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT v0.7 Page 13 of 32 with bleach following each consultation. Specimens will be stored in a secure fridge within the area. Following initial assessment and review, patients may be transferred internally to other areas of the ED. This may include admission to the EMU. Alternatively, patients may be transferred to other services within the hospital, another hospital or return home. Mental Health Patients with mental health concerns may be seen in all clinical areas of the ED depending on their clinical needs. In order to provide care to Mental Health consumers it is proposed that there be two specific areas within the ED for patients with predomi nantly mental health presentations including: 1)the behavioural assessment rooms immediately adjacent to the triage/reception area, and 2)the ED -Mental health pod, which should ideally be located close to the interface with the MHSSU. Patients with severe ac ute behavioural disturbance may be initially assessed in the resuscitation area, or in a number of behavioural assessment rooms (BAR's) immediately accessible from the triage/reception area. Patients with acute behavioural disturbance who are initially as sessed in this area may be found to have an acute medical or surgical issue. There may also be associated co-morbidities, social issues, and substance -misuse co -morbidities. At least one of the behavioural assessment rooms will be functional for children/adolescents with acute behavioural issues and for elderly patients with agitated delirium. Provision of this facility will reduce the use of such interventions as deep sedation. These rooms need to provide both visually and auditory privacy. Assessment i n this area will be led by the ED team, and will require close collaboration with, and assessment by, specialised mental health team staff. The ED -Mental Health pod has a sub -wait area, and staff station and other clinical facilities as for the other ED st reams. Entrance is access controlled, however people can move freely within the area. The pod is permanently staffed by ED nursing staff, medical staff, mental health clinicians and psychiatry medical staff. As hospital avoidance strategies and to improve patient care, further development of mental health models of coordinated assessment at scene, to prevent hospital presentation In addition to these two areas within the ED, the MHSSU (governed and staff by Mental Health) will be separate to, but nearby to the ED. Mental Health Short Stay Unit (MHSSU) - not part of the ED The MHSSU is a standalone short stay mental health inpatient unit adjacent to the ED, under the governance of Mental Health Justice Health Alcohol and Drug Services , and is staffed with appropriately trained Mental Health, Justice Health, Alcohol and Drug Service (MHJHADS) staff, medical, allied and nursing staff. A separate MoC is available for the MHSSU . The skilled medical and nursing staff will work in close collaboration with Community Mental Health Teams (CMHTs) and, Home Assessment and Response Team (HAART), private Psychiatrists, families and carers, General Practitioners (GP) and Community Agencies to deliver high quality, timely and appropriate care for people presenting to the ED who require extended assessment or brief admission for mental health treatment and care. To facilitate appropriate patient care there must be rapid patient flow from the ED into MHSSU, and maintenance of a short stay model in MHSSU with target lengths o f stay of 6- 48 hours. MODEL OF CARE - EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT v0.7 Page 14 of 32 Decontamination and Disaster Management Single person decontamination facilities have been incorporated within the ED, multiple person decontamination will be conducted external to the ED to enable decontamination prior to the entry to ED. The multiple person decontamination process is under review following consultation with ACT Fire and Rescue , the lead combat agency for this type of event. Depending on the type of incident and level of exposure the most appropriate treatment of decontamination will be determined by the lead agency in consultation with staff at ED. Treatment and flow within the ED is to be as streamlined as possible utilising wayfinding strategies, in order to increase patient and visitor satisfaction and decrease travel times and distances for staff. Although patients can be moved from any one zone, to another, the general patient fl ow is outlined below in Figure 2 Figure 2 - Stream relationships within ED Attaining patient history and a record of care occurs contemporaneously. Medical records will be electronic. To facilitate this process, decentralisation of staff stations within each stream will provide write up areas for core staff whilst providing visibility to all patient beds. Mobile device platforms wil l also be provided adjacent to treatment spaces to enable write up at the patient bedside. Noncore staff will also access computers and write up space within the office - clinical workrooms adjacent to the staff stations. Given that the evolution from pap er based medical record to electronic will occur over time, storage for paper based records and charts is to be provided in close location to patient care and at staff stations. MODEL OF CARE - EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT v0.7 Page 15 of 32 4.4 Workflow and work processes Care within the ED is interdisciplinary ensuring a patient centric approach, with core staff made up of medical, nursing and allied health staff. 4.4.1 Allied Health The major allied health services to be provided within the Department will include: Teams dedicated to ED: Physiotherapy Physiotherapy is currently delivered 7 days a week during business hours and after hours. Services include assessment and management by extended scope, advance practice and primary contact physiotherapy for all non -life threatening fractures and acute soft tissue injury presentations. Secondary contact physiotherapy services are also provided upon referral by medical officers for a broad range of medical presentations. Social Work Currently provided 7 days 8.30am- 21.30pm. The business hours allocation of staff is 1.0 FTE HP3 with additional resources regularly deployed as required to meet high priority referrals. After -hours the HP3 staff member is provided with clinical support by an on- call HP4/5 senior social worker. Social work ers provide psychosocial interventions 7 days per week for patients presenting to the ED requiring crisis support and complex assessment to address issues of safety and to support safe discharge. A n after -hours service is provided for trauma presentations or where there is an immediate safety conc ern or acute distress as a result of a sudden deterioration in health or sudden death. Future growth in ED services across the Territory will require dedicated allied health resources in the ED for those disciplines currently providing in- reach services. Services available on an in -reach basis via referral include : Speech Pathology : Speech pathology assessment and management is provided during business hours Monday - Friday in the emergency department according to local referral criteria for high priority dysphagia and communication assessment. Services are provided in line with the acu te stroke care pathway and for patients requiring swallowing or communication assessment prior to admission to the Canberra Hospital. Audiology services are available to patients presenting to the emergency department at the Canberra Hospital on a referr al basis on Mondays and Tuesdays only Occupational therapy Occupational Therapy services are currently delivered on an as needs basis 5 days a week during business hours only. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Liaison Service respond according to clinical prioritisation with no dedicated staffing Exercise Physiology Psychology Podiatry Nutrition and Dietetics Currently no service to the Emergency Department as historically no funding to provide a service MODEL OF CARE - EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT v0.7 Page 16 of 32 The evidence supported by Queensland's Allie d Health Workforce in Emergency Department's document indicates dietetics provide a valuable role in the treatment of patients in ED to avoid admission and also in initiating early treatment for patients requiring admission: malnourished patients patients who are addicted to alcohol unstable diabetes patients requiring a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) or enteral feed regimen and feeds to be arranged during their stay in ED patient requiring enteral nutrition to avoid admission e.g. malnourished, eating disorders acutely unwell children with metabolic disorders who present with an inter -current illness, requiring assessment and urgent commencement of emergency feeding regime patients with eating disorders and very poor nutritional status, who may r equire rehydration and safe re -feeding plan to be commenced in ED prior to admission to ward initiation of a feeding plan for early intervention prior to transfer to the ward. For an ED of 120beds/bays nutrition and dietetics should be staffed at: 1.0FTE H P3 made available on call overnight 24hours In order to undertake patient care, allied health services will need access to clinical and related facilities including: interview rooms larger meeting rooms consultation rooms in the fast track assessment stream treatment rooms an area to assess patients on stairs storage facilities for equipment, consumables and patient resources. 4.4.2 Medical Medical Workforce is made up of consultants, post -graduate fellows, registrars, career medical officers, residents and interns . Emergency Physicians in the ED supervise and support Fellows, Registrars and Residents (in order of seniority) that are undergoing specialised training in Emergency Medicine and carry out the day -to-day management of high and low acu ity patients with levels of supervision as required (based on patient acuity and fellow/registrar/resident skill level). In addition, Interns who rotate across all areas of the hospital also require supervision by the more senior medical team. Three consu ltants are currently rostered on most morning and evening shifts, with a consultant usually in charge of a stream; as such, the consultant is ultimately responsible for the care of patients within that stream. When a registrar is in charge of a stream, the y are mentored by a consultant elsewhere in the ED. The ED Admitting Officer is an ED Consultant, Fellow, or senior registrar (between 8am and midnight) or an ED Registrar from Midnight to 8am. The Admitting Officer is r esponsive to the admitting officer p hone and receives referrals for patients coming to the ED. The admitting officer (consultant) is currently usually rostered to Fast Track. Medical officers work a variety of shift as outline in Table 2 . Table 2 - Medical staff shift times RMO/intern 0800 -1800 0800 CARE 17 of 32 1400 -2400 postgraduate fellows and registrars have a portion of their employment as non - clinical commensurate with seniority . Medical staff are allocate d to shifts and stream s according to a rostering syste m. Current s taffing numbers per shift are indicated in Table 2 . Note that these numbers are a guide only, and on each shift, medical staff may be flexibly moved between stream s accordi ng to patient presentations and clinical demands. With the expansion of ED, additional staff will be housed in each stream . Current staffing allocation is outlined in Table 3 Table 3 - Current medical staff allocation Location Medical staff numbers Comment Fast track 6-8 Acute 6-8 EMU 2 Consultant/ JMO Paed iatric s 2-3 At the beginning of the shift, staff members make their way to their allocated stream . Three handovers may occur concurrently , noting however that there are also staggered shift start times, so there are also brief handovers involving more senior staff at other times. Combined Acute/EMU at the flight deck (EMU staff will move to acute once work in EMU is completed) Paediatrics Fast Track A colour coding team system operates within ED to enable staff to identify which stream a medical officer is working in and in the case of the Acute stream, which doctor is responsible for which patients care. The Acute stream has two teams; patients within that team are allocated to team members b y clerical staff according to arrival . In the future model, the resuscitation area will also require dedicated ED medical staffing. To support continuity of care and provide the right service at the right time, the ED will interface with all other specialty services in the Canberra Hospital and will adopt the ACEM recommendation for an integrated Territory -wide ED Network approach with the north- side hospital . 4.3.3 Nursing Nursing flow MODEL OF CARE - EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT v0.7 Page 18 of 32 At the beginning of each shift a flash handover occurs in the ED administrative space where staff are allocated to a stream , issues and themes are discussed as well as any major incident that have occurred in the shift prior. Nursing staff will then move to their allocated clinical stream. Each stream will have a nursi ng team leader whose is responsible for supporting the Nurse Navigator, manage flow within the stream, be the 'go to nurse' within the stream, in addition to having a clinical patient load. The Acute stream has two stream leaders. The nursing allocation within the Acute stream is in accordance to geographical location so that nurses can look after a small group of patients who are situated close to each other. Nursing in other streams follows the team nursing model. Rostering occurs within the ED according to the patient: staff ratio model, which differs according to the stream. As a guide the ratios are outlined in Table 4 . Table 4 - Nursing staff to patient ratio according to stream Area Ratio Staff to Patient Acute 1:3 Paediatrics 1:3 Fast Track 1:4 EMU 1:4 Resuscitation 1:1 The ED nursing workforce model consists of clinical, educational and management role s. These roles are represented in Figure 3 . Further information regarding position descriptions, roles and responsibilities for each of the positions is provided under the Reference heading contained within this document. Figure 3: Nursing structure within ED MODEL OF CARE - EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT v0.7 Page 19 of 32 4.3.4 Administrative staff Clerical staff will be located along side nursing staff at the first point of patient contact at the triag e desk. Triaging and administrative information will be gathered at the same time. Clerical staff will require access to various ICT modalities including FAX. In addition clerical staff will be distributed throughout the ED in workroom adjacent to staff st ations. 4.5 Workforce Projected staff profiles have been developed to inform this stage of planning and will be subject to adjustment both in numbers and classification as better clarity is gained around MOCs and service delivery models. This staffing profile is based on a unit of approximately 120 -130 spaces. This staffing profile is required to help guide the model of care and help develop the HPU brief and the associated schedule of accommodation (e.g. offices, staff stations and receptions). Staff profile s are subject to review. The staff listed in Table 5 are those working solely within the ED, except where annotated. Currently, a number of these staff are funded and governed through other management structures in the organisation. For the future new ED, it is highly recommended that all staff who work solely within the ED a re funded and governed within ED management structure.

Its mod el of care and staffing profile should be found in the separate MOC paper. The following note s are in relation to: Table 1 - Workforce Note 3 One Director, four Deputies, two DEMTs, Prof and two senior lecturers are likely to spend about 50% of their time averaged over all of the admin areas. Other 31 specialists will spend about 25% of their time in admin areas. Note 4 Double shift staffing: there will be a four hour overlap in the late afternoon and another overlap from 9pm to 1030pm. Note 5 Registrars generally spend an average of about 10% of thei r time in admin areas, 0.1x35 = 3.5fte i.e. three- four staff each day. Note 6 Education will be significant component of the ED functioning, and there will be a very large number of staff involved in those areas each day, again larger on weekdays than weekends . MODEL OF CARE - EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT v0.7 Page 22 of 32 Note 7 Incorporation of allied health staff within the ED will require consideration of discipline - specific clinical supervision, governance, leave back -fill, workforce/career pathways, and administrative arrangements. 4.6 Training, education and r esearch A major function of the ED is to facili tate and support education, training and research within the ED. This model is key to placing the patient at the centre of decision making and therefore enhancing the delivery of a high quality service to both adults and children. Ongoing training of the ED team is a major focus of health service delivery into the future. It is anticipated that these essential training and education facilities will be provided within the d epartment to allow easy access by staff. These facilities will also be used to provid e venues for internal meetings and family conferences, this model is key to the provision of person centred care. With an increase in ED presentations to the Canberra Hospital and Health Services (CHHS), from 85,000 in 2016 -17 FY, to predictions of over 15 0,000 in 2031 -323, the number of staff will approximately double. This will lead to challenges brought about by a large increase in the total number of staff as well as change in seniority . This will also lead to significant challenges in regard to education and training provision and logistics. In addition to registrar training in Emergency Medicine, the ED will continue to train large numbers of medical students and junior medical officers each term. Resources and facilities will be required to pr ovide onsite nursing and allied health training to staff that provides care solely within ED. As a twenty -four hour service delivery model, in order to ensure all staff have access to education and training opportunities, resources and training facilities will be available 24 hours, seven days a week. Education and training programs are inclusive of, but not limited to: service delivery updates, quality Improvement, mandatory training, mental health training, A dvanced Cardiac Life Support , Neonatal Advance d Life Support , in-service education program s, mock scenarios, competency assessments, orientation of new staff, triage program, resus citation programs , Trauma Nursing Core Course , transition program s. The ED maintains a strong focus on education , training and research programs through structured positions and portfolios . The ED contributes to teaching students from the Australian National University (ANU) Medical School, University of Canberra, Australian Catholic Universi ty, Charles Sturt University, the Canberra Institute of Technology, clinical placements for medics from the Australian Defence Force (ADF) and paramedic services. 5. Service support elements 5.1 Essential equipment and t echnology services Bedside data e ntry Staff will need access to computers at each bedside, staff stations, in consultation, treatment and procedure rooms. Clinicians (nurse, allied health, doctor, etc.) should have a tablet device to enter relevant patient information, order tests, review results, send outpatient refer rals, provide discharge emails (to patient and GP). This should include entering information in a real time medical record, that all involved in the patients care can see. These handheld devices should also be 3 ACT Emergency Department modelling - Hardes and Associates 2018 MODEL OF CARE - EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT v0.7 Page 23 of 32 the communication method between staff within and outside the ED, and may be best used when plugged into wall mounts. Access is required to a mobile device platform (computer on wheels) for the purpose of data entry. One device will be used between two bed spaces. Wi-Fi Provision for medically saf e wireless networking throughout the clinical area. Wi-Fi internet access will be provided throughout the Department (including lounge/wait areas) for use by staff and visitors. Printer Printers are required at the staff station in each stream, at reception/triage and in close proximity to the ambulance entrance. Space is required for equipment relating to electronic medication/pathology/wristband/programs. Hearing loop Hearing loop is to be available at triage/reception and scattered through the s treams. Each stream will have at least one area with hearing loop installed; this will include interview, consult and meeting rooms. Patient monitoring Patients should be issued with Electronic wristbands that provide real time tracking ability, can be sc anned by clinician devices to confirm identity and provide alerts for allergies etc Patient monitoring at bed spaces, and selected other spaces (e.g. procedure rooms) will be configured for monitoring at a central location with real time reporting. All re suscitation beds are to have haemodynamic monitoring and ventilation equipment. Central monitoring will feature in all streams. All monitoring modalities will be compatible with other critical care areas within the hospital including ICU/CCU and Interventi onal Suite. Patient beside entertainment Where appropriate and required, patient entertainment (i.e. TV) will be provided. Bedside data entry for clinical staff will be provided by an alternate system. Patient entertainment will be available in all paedi atric areas. TV in lounge/wait areas providing access to entertainment and health information. Telemedicine/v ideo conferencing Selected clinical spaces will be configured to provide remote telemedicine for patients located in the ACT to access services pr ovided elsewhere. These facilities can be located in either the Education room or a communal office area. Communication ED has the following specific requirements for communication devices. The most appropriate latest technology will be required for: communicating during systems fail or in disaster response audible communication in all clinical and non -clinical areas of the ED with access to points in multiple locations communication will be via real time direct smart phone / tablet device leading to minimal landline or overhead paging use MODEL OF CARE - EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT v0.7 Page 24 of 32 Communications centre The Communication Centre will be the focal point for communication, with ready access and visibility. A mini switch board will be operated by a clerk/switch operator to manage incoming and outgoing calls and paging within ED. Patient transfer advice and re ferrals may also be provided by a clinician within this centre. The room requires the ability to be multipurpose and perform a range of activities and functions including switchboard function and space for senior ED staff to co-ordinate urgent and emergen t ED issues. This room will also be important in teleconferencing with other facilities. Biomedical equipment m anagement Services will be provided by the Biomedical Service in the Canberra Hospital. A workroom will be provided within the ED where Equipment Officers (also known as a Technical Officers) will manage the equipment requirements of ED. Further to the ED workroom, a satellite Biomedical Workroom, where repairs and maintenance of equipment will be required. 5.2 Environmental and supply services Food Services Food for EMU will be delivered to the ward in a food retherm trolley and docked for distribution by a food services staff member. Meals are not provided to families; however they will have access to tea and coffee facilities, reheating facilitie s and a shared patient/family dining room. Within other stream sandwiches , snacks, tea and coffee and water will be provided. These are to be available in close location to treatment areas . Linen Linen supplies will be as business as usual. Supplies are de livered by Capital Linen Service and delivered daily. In order to decrease travelling time for staff, linen trolleys are to be distributed within the ED stream and will be stocked by an ED assistant Stores Stores are delivered regularly, with stock levels monitored by Purchasing and Inventory Control System (PICS). A large selection and quantity of stores is required within the ED. Adequate storage is to be provided, including point of care cupboard and storage within treatment bays. Waste m anagement Waste will be managed as per the facility -wide policy for managing waste. Waste streaming bays will be available throughout the ED. 5.3 Core s ervices 5.3.1 Diagnostic Imaging Patients in the resuscitation area will have direct access CT. Diagnostic Imagin g modalities including x -ray , OPG and CT and an ultrasound suite will be located in ED. Imaging staff are to be dedicated to and rostered within the ED, with services available 24/7. Where clinically appropriate, patients will be escorted to the required modality by a Wardsperson. If the patient is critically unwell/unable to be moved, the mobile x -ray/ultrasound will be taken to the patient bedside. MODEL OF CARE - EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT v0.7 Page 25 of 32 There will be multiple portable ultrasound machines in use throughout the ED. As with existing practice, these will largely be used by ED specialists, ED registrars, and for some applications by ED nursing staff. Within the resuscitation stream gantry style x -ray will be available along with C -arm capability. 5.3.2 Pathology Sampling will occur at the beds ide by a suitably qualified staff member. Pathology services will include the use of point of care testing, which is expected to increase in use over the lifespan of the facility. Rapid access to pathology labs through the use of pneumatic tube and electr onic result system, including immediate electronic notification of results availability . 5.3.3 Pharmacy Rapid access to pharmacy services within the ED will be provided and include dedicated pharmacy staff based in the ED, and provision of automated dispensing machines (ADM) located throughout the ED to support clinical care. ADM stock levels are monitored electronically, with restocking managed by a pharmacy technician. Restricted and individualised medications are monitored and stocked by the ED pharmaci st/s who will be available seven days a week extended hours will be required. A wall mounted medication safe is required within the ED for storage of restricted medication as a safeguard against ADM failure. 5.4 Security At the core of the MoC for ED is the right of staff, patients and others within the ED, to be provided with a safe environment and workplace. To this end there will be appropriate guidelines, policies and where appropriate, training and education to mitigate and safely manage occupational violence and behavioural disturbances. In addition, there will be an area to safely manage individuals exhibiting signs of behavioural disturbance within the ED. This facility will provide the ability for staff to safely observe and manage the care of the p atient until the patient has de -escalated or is transferred to an alternate location. These spaces within the ED are to be at the entrance of the unit and modelled on 'behavioural assessment rooms' (BAR's). Correctional services patients may present to the ED accompanied by two correctional officers. If a correctional services patient requires resuscitation or continuous physiological monitoring, the patient will be managed in the most appropriate clinically area. Otherwise the patient will be managed in single rooms or isolation room where possible. The rooms should be large enough to enable the patient to be accompanied by two correctional officers, the room should be located to enable ease of supervision and provide minimal disturbance to other patients, protect the privacy and dignity of the patient and consideration should be given to the paths of access to and from the room. To support the safety and security of staff, a fixed duress will be available throughout the unit, particularly in interview rooms and at staff stations. The hospital security room will also be located within the ED to provide a 24 hour presence within ED, and act as a base for out of hour's security operations within the hospital. MODEL OF CARE - EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT v0.7 Page 26 of 32 5.5 Business support s ervices Support services w ill be in keeping with CHHS inpatient ward requirements. Dedicated cleaners will be allocated to ED. Cleaning equipment is to be located in close proximity to clinical areas to enable prompt cleaning of spills. 5.6 Volunteers Appropriately trained and cre dentialed volunteers perform an integral role in the ED. They are part of the overall care for ED patients and play a significant role in the experience of patients, families and support persons in the ED . A volunteer will be available at front of house to assist with enquires and way finding. 5.7 Clinical support persons Clinical support persons will be dedicated to the ED . Clinical support persons will assist with manua l handling, patient transfers, moving medical equipment and after -hour blood couriering. The service is required 24hrs a day 7 days per week . Hospital Assistant role includes restocking point of care locations and cleaning treatment cubicles between patients. Communication with these staff will occur via pager and the audible page r system within the ED. In order to ensure that these staff are immediately available and can assist with patient flow, an interchange/setting area is required for use between tasks. 6. Benefits (Service Innovation and Efficiency) The integration of CH ED on the south -side at Woden with the North- side ED ACT Health will create a Territory wide Emergency Service and will lead to significant benefits. Staffing, patient flow and governance links will enhance patient care. The ACEM also recommends an integrated Network. The smaller \"minimalist\" front of house waiting room, in conjunction with sub -waiting rooms associated with each clinical stream will allow rapid movement of patients to the clinical area where they will be assessed and treated; directly adjacent to the clinical staff. This will enhance patient flow, with improvements in National Emergency Access Targets ( NEAT ) performance, patient care, and the experience of ED patients, their families and support persons. Focused assessment by teams al lowing for early referral to inpatient teams and commencement on pathways for admission/transfer or discharge allows for a more efficient way of managing common presentations. Tablet devices for all clinicians and administration staff with bedside entry and communication, should lead to minimal requirement for write up space, password protection for confidentiality of clinical records and remote access for triaging of patient referrals. Electronic wristbands for patients will allow for real time tr acking ability, reduction in clinical and identification errors, as clinician devices should be able to scan these to confirm identity and provide alerts for allergies and medical details. Integration of medical imaging (CT, x-ray, ultrasound) within the E D physically and by processes will enhance care for high and low acuity patients, and reduce length of stay. MODEL OF CARE - EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT v0.7 Page 27 of 32 Geographically separate registrar review space to the ED will enhance flow, and coordinated patient care . Dedicated allied health teams in the ED will improve timely access to allied health services within NEAT guidelines at a patient's first contact with the health system and improve patient flow to the wards or to outpatient community services (thereby avoiding patient admission). For future service development and innovation it is essential that there will be identification of space for future expansion adjacent to the ED, such that should future requirements direct that extension of the ED is necessary, this will be done in such a way that maxim ises functional outcome, and can be achieved without major effect on other structures. ED avoidance strategies The tertiary ED services will be provided at the CH site in Woden, and will be integrated with the ED services provided at the North Canberra hospital site. Opportunities to improve patient flows by directing patients to the most appropriate ED will be explored. There may be a privately managed GP service provided adjacent to the ED for patients willing to pay for services (future state unknown) . Consideration is being given to establishment of an ambulatory Specialist Registrar Review Clinic external to the ED, to which patients can be referred for follow up at the conclusion of the ED episode of care. MODEL OF CARE - EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT v0.7 Page 28 of 32 7.Monitoring and evaluation The model of c are will be monitored and evaluated through quantitative measures such as improvement in KPIs, e.g. NEAT, and qualitative measures including complaint and compliment analysis, culture surveys, Quality assurance process outcomes. Outcome Measure (KPI) Target Improved patient flow National Emergency Access Target (see definitions) National Emergency Access Target (NEAT) requires ED patients to be admitted, referred for treatment in aninpatient unit, or discharged within fourhours. At the time of wr iting, NEAT is no longer used nationally, but continues to beused at jurisdictional level to driveperformance.80%+ Patients who arrive in the ED are seen and do not depart without waiting Did not wait % Include specific measure of MentalHealth patients<5% Seclusion All instances of seclusion are reviewed 100% Improved pathways Percentage of patients admitted toinpatient wards from a short stay uni tLess than 15% Improved patient experience Percentage of patient rating theirexperience as good or very good greater than 90% MODEL OF CARE - EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT v0.7 Page 29 of 32 8.

This infrastructure project is part of the ACT Government's 10 -Year Health Plan and is in response to the increasing demand on ACT hospitals and health services across the territory. The ACT Government 2017 Budget provided funding for the first stages of the SPIRE project which includes planning and the commencement of design. A Model of Care (MoC) is a planning document that broadly defines the way health services are delivered and outlines best practice care for a person using this service. This MoC planning document has been developed for building design only and is required by the prospective design consultants to enable design development. For noting, a complete patient journey MoC is a s ubsequent piece of work. ACT Health engaged Healthcare Management Advisors (HMA) Pty Ltd to undertake the MoC development in collaboration with staff from Health Services Redesign and Building Health Service's Program. Development of this document occurred between February and March 2018 with internal ACT Health stakeholders who have been identified within this document. Outstanding issues that require resolution over the next design phases are noted at the beginning of this document. 2.Description of the s ervice An Intensive Care Unit (ICU) is a specially staffed and equipped, separate and self- contained area of a hospital dedicated to the management of patients with life -threatening illnesses, injuries and complications, and monitoring of potentially life -threatening conditions. It provides special expertise and facilities for support of vital functions through the skills of medical, nursing, allied health and other personnel experienced in the management of these problems. At the CH , ICU staff also provide services outside of the ICU such as emergency response e.g. Medical Emergency Team (MET), trauma response, tracheostomy follow up and o utreach services. The provision of care to critically ill patients is by nature unpredictable and unexpected. This results in the need for consideration of surge capacity as a core requirement of any MoC . 2.1. Target population CH provides tertiary leve l services in the Territory and neighbouring regional centres in surrounding Southern NSW. The target population of the ICU is critically ill patients from the CH catchment as a tertiary referral hospital. There are two distinct patient groups which will be provided for in futur e through Intensive Care Services at the Adult Intensive Care Unit (AICU) and the Paediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) . Th e AICU will provide care for critically ill patients, in single or multiple organ failure, and those at risk of further deterioratio n (e.g. post complex surgery), aged 16 years or more . In addition AICU staff will provide an o utreach service which extends care beyond the walls of the physical ICU, providing acute resuscitation for those patients who deteriorate on the general wards, t racheostomy review and care, a response to the trauma calls in the Emergency Department (ED) and follow up of ICU discharges. Th e PICU is envisaged to provide care for critically ill patients, in single or multiple organ failure, and those at risk of further deterioration (e.g. post complex surgery), from 28 days of age through to 16 years. This service is one not currently provided by th e ICU service within the Division of Critical Care . However, due to the geographical isolation of the area and lack of alternative immediately Model of Care Intensive Care Unit v0.7 Page 5 of 32 accessible options, the AICU has historically admitted children aged between two and 16 years for the purpose of short term organ support in the event of critical illness, while awaiting transfer to a PICU and/or resolution of their acute single organ failure. F or the same reasons, the Neonatal Intensive Care U nit (NICU) at CH has historically managed children beyo nd 28 days, up to as old as two years, for immediate resuscitation and support while awaiting Newborn and Paediatric Emergency Transport Service ( NETS ) transfer and/or definitive management depending on the condition. I t is likely that the age and weight criteria for admission to NICU, PICU and AICU will be considered in interim stages as the capacity is built up in the ACT to provide this service. The emergency response and outreach s ervice for p aediatric patients in CH is not currently supported by the A ICU. However , it is envisaged that within the model of a stand -alone PICU, the PICU staff would provide a similar service for the wider hospital population as the AICU staff, with response to deteriorating patients, tracheostomy review and care, trauma response and ICU follow -up. Response to infants in the neonatal period will continue to be provided out of the NICU. CH has level 6 (Tertiary facility) intensive care services as per the NSW Guide to the Role Delineation of Clinical Services . As per the College of Intensive Care Medicine ( CICM ) Guidelines the CH ICU is a level 3 ICU capable of providing complex multi -organ support for adult patients for indefinite periods of time. [1] The a bility to support some specialised conditions are limited by the hospital's subspecialty provision which is currently in evolution. At the present time: Spinal and burns patients are resuscitated and stabilised, but then moved to specialised ICUsin NSW capable of providing for their highly specialised complex care needs. It is not anticipated that this will change in the near future and that these patients will continue to be transferred out of the ACT after short term stay in the ED or ICU. Patients in need of Extra -Corporeal Membrane O xygenation (ECMO) are currently transferred to Sydney. However, it is anticipated that under the planned new MoC , a large proportion of these patients will remain in the ACT. A proportion of these patients will stillrequire transfer to Sydney e.g. for solid organ transplant and/or left ventricular assistdevice/artificial heart implantation, as the highly specialised services will not be provided inthe ACT. Paediatric ECMO will not be provided within the ACT. Critically ill children with multi- organ failure or projected requirement for greater than 24 hours of ventilator support are currently transferred to the Sydney Children's Hospit al N etwork. However, it is anticipated that a large majority of these patients will be cared fo r w ithin a PICU within the ACT under the planned new MoC . A small number of critically ill c hildren with complex care needs will still require transfer to the Sydney Children's Hospital Network for specialised services not provided in the ACT, such as highly specialised surgic al o r tran splant management. 3.Care/service s etting Within CH, the ICU is grouped under the Critical Care Division, along with ED, Retrieval Services, Patient Flow Management and Assessment and Planning Units. [2] Currently the ICU is located on level 3 of Building 12 of the CH. Under the proposed SPIRE deve lopment, the ICU will relocate to level 7 of the SPIRE building. The ICU is a physical location in which critically ill patients or patients at high risk of dete rioration such as post complex elective surgery, are cohorted and managed under the di rection of a specially trained d octor who is a Fellow of the CICM . ICU provides special expertise and facilities for the support and monitoring of vital functions and use s the skills of medical, nursing, allied health and other personnel experienced in the clinical management of patients with life -threatening illnesses, Model of Care Intensive Care Unit v0.7 Page 6 of 32 conditions, injuries and complications. Paediatric and Adult Intensive Care service provision require different though complimentary skill sets, and staff working within these separate areas are trained specifically in these skills. Intensive care staff provide some acute resuscitation and support to patients who deteriorate or are at risk of deteriorating t hat are not yet physically located in the ICU in the form of m edical emergency response, direct o utreach referrals, tracheostomy s ervice (TRACS) and trauma response. Historically patients admitted to the ICU have been loosely defined as either \"Intensive c are\" or \"High dependency\" type patients and in the past were physically moved around the footprint of the unit depending on these categories of care. In the evolution of this specialty service it is recognised that these tight definitions are no longer app licable as this describes only the nursing: patient ratios (1:1 care for intensive care and 1:2 for high dependency level patients) and is a fluid determination which can change multiple times in a day. These changing care needs are now seen as part of the critically ill patient's journey while they remain within the physical ICU , and there are no physical separations of an intensive care or high dependency care bed. 3.1. Environmental considerations With the expansion of the Outreach s ervice, it is anticipated that the future ICU will be divided into operational 'pods' for the treatment of patient cohorts with similar needs, for example: general medicine cardiovascular including cardiothoracic surgery patients, patients with cardiac failure, and in future ECMO therapy patients surgical patients including elective surgery, trauma and neurosurgery chronic critical illness paediatric patients. Within in each pod there will be designated staff, space to accommodate up to 12 bed spaces, access for bariatric patient s and negative or positive isolation room/s ( class N or P ). One pod will also be designed for cohort isolation with patient and staff flow arranged to minimise potential contamination to the remaining ICU. The care of families is pivotal in the service delivery model. Hence, design should take into account the need for some families to stay for extended periods of time with their critically unwell loved one. For AICU patients, this area would be suitably located outside of the treatment space. However, for PICU patients, family space would need to be considered adjacent or within the treatment space. Other considerations specific to the care needs of the critically ill patient group are: access to outdoor spaces which allow for continuation of their multi -organ support in these environments, especially critical for the long stay patients access to a rehabilitation space, which allows for continuation of their multi- organ support access to suitable spaces for palliative care requirements including larger areas that can accommodate larger families including children waiting areas that are family -friendly and allow for some privacy among family groups. Another specific requirement is consideration of the patient and family who are undertaking a process of organ donation. The d onation after cardiac death process especially requires urgent transport between the area of palliation and the operating suite within minutes of the declaration of death. The ICU provides a virtual 'external pod', which includes specialist medical staffing for the outreach service, which includes MET response, management of admissions to the ICU (e.g. admitting office Model of Care Intensive Care Unit v0.7 Page 7 of 32 for direct referrals from ED and Retrieval service), trauma response, TRACS and in future the follow up of ICU surviv ors. 3.2. Change to model At present the CH ICU has a physical footprint that includes 31 beds with dedicated cardio -thoracic bays, and four c ombined alternating pressure isolation rooms (enabling the room to have either negative or positive pressure) . The CH ICU is planning to expand the range of services to be provided to consumers in the region, which will include: ECMO - AICU only PICU follow up and bereavement clinic/support Integrated psychological and social support infectious threat quarantine and access . The future service will also include separate negative (class N) and positive (class P) pressure isolation rooms in accordance with the Australasian Health Facility Guidelines (AHFG) . [3] Under the new MoC , the CH ICU will remain a level 3 ICU, but will have expanded care capacity as described above. In addition, future service provision may also include invasive organ supports as the technology and skills in this area develop. ECMO Extra corporeal membrane oxygen ation (ECMO) therapies, venoarterial (VA) and venovenous (VV), are now commonly offered to a wide range of ICU patients with severe cardio -respiratory failure and can be regarded as the standard of care for patients with these conditions in whom conventional therapy is failing. Initiation of ECMO therapies is time critical in some cases, which makes the need for hospital transfer for this therapy sub- optimal. Development of ECMO services will require specialist ECMO equipment (machine) and upskilling of staff to support this service provision. PICU At present, many ch ildren who could otherwise be cared for locally are retrived interstate to the Sydney Children's Hospital Network. An independent review conducted in 2014 supported the development of a PICU services in Canberra. At this stage, the proposed PICU will be co -located with the AICU in a separate pod and attended by specially trained staff using paediatric specific equipment. Follow up and bereavement clinic Post Intensive Care Syndrome is a collection of health conditions common to survivors of a critical illness, typically involving neurological, psychological and functional problems. Post Intensive Care Syndrome is more common after prolonged ICU admission and is associated with ongoing healthcare resource utilisation, increased hospital readmission rates and outpatient presentations . [4] Families of patients who do not survive their ICU stay require support and bereavement counselling. Social work services currently include grief counselling and information that is provided to patients/families where comfort care is anticipated or when death occurs. Bereavement follow up is currently offered to families who have been identified at high risk of complicated grief. Aboriginal Liaison Officer follow up with bereavement, 'sorry busines s' and support is also provided for Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander families. Model of Care Intensive Care Unit v0.7 Page 8 of 32 The expansion of the follow up and bereavement program would enable support to all patients and their families in the period of time after critical illness. These multidisciplinary services will be designed to improve community level care and reduce hospital presentation and admission rates. Integrated psychological and social support The involvement of a clinical psychologist on a more regular basis in the care of critically ill patients and support of their families would enhance the holistic care of ICU patients and families. The model of this service would be based on that currently provided within CH. Infectious threat and quarantine Future service provision planning needs to consider quarantine of patients including cohorting of patients , and flow of potentially infectious patients and contaminated waste in and out of the unit without risk to other patients requiring ICU support services. The AHF G recommend [3] that one hospital in each Australian capital city will have designated Class Q isolation room/s providing facilities for patients with highly infectious pathogens such as haemorrhagic fevers and pneumonic plague. These patients require a further level of containment over and above the standard negative pressure isolation room. 4.Care provision continuum and w orkforce 4.1. Philosophy and principles of c are The mission of the CH ICU is to deliver seamless, outstanding care to critically ill patients and their families. The ICU current and planned MoC is a multidisciplinary team (MDT) based approach to holistic patient care, including compassionate care for patients' families and friends. Highly specialised medical, nursing and allied health staff work collaborativ ely with referring clinicians to adopt the most appropriate evidenced based care for each patient. Patient observation and proximity of staff to patients are critical fact ors in the MoC . The clinical infrastructure and staff profile required to provide an ICU service needs to reflect the complex nature of the monitoring and therapeutic interventions undertaken within the service. An ICU should be designed to minimise the movement of critically ill patients during their stay (i.e. i f a patient's condition improves or deteriorates, a bed move should not be required). 4.2. Business rules The College of Intensive Care Medicine of Australia and New Zealand ( CICM ) has a suite of Inten sive Care policies, guidelines and standards, including Minimum Standards for ICUs (IC -1) and ICU based Rapid Response Systems (IC -26). The full list of resources is available from the CICM website. [5] The Minimum Standards for ICU also outline staff, equipment and floor space requirements. [1] The standards for PICU are described in these documents as well. ACT Health CH specific policies and procedures relevant for the ICU include: Code Blue and Deteriorating patient procedure and policy documents Relevant S pecialist referral pathway s Tracheostomy Care Service ( TRACS) referral procedure policy document.Model of Care Intensive Care Unit v0.7 Page 9 of 32 4.3. Patient pathways Referrals to the Intensive Care service for potential admission to the unit occur via numerous means as described in the following sections and presented below (both PICU and AICU) . 4.3.1. Referrals Refe rrals are received from any area in the CH. Most emergency admissions to the ICU are referred via the ICU Outreach team from the ED , Retrieval Service or inpatient wards. ED oTrauma: the ICU Outreach doctor is on the trauma code team as per the Trauma Team Activation guideline. On activation of the trauma code page, the ICU Outreach docto r a ttends the ED, with the final disposition of the patient under the direction of the Trauma code team leader. A large proportion of these patients will be admitted to IC U v ia the angiography suite or the atre suite. oNon Trauma: any ED patients who are identified by an Emergency physician to potentially require ICU admission are referred to the ICU via the ICU Outreach docto r v ia the ICU Outreach pager or registrar phone. Retrieval service (Canberra Region Retrieval Service in the ACT or Medical Retrieval Unit in NSW): oTrauma being transported to CH via the retrieval service will always be transferred to the ED and referred to ICU via the Trauma team activation process. Retrieval doctors may contact the IC U Outreach doctor (usually consultant phone) to alert them to the transfer to ED if the patient is likely to be admitted eventually to ICU - in order to determine capacity and therefore best transfer destination.Referral Canberra Hospital ICU cares for over 2,000 critically ill patients per year , for a range of conditions including general medicine, cardiovascular, surgery including neurosurgical and trauma and chronic illness .Admission Admissions are accepted following referral to the ICU Consultant. Admissions are based on patient's likely benefit, disease process, comorbidities and frailty.Access ICU capacity is dependant on available physical beds and appropriate staff. Capacity can be influenced bybed block, \"front door\" triage and \"back door\" triage. Ifatcapacity patients may be refused and transferred elsewhere.Treatment Multiple treatments include physical, psychological and drug therapies. Staff require education and up to date equipment to meet theneeds of patients. Coordination Multiple staff are involved in the care of each ICU patient. The team in ICU includes clinical, clerical and support staff. Care is coordinated through the clinical nurses and Consultant in charge.Discharge Discharge planning for most patients occurs on the day of discharge at the MDT daily handover. Electronic discharge generated for treating hospital team and general practitioner. Elective -via operating theatres Emergency -ED: Trauma or non -Trauma Emergency -Wards: Direct or via MET Emergency -via operating theatres Emergency -other hospitals via retrieval serviceReferrals received from anywhere in the Canberra Hospital campus, e.g. Surgeons, Emergency Department and inpatient wards. Referrals from Retrieval Services typically attend the ED in the first instance. Referrals may also come from other hospitals via the retrieval service. Some referrals do not require admission e.g. TRACS or some MET calls. Access to intensive care can sometimes be delayed due to ICU capacity Family members may have limited access depending on space or treatment needs Access to accommodation for interstate family can be limitedTreatment and care is planned daily and reviewed regularly by MDTs to adjust for individual responses. MDT care includes doctors, nurses and a range of allied health professionals. Nursing care provided at 1:1 or 1:2 ratios as clinically required.

Family given bereavement support. Option todonate organs where possible .Figure 1: ICU patient pathway Model of Care Intensive Care Unit v0.7 Page 10 of 32 oNon trauma referrals to ICU from retrieval services will occur to the ICU Outreach consultant phone. As per the inter -hospital transfer/referral procedure policy document, the default is transfer from an ICU to an ICU or transfer from an ED to an ED. Wards at CH: oVia MET activation according to the Code Blue and d eteriorating patient procedure policy documents. oDirect referral from inpatient teams to the ICU team occurs via the ICU Outreach registrar phone or pager, only after the admitting specialist has been contacted via theSpecialist referral pathway outlined in the relevant procedure policy document. Theatres at CH: oThe anaesthetic or surgical team contact the ICU Outreach consultant or registra r p hone to refer an operative patient for emergency admission to ICU. The majority of these emergen cy admissions from theatre do not transition through the PACU prior to ICU admission and usually require 1:1 nursing care in ICU even if not ventilated. This isnegotiated on a case -by-case basis with the relevant clinical teams. Non-CH referrals Direct referrals are not usually accepted from clinical areas outside of the CH without involvement of the retrieval service. Within the Territory, a patient who is considered to require ICU services requires review by the local ICU specialist before referral to retrieval or ICU at Canberra Hospital. For example , if a patient located in the Calvary Public Hospital Bruce (CPHB) ED requires ICU admission, the ICU specialist or their delegate located at CPHB would review the patient first, determine their suitability for ICU and decide on the best location for the provision of this service, and make the referral to CH and/ or Retrieval services as required . External calls for referral to CH ICU should be directed to the ICU Outreach consultant phone. Non-admitted referr als There are some services for which referral is made to ICU services for patients who do not ultimately require admission to the ICU , as follows: TRACS: patient s are referred to this service as outlined in the TRACS referral procedure policy document. ICU provides staff to perform at least twice weekly rounds on all patients in the CH who have been referred to this service. MET activations who do not require admission at that time to ICU are occasionally placed on an Outreach referrals list and are followed up by a member of the ICU outreach team at time intervals determined by the ICU consultant responsible for the service at this time. In the planned new MoC , there may be a role for an outpatient clinic for ICU survivors and/or their families (including bereavement care), and follow up of discharges from theICU . I t is anticipated that under the new MoC that there will be a separate Paediatric Outreach team which will fulfil the functions of the ICU Outreach team for patients aged 28 days to 1 6 y ears, while the Adult Outreach team will receive referrals for patients greater than 16 years of age.Model of Care Intensive Care Unit v0.7 Page 11 of 32 4.3.2. Admissions and access The decision on whether a patient is admitted to the ICU at CH ultimately lies with the rostered ICU specialist. This is underpinned by ACT Health's philosophy of treating the right person at the right place at the right time. However, admission is limited by the capacity of the ICU service which has restricted surge resourcing. The decision on whether to admit to ICU is based on whether the patient is likely to benefit from invasive monitoring and/or organ supports, depending on the disease process and its likely reversibility, underlying comorbidities and frailty of the patient being referred for consideration of admission. All of these factors determine whether the patient will survive the ICU admission with a reasonable quality of life. In some cases , the burden and suffering the patient is likely to experience as a result of the organ support provided in the ICU may outweigh the expected benefit of the care, in which case the admission would be considered futile and may be refused. In some circumstances patients will be admitted to the ICU to facilitate expert palliative care and/or expected referral for the purpose of fa cilitating donation of organs. Access Movement of patients into and out of the ICU should have a separate route available from public entry/exit. Rapid and urgent access to the perioperative unit and ED is required. Elective admissions Some patients undergoing complex elective surgery, or who have significant comorbidities undergoing less complex surgery, may require ventilation in the immediate post -operative period, or a higher ratio of nursing care during the immediate and intermediate post -operative period. These patients may require management decisions provided by a doctor who is immediately available and physically on site in the hospital. These patients are usually admitted to the ICU from Monday to Friday only. However, weekend bookings may be accepted by exception if there are sufficient resources to accommodate them. The capacity for elective surgical bookings is determined each year under budgetary discretion from the organisation, which takes into account previous year's activity. The patients accepted for admission are indicated on the surgical lists each morning as having a post -operative destination as being ICU. Whether the patient requires a 1:1 or 1:2 ratio of nursing care is at the discretion of the ICU care team. The referral process may occur via one of the following methods: A bed is requested by the surgical team through completion of \"request for admission\" (RFA) form, processed through surgical bookings team. If on the \"autom atic acceptance\" list which is reviewed annually by the surgical, anaesthetic and ICU senior clinicians, this patient is booked into ICU for the respective day. If not on the automatic admissions list, then th e p atient is presented to the ICU consultant gr oup for consideration of admission. A bed is requested by the Anaesthetic team, and either indicated on the anaesthetic record completed in the pre -admission clinic, which is processed through the surgical bookings team as above, or through direct referral to the ICU Outreach consultant or their delegate. If accepted for admission, the patient is placed on the elective admission list to ICU for thatday. A bed is requested for an existing inpatient by the Anaesthetic or Surgical teams, fo r a p atient who is undergoing a planned procedure on an elective list on a future date, by contacting the ICU Outreach consultant. If there is capacity in the unit on that day, and thepatient is suitable for admission, then the patient is booked in for an elective bed by th e Clinical Nurse Consultant (CNC) and confirmed with surgical bookings and theatre flow coordinator.Model of Care Intensive Care Unit v0.7 Page 12 of 32 The majority of elective surgical admission who do not require post -operative ventilation transition through the Post Anaesthetic Recovery Unit (PACU) and achieve discharge criteria from that area before admission to ICU. 4.3.3. Treatment and coordination The ICU provides MDT care under the direction of the ICU specialist to critically unwell patients or those who require an intensive level of monitoring and treatm ent. Clinical management includes , but is not restricted to , MDT ward rounds conducted at least twice daily, continuous monitoring and treatment provision, family meetings and regular multidisciplinary and multispecialty meetings. Patients are continuously monitored and ongoing reviews and treatment is planned out as required. The Intensive Care model incorporates intensive care patients and high dependency patients ensuring safe de -escalation of care for high dependency patients. Although the patient will not physically move from the ICU, high dependency patients have reduced nursing requirements. As per the CICM guidelines, nurse to patient ratio are determined by patient acuity. Patient requiring intensive care are nursed 1:1 or greater as necessary. High dependency patients are nursed at a ratio of 1:2 or as required. [1] Due to the seriousness of ICU patient conditions, family and visitors are critical to the provision of care and advocacy of patient wishes. Family members p lay an important role in the psychological wellbeing of patients and there are no restrictions to visiting times, though physical restriction of space and dignity of patients during certain care activity , may require modification of visitor numbers and tim ings. The type of specialised equipment required in the ICU depends on the organ failures to be supported and is constantly evolving. At the current time this include s but is not restricted to : information t echnology equipment to support a fully electro nic ICU including sufficient data and power outlets for all equipment ventilators , both transport and static monitors for heart rate and rhythm, blood pressure, oxygen , carbon dioxide, respiratory rates , intracranial pressure and cerebral electrical activ ity cardiac output monitors including more invasive (pulmonary artery catheter), less invasive (transpulmonary dilution) and non -invasive means dialysis machine s which include capacity for plasmapheresis X-ray machine s ultrasound machines including transoesophageal and transthoracic echo capabilities Intra -aortic balloon pump , and in the future ECMO and carb on dioxide removal transvenous pacing and external pacing modules simulators including high fidelity mannequins, airway and b ronchoscopy mannequins, intravenous access mannequins medication management systems for storage and dispensing including appropriately locked cupboards for certain drugs as per organisational policy computers on wheels for each patient pod in addition to t he computers at each bed space large viewing screens for radiology and viewing screens to facilitate patient flow and identification blood gas and other point of care te sting equipment ( e.g. thromboelastography )). The d esign of the ICU needs to include adequate space for the storage of specialised equipment , both disposable and reusable components, as well as charging points as required. The p atients' length of stay in the ICU varies depending on the reason for admission and the patients' comorbidities. L ength of stay could be a short as 12 - 24 hours post -surgery, or 18 months or more for some conditions .. Model of Care Intensive Care Unit v0.7 Page 13 of 32 The physical space for treatment in the ICU needs to accommodate for the varied needs of patients and families, while maintaining open plan design to accommodate required visual observation by clinical staff. The accommodation should be configured to facilitate efficient and effective patient care. Each pod should have its own clinical service and can function independently. Bed space layout needs to b e sufficient to accommodate the varying equipment required as well as clinical staff that will include doctors, nurses and allied health and families . Bed bays should be designed to enable nursing ratios for patients while maintaining direct line of sight (e.g. for 1:2 patients a single nurse needs to be able to visualise two patients simultaneously even when providing care to one patient while optimising privacy for patients and family members. This could be achieved through use of partitions or retractable walls. The intention is for all patients to remain in the same room / space for the duration of their admission in ICU unless they develop additional conditions which would require a move e.g. acquisition of resist ant/easily transmitted organism or chronic critical illness . However, most equipment is mobile in case patients are required to be moved to another bedspace or pod. All patient rooms are capable of providing all intensive care needs for all patients including bariatric patients. Consideration needs to be given to the acoustic de sign to minimise noise between bed bays; lighting to provide a calming environment and diurnal variation with natural light, access to outdoor areas (e.g. balconies) especially for long -term patients or terminally ill patients; and ability to control the ambient temperature to address the minimal movement and clothing of ICU patients. Additional private meeting spaces for the purpose of family meetings need to be provided of suffic ient size to accommodate large family groups, multiple care teams and patients if required. Within the waiting areas, which may be located inside and/or outside the ICU itself, consideration should be given to families with small children with appropriate spaces to support breastfeeding with privacy and safety for play and supervision of children as required. Treatment of patients includes bedside teaching of more junior healthcare staff and students from all professions. This needs to be considered in t he future planning of patient treatment spaces. 4.3.4. Discharge Discharge planning in the ICU commence on admission and the patient retains a care speciality team (i.e. the admitting specialist who originally admitted the patient to the hospital ) throughout the ICU admission. Discharge from the ICU occurs when intensive monitoring and treatment is no longer required , as determined by the ICU specialist on duty, in consultation the patients' primary care team. Patients may be discharged to one of the following l ocations: a speciality inpatient ward at the CH or the Centenary Hospital for Women and Children (CHWC ) - actual ward depends on what condition the patient has , and the p atients' ongoin g t reatment and care needs. ICU coordinates inpatient beds with the patient flow unit ( PFU) or th e after -hours nurse manager for after-hours discharge if required (after hours discharge is minimised from ICU). inter -hospital transfer - requires discussion with and acceptance from the receiving ICU specialist and an admitting specialist from an inpatient team identified home (occasionally) or discharge lounge while awaiting paperwork/medications to facilitate discharge home hospice Mortuary .Model of Care Intensive Care Unit v0.7 Page 14 of 32 4.3.5. ICU Outreach MET response (Adult and Paediatric) The MET aims to provide rapid assistance in response to emergency management of a patient as deemed necessary by any nurse or doctor. The aim of this service is to improve patient outcomes by identifying deterioration where possible prior to organ failure occu rring and instituting the correct treatment as early as possible after deterioration is identified . This does not necessarily avoid the need for ICU admission. [5] The MET service provided out of adult and paediatric ICU will be responsible for calls to deteriorating patients as identified in the relevant organisational policy and procedure documents at the time. The outreach team reviews any patient referred to ICU services who a re located on the CH campus. This includes direct referrals from any ward area, PACU/theatres and Emergency including Trauma code activations. The o utreach team is involved in TRACS currently under the governance of allied health. In future the o utreach te am may also be involved in ICU survivor review and outcome clinic, and there may be some role in bereavement care which has not yet been determined. 4.4. Workflow and work processes ICUs are staffed by large MDT's including the highly trained specialised doctors and nurses, as well as pharmacists, dieticians, physiotherapists, occupational and speech therapists, orthotists, radiographers and social workers. ICU doctors and nurses respond to medical emergency response calls as outlined above. ICU Nursing staff provid e continuous nursing care to patients and their families ; support the medical team in proc edures and administ ration of medications ; and alert medical staff if a patient deteriorates. Nurses work closely with medical and allied health staff to provide high quality evidenced based care and are an integral part of the twice daily formal rounding usually led by the medical staff. Nurses liaise closely with families to ensure they are well informed of the patient care plan including discharge planning and palliative planning as relevant. Allied Health staff are responsible for ensuring a timely response to referrals , providing care and expert advice to the medical and nursing team and the patient or family in their field of expertise, and ensuring necessary follow up care has been organised. Allied health professionals are also an integral component of the regular daily ward rounds lead by the medical staff. Formalised MDT ward rounds are conducted regularly and include the patient and family, and external s pecialist teams where possible . 4.4.1. Medical Medical staff in the ICU are responsible for assessing patient suitability for admission in consultation with referring doctors, this done by the Intensivist or their delegate . Once admitted, doctors are responsibl e for stabilising the patient and creating care plans and coordinating and leading the care team. Doctors conduct at least twice daily ward rounds to review and alter patient care plans , but additional cares and decisions are being made constantly througho ut the day and night . Doctors work closely with nurses and allied health to provide best practice intensive care to patients, and ensure patients and families are well informed of the care plan. Doctors are responsible for assessing patient suitability fo r discharge from the ICU and ensuring necessary follow up has been organised including handover to accepting teams . The care of patients includes intra- hospital transfers for the purpose of care delivery (e.g. cardiac catheterisation, angiography, endoscop y) and Model of Care Intensive Care Unit v0.7 Page 15 of 32 investigation (e.g. radiology, cardiac intervention suite), usually provided by a combination of nursing, medical and support staff. ICU is an Intensivist -led MDT service. It is expected that all registered medical specialists in the ICU are Fellows of CICM . As the peak professional organisation for critical care, the CICM has significant interest in ensuring the highest standards of medical care for patients are maintained. The IC U is accredited by the CICM as a training facility and provides train ing and education to a variety of medical, nursing and allied health staff. In CICM accredited facilities, ICU Intensivists oversee the training of junior medical staff comprising advanced trainees, basic trainees and registrars from other disciplines. Intensivists supervise and support Provisional Fellows, Registrars and Residents that are undergoing specialised training in Intensive Care Medicine and carry out the day -to-day management of patients. A summary of the medical team hierarchy is provided belo w. Intensivist A consultant is a medical practitioner who has completed their specialist training, is registered with AHPRA as a specialist , and employed as a Staff Specialist (salaried) or Visiting Medical Officer (fee for service) by ACT Health. Intensive Care consultant is a Fellow of the Australian and New Zealand College of Intensive Care Medicine and referred to as an Intensivist. Provisional Fellow A Provisional Fellow in Intensive Care has completed their final College of Intensive Care Medicine Fellowship Examination and who is usually in their final year of training (\"transition year\"). A Provisional Fellow is supported by a Consultant Intensivist who is rostered to this role. Senior Registrar A Senior Registrar in Intensive Care is enrolled in the College of Intensive Care Medicine for vocational training and is usually in the advanced training pathway, after successful completion of their primary examination. Registrar A registrar is a medical practitioner who is at least four years post Bachelor of Medicine degree (classification PGY4 or higher). Registrars will usually have enrolled in vocational training in Intensive Care, Anaesthetics or Emergency Medicine, though this is not essential for the position. This is usually a pre -prim ary examination position. Senior Resident Medical Officer (RMO) Senior Resident Medical Officer (RMO) employed in Intensive Care are either employed as critical care residents, rotating through ED, ICU and Anaesthetics during the year, or are junior traine es of Basic Physicians or Basic Surgical programs. These medical officers require full support and supervision 24/7 in Intensive Care and are not expected to undertake any independent decision making while working in ICU. Model of Care Intensive Care Unit v0.7 Page 16 of 32 4.4.2. Nursing The Australian College of Critical Care Nurses recommends there must be a designated critical care qualified senior nurse per shift who is supernumerary. The Australian College of C ritical Care Nurses provides vit al resources for ICU nursing and plays a key role in the transition of nurses into intensive care and post -graduate critical care nursing, ongoing upskilling and professional development. ICU nursing staff comprises of the following: Assistant Director of Nu rsing (ADON ) - (RN level 4. 3) is responsible for Operational Governances, Clinical Governance, Workforce Management, and Business Management. Nurse Manager (NM) - (RN level 3.2) is responsible for recruitment, rostering of nursing staff and contract manag ement. Clinical Nurse Consultant (CNC ) - (RN level 3.2) is responsible for operational performance, staff performance and workplace safety. Clinical Support Nurse (CSN) - (RN level 3.1 ) is responsible for workforce development, quality performance, research and education. ICU Clinical Care Coordinators (CCC) - (RN level 3.1) are responsible for patient flow in the unit. Clinical Development Nurse (CDN ) - (RN level 2) is responsible for orientation, workforce development and undergraduate and postgraduate coordination. Bay Leaders - (RN level 2 and 1) are responsible for direct patient care and supporting consistent safe and effective nursing care, improve leadership and clinical support at the bedside in each clinical zone. Access Nurses - (RN level 2 and 1) are responsible for practical support to each clinical zone, attend 2nd response MET calls and accommodate unplanned admissions when required.

Direct physiotherapy staff are supported by a HP4 team leader, providing service coordination and clinical backfill. Physiotherapists assess patients' respiratory, cardiovascular, neurological andmusculoske letal systems to formulate treatment plans. They focus on the respiratory management of intubated patients and exercise rehabilitation of recovery patients. Dietetics Dietetics provide a key role by assessing patient nutrition needs, guiding decisions abo ut appropriate nutritional therapy, monitoring fluid and electrolyte status, adjusting thenutrition care plan to the specific disease status and changes in the patients' clinic al c onditionADON -Critical Care Operational and Clinical Governance Workforce and Business Management Nurse Manager Recruitment, roster and contract management Clinical Nurse Consultant Operational and Staff performance Workplace safetyClinical Care Coordinators - Level 3.1 Performance Quality / Safety Roster Bay Leaders RN level 1+2 Patient care Access Nurses RN level 1 +2 Support for clinical zones MET response Unplanned admissions Clinical Support Nurse Workforce Development Quality Performance Nursing Research Clinical Development Nurses Orientatio n Workforce Development Under / Post Graduate coordination Figure 3: Nursing staff workflow Model of Care Intensive Care Unit v0.7 Page 18 of 32 Dietitian assessment is delivered five days a week during business hours with cover provided for urgent referrals on Saturday and on call phone support available on Sunday. Dietetics staff are supported by a H ealth Professional Level 4 (HP4) team leader, providing service coordination and clinical backfill to the larger dietetics team. Occupational therapy Occupational therapists have a key role in the cognitive assessment and management ofpatients, activities of daily living, functional assessment and customised splint provision. Occupational Therapy (OT) services are delivered on an as needs basis 5 days a week durin g b usiness hours only. There is no identified position for ICU and no allocated FTE to ICU. Referrals for OT are prioritized and triaged according to urgency and balanced against the workload of the de partment and other areas of need in the hospital. Pharmacist The ICU Pharmacists monitors the drugs that are prescribed for interactions and appropriateness to ensure the prescribing guidelines are adhered to. Reducing error and harm from medicines through safe and quality use is an important element of Intensive CareMedicine and assists in achieving patient safety and quality standards. Current recommendation for Pharmacy support of ICU is one pharmacist per 10 patients,with an additional HP4 to provide supervision and training. Operational support for imprestrequires additional Pharmacy technician officers. Podiatry Podiatry is current ly provided as a referral service without dedicated resourcing attached to the provision of care for critically ill patients. Social Work Social workers take a lead role in addressing the needs and concerns of the family members in the ICU as well as assessing the ongoing psychosocial needs of the critically ill patient. Social work currently provide an extended hours service to ICU from 0830 - 2100, seven day s p er week. Social workers work in collaboration with the ICU MDT colleagues to provide holistic psychosocial assessment and interventions including practical and emotion al s upports to patients/family members. Co -ordination, clinical oversight and backfill is provided by a HP4 team leader, with additional on -call supervision provided by a senio r s ocial worker HP4/5 Speech Pathology Speech Pathologists provide assessment and intervention for swallowing and communication for tracheotomy and extubated pati ents. Speech Pathology currently provides ICU support during business hours Monday -Friday only. Clinicians will see patients in ICU according to their clinical caseloads (general medicine,tracheostomy, and neurology /neurosurgery). Psychology Clinical psychology does not currently provide a dedicated service for critically ill patients inICU. Future service provision should examine a collaboration between psychology and socialwork services to achieve a shared service model similar to that currently exist ing within the Trauma service.Model of Care Intensive Care Unit v0.7 Page 19 of 32 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Liaison (ALO) Service The ALO Service currently delivers an on needs basis service five days a week during business hours. There is no identified FTE/position for ICU. The ALO Service w orks within a MDT model and provides cultural assessments and supports engagement of other MDT members,including practical support to patients and their families. Allied Health A ssistants This position does not currently exist. The development of a multi disciplinary critical care Allied Health Assistant position (e.g. physiotherapy/occupational therapy/speech) wouldsupport health professionals providing clinical service to the ICU.

Clinical support persons Wards persons play an integral role in patient care and patient flow (discharges to ward/mortuary, transport to other areas of the hospital for clinical input into patient care). Other support staff for the ICU include equipment officers and operational staff such as ward clerks and cleaners 4.4.5. Administrative and support staff Administrative staff in the ICU have responsibility for reception, secretarial support for educational and other administrative activities. These are articulated in the CICM Policy Document IC-7. [7] Duties of the administrative staff include individual secretarial support to specialists, trainees and other members of the department as required prepare, circulate and update departmental duty rosters, maintain dep artmental and medical records and general administration including minuting departmental meetings educational support including coordinating administrative aspects of continuing medical education, clinical review and quality assurance activities of all departmental staff duties to support research staff activities including data entry, maintenance of databases, literature searches, manuscript preparation and correspondence with hospital committeesand outside agencies.

Training, education and research The ICU is a training unit with a commitment to growing its research capacity. Education for current staff and undergraduate and postgraduate multidisciplinary staff is considered core business in the ICU. All ICU staff both deliver and receive education. There are some individuals whose substantive position or part thereof is related to provision of education, inc luding CSN's and CDN's, as well as the specialist ICU doctors who have education and supervisory roles in their non -clinical portfolios. T raining and education activities within the ICU are delivered in a multidisciplinary format and occur in a variety of settings (bedside, tutorial style, supervision of training, simulated learning environment, half/whole day programs and external courses) with a variety of levels of healthcare professionals including undergraduate, postgraduate, pre -vocational and post -vocational. It would be anticipated that teaching and meeting spaces would be available embedded within clinical care areas to facilitate clinical teaching, with easy access (e.g. in a dedicated teaching and training centre) to larger spaces more appropriate for whole or half- day courses e.g. BASIC (Adult and Paediatric), Beyond BASIC and the Canberra Course. At minimum the considerations for in -situ teaching and training would include: education/ meeting room in each pod larger education/ meeting space in cl ose proximity to the pods, e.g. large enough fo r all m edical staff across the unit to meet in a shift. This would need to be on the same floor as the clinical areas to allow for immediate attendance to a patient if sudden unexpecteddeterioration occurred. This would need to have appropriate IT support for teaching and trainingModel of Care Intensive Care Unit v0.7 Page 21 of 32 simulation space to allow for teaching of procedures, new equipment and crisis response management within the clinical environment. ICU staff are frequently involved in other teachin g activities across the CH campus and in the ACT, including but not limited to Staff Development Unit coordinated programs, Medical Officer Support and Clinical Training Unit teaching, Australian National University, Canberra University and C anberra Instit ute of Technology programs. This includes teaching and training for: Senior Medical O fficers , prevocational and vocational Junior Medical Officers, and medical students Nurses and Nursing students Allied Health staff and Allied H ealth students administrative and clerical staff. 5.Service support elements The capacity to deliver ICU services is dependent upon having the relevant clinical and non -clinical support services available and readily accessible. A number of services support the overall tea m in the delivery of ICU service. These include (but are not limited to) the services discussed below . 5.1. Essential equipment and technology services Information Communication Technology (ICT) and data entry staff will need access to computers at each bedside, staff stations electronic med ication management electronic pathology records Meta -Vision computer programs which collect all information from the patient equipment including medication charts and enable nurse s to do patient notes computers on whee ls (at least one per pod) for ward rounds disaster contingency plans for each ICT systems electronic medical records. Existing systems for medical records management will continue. access to ICT support (Help Desk) Telemedicine/videoconferencing Selected clinical spaces will be configured to provide remote telemedicine for patients located in the ACT to access services provided elsewhere. These facilities can be located in either the education room or a communal office area. Communication Nurse Call Syste m - electronic comm unication system within clinical teams , i.e. patient o r fam ily can comm unicate with nursing staff or nurse can comm unicate with other clinic ians Everyday comm unication s e.g. phone , fax, page Intercom for access to the closed unit. Wi-Fi Provision for medically safe wireless networking throughout the clinical area Wi-Fi internet access will be provided throughout the Department (including lounge/wait areas) for use by staff and visitors.Model of Care Intensive Care Unit v0.7 Page 22 of 32 Printer Printers are required at the staff station. Space is required for equipment relating to electronic medication/pathology/wristband/programs. Hearing Loop Hearing loop is to be available at reception and the capacity installed at various consumer areas within the unit. Specific locations of hearing loop stations will be identified in the design stage of the SPIRE project. Biomedical equipment management ICU have a high concentration of specialised, technical and monitoring equipment needed to care for critically ill patients. Clinical Enginee ring is responsible for the maintenance of this equipment in close collaboration with the ICU. Usually a biomechanical engineer is devoted to the ICU portfolio and is physically located in the unit for the purpose of their work. It is essential that s uffic ient office space and equipment to support th e biomedical engineering role is pro vided for in the ICU footprint. 5.2. Environmental and supply services Food Services food services are delivered to the unit in a dedicated retherm food trolley. A recess/ dockin g s tation for the food trolley is required meals are not generally provided to families. However, tea and coffee making facilities are provided along with re -heating facilities and a fridge in a shared family space external to the closed ICU , the family wait ing room area is also equipped with tea and coffee making facilities. Linen Capital Linen Service delivers linen to the CH daily. ICU linen is replenished daily and a recess space for the linen trolley is required. Stores Large storage capacity for cons umables is required. Consumables are monitored by the Purchasing Inventory Control System (PICS) and replacement items delivered daily. Infection Control and Prevention Unit Infection Control and Prevention Unit provides an advisory role and monitors the number of patients with infections or multi- resistant organisms (MRO) and provide coordination and departmental education to facilitate patient isolation in acco rdance with National guidelines Sterilising Services Department (SSD) for sterilisation of equ ipment as required dirty utility space is required for cleaning, decontamination of equipment, stripping back equipment for terminal cleaning and drying of re -usable equipment. Some equipment will then need to be transferred to the SSD for sterilisation. Waste management Waste management is provided as per ACT Health facility wide policies. Waste streaming is required within the unit. This includes the management of sharps bins and contaminated waste. Alternative travel routes for waste transport to poin ts of public access and 'clean' items will be available. Model of Care Intensive Care Unit v0.7 Page 23 of 32 5.3. Core services 5.3.1. Medical I maging internal imaging ( e.g. mobile X -ray and ultrasound ). Equipment is permanently housed in the ICU external imaging in the medical imaging suite (note, MRI compatible transport ventilators and monitoring equipment are used when required). 5.3.2. Pathology sampling will occur at the bedside by a suitably qualified ICU staff member. Pathology samples are sent via the pneumatic tube system to the Pathology department arterial b lood gas es are analysed internally using a blood gas analysis machine located within the ICU. 5.3.3. Pharmacy bedside trolleys for stan dard pati ent medicine , one per patient central imprest stock room for all medicines lockable cupb oards at nurses ' desk for S4D and S8 medic ations in accordance with legislation. One cupboard per nursing station monitored medication fridge within a clean utility lock able room , restocked by a pharmacy technician urgent requests for medicines are given to the Pharmacists on ward rounds or sent to the p harmacy . The Pharmacist checks the medication stocks and orders as required ACT Health p lans to move to an Automated Dispensing Machine (ADM) in future (similar to the machines used in the ED). Space and power for the A DM will need t o be factored into the design. 5.3.4. Additional core services Specialty Services To support continuity of care and provide the right service at the right time ICU will interface with other spec ialty services such as General Surgery, General Medicine, Infectious Diseases, Paediatrics, Obstetrics, ED, Anaesthetics and the Pain Management Team . Tissue Viability Team Tissue Viability Team has an advisory role for wound management and provides a liaison service. DonateLife ACT The Organ Donor Coordinators from the DonateLife ACT are available 24 hours a day, seven days a week to provide information and support. When an organ donation is planned, the c oordinators ensure the deceased patient is kept in conditions that are optimal for the donated organs in the ICU and coordinate with Operating Theatres at CH and the receiving hospital for organ retrieval. Pastoral Care Chaplains from Catholic, Anglican and Uniting churches are located within the hospital. The chaplains provide spiritual support to patients and their relatives or carers. Clergy from most denominations can be contacted on request. Interpreter services As required Model of Care Intensive Care Unit v0.7 Page 24 of 32 Volunteers Volunteers provide a supportive link between relatives/families of patients admitted in the ICU and clinical staff. For example, as a locked unit it is necessary to press an intercom to talk to staff in the ICU or to be let into the unit. Volunteers assist in this process. Volunteer recruitment and rostering is led by the Personal Assistant to the Director, assisted by the CH Volunteer office. Volunteers undertake training prior to work in the ICU. 5.4. Security At the core of the MoC for ICU is the right of s taff, patients and other s in the ICU to have a safe environment/workplace with the prevention and management of occupational violence. To this end there are to be appropriate guidelines and policies aroun d the management of aggressive/ violent or behavioura lly disturbed individuals. T o support staff safety and security fixed duress will be available throughout the unit, particularly in interview rooms and at staff stations. 5.5. External service providers As well as hospital-based services, the ICU interfaces w ith a number of external services, such as: ACT Ambulance Service (ACTAS) is responsible for providing emergency and non -emergency ambulance and aeromedical ambulance services to the ACT community and surroundin g s outh east NSW region. ACTAS also provides Intensive Care Paramedics (ICPs) to the Capit al R egion Retrieval Service helicopter. [2] Capital Region Retrieval Service is a joint initiative of the governments of New South Wales and the ACT, and provides aeromedical rescue and retrieval services to the ACT and south- eastern New South Wales. Capital Region Retrieval Service and Medical Retrieval U nit is a joint initiative of th e go vernments of New South Wales and the ACT, and provides aeromedical rescue and retrieval services to the ACT and south- eastern New South Wales. Capital Region Retrieval Service is managed and staff ed by ACT Health . The medical crew are highly skilled Emergency, Intensive Care and Anaesthetic consultants and senior registrars. The usual are a o f responsibility for the service extends from the Victorian border, west to Griffith and Hay, north to Sydney and down the east coast of New South Wales. [8] General Practitioners (GP's) provide community based services to patients as a part of the medical neighbourhood. Newborn and paediatric Emergency Transport Service (NETS) is a 24/7 state- wide service o f N SW Health that provides: expert clinical advice, clinical coordination, stabilisation, and emergency treatment and inter -hospital retrieval for sick babies and children up to the age of 16 years NETS also provide a referral service for hospitals faced with a neonatal o r p aediatric emergency. [9] NSW Ambulance service (NSWAS) is responsible for providing emergency and non - emergency ambulance services in NSW. They also provide aeromedical transport via To ll R escue Heli copter Service and Air Ambulance, for both emergency and non -emergency transfers. [10] Interstate health services for transfer of patients requiring specialist services e.g. burns.Model of Care Intensive Care Unit v0.7 Page 25 of 32 5.6. Other considerations Other ICU planning considerations are those which involve movement of critically ill patients around the hospital to access interventions and diagnostics. Some examples are provided below . Proximity to cardiothoracic surgical theatres. The transport of patients to ICU post- cardiothoracic surgery requires substantial monitoring equipment and staff to physically move the patient. If the cardiothoracic theatres are not located on the same floor as the ICU, then direct vertical egress via an extra -large service lift is required to transport these patients. Proximity to Interventional Cardiology Laboratories (ICL) . Transport of critically ill patients to and from the cardiac intervention suite can involve substantial monitoring and organ sup port equipment, as well as staff to move the patient, similar with the cardiothoracic surgical suite . Retrieval service access. The ICU requires access to direct retrieval rout es from the Helipad and ambulance bays /ED and Medical Imaging . Proximity to Perioperative and Interventional Centre for the purpose of organ donation, especially for donation after cardiac death where transport between place of palliation and death, and organ retrieval is time critical. Proximity to Diagnostic Imaging. Critically ill patients are frequently transported to radiology for MRI and CT scans, as well as to angiography suite to undergo procedures. These patients require substantial equipment for monitoring and organ support, as well as staff to transport with them. 6.Benefits (service innovation and e fficiency) 6.1. Outline The ICU MoC aims to provide appropriate access to and patient management within the ICU which is described by the ACT Health principle of providing the right care to the right patient at the right time . Based on the Australian Council on Healthcare Standards (ACHS) , monitoring should occur across the following areas at the time of the publication of this document : access and exit block to assess delays in patients accessing ICU or being discharged from IC U in tensive care patient management to assess premature discharge form IC U in tensive care patient treatment regarding early prophylactic treatment for v enous thromboembolism (VTE) c entral line -associated bloodstream infection utilisation of patient assess ment systems to monitor participation in appropriate dat a re positories compassionate practice towards families of patients. It is anticipated that these may have changed by the time of implementation of this MoC and will need to be regularly updated. 6.2. Qualitative benefits Qualitative elements of the ICU model of care will be measured through the patient satisfaction survey. This may include: Appropriateness of the waiting space Satisfaction with treatment and care provided including communication with families andpatients Appropriate and empathic treatment of families.Model of Care Intensive Care Unit v0.7 Page 26 of 32 6.3. Quantitative benefits Quantitative elements of the ICU MoC will be measured throu gh the ACHS clinical indicators . [11] These are: Access and exit block 1.1 ICU - adult non -admission due to inadequate resources 1.2 ICU - elective adult surgical cases deferred or cancelled due to unavailability of bed 1.3 ICU - adult transfer to another facility/ICU due to unavailability of bed 1.4 ICU - adult discharge delay more than 12 hours 1.5 ICU - adult discharge between 6pm and 6am 1.6 ICU - paediatric discharge between 6pm and 6am Intensive care patient treatment 3.1 VTE prophylaxis in adult patients within 24 hours of ICU admission Central line -associated bloodstream infection 4.1 Adult ICU -associated CI -CLABSI 4.2 Paediatric ICU-associated PI- CLABS I U tilisation of patient assessment systems 5.1 Participation in the ANZICS CORE Adult Patient Database 5.2 Participation in the ANZICS CORE Paediatric Intensive Care registry 5.3 Participation in the ANZICS CORE Critical Care Resources survey In addition , the ICU Executive team have identified a number of evidence based key performance indicators for the service , as follows : Outcome measures oICU mortality and SMR oPain management oRate of ICU survivors to home oPatient and family satisfaction score Process measures oGoal Richmond Agitation and Sedation Score documentation oDVT prophylaxis compliance oTargeted temperature management implemented in out of hospital cardiac arrest oSafe tidal volumes delivered oPlateau inspiratory pressures not exceeding 32cmH2O oTime to antimicrobials in sepsis not exceeding 60 minutes Access measures oAdmission block oRefusals and over capacity transfer to other ICUs oElective surgery cancellation oBed block and avoidable days in ICU oAfter hours discharge oMET duration oConcurrent MET activation oOccupancy - capacity measure oChronically critically ill patients Complication measures oCentral line associated bacteraemia oMulti -resistant organism acquisitionModel of Care Intensive Care Unit v0.7 Page 27 of 32 oHand hygiene compliance oUnplanned pneumonia 7.Monitoring and evaluation The ICU executive/management team will monitor the adequacy of care being delivered against the Key Performance Indi cator suite as outlined above. These indicators will be regularly reviewed for suitability by the management team. This will be reported upwards through the organisatio n's relevant governance structure and also be reported down to treating clinical staff via direct and group messaging e.g. newsletters and unit meetings. M onitoring and evaluation will occur via the ACHS Clinical Indicator Program on which the quantitati ve and qualitative indicators are based. [12] M onitoring and evaluation will also occur through: patient surveys staff culture surveys critical incidents Riskman workers compensation claims ICU data and long- term outcome dataModel of Care Intensive Care Unit v0.7 Page 28 of 32 8.

Introducti on In September 2016, ACT Government announced the construction of a Surgical Procedures, Interventional Radiology and Emergency (SPIRE) Centre to be built at C anberra Hospital (CH) . This infrastructure project is part of the ACT Government's 10 -Year Health P lan and is in response to the increasing demand on ACT hospitals and health services across the territory. The ACT Government 2017 Budget provided funding for the first stages of the SPIRE project which includes planning and the commencement of design. A Model of Care (MoC) is a planning document that broadly defines the way health services are delivered and outlines best practice care for a person using this service. This MoC planning document has been developed for building design only and is required by the prospective design consultants to enable design development. For noting, a complete patient journey MoC is a subsequent piece of work. ACT Health engaged Healthcare Management Advisors (HMA) Pty Ltd to undertake the MoC development in collaboration with staff from Health Services Redesign and Building Health Service's Program. Development of this document occurred between February and March 2018 with internal ACT Health stakeholders who have been identified within this document. Outstanding issues tha t require resolution over the next design phases are noted at the beginning of this document. 2.Description of the Service The CH is the only tertiary cardiology care service for the region. Cardiac care is a level 6 referral centre as per the NSW Guide to the Role Delineation of Clinical Services . Cardiology Services at the CH encompasses: Acute (ACCU ) Interventional Cardiology Laboratories (ICL ) Cardiac Diagnostic and Imaging Services Ambulatory Cardiology Care The Cardiac Diagnostic and Imaging Services and Ambulatory Cardiology Care are outside of the scope of this document. The Department of Cardiology at the CH provides expert advice and specialist care for patients with acute and chronic heart conditions such as: acute coronary syndromes including acute ST elevation MI management cardiac arrhythmias (brady and tachyarrhythmias) decompensated acute and chronic heart failure post elective coronary and structural heart interventional procedures including IABP support post cardiac electrophysiology (EP) interventional procedures (includes ablation and cardiac devices) elective DC cardioversion for atrial include: cardiac monitoring: invasive and non -invasive; hard wired with or without telemetry invasive haemodynamic monitoring co-ordination and administration of appropriate drug therapies including thrombolysis Model of Care - ACCU & ICL v0.8 Page 5 of 25 counter -pulsation transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) - may be performed at the bedside in the process of cardiac rehabilitation exercise stress testing and management of patien ts with temporary pacing wires discharge planning and patient education/rehabilitation. CH does not manage complex congenital heart disease or inpatient paediatric cardiology services. This doc ument outlines the model of care for following the Cardiology Services at the CH : Acute Cardiac Care Unit (ACCU) Interventional Cardiology Laboratories (ICL) 2.1. Acute Cardiac Care Unit (ACCU) The ACCU is a specially staffed and equipped inpatient ward for the support, diagnosis, monitoring (including ECG monitoring and telemetry) and treatment of acute patients with medical or surgical cardiac conditions, which are life threatening or potentially life -threatening. The ACCU will provide inpatient and ambulatory management of cardiac conditions such as: acute coronary syndrome s including acute ST elevation myocardial infarction management cardiac arrhythmias decompensated acute and chronic heart failure post elective coronary and structural heart interventional procedures including I ntra-Aortic Balloon Pump (I ABP) support post cardiac electrophysiology (EP) interventional procedures (includes ablation and car diac embolism,pulmonary hypertension, infective endocarditis management of bar iatric patients with cardiac conditions The ACCU is a discrete unit for monitoring of patients with acute coronary syndrome , heart failure or life threatening arrhythmias. It provides a full range of invasive and non -invasive monitoring for cardiac patients, with access to the full range of cardiac investigations and 24 hour on call echocardiography, angiography, angioplasty and permanent pacemaker services. The ACCU including: -acute & ST (STEMI) bed in case of acute STEMI S ub- acute beds Chest Pain Evaluation Unit (CPEU) -is a dedicated area within the ACCU used for the evaluation of chest pain, and to initiate treatment under protocol. It will require access to exercise stress testing (treadmill exercis e t esting) 18 hours per day . Patients usually stay in the CPEU for less than four hours. Patients may require exercise stress testing and focus echocardiography in the adjacent procedur e a rea. Following evaluation patients may be transferred to an overnight bed in the ACCU, the ICL or discharged home ACCU Procedure Rooms Model of Care - ACCU & ICL v0.8 Page 6 of 25 ACCU Clinical Support area, including central analysis station for electrocardiography transmission 2.1.1. Multi day beds Provides acute inpatient cardiology beds and an ST -Elevation Myocardial Infarction (STEMI) bed. These beds are cardiac protected and require spec ialised cardiac monitoring, networked to a central monitoring station. 2.1.2. Sub- acute beds These beds provide an intermediary space between Acute Cardiology and ward beds. They are cardiac protected and have telemetry monitoring. 2.1.3. Chest Pain Evaluation Unit This unit is a dedicated area within the ACCU used for the evaluation of chest pain, and to initiate treatment under protocol. It will require access to the ACCU procedure room for exercise stress testing (treadmill exercise testing) 18 hours per day. Th ey are cardiac protected and have telemetry monitoring. 2.1.4. ACCU Procedure Room The procedure rooms provide internal access for the ACCU to dedicated non sterile procedure space i.e. cardiac ultrasound, stress testing, and advanced cardiac monitoring. 2.1.5. Clinical Support Area Location of staff station to support the staff functions within the clinical environment, including central monitoring and Central Analysis Station for 12 Lead ECG from ACT Ambulance Service, NSW Ambulance, regional and district Southern NSW hospitals via the STEMI pathway, as shown in figure 2 below. Enabling prompt advice in relation to appropriate reperfusion therapy for acute myocardial infarction . ies (ICL) Cardiology Laboratori es consisting of the Cardiac Catheterisation Laboratories (CCL), Electrophysiology Laboratory (EPLab), Procedure rooms and Hybrid Cardiac Catheterisation Laboratory are specialised diagnostic and interventional therapeutic services within cardiac services at the CH. The laboratories are support by Interventional Cardiology Day Unit. The ICL standard operat ing hours are 0800 -1800 Monday to Friday. However, t here is a 24/7 Primary Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI) service for acute ST elevation myo cardial infarction and capacity to accommodate other emergency interventions as required . The ICL is staffed by an experienced interventional cardiology team . Interventional activities are supported by the ICL Day Unit and the ACCU . The hybrid cardiac catheterisation laboratory allows for future proofing of the cardiology interventional services at CH. 2.2.1. Cardiac Catheterisation Laboratory (CCL) Cardiac catheterisation procedures are u sually done with local anaesthesia and conscious sedation. A minority of cases are under general anaesthetic for agitated patients. Some can be performed as day or short stay procedures, although some will require longer periods of observation depending on the type of procedure and patient co -morbidities. CH provides emergency, Primary Percutaneous Coronary Interventions (PCI) 24 hours a day, seven days a week and planned elective interventions during business hours. Model of Care - ACCU & ICL v0.8 Page 7 of 25 Cardiac Catheterisation procedures are categorised as either diagnostic or interventional. Diagnosti c catheterisation involves the insertion of a catheter into an artery (usually in the thigh or wrist) which is threaded through to the heart. Dye is then injected into the coronary arteries to reveal any blockages. Catheterisation can also be done for myocardial biopsy. Interventional catheterisation includes: balloon angioplasty where a catheter with a 'balloon' is passed through to a coronary blockage then inflated to allow more blood flo w s tenting where a small, metal mesh tube is placed within a coronary artery after balloon angioplasty to prevent the artery from reclosing septal closure devices used to non -surgically close defects in the atrial septum atherectomy to remove hardened and calcified blockages (plaques) thrombectomy to remove loose de bris within the coronary arteries, prior to angioplasty or stenting. Day procedure for a selection of angioplasty patients is the preferred model of care. In these instances, patients are admitted as a day -only patient and recovered for a minimum of four hours before discharge. This reduces patient bed days and subsequently improves bed access. [4] 2.2.2. Electrophysiology Laboratory (E P Lab) Electrophysiology study (EPS) are conducted within the EPLab where the heart's electrical sys tem is tested to diagnose electrical conditions triggering heart arrhythmias. During the EPS, the diagnosed condition may be ablated (if appropriate), using either high frequency electrical energy (RF ablation) or intense cold (cryoablation). Cardiac devic e implantation is also undertaken in the EP lab. EPS and ablations typically require a general anaesthetic or heavy sedation. Some EPS are done as day procedures, although patients that receive ablation may require a longer stay. Occasionally patients will require emergency interventions in the EPLab, although this will be dependent on the availability of an Electrophysiology Cardiologist. 2.2.3. ICL Procedure Room The procedure room will provide a dedicated sterile space for t ransoesophageal echo cardiogram s and sterile procedures. 2.2.4. Interventional Cardiology Day Unit The Interventional Cardiology Day Unit supports the function of the ICL through the provision of pre and post procedure beds and is staffed by trained medical, nursing and technical staff. Patients suitable for the Day Unit (23 hour) beds include: inter-hospital transfer patients, pre and post CCL procedure elective patients post angioplasty/stent (who cannot remain in recovery beds) elective patients requiring 'follow on' angioplasty DC Cardioversions pre and post -procedure post- operative elective pacemaker procedures pre and post hospital transfer pacemaker procedures 2.2.5. Hybrid Cardiac Catheterisation Laboratory (shelled) The Hybrid Cardiac Catheterisation Laboratory is a soft shelled space, which has capacity to support future development in interventional technology and practice. The exact use will be determined by future demand. Model of Care - ACCU & ICL v0.8 Page 8 of 25 2.2.6. ICL Clinical Support Location of staff station to support the staff functions within the clinical environment. 2.3. Target population The target population i ncludes ACT residents and patients requiring tertiary level services (e.g. level 5 or 6) from the surrounding NSW regions. Cardiology patients include adults of all ages, acuity, frailty and disability, and increasingly patients with comorbidities. Cardiac inpatients have special needs in that they are often fully aware of their surroundings but may be restless, distressed and agitated and may require immediate and critical emergency care. 2.4. Changes to existing service The possibility of heart failure increases with age and with the incidence of diabetes. As the general population ages, more patients will require assessment and treatment. Heart failure treatments are becoming more complex resulting in greater levels of ambulatory and inpatient care for heart failure. Consequently, reliance on cardiology specialist staff and diagnostic tests is also increasing . [2] Advances in technology in the C ardiology space may increase demand for Cardiology services over and above population growth rates and historical trend projections. For example: technological advances are improving the safety and efficiency of interventional cardiac treatments the demand for intervention electrophysiology is increasi ng with complex arrhythmias now able to be treated with three -dimensional mapping techniques advances in pharmacology resulting in more complex drug regimens for patients post -surgery / procedure has increased the need for close observation of patients in a A CCU. [3] Other trends in models of care that will impact on future service delivery include the use of CCU beds for non -infarct patients (such as unstable angina or recovery after a cardiac procedure) and the need for integrated CCUs with transitional or step -down bed availability. 3.Care/service settin g A dedicated cardia c precinct will be developed as part of SPIRE including a n ACCU and the ICL. Colocation of Cardiology services is designed and intended to provide safe and efficient care of patients. Colocation will enable central bed management capabilities, single management structure, effective use of resources (space and staff), minimising the transfer distance for patients between the CCL and post -intervention recovery beds, increased staff rotation and skill development, flexibility of bed usage during peak times. [4] 3.1. Environmental c onsiderations The aim of health care is not only to treat disease, but also to create a healing environment for patients that is safe and free of psychosocial elements created through poor design. To this end the environment and design is to support the MoC. Noise has been linked with poorer outcomes and increased levels of stress, for both patients and staff. Noise leads to communication difficulties, and may impede on an individual's privacy. Therefore Model of Care - ACCU & ICL v0.8 Page 9 of 25 strategies for combating noise levels within the ACCU should be included. This includes, but is not limited to: single rooms noise attenuation ceiling tiles ceiling battens soft floor covering where appropriate. Light has also been shown to be an important consideration for the wellbeing of patients, not only access to view and natural light, but also the ability to control artificial light levels locally. As such all lighting in treatment areas is to be manually controllable to enable dimming or brightening as clinically appropriate. Families and carers are often integral to the wellbeing of the patient in ACCU and ICL . Where clinically appropriate carers will accompany patient into treatment spaces. Spaces are to be designed with space allocation for carers and well as quiet rooms for family/friend of those patients who are receiving intensive treatment, as well as appropriate space for grieving. Regardless of specific environmental considerations, the design is to support a balance between line of sight and privacy of patients in treatment areas and waiting areas fr om staff areas, specifically staff stations. 4.Care provision continuum & workforce 4.1. Philosophy and principles of care The vision for C ardiology services is to provide improved care and outcomes for patients with, or at risk of, cardiovascular disease. This m eans person -centred care from early diagnosis to end of life care , with improved access for vulnerable groups. [5] The ACCU and CCL incorporate s concepts of a 'Healing Environment' including appropriate d\u00e9cor to create a relaxed ambiance for patients, sound proofing in consulting and testing rooms to ensure adequate privacy for patients and decentralised inpatient room design to increase privacy . Health care at the CH is delivered in a way that is: person -centred - providing care that is respectful, responsive and focused on the patient's needs safe - avoiding harm to patients from care that is intended to help them effective - providing services b ased on scientific knowledge and which produce a clear benefit timely - reducing waits and sometimes harmful delays efficient - avoiding waste and reducing cost equitable - providing care that does not vary in quality because of a person's characteristics. 4.2. Policies and business rules Cardiology services provides evidence based treatment under the Clinical Guidelines of the National Heart Foundation of Australia and Cardiac Society of Australia and New Zealand: Australian Clinical Guidelines for the Management of Acute Coronary Syndromes 2016 https://www.heartfoundation.org.au/for -professionals/clinical- information/acute -coronary - syndromes ). In addition, the close monitoring of patients in the ACCU requires a nurse to patient ratios of 1:2, plus super -numerary nursing staff , based on NSW Nurses and Midwives' Association recommendations for nursing ratios 2017. Model of Care - ACCU & ICL v0.8 Page 10 of 25 4.3. Patient pathway s 4.3.1. ACCU and ICL Admission Patients are admitted to the ACCU and ICL for diagnostic and interventional procedures from: ED inter -hospital transfers inpatient wards post- catheterisation or electrophysiology procedures (diagnostic or interventional) as required. ICU CH outpatient clinics community (ICL only) Model of Care - ACCU & ICL v0.8 Page 11 of 25 Patient Flow through the cardiology service at the CH is shown in the below diagram . Figure 1: Patient Pathway Admi ssions to the ICL can be clas sified as elective or emergency: Elective As part of an elective admission, patients may attend pre -admission in the outpatient setting. During this appointment patients may have a 'walk through' of the area to familiarise themselves with the area. On the day of the procedure e lective patient admission s will present to the Day of Surgery Admission (DoSA) for clerical admission. Patients will be directed to the ICL day unit for nursing and medical admission. After admission patients will wait in the ICL Day U nit until they are taken in to the laboratory for their intervention. Emergency Patients can be admitted directly from ACTAS/NSWAS, transferred from CPHB, Regional NSW hospitals, the ED or transferred from inpatient wards, including ICU. P ost intervention , patients will be transferred to either ACCU, ICU or PACU . Model of Care - ACCU & ICL v0.8 Page 12 of 25 Emergency procedures, including PCI wi ll follow the STEMI pathway. Figure 2: STEMI Pathway Source: Canberra Hospital and Health Services, Operational Procedure. ST Elevation Myoca rdial Infarction (STEMI) Pathway (2016) Model of Care - ACCU & ICL v0.8 Page 13 of 25 Figure 3: Cardiology Staffing Structure 4.3.2. Treatment A majority of patients having procedures in the ICL will be given a conscious sedation, this will occur in the location of the procedure. However a portion of patients will require full anaesthetics, these patients will be induced in the anaesthetic room. Approximately 10% of patients undergoing EPL ab procedures are likely to require stage one recovery , ongoing ventilatory or haemodynamic support. These patients will be transferred directly to Post Anaesthetic Care Unit (PACU) or ICU from the ICL. 4.3.3. Patient r ecovery and discharge Patients are monitored fo llowing cardiac catheterisation/EPS procedures. Options for recovery include: ICL Day Unit ACCU or cardiac inpatient unit stage one recovery in PACU ICU Overnight beds are made available for patients from geographically isolated areas who may not be able to return home immediately or following complications. Once stable, in patients will return to their own unit. Patients referred from other hospitals may be transported back to the referring institution, or to another healthcare facility with access to appropriate monitoring, or may be discharged home. Patients are discharg ed from the ACCU and ICL to: inpatient unit inpatient rehabilitation unit community rehabilitation transferred back to the referring hospital home. For the first 24 hours post -angiography, day patients should remain within an accessible distance of a service that is able to manage relatively common complications. 4.4.

This infrastructure project is part of the ACT Government's 10 -Year Health Plan and is in response to the increasing demand on ACT hospitals and health services across the territory. The ACT Government 2017 Budget provided funding for the first sta ges of the SPIRE project which includes planning and the commencement of design. A Health Planning Unit (HPU) Brief is a planning document that defines the activities and functions to be undertaken within a unit/ service. This HPU Brief has been developed as part of the SPIRE planning component and articulates the operational requirements, functionalities and relationships for which the prospective design consultant can develop a suitable design response. ACT Health engaged Capital Insight Pty Ltd to unde rtake the HPU development in collaboration with staff from Health Services Redesign and Building Health Service's Program. Development of this document occurred between April and May 2018 with internal ACT Health stakeholders who have been identified withi n this document. Outstanding issues that require resolution over the next design phases are noted at the beginning of this document. This HPU Brief defines the activities and functions to be undertaken in the Intensive Care Unit (I CU). It is not the role o f the HPU Brief to design the space, but rather to articulate the operational requirements, functionalities and relationships for which the architect can develop a suitable design response. The HPU brief has been developed in alignment with the Australasian Health Facility Guidelines. This Health Planning Unit will comprise of: Adult ICU (AICU) Paediatric ICU (PICU) . D escription of the service The Intensive Care s ervice at CH provides care for critically ill adult and paediatric patients and close monitoring for those patients most at risk of further deterioration. It is the only tertiary care intensi ve care service in the region. The ICU will be a 48 bed department providing complex multi- system life support and ongoing advanced management to a range of critically ill patients with life threatening illnesses, injuries and complications. Historically patients admitted to the ICU have been loosely defined as either \"Intensive care\" or \"High dependency\" type patients and in the past were physically moved around the footprint of the unit depending on these categories of care. In the evolution of this specialty service it is recognised that these tight definitions are no longer applicable as this describes only the nursing: patient ratios (1:1 care for intensive care and 1:2 for high dependency level patients) and is a fluid determination which can change multiple times in a day. These changing care needs are now seen as part of the critically ill patient's journey while they remain within the physical ICU, and there are no physical separations of an intensive care or high dependency care bed. The CH ICU is a tertiary referral service providing level 5 and 6 services as per the NSW Role Delineation, for the Territory and neighbouring regional centres in Southern NSW (comprising approximately 50% of admissions). The CH ICU is a level 3 ICU as per the College of Intensive Care Medicine (CICM ) of Aus tralia and New Zealand Guidelines, capable of providing complex multi -organ Health Planning Unit Brief - Intensive Care Unit v0.6 P age 5 of 30 support for adult patients for indefinite periods of time. The service will provide care to both adult and paediatric patients and will offer the following services: Intensive Care Services for adults aged 16 years and over, requiring single or multiple organ support, including enhanced services e.g. extra corporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) support, bereavement support, integrated psychological and social support Intensive Care Services for paediatrics aged 28 days to 16 years (new service) ability to quarantine one ICU pod (12 beds) to manage infectious threats (new capability) emergency response within the CH and management of the Medical Emergency Team (MET) ICU Outreach servi ce - monitoring/consultation/liaison/follow -up services/ tracheostomy service to patients on inpatient units trauma response in the Emergency Department (ED) an ICU outpatient service (follow -up of patients who have been discharged from the Hospital) using the bookable space in the Ambulatory Care Centre (ACC) a satellite base for DonateLife (the promotion of organ and tissue donation service) whilst its admin function will remain in a remote location of the Hospital campus Capital Region Retrieval Service - emergency, intensive care and anaesthetic consultants and senior registrars are employed as the medical flight crew to the service and will be involve in telemedicine support clinical research. The AICU will provide care for critically ill patients, in single or multiple organ failure, and those at risk of further deterioration (e.g. post complex surgery). Adult ICU patients will receive either 1:1 or 1:2 nursing care with input from medical and allied health care personnel in a self- contained unit . The level of nursing care will be altered over the course of a day according to patient acuity. An integrated ICU/HDU Model of Care (MoC) will be implemented in each pod to maintain staff skills across specialties and support less experienced staff in caring for patient s requiring different levels of care. All patients will be managed by intensive care specialists. Adult spinal and burns patients are resuscitated, stabilised, and retrieved to specialised ICUs in NSW. This arrangement is expected to continue. The P ICU is a new service envisaged to provide ongoing care for critically ill patients in single or multiple organ failure, and those at risk of further deterioration (e.g. post complex surgery), from 28 days of age through to 16 years. It is proposed that the majority of critically ill paediatric patients requiring critical care interventions will be managed in the PICU, however a small number of children with complex care needs will continue to be retrieved to the Sydney Children's Hospital networ k for specialised services not available in the ACT e.g. for ECMO, specialised surgical or transplant management. On occasion, the PICU will provide short -term care and management of critically ill children, aged two years and over, awaiting retrieval to a specialist Sydney Hospital. Paediatric patients will receive 1:1 nursing care with input from medical and allied health care in a dedicated PICU pod within the AICU. All patients will be managed by paediatric intensive care specialists. It is envisaged that PICU staff will also provide emergency response to deteriorating paediatric patients in the Centenary Hospital for Women and Children (C HWC ), tracheostomy review and care, trauma response and PICU follow -up. Staff and support areas will be shared with t he ICU. Paediat rics requiring High Dependency type services will be managed in the CHWC. Neonat al Intensive Care (NICU) services and super s pecialty services such as ongoing management of severe burns and transplant surgery are not provided by the ICU. Emergency response to infants in the neonatal period will continue to be provided out of the N ICU. Health Planning Unit Brief - Intensive Care Unit v0.6 P age 6 of 30 S cope of service In 2016/17, CH had 2,293 AICU and HDU admissions to the ICU. The median number of patients in the ICU at any given time was 21, with a requirement additional beds to provide surge capacity at peak times . Initial activity analysis suggests that additional admissions would occur if capacity was available . Length of stay can be a short as 12 - 24 hours post -surgery, or 18 months or more for some conditions . The followi ng table outlines the required functional planning u nits (FPU) for the ICU to 2026/27. Table 1: Functional Planning Units required for ICU Health Planning Unit Room type (FPU) Future Number (2026/27) Intensive Care Unit Class N Enclosed Bay 8 Class P Enclosed Bay 4 Class S Enclosed Bay 8 Open Patient Bay 28 Total 48 O perationally the AICU will provide capacity for 12 HDU beds, however HDU beds are not designated and the whole unit is specified to AICU requirements to optimise operational flexibility. An integration of AICU /HDU beds is planned to minimise patient movement and address staffing ratios. This following section outlines the existing usage of AICU services at the CH . Table 2 shows activity at CH for patients treated in the AICU from 2013 -14 to 2016 -17, which shows consistent growth in activity.

M odel of Care summary The mission of the CH ICU is to deliver seamless, outstanding care to critically ill patients and their families. The u nit will provide complex multi- system life support for an indefinite period to adults and paed iatrics, as well as high dependency care to adults. The ICU MoC is a multidisciplinary team (MDT) based approach to holistic patient care, including compassionate care for patients' families and friends. Highly specialised medical, nursing and allied health staff work collaboratively with referring clinicians to adopt the most appropriate evidenced based care for each patient. Clinical management includes but is not restricted to multidisciplinary ward rounds conducted at least twice daily, continuous mon itoring and treatment provision, family meetings and regular multidisciplinary and multispecialty meetings. An enhanced ICU capability is anticipated for patients requiring ECMO resulting in fewer patients requiring retrieval to Sydney. Patients for solid organ transplant and/or left ventricular assist Health Planning Unit Brief - Intensive Care Unit v0.6 Page 7 of 30 device/artificial heart implantation will continue to be retrieved to Sydney as these highly specialised services will not be provided in the ACT. Patient cohorts will be organised across four pods to reflect similar treatment needs, for example: general medicine cardiovascular including cardiothoracic surgery patients, patients with cardiac failure, and in future ECMO therapy patients surgical patients including elective surgery, trauma and neurosurgery chronic critical illness paediatric patients. One pod will be fully self- contained to enable quarantine in the event of an infectious threat. Each pod will have designated staff. The AICU/PICU pods will have a range of isolation capability and access for bariatric patients . There will be a d edicated ICU multi -purpose therapy gym /rehabilitation space for all eligible patients' to access to enable functional rehabilitation, minimis ing loss of condition and promot e recovery. The gym will have ov erhead tracking and contain parallel bars, tilt table, double plinth, treadmill, weights and a cage to attach slings. Patients will also have access to outdoor areas in which multi- organ support can be maintained, known to p romote wellbeing and recovery. In addition, t he involvement of and care for families is pivotal in the service delivery model. Comfortable amenities will be provided for families to stay overnight for extended periods of time and for visitors to gather, including amenities for children . A specific requirement is consideration of the patient and family who are undertaking a process of organ donation. The 'd onation after cardiac death ' process requires urgent transport between the area of palliation and the operating suite within minute s of the declaration of death. The ICU also provides the following outreach services : MET response providing rapid assistance for emergency management management of admissions to the ICU (e.g. admitting office fo r direct referrals from ED and retrieval se rvice) trauma response tracheostomy care (TRACS) - twice weekly rounds follow up of ICU survivors (new service to be established ) Capital Region Retrieval Service disaster and post disaster management for the A CT region. It is the intention that all patients remain in the same room/ space for the duration of their admission in ICU unless they develop additional conditions which would require a move e.g. acquisition of resistant/easily transmitted organism or chronic critical illness. Workforce The staffing profile is based on a 48 bed unit . Projected staff profiles have been developed to inform this stage of planning and will be further developed during d etailed strategic business case development and clarification around MoC's/Service delivery mo del.

Health Planning Unit Brief - Intensive Care Unit v0.6 P age 14 of 30 7.7. Information Communication Technology (ICT) ICT services technology changes rapidly and the design process must acknowledge continuous development of policy and the impact it may have on implementation. The ACT Health ICT foundations comprises of four key areas: Patient Record Systems that provide a consolidated, shareable patient -centric health record enabling information to be available to the right person at the right place and time to enable informed health care and treatment decisions. This program includes systems such as: Electronic Health Record fully integrated for ICU and IPU patients Personal Electronic Health Record (PEHR) incorporating an ACT Health smart card Clinical Portal/ Centralised Order Entry/Provider Index e-Referral system Integrated Chronic Disease Management to ols Electronic Medical Record System for patient admissions and discharges (Clinical Record Information System ( CRIS) replacement ) . Clin ical Decision Support Systems that provide healthcare professionals with better access to clinical research and evidence, and clinical decision -support tools to enable improvements in the quality, safety and efficiency of clinical practices. This includes: Electronic Medication Management (EMM) Clinical Protocol System Community Care System Renal Dialysis Application Theatre System Integration oACT Patient Administration System (ACTPAS ) oPurchasing and Inventory Control System (PICS) oT-Doc (electronic sterile supply management and tracing system) . Support Services that use technology to efficiently manage the resources which support ACT Health in the provision of patient care, for example the management of staff , food and beds. T he Digital Hospital Infrastructure designed to provide : the technological capability to ensure a complete view of patient information at the point of care high availability technologies needed to support a 24/7 care environment electronic systems needed to support the coordination of health care support for technologies required by staff in the delivery of health care services at the poin t o f care readily accessible facilities to allow patients to review and update their details, manage appointment bookings and access health care information and education materials provided in the e -health environment enhanced patient health care experience support for the future expansion of clinical ICT systems across both public hospitals.Health Planning Unit Brief - Intensive Care Unit v0.6 P age 15 of 30 MetaV ision is an electronic Clinical Information S ystem (CIS) used within the ICU at CH . It supports both clinical and administrative processes. Staff within the ICU will manage all clinical documentation electronically, including progress notes, medication man agement, assessments, and patient observations. The system facilitates improved clinical outcomes by providing an integrated and complete view of patient health information at the point of care, and enhances patient safety by reducing transcription and doc umentation errors. A centralised electronic bed management tool linke d to Pathology, ACTPAS and MetaV ision systems is required to ensure efficient coordination of patient activity/flow within the department and timely access to ICU services. Specific ICT r equirements include: patient monitoring at bed spaces, and selected other spaces (e.g. patient gym) will b e c onfigured for monitoring at a central lo cation with real time reporting mobile devices for bedside data entry will include workstations on wheels ( WOWS), laptops, notebooks, palm computers and tablets, in addition to multifunctional wireless phones andmobile phones. Staff will be able to select from this range of devices to find a solution thatfits their needs and the requirements of systems being utilised secure storage of and charging facilities for mobile clinical devices such as WOWs, handsets,batteries on wheels, in close proximity to the staff workroom Wi-Fi and blue tooth : oprovision for medically safe wireless networking throughout the clinical area oWi-Fi internet access for use by staff and visitors ocommunication between portable medical devices to enable equipment tracking and remote diagnosis of equipment f aults to Biomedical Engineering oradio frequency ID tracking to enable equipment tracking throughout the Hospital annunciator and PA system located in each pod able to communicate to all pods and office spaces printers are required at the staff station, clinical workroom and in proximity to staff offices hearing Loop is to be available at the staff station near the ward clerk, one bed bay and ensuite per pod patient beside entertainment will consist of an integrated communication system including services such as television, computer monitor, patient health education, access to PEHR, menu ordering etc headphones which meet infection control guidelines will minimise disruption to othe r p atients and families. The system should be connect ed to hospital TV/movie systems the Unit will require improved communication devices and processes for staff due to the increased size and layout of the unit. A voice activated paging system will be used by nursing staff when requiring assistance from inside patients' rooms MET, in its outreach role, will operate a monitoring service to monitor at -risk pat ients throughout the Hospital. The Patient track system uses network infrastructure using a c ombination of desktop web -based (https) clients and Wi -Fi networked mobile devices. televisions at each bed space are required for patient divers ion therapy perso nal duress alarm capability will be available in all single enclosed rooms for staff security nurse call systems are to be extended to link with reception a nd the security monitoring room medical emergency buttons will link to doctors ' and nurses ' offices. A record data system will be provided to log timesHealth Planning Unit Brief - Intensive Care Unit v0.6 Page 16 of 30 the provision of videoconferencing locations in the staff areas adjacent to the unit will support conferencing with networked national, territory and rural services and assist in training and development of the unit staff. 7.8. Teaching, education and research The service will meet the requirements for an accredited teaching facility including the College of Intensive Care Medicine. Training and education activities within Intensive Care are delivered in a multidisciplinary format and occur in a variety of setting s (bedside, tutorial style, supervision of training, simulated learning environment, half/whole day programs and external courses). Teaching and meeting spaces will be embedded within clinical care areas to facilitate clinical teaching, with easy access t o larger spaces outside the Unit for extended education activities. In-situ teaching and training facilities will include education/ meeting room s and s imulation space to allow for teaching of procedures, new equipment and crisis response management within the clinical environment. At minimum the considerations for in -situ teaching and training would include: Education/ meeting room in each pod Larger education/ meeting space in close proximity to the pods, e.g. large enough for all medical staff across the un it to meet in a shift. This will need to be on the same floor as the clinical areas to allow for immediate attendance to a patient if sudden unexpected deterioration occurred. This would need to have appropriate IT su pport for teaching and training Simulat ion space to allow for teaching of procedures, new equipment and crisis response management within the clinical environment. Specific design requirements 8.1. Overarching design requirements Design requirements include: Acoustic design to minimise noise and promote confidentiality, particularly between bed bays , meeting rooms, interview rooms and staff offices Lighting is to be locally controllable in order to provide a calming environment and diurnal variation with natural light Local air- conditioning co ntrol is required in order to control the ambient temperature to address the minimal movement and clothing of ICU patients The environment will minimise stress to patients and staff and be culturally appropriate Patient privacy and confidentiality must be maintained. To support this, patient's full nam es must be out of public view The use of natural light is to be maximised part icularly in patient care areas, however it is also necessary for suitable window coverings to be provided to accommodate rest periods throughout the day. Health Planning Unit Brief - Intensive Care Unit v0.6 Page 17 of 30 8.2. Pod design The ICU will be planned as four pods, each pod will have 12 beds. Each bed requires structural separation in order to maintain patient privacy and acoustically attenuation, whilst enabling staff providing care at the head of bed to maintain visual contact of patients either side. Exact design of this separation requirement requires further exploration during the design phase. The four pods will be configured to include : two Class N isolation rooms (in one pod, 1x Cla ss N will be configured as a super bariatric) one Class P isolation room two Class S isolation rooms seven open bays. Two bays per pod will be configured to facilitate use as a single large bay have a appropriate tap water connections in each pod for dialysis machines one ceiling mounted patient hoist in an open bay in 3 pods rated to 250 kg, one rated to super bariatric in the 4 th pod. In addition: one pod will include a separable PICU. a second pod will be able to be quarantined. three pods will incorporate one bariatric Class N and one bariatric open bed space for up to 250kg. One pod will accommodate one super bariatric Class N and one super bariatric open bed space for up to 500kg. a total of eight beds across all pods will be fitted with dialysis ports and access to the water purification RO plant will be subject to the final location of the Acute Renal Dialysis Service (note that the shorter the loop the less likelihood of contamination) . Otherwise, all pods and individual spaces will be planned to achieve a standard layout to maximise flexibility and staff familiarity. 8.2.1. Outdoors A bed accessible outdoor area for up to six patients is required for use by long term patients. This space will be able to support medical services such as medical gases , emergency call systems, suction and power connections (contained in a weatherproof and secured box to prevent tampering by visitors) . This space will be accessible directly from ICU by family and visitors . It will require a flexible roofing option for some direct sunlight while able to provide protection from the weather patterns and potential hazards caused by the rescue helicopter . 8.2.2. Quarantine pod One pod will be capable of being quarantined in the event of a major infectious threat. This pod will be fully self- sufficient with patient, staff and support functions required for a prolonged period of quarantine e.g. utilities, beverage bay, ensuites , staff toilets, staff station. There will be direct access into and out of this pod. A separate air conditioning system is required to the quarantine pod. Telephones will be located in each zone to support communication between staff. Areas within the pod w ill be 'zoned' green, yellow and red, reflecting the physical barriers, PPE and processes to be followed to contain the infectious threat. The zoning will respond to the nature of Health Planning Unit Brief - Intensive Care Unit v0.6 Page 18 of 30 the threat being quarantined and relates to quarantine requirements of the whole Unit and/or the quarantine requirements of the individual patient. The following functions will be considered as green zone: staff station and workroom staff amenities (beverage bay, change, showers, toilet) clean utility, medication room, supplies storage clean linen. The following functions will be considered as yellow zone: amenities for donning and doffing PPE The following functions will be considered as red zone: patient bed spaces and ensuites dirty utility and dirty linen clean up room dispos al room (with direct external access to avoid cross contamination). In addition to the functions listed above, the quarantine pod will have dedicated: pneumatic tube cleaners room and disposal room for waste collection. 8.3. Specific design r equirements 8.3.1. Entry/reception area The entrance will be welcoming and staffed according to ACT Health policies. The reception will be accessible to staff from the clinical zone. The waiting area will provide privacy to family and visitors. The entry will be access controlled, with the ability to remote access entry and include audio visual capabilities from front of house to clinical areas. 8.3.2. Family z one Interview and meeting rooms will be available in this zone, able to accommodate up to ten people. Interview rooms will contain a full length cupboard with a sliding door to conceal a computer, phone and resource material. A lounge and play area in the family zone will provide a breakout space outside the clinical zone. It will be designed to provide separation of family g roups , perhaps through the provision of alcoves. This area will provide access for computers, mobile device charging stations, a pantry for meal preparation. Overnight accommodation will be provided in this zone for family member of adult patients. Overn ight accommodation for paediatric patients will be within the PICU pod. Nappy changing equipment will be available in the family bathroom . A parenting room will be available within the Hospital . Health Planning Unit Brief - Intensive Care Unit v0.6 Page 19 of 30 8.3.3. Patient Areas Each patient bed space will : Have l ine of sight from staff stations is required for all patients. The nurses write up area will be located to allow visual observation of two patients simultaneously, even when providing care to one patient. The nurses' write- up area will accommodate a cent ral monitor ing system be partially partitioned in open bay bed spaces at the patient's head to minimise spread of droplet infection, promote privacy and be equipped to provide all intensive care needs for all patient s including bariatric patients be clear of trailing tubes, cables, power cords and pieces of equipment facilitate unimpeded access to the patient and the bed from both sides and the bed ends, in particular from behind the head for airway management procedures accommodate staff, family and visit ors and highly sophisticated technical equipment (such as aortic balloon pumps, portable x -ray machines, dialysis machines and infusion pumps) homely environment and maintain normalcy (contain pieces of furniture such as clocks, armchair and whiteboard ) accommodate a reclining chair for patients to facilitate early mobilisation ensuites will have medical gas panels bathroom is to include o a bath that is accessible from rear and both sides o a medical gas panel including nitrous, o ceiling mounted hoist positioned to enable transfer from bed/chair to hoist within the bathroom requires duress/emergency . 8.3.4. Staff Areas This will be located in close proximity to patient treatment areas. Staff will have an alternate access/egress route that does n ot travel through the main entrance of the Department. This area will accommodate office areas, staff amenities and facilities to support education and research and rest activities. A meeting room will be used as a command centre during infectious threat e vents and large scale critical incidents. Space will be available for in -situ simulation/didactic teaching/clinical review and audit. Health Planning Unit Brief - Intensive Care Unit v0.6 P age 20 of 30 F unctional relationships 9.1.

Health Planning Unit Brief - Intensive Care Unit v0.6 Page 22 of 30 Future service developments and innovation The establishment of the PICU as part of the ICU is a significant innovation for the Intensive Care Service which requires careful planning. By the time the project is delivered, it is anticipated that: fewer adult patients will be transferred out of CH ICU for ECMO as this capability will be routinely provided at CH additional invasive organ supports are likely to be provided as technology and skills in this area develop the range of specialist services available at CH will broaden, providing opportunities for ICU to expand the scope of service provision Design must inco rporate space for future expansion as demand for intensive care services continues to grow , as well as opportunities to adapt to changes in the model of care . Planning will incorporate future inclusion of: ADMs delivery by Automatic Guided Vehicles (AGV) paperless system s.

Introduction In September 2016, ACT Government announced the construction of a Surgical Procedures, Interventional Radiology and Emergency (SPIRE) Centre to be built at Canberra Hospital (CH) . This infrastructure project is part of the ACT Government's 10 -Year Health Plan and is in response to the increasing demand on ACT hospitals and health services ac ross the territory. The ACT Government 2017 Budget provided funding for the first stages of the SPIRE project which includes planning and the commencement of design. This Brief is a combined Model of Care (MoC) and Health Planning Unit (HPU). A MoC is a p lanning document that broadly defines the way health services are delivered and outlines best practice care for a person using this service. This MoC planning document has been developed HEALTH PLANNING UNIT BRIEF - SURGICAL IPU v0.2 Page 4 of 31 for building design only and is required by the prospective design co nsultants to enable design development. For noting, a complete patient journey MoC is a subsequent piece of work. A HPU Brief is a planning document that defines the activities and functions to be undertaken within a unit/ service. This HPU Brief has been developed as part of the planning component and articulates the operational requirements, functionalities and relationships for which the prospective design consu ltant can develop a proof of concept. 2. Description of the service The new S urgical Inpatient Unit (IPU) will provide accommodation for the care and management of adult patients with a broad range of surgical c onditions who require a minimum overnight inpatient stay. 3. Scope of s ervice Vision for the project Two new commissioned and the soft shell space for an additional two surgical wards will be delivered as part of the Surgical Procedures Interventional Radiology Emergency (SPIRE) project. Each unit will comprise 32 adult surgical beds offering a range of surgical specialities. The unit will c ater for patients 18 years and older and requiring an overnight stay in an inpatient environment. Table 1. Bedroom Type IPU Room type Number Surgical Inpatient Unit 1 Bedroom 25 1 Bedroom, Class N 1 1 Bedroom, Class P 1 1 Bedroom Special - Bariatric 2 1 Bedroom - Accessible 1 2 Bedroom 2 Total 32 Patients assessed as requiring advanced surgical management that cannot be managed in the unit (in the Close Observation Unit) will be managed in the either the High Dependency Unit (HDU) or Intensive Care Unit (ICU). Patients requiring rehabilitation wi ll be transferred to the rehabilitation unit at the University of Canberra Hospital: Specialist Centre for Rehabilitation, Recovery and Research (UCH). The new wards will support innovation and implementation of the principles of the Territory -wide deliv ery of health services. The wards will form part of the facilities associated with providing undergraduate and postgraduate education for health and related disciplines as well as playing a role in the vocational and educational training sector. HEALTH PLANNING UNIT BRIEF - SURGICAL IPU v0.2 Page 5 of 31 The war ds will emphasise best practice in the design and delivery of care to the community by including concepts of the health environment and advanced technology together with high quality healthcare. The focus of person -centred care will be embedded in the pla nning and design. The wards will be designed as a healing environment that incorporates the use of natural light, artworks and views in its design while also providing for quiet and privacy. The high quality environment will be conducive to teamwork and help Canberra Hospital attract and retain a high quality workforce Project objectives The key objectives are to: meet the health needs and expectation of the community deliver surgical services in line with the vision of the Territory -wide Framework and S pecialty Service Plans (SSP) provide expanded surgical capacity by increasing bed capacity, in the first instance, by 62 beds, and increasing the level of clinical services capability of the existing services provide contemporary healthcare facilities that are designed to support the delivery of person -centred, evidence based care in an environment that supports staff to deliver excellent, efficient and effective surgical services provide a spatial environment that is contemporary, salutogenic, flexible and adaptable provide a unit that facilitates best practice models of care Design principles A primary objective in the planning and design of these units is that surgical services should be safe, of high quality and person -centred. The overarching principle s that underpin this objective are: design of the physical form should be a balance of staff, patient and operational needs design must consider and facilitate - efficient patient, staff and services flows - privacy and dignity for all patients - avoidance of healthcare associated infections - prevention of falls and adverse events - minimised travel time for staff evidence based design based on the following - spatial planning that supports standardisation of the configuration and fitout - integration of ergonomic pri nciples - clear vision connection between patients and staff - connectivity to external environment - control over natural and artificial light by patient and staff - design features that facilitate safe and effective care for people with disabilities or obesity design that is salutogenic, that supports good health and maximises use of positive elements related to natural light, colour, images of nature, access to fresh air and music and spiritual space. 4. Model of c are summary The Surgical IPU will provide multidis ciplinary case management for acute surgical care for booked and emergency adult patients. The patients admitted to the unit will require a minimum overnight stay. The unit on most occasions will be dedicated to surgical patients but on occasion medical patients may need to be accommodated in the unit depending on demand. Male and female patients will be HEALTH PLANNING UNIT BRIEF - SURGICAL IPU v0.2 Page 6 of 31 accommodated and separated through single rooms with the except ion of those patients requiring a higher level of care in a Close Observation Unit (C OU). The COU provides a level of care between standard ward care and the Intensive C are Unit (ICU ), with close monitoring and observation. The COU provides a dedicated care area to high acuity patients who require increased nursing support , for example , patients transitioning out of the ICU, patients likely to need intensive care outreach support, patients requiring non- invasive ventilation (NIV), and on occasions post -operative patients need increased observation, inotropic support or central cardiac monitoring . Patient Centred Care A person- centred , flexible, holistic model of care that is responsive to the individual needs of each person wi ll be provided and will require: focussing care services around the patient and within their bed area extensive involvement o f patients and their family/significant other in th e planning and delivery of care admissions will generally be on day of surgery, with a small number requiring adm ission the night before surgery privacy and dignity for the patient, their carers and family providing treatments or therapies either at the patients bed or in the units treatment/therapy room holistic multidisciplinary care involving integrated healthcare teams including medical, nursing, allied health, operational and administr ative staff tailored nursing models of care to suit the needs of the patient and/or cohort of patients an integrated model of care working closely with primary care providers such as the emergency department, general practitioners and community settings. This will include follow up care of patients at high risk of readmission with a focus on prevention and early intervention to minimise risk clinical handover at the bedside, involving the patient in the care process and assisting to minimise clinical err or facilities should be available for families that include the ability for family/carers to stay a nd sleep in the same room , somewhere to sit away from the wa rd, quiet room for relatives, beverage bay , toilet and washing area discharge planning for all booked admissions will commence at pre -admission prior to the day of surgery note - the Canberra Hospital is accredited with the WHO as a B aby Friendly Hospital Initiative provider, as such breast feeding and change facilities are located within the public areas in the hospital. Model of Care Overview As treatments and methods of care frequently change, the IPU will need to be flexible and adaptable to new models of care and service delivery. Allied health services such as physiotherapy, speech patholo gy, psychology, occupational therapy, dietetics, pharmacy, aboriginal liaison and social work will be provided on an extended hour's basis. Allied health services will contribute to and provide health care for people in these units in collaboration with mu ltidisciplinary teams. Patients with burns defined for referral in the Burn Protocol will require transfer to interstate burns specialist hospitals. Patients with behavioural disturbances or at risk of self -harming will have a risk assessment and their room and physical environment adapted accordingly. HEALTH PLANNING UNIT BRIEF - SURGICAL IPU v0.2 Page 7 of 31 The IPU will be supported by Family Resource Areas to meet the needs of families and carers who may come from regional areas, carers who are reluctant to leave their friend or relative and those who cannot v isit a patient due to extended treatment being undertaken and or restrictions on the number of visitors at any one point to support their needs whilst visiting for prolonged periods of time. Surgical Inpatient Unit The IPU will be based on standar dised 32 bed layout and configured into pods. Two IPUs will be paired to share ancillary facilities such as the staff lounge and teaching facilities. The IPU will provide an environment that supports adults of all ages, acuity, frailty and disability, those livi ng with co -morbidities, and allows the delivery of safe effective care for the patient and safety for staff. The management of the IPU will be flexible to accommodate changes in demand. This may i nclude flexing beds from one pod into one another as requir ed. Patients requiring a higher level of care, but less than provided in ICU/HDU will continue to be managed within the same IPU but in a Close Observation Unit (COU) located adjacent to the Staff Station that accommodates 4 beds and 2 ensuite . Configuration of high observation rooms will include monitoring equipment with the ability to incorporate additional technology for patients who may require continuous monitoring or non- invasive ventilation. Patients with an infection will be isolated within the pods with a single standard isolation room with dedicated ensuite . A negative pressure (Class N) single bed room will be used for patients with airborne infections (e.g. Tuberculosis and Chicken Pox) . A p ositive pressure (Class P) single bed room will be used for immunocompromised patients requiring isolation. Patients with behavioural disturbances will be managed in a single bed room that is devoid of items that could be used to harm themselves or others. Centralised and sub staff station will be provided to encourage the collaboration required between staff and data entry will primarily be done at the patient's bedside using available technology .

Multid isciplinary learning and development opportunities are promoted and encouraged. Medical teaching rounds occur during ward rounds. Clinical placement for students from TAFE Colleges and Universities is provided for nursing, allied health and medical student s. 8. Design requirements The design must: incorporate safe design principles including visibility between staff and patients and vice versa, standardisation, automation (if possible), reduction in noise, immediate accessibility to information close to the point of service and the minimisation of patient movement around the facility HEALTH PLANNING UNIT BRIEF - SURGICAL IPU v0.2 Page 19 of 31 support maximum productivity and efficiency, short travel distances, and ensure flexibility to allow operational models, nursing staff structures and the MoC to change over time, including nurse to patient ratios be standardised to produce an environment which is familiar to staff enabling efficient use of time and space thereby reducing stress and fatigue facilitate efficient and effectiv e patient flow though areas have universal design of individual patient treatment areas to offer greater flexibility and adaptability for multiple purpose use. The design and distribution of spaces must support the range of health care professionals and other care givers who will work in the IPU. There is to be sufficient storage and mobile trolley bays to ensure trolleys do not clutter the corridor. Floor and wall coverings are to support acoustic attenuation. Carpet may be used in the staff station, staff workroom, interview room and offices i f an appropriate cleaning regime can be agreed. Emergency (battery powered) lighting and other power to other essential equipment must be provided in all patient care areas in case of power failure. 8.1. Specific design r equirements The design will be consisten t with the elements described in the AusHFG'S unless otherwise stated. The design of the surgical IPU is to convey a person -centred healing environment with welcoming surround. The unit will be designed for patient and staff safety, bariatric care and be 'elder friendly'. Patients who are admitted to hospital these days are often acutely unwell and in need of observation. One of the primary goals in design, therefore, is to minimise the distance between patient bedrooms and the staff station/work -base and the distances betwee n all patient rooms. The unit will be designed as four pods with central staff and support areas. The unit needs to support flexibility of nursing allocation and bed management to enable c lear visi bility if working across a two pods. This ensures areas can: be managed efficiently during periods of low activity accomm odate patients admitted under different specialities in a designated area in times of high demand. 8.1.1. Bed Rooms and patient amenities Four beds will be podded to create a Close Observation Unit (COU). The COU will be located adjacent to the Staff Station to maximise visual and auditory observation of the patients. The COU will have central vital signs monitoring with the master monitor installed at the Staff Station. T he remaining bedrooms are to be single bed rooms. Each bedroom is to have a carer zone .

This infrastructure project is part of the ACT Government's 10 -Year Health Plan and is in response to the increasing demand on ACT hospitals and health services across the territory. The ACT Government 2017 Budget provided funding for the first stages of the SPIRE project which includes planning and the commencement of design. A Hea lth Planning Unit (HPU) Brief is a planning document that defines the activities and functions to be undertaken within a unit/ service. This HPU Brief has been developed as part of the SPIRE planning component and articulates the operational requirements, functionalities and relationships for which the prospective design consultant can develop a suitable design response. This HPU brief describes the perioperative facilities to be provided in SPIRE for the management of Surgical Booking and Preadmission Cl inic facilities for elective surgery patients will be provided in the ambulatory care building and are not included in this brief. D escription of the Service The Perioperative service provided at CH include s preoperative care, intraoperative treatment , and postoperative support for the management of Day Only (DO) patients, DoSA (Day of Surgery Admission) elective surgery patients, in patients , or emergency patients in an operating room environment. 2.1. Surgery types The tertiary perioperative services provided at the CH include: cardio -thoracic dental ear, nose and throat (ENT) neurosurgery obstetrics oral-maxillary be required in the operating rooms/s uites to undertake emergency endoscopy procedures and elective endoscopy and urology procedures requiring anaesthetic support in a major theatre environment due to the risk profile of the patie nt (e.g. patients with bariatric conditions, patients with multiple comorbidities and paediatric patients ). Low complex endoscopy, bronchoscopy services will continue to be provided in a \"Gastroenterology\" Endoscopy Procedure Suite external to Perioperativ e Services . Separate HPU briefs have been prepared for: Health Planning Unit Brief - Perioperative & Interventional Centre v0.6 P age 5 of 32 S terilising Services Department (SSD) Diagnostic Imaging, excluding I nterventional Radiology Procedure rooms . Sc ope of service The Perioperative service will continue to provide a l evel 6 role delineation service and will be comprised of: Day of surgery admissions Operating Theatres (general digital robotics) Interventional suites Hybrid operating suites Post Anaesthetic Care Unit Day surgery Extended Day Surgery Discharge Lounge Support Services (including technician support areas, office accommodation). Services requiring or potentially requiring an anaesthetic intervention and post - anaesthetic/procedural support to be co -located e.g. hybrid and interventional suites. This is to eliminate duplication of specialised equipment, to utilise skilled staff effectively , and to promote improved patient care. The scope of perioperative services covered by this brief is outlined in Table 1 .

General digital robotic operating rooms The SPIRE perioperative service will include visual and digital information o perating rooms with robotic capability . These rooms provide the integration necessary to support minimally invasive and image guided surgery. Video integration can also occur outside of the theatre with the transfer of streamed video from instrumentation or cameras to an external location such as a training room or device. The general digi tal robotic theatres will include provision for robotic surgery, 3D printing, mobile robot arms and tactile feel technology systems. The operating rooms will be organised in pods of 4. Within these pods surgical specialties will be collocated . For example, the orthopaedic ORs will be grouped to utilise specialty operating theatre requirements, such as the laminar flow operating theatre used for implant surgery. Robotics Robotics used in surgery is si milar to laparoscopic surgery facilitating the use of min imally invasive techniques. Robotics offer greater precision and control than is possible with conventional techniques. Operating rooms with robotics capability require additional space to house extra equipment as well as accommodate more staff who are pr esent during a procedure. 3.1.2. Hybrid operating suites The Hybrid o perating suites will have robotic capability and fixed imaging platform s designed to support multi -disciplinary teams in delivering real -time intraoperative guidance for complex open and minimal ly invasive surgery . Examples include transcatheter aortic valve replacement, simultaneous Coronary -pass carotid stenting. Planning Unit Brief - Perioperative & Interventional Centre v0.6 P age 7 of 32 Initially it is expected that hybrid theatre activity will be focussed in the following four surgery s pecialties: Interventional Neurology odigital angiography is used for neurovascular surgery and spinal surgery oCT scan or MRI scan is applied in brain tumour surgery Neuro surgery/Orthopaedic surgery - the O -arm system is specifically used in spinal surgery Vascular Cardiothoracic. Use of hybrid theatre techniques is evolving rapidly. Other areas where hybrid surgery techniques could expand in the medium term include orthopa edics and trauma. 3.1.3. Interventional operating suites Interventional suites will have robotic capability, MRI, interactive imaging, 3D modelling, and navigational image guidance to support tightly coupled diagnosis and surgical treatment. These tools enable a surgeon to navigate and execute procedures with full knowledge of the surrounding anatomy. Examples of procedures include laparoscopic assisted pancreatic necurosectomy, endoscopic sinus surgery, spinal surgery , interstitial laser for bra in tumo urs, cryoablation metastatic colorectal cancer, and MRI -g uided prostate brachytherapy treatment with computer control. An i ntegrated and co -located interventional suite creates an environment where all interventional procedures requiring anaesthetic support can be provided from one hospital location. 3.1.4. Post Anaesthetic Care Unit (PACU) The Post Anaesthetic Care Unit (PACU), operated by specialist nursing staff, is responsible for the management of patients' immediate post-procedural period. The SPIRE perioperative service will include Stage 1 Recovery, and Stage 2 Recovery Area s. Stage 1 Recovery: oa service that accommodates unconscious patients who require constant observation a nd m onitoring owith a one -to-one patient nurse ratio oopen planned ba ys are provided that can be observed from a staff station. Stage 2 Recovery: oaccommodates patients who have regained consciousness after an anaesthetic however require further observation opatients who have undergone procedures with local or sedation anaesthetic who may require less supervision then Stage 1 Recovery. opost- operative obstetric patient needs including facilitating breast feeding as per the breast feeding -friendly hospital polic y. 3.1.5. Day Surgery Unit (DSU) The Day Surgery Unit will be a flex ible area integrated into Perioperative Services where patients can have their entire episode of care within the perioperative environment and be discharged on the day of surgery. It will provide facilities to support the post- operative care of patients un dergoing a range of surgical procedures. 3.1.6. Extended Day Surgery Unit (EDSU) The SPIRE perioperative service will include a 23 Hour Extended Day Surgery Unit. It will be a flexible area where patients can have their entire episode of care within the perioperative environment and Health Planning Unit Brief - Perioperative & Interventional Centre v0.6 P age 8 of 32 be discharged as per criteria. Bed allocation will be for patients who meet the 23 Hour Extended Day S urgery Unit criteria and do not require admission to an Inpatient Unit as they are discharged within 23 hours post op surgery/procedure. 3.1.7. Discharge Lounge The discharge lounge provides comfortable chairs for patients who are awake and waiting for a medical discharge, medication, instructions etc. The patient may eat and drink in this area. 3.1.8. Support Services Support Services are a requirement within the perioperative service. Support Services will include: Central Sterilising Services Department (CSSD) Clinical/Biomedical Engineering Pathology Medical Imaging Body Viewing Room Waste Management Cleaning Service s Hospital Assistant services Wards Persons services Sterile Stock Rooms General stock rooms Prosthetic and implant consignment management facilities Medication Stock Rooms - Automatic dispensing machines Equipment Store Rooms Technology garaging faciliti es 3D implant printing facilities Administration Staff services Anaesthetic Department Medical Physics & Radiation Engineering Clinical education resources Bone and Tissue Bank . M odel of c are summary The key principles that underpin the Model of Care (MoC) for P erioperative Services are outlined in the following SPIRE Project Perioperative Services principles and assumptions : the perioperative service will comprise of three separate functional zones i.e. general digital robotic o perating room s uite, hybrid s uite, interventional suite . othe general digital robotic o perating room s uite will comprise of operating rooms for general digital robotic surgery, anaesthetics, and shared Admissions, Holding Bay, PACU (Stage 1 and Stage 2) and Support Services. othe hybrid suite will comprise of digital robotic operating rooms, and fixed imaging platforms designed to support multi -disciplinary teams in delivering real time intraoperative image guidance, anaesthetics, and shared Admissions, Holding Bay, P ACU (Stage 1 and Stage 2) and Support Services othe Interventional Suite will comprise of integrated operating rooms designed to facilitate the use of robotic capability, MRI, interactive imaging, 3D modelling, and navigational image guidance to support tightly coupled diagnosis and surgical treatment and the interaction ofHealth Planning Unit Brief - Perioperative & Interventional Centre v0.6 P age 9 of 32 multidisciplinary clinical care teams, shared Admissions, Holding Bay, PACU (Stage 1 and 2 R ecovery) and Support Services. the SPIRE perioperative service will provide for planned Day of Surgery Admission, Day o f P rocedure Admission, unplanned emergency surgery/procedure and elective surgery/procedure. The majority of patients presenting at the SPIRE perioperative service will have been managed inpreadmission clinic s located in an Ambulat ory Care setting. All Zones (see dot point 1 above) will be responsible for the clinical management of their patients within the perioperative service. All zones will be staffed with specialty staff. the SPIRE perioperative service will provide standardis ed layout of rooms for all general digital robotic o perating rooms , interventional suites , and hybrid suites as well as Post Anaesthetic Care Unit (Stage 1 & 2 Recovery), Day Surgery Unit, Extended Day Surgery Unit and Discharge Lounge where possible. This will facilitate familiarity to staff. all perioperative services will be co -located the Post Anaesthetic Care Unit (PACU) will require flexible use of Stage 1 an d Stage 2 Recovery, as well as DSU/EDSU and a Discharge Lounge due to the high volume turnover of some ORs . ambulant and non -ambulant patients will be admitted via separate entrances to facilitate patien t f low through the unit Day Surgery, Extended Day Surgery and Discharge Lounge facilities will be shared by the operating room suite, the hybrid suite and the interventional suite . th e suites will be a security controlled environment to provide facilities for non -elective, emergency surgery, and elective planned surgery. Emergency non -elective patients will be booked via the team leader of the required procedure/surgery zone. 4.1.1. Patient flow The proposed patient flow is summarised as follows: on the day of surgery, all elective/planned admissions will present to the DoSA for clerical admission. following registration, patients unde rgo nursing and anaesthetic assessment where required, and don surgical gowns for their procedure in the DoSA preoperative area within the D oSA there will be separate streams and holding/recovery areas for paediatric/youth, obstetric, and miscarrying gynae cology patients, to optimise flow and the patient experience DoSA patients will proceed from the D oSA preoperative area to a \"ready for procedure\" holding area at the entry to the pod where the procedure will be undertaken inpatients and emergency patients will be transferred directly to the relevant holding area from the inpatient unit or Emergency Department (ED) patients are transferred to the anaesthetic bays for further assessment and anaesthetic interventions whilst the operating room is cleaned and prepared for their care patients are transferred into the operating room for their procedure patients who have had a general anaesthetic or sedation will be transferred to the designatedPACU area (paediatric/youth, obstetrics and miscarrying gynaecology patients, general) followingtheir procedure for observation and monitoring until they regain consciousness and are stabilisedpost procedure; a cohort of acutely unwell patients or those already expecting immediateadmission to ICU will bypass the PACU and go directly to Intensive Care Unit (ICU) on regaining consciousness and post -surgery clinical stability: oinpatients will be transferred to an inpatient unit including obstetrics and miscarrying gynaecology patients requiring an extended recovery (>4 hours ) opatients requiring high dependency will be transferred to the ICUHealth Planning Unit Brief - Perioperative & Interventional Centre v0.6 P age 10 of 32 oDay surgery unit (DSU) patients will be transferred to the designated DSU postoperati ve a rea (paediatric <4 gynaecology <4 hours, general) DSU postoperative area - stage 2 and stage 3 (discharge) oPaediatric patients <16 years requiring >4 hours recovery (or a stay beyond 2100 hours ) will be transferred to the Paediatric DSU or an inpatient unit oExtended Day surgery Unit (EDSU) patients will be transferred to the EDSU a nd discharge d w ithin 23 hours. patients who have undergone procedures with local anaesthetic or light sedation will: otransfer to the inpatient unit if they are an inpatient after assessment in PACU otransfer to the designated DSU postoperative area (paediatric, obstetrics and miscarrying gynaecology, general) - stage 2 and stage 3 (discharge) if they are a DO patient otransfer to the ED SU if the ir stay is expected to be more than 23hrs . emergency surg ery/procedures for neonates will continue to be undertaken in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU). 4.1.2. Work flow overall staff workflows are guided by the patient pathways through perioperative services. Perioperative services involve a wide-ranging number of specialised staff. A perioperative management structure supports efficient and effective fiscal, human resource,and materials management practices for both elective and emergency streams. This includes utilisation of an Operating Room and Anaesthetic Management System. Information management unit staff support the provision of sound data for planning and analysis. Variations to workflow and process: the impact of procedure type The category of operating room and surgical subspecialty required varies i n the intraoperati ve p hase according to a range of characteristics, including: the body part involved and procedural complexity e.g. simple day procedures (e.g. close d r eduction of a fractured bone) compared to a more complex operating room procedure (e.g. hip r eplacement) the degree of invasiveness and associated procedural techniques e.g. minimally invasi ve t echniques using endoscopy, open surgery equipment needed e.g. lasers, hybrid theatre imaging equipment, robotic surgery number of surgeons or other proceduralist involved, which can vary from one to several for a complex trauma or organ retrieval case. The procedural characteristics determine the numbers of anaesthetic, nursing and technical stafftogether with non -clinical staff in the intraoperative phase e.g. more wardspersons are required to assist with patient movement in multi trauma surgical cases. 4.1.3. Workforce Projected staff profiles will be developed to inform this stage of planning and will be subject to adjustment both in numbers and classification as better clarity is gained around MoCs/service delivery models. The staffing profile is required to develop the Schedule of Accommodation only (e.g. offices, staff stations and receptions). Staff profiles are subject to review by Workforce Policy and Planning. Future workforce requirements will be determined using relevant College standards e.g. Australian College Operating Room Nursing (ACORN) Standards for Perioperative Nursing .

In troduction The ACT Government committed to an expansion of the Canberra Hospital in the 2016 election with the development of a Surgical Procedures, Interventional Radiology, and Emergency (SPIRE) Centre. In September 2018, the Building Health Services Program Strategy Steering Committee agreed in -principle for the eastern corridor (North End) of the Canberra Hospital Campus, Garran be scoped as the future site of the SPIRE project. This planning unit brief has been developed in response to the eastern corridor site proposal and will be used to inform early site planning, feasibility and proof of concept in the first instance. 2. Purpose This Health Planning Unit (HPU) Brief defines the activities and functions undertaken at the Canberra Hospital loading dock. It has b een developed with limited consultation and only approximates current space for initial proof of concept and does not reflect what the service may need in the future. It is not the role of the HPU Brief to design the space, but rather to articulate the operational requirements, functionalities and relationships for which the architect can develop a suitable design response. 3. Description of the s ervice The loading dock's function is to provide an area for easy delivery and dispatch of goods and services, critical to the Canberra Hospital's effective functioning. The loading dock will receive goods, equipment, medical and pharmaceutical supplies, linen and food. The loading dock will dispatch waste, dirty linen, empty supply trolleys and dirty instruments/trolleys for sterilising services. The dock will be used as a holding area for bins that are full awaiting collection by various contractors, and for empty bins t hat exchange with full bins throughout the facility. Bin washing will be undertaken at the dock. The dock will be a permanent holding point for the flammable store that will store separately flammable liquid and dangerous goods. The dock will be a perman ent holding point for portable unused/used medical gas cylinders, gas packs and the management of these gases will be undertaken from the dock. A stores manager will be located in the loading dock in the site office. The store manager/staff will take receipt of goods and provide overall operational support to the services who deliver goods and collect waste and other items. 3.1. Medical Gas Portable medical gases will be managed centrally at the dock using an imprest system. The medical gases will continue to be located at the vicinity of the loading dock. The medical gas manager is to be located in HEALTH PLANNING UNIT BRIEF - RECEIV ING & DISPATCH LOADIN G DOCK_V0.1 Page 5 of 21 the site office at the loading d ock and will be responsible to dispense/collect portable medical gas cylinders and provide inventory management for the gases. The types of gases requiring storage at the loading dock include: medical a ir medical o xygen nitrogen nitrous o xide carbon dioxide gas special m ix medical dry air 3.2. Flammable Store Flammable stores are required to store bulk flammable liquids that are n eeded for general hospital use including goods inwards and outwards. Operationally, there are several types of flammable and corrosive materials used across the campus. 85% of products are used by Pathology, 15% used by resea rch, Business Support Services and some formaldehyde used in places like Perioperative Suites and Delivery Suite etc. Pathology uses 150 litres of flammable products per day. The medical gas manager is located in the Loading Dock in the site office. The medical gas manager is respons ible to dispense/collect portable medical gas cylinders and provide inventory management for the gases (new position from external contractor). 4. Scope of s ervice The dock is also used as a goods staging/holding area particularly for bulky goods and palleti sed deliveries that require uncrating/unpacking prior to onwards movement into the hospital or for crating/packing prior to outwards shipment. Inwards and outwards commercial courier shipments are also staged via the dock. The dock is also used as a perm anent holding area and for a range of bulk goods trolleys / bins that are constantly rotated throughout various services areas (e.g. 'Sulo' type waste bins, clinical waste bins, stores trolleys, linen trolleys, sterile instrument trolleys). The dock area holds waste compactors, waste bins (both clean and dirty) for general, recycling of items and clinical waste. Waste is transported by a licensed contractor in accordance with legislative requirements. The loading dock will facilitate collection of full bin s, and delivery of cleaned empty bins to the hospital. The receiving and dispatch dock needs to accommodate the following servic es with an uninterrupted flow: supply stores - deliveries and returns will be conducted by ACTHD Supply Services warehouse and com mercial couriers. The supply services delivery holding a rea is located adjacent to the dock sterilising services goods and services (i ncoming clean, outgoing soiled) waste m anagement - major movement of waste streams will be conducted by waste contractors including the use o f compactors and exchange bins clinical and s harp s waste conducted by contractor mail (incoming and outgoing) will be undertaken by ACT Record Services Mail Centre linen will be managed by Capital Linen Services (i ncoming clean, outgoing soiled) HEALTH PLANNING UNIT BRIEF - RECEIV ING & DISPATCH LOADIN G DOCK_V0.1 Page 6 of 21 pharmaceuticals will be delivered by various commercial couriers medical equipment and furniture deliveries will be d elivered by private contractors medical gases / cylinders, various sizes & quantities will be managed by private contractor (incoming full, outgoing empty) The table below describes the core activities that are undertaken at the dock during a weekly period.

The Waste Management Plan will inform the detail of distribution. The loading dock is a holding ar ea for several delivery trucks and vans that have a large amount of deliveries to occur across varying parts of the Canberra Hospital campus. The table below describes the types of services that leave their vehicle parked at the dock for more than one hour.

Model of c are summary The dock is a centralised point for the campus for all items moving in and out of the facility. All inwards and outwards goods and related services for the campus operate from a centralised model with all goods being received and dispatched across the dock area. The lo ading dock operates using clean/dirty principles and zone s. Supply stores and linen services are managed offsite (at Mitchell) with large workrooms/stores adjacent to the loading dock for local storage and dispatch. From these store areas, staff distribute items to all areas of the hospital campus. Waste streaming bays use an exchange bin model where clean, empty spare bins are stored in the nearest disposal room and exchanged for waste bins once they become full. From the disposal room, the y are taken by cleaning staff to the dock where one of the following occurs: General waste - emptied into compactors Paper waste - emptied into compactors Held awaiting contractor pick up - clinical waste, shar ps, organic, polystyrene, fluorescent tubes , dirty linen, metal waste, batteries, pallets and other recycling. Some areas through out the hospital do not have waste streaming or disposal rooms and thus storage area for exchange bins for these areas will continue to be on the loading dock. Once bins are emptied at the dock, they are cleaned in the bin wash area. HEALTH PLANNING UNIT BRIEF - RECEIV ING & DISPATCH LOADIN G DOCK_V0.1 Page 8 of 21 Currently the compactor is a double version which takes up 7 x 10m area. One compactor takes general, the other paper/cardboard. A third is required to take plastic/cans. The work flows wi thin the dock should reduce the amount of manual handling of any waste products which minimises the exposure of staff to the high risk of injury / infection. 6. Workforce 6.1. Loading dock workforce Projected staff profiles have been developed to inform this stage of planning and will be subject to adjustment both in numbers and classification as be tter clarity is gained around the proposed model of care /service delivery model . This staffing profile is required to develop the schedule of accommodation only. Staff profiles are subject to review by Workforce Policy and Planning.

Operational d escription and associated design requirements 8.1. Operational description 8.1.1. Hours of operation The hours of operation will be 07 :00-15:30hrs Monday to Friday for deliveries and pickups by non- ACT Health partners. Several departments within ACT Health provide services outside of the above normal business hours. The dock will have the capability of operating on a 24/7 basis. Processing and treatment of waste may occur outside of business hours. Swipe card access will be provided to the stakeholders as required. T here is no waste removal on Sundays hence changeover bins will be needed to accommodate waste in disposal rooms or at the loading dock. 8.1.2. Access The zoned approach to the dock will prevent unauthorised access to staff areas of the building. After hour's access is restricted, however, will be available for other services i.e. linen, sterilising services etc. After hour's entr y/exit to the hospital thr ough the loading dock via supply s ervices delivery holding area should be avoided. A separate doorway that can be visually monitored from the loading dock operator's office should be utilised for after hour's deliveries. Collapsible bollards at the entrance to the loading dock for added security and regulating traffic flow. 8.1.3. Infection control The incorporation of effective infection controls within the facility is critical to reducing the potential for the transmission of infectious diseases and the transmission of infections in general. Both service corridors and goods lifts are required to keep contact and exposure to staff , clients and visitors to a minimum to reduce the possibility of contamination. 8.1.4. Security Security arrangements will be in line with ACT Health policies and procedures.

Introduction In September 2016, ACT Government announced the construction of a Surgical Procedures, Interventional Radiology and Emergency (SPIRE) Centre to be built at Canberra Hospital (CH) . This infrastructure project is part of the ACT Government's 10 -Year Health Plan and is in response to the increasing demand on ACT hospitals and health services across the territory. The ACT Government 2017 Budget provided funding for the f irst stages of the SPIRE project which includes planning and the commencement of design. This document incorporates components of a Model of Care (MoC) and Health Planning Unit (HPU) Brief into a combined planning document that broadly defines the way the service is delivered, and the functions to be undertaken within the unit/ service. This planning document has been developed for building design only and is required by the prospective design consultants to enable design development. ACT Health engaged Healthcare Management Advisors (HMA) Pty Ltd and Capital Insig ht Pty Ltd to undertake the MoC/ HPU brief development in collaboration with staff from Health Services Redesign and Building Health Service's Program. Development of the document occurred between February and May 2018 with internal ACT Health stakeholders who have been identified within this document. Outstanding issues that require resolution over the next design phases are noted at the beginning of this document. The SPIRE Project provides an op portunity to develop a helipad for patient transfer by medical transport helicopters and is an essential element of the healthcare capabilities of the CH and the Centenary Hospital for Women and Children (CHWC ). A rooftop helipad located on the SPIRE building will enhance the efficiency of patient transfer by aero -medical ambulances using a direct transfer link between the helipad and the critical care areas in CH such as the Emergency Department (ED), Perioperative service , Inten sive Care Unit (ICU) and the Intensive care Unit (NICU) in the CHWC . 2.Description of the service A helipad is defined by the Civil Aviation Safety Authority ( CASA) as an area that is: a.intended for use wholly or partly for the arrival or departure of helicopters, on: (i) land; or (ii) a building or other raised structure on land b.meets or exceeds the helipad standards set out in Volume II of Annex 14 to the Chicago Convention. The helipad will meet the operational needs of the current and longer term fut ure fleet of medical transport helicopters operating in Performance Class 1, a future requirement for Medical transport helicopters advised by CASA in their Notice of Proposed Rule Making OS13 -04. The helipad is primarily used for the retrieving patients to CH as a regional trauma healthcare facility and tertiary Intensive Care Unit for the Southern region of NSW . The helipad also supports patient transfers from CH to other hospitals notably the major specialist facilities in Sydney , NSW . Heal th Planning Unit Brief - Heliport v0.6 P age 4 of 15 The CH helipad is used by the helicopter retrieval service located in the ACT and other New South Wales Ambulance Service ( NSWAS ) Helicopters in NSW (Orange, Wollongong and Bankstown bases) ; including the Newborn Emergency Transport Service (NETS ) helicopters operating from the NETS base at Bankstown airport , Sydney NSW . The CH helipad may on occasion be used by Ambulance Victoria for patient transfer s. The various retrieval services currently operate the Agusta Westland AW139 helicopters . The se helicopters hav e the capability to transport one to two patients and are classified in the generic grouping of medium twin types due to their maximum mass and twin engine configuration. 3.Scope of service The existing helipad serving CH currently supports approximately 700 patient transfers a year. The assessment of demand for Helicopter Medical Transport flights through CH indicates that the helipad is to be capable of supporting the independent loading or unloading of two helicopters The CH rooftop helipad will be used exclusively for air ambulance flights associated with healthcare service provision in the Capital Region and adjoining areas, including the Sydney Basin. As such, the facility will meet the physical and operational needs of the current and future fleet of Medical transport helicopters operating in these areas. The helipad will be available used 24 hours a day, seven days a week . The frequency of use is variable and whilst current usage patterns indicate a daily average of two or three flights, more than five flights in a 24 hour period have been recorded. The duration of time that a helicopter occupies the helipad is also a variable but a 30 minute period between approach and departure is not uncommon. 4.Model of c are summary The CH helipad will be capabl e of two Final Approach and Take Off (FATO) areas for independent but non-simultaneous arrivals and departures . This will enable the transport of two patients at a time without the requirement for helicopter movement and parking, giving increased flexibility and operational safety for each helicopter using the facility. A detailed analysis of the helipad configuration and operational protocols will be undertaken during the detailed design phase for the project. 5.Workforce Dedicated workforce is not required for the clinical operation of the helipad , staffing will be supplied by the appropriate retrieval service. Canberra retrieval service medical staff are provided by the Capital Region Retrieval Service (CRRS), located at the CH . Each mission by the retrieval helicopter service requires four crew members on board the helicopter (pilot , air crew , intensive care paramedic and a critical care doctor ). A similar configuration applies to the flights conducted by the Ambulance Services of NSW (ASNSW) and NE TS. CH medical staff rostered to work on the retrieval helicopter, when not on shift for the aircraft, work in their designated specialty area at CH . The doctors provide 24/7 medical coverage and are key to providing an aeromedical coordinated system approach to the care of critically ill and injured Heal th Planning Unit Brief - Heliport v0.6 P age 5 of 15 patients throughout the ACT and Southern NSW. Paramedics assigned to the service are em ployed by the ACT Ambulance Service (ACTAS) CH Security and ward staff personnel will be involved whenever the helipad is active. Protocols and procedures for the activities by hospital staff will be developed during the project development phases in consultation with relevant user groups. Support by additional CH clinical personnel may be required on occasions in support of the clinical personnel on the helicopter. Procedures including communication protocols for the involvement of additional personnel will be developed during the project development phases in consultation with relevant user groups. 6.Policies impacting on the built environment The design and construction of the helipad must comply with the current technical standards , codes and recommended practices defined by CASA and the Building Code of Australia (BCA) for a helipad operating as a h ospital based Helicopter Landing Site (H LS). A HLS is defined as a helicopter landing area within easy trolley access (<100m) to and from the hospitals critical care areas. Additional guidance material for hospital helipad s has been prepared by the ASNSW . 7.Operational d escription and associated desig n requ irements 7.1. Access 7.1.1. Hours of operation and access The helipad will operate 24/7 on an as needs basis, therefore is to be designed for day and night use. Incoming retrieval flight s contact the Navigator Nurse in the CH ED and advise the patient requirements on arrival. A Code H alert is then sent to all the required services in preparation for the arrival of the patient. Access to the hospital rooftop and helipad lobby will be restricted and controlled by building access and security protocols. Normal operating procedures for the arrival and departure of helicopters will include provisions whereby no personnel will be permitted to be outside the helipad lobby or o n the hospital rooftop in proximity to the helipad. Public access to the hospital rooftop and helipad level will not be available. 7.2. Core services All required clinical support services will be provided in accordance with the Code H specifications. Heal th Planning Unit Brief - Heliport v0.6 Page 6 of 15 7.3. Non- clinical support 7.3.1. Environmental and supply services Cleaning Cleaning services will ensure that facilities are clean and hygienic as per Infection Prevention Guidelines and contemporary best practice. Access will be required to a c leaners' room . Equipm ent Four adult retrieval transfer trolleys will be required on-site to support patient transfer to and from the helipad . Two trolleys will be stored in bays within the helipad at all times . Following use , transfer trolleys will be decontaminated by staff within a clean -up area adjacent the ED ambulance bays and stored with other patient transport equipment managed by s taff. Equipment tracking technology , such as RFID, will be employed to ensure the location of the trolleys is known at all times. The NE TS transfer cot will be stored with in NICU. Waste Waste management and removal will occur as per the facility wide policy for managing waste. The helipad will require bins for general and clinical waste . 7.4. Amenities for staff Retrieval team members will have access to hospital amenities including the staff cafeteria and toilet facilities . Decontamination facilities will be provided in the ED . 7.5. Security requirements Security arrangements for access to the helipad area will be in line with ACT Health policies and procedures including appropriate access control and adequate restriction to the helipad operational areas. Lifts to the helipad will be access control led. Access from the helipad lobby to the flight deck will also be access controlled. Security and access must be able to be maintained during power failure. A fixed duress will be located in the helipad lobby. Security personnel will respond to critical incidents within the helipad automatically on activation of duress alarms and as required on request from clinical staff Closed Circuit Television ( CCTV ) will be in the helipad lobby and on the flight deck. 7.6. Infection control Standard precautions will be implemented for patients know n or suspected to be infectious or who are immunosuppressed. Alcohol based hand rub, a clinical hand wash basin and Personal Protection Equipment (PPE) will be located in the helipad lobby. General and c linical waste bins will be provided in the lobby . Heal th Planning Unit Brief - Heliport v0.6 Page 7 of 15 Furniture Fittings and Fixtures (FFE) should allow for ease of cleaning and discourage accumulation of dust. Finishes are to be washable and approved by Infection, Prevention and Control . 7.7. Information Communication Technology (I CT) Specific ICT requirements for the helipad include: Radio and mobile phone communication between the helicopter and hospital A fixed telephone Access to full two way radio Wi-Fi Automated weather station Automated lighting activation system CCTV 7.8. Safety The planning, design and construction of the helipad is to comply with all relevant safety standard s and codes including fire safety. The serviceability of the rooftop helipad and associated obstacle environment will be monitored daily by the Helipad Safety Officer. A n annual technical inspection that includes a detailed survey of the obstacle environment needs to be undertaken and provided to the helicopter operators so that flight planning with reference to the operational criteria for Performance Class 1 can be comp leted for each flight. 8. Specific design requirements 8.1. Overarching design r equirements The analysis of operational parameters for the CH rooftop helipad will include the identification of flightpath track options and an assessment of expected usability relative to a range of crosswind limits using site specific wind data. The assessment of h elipad usability relative to crosswind values is necessary to consider the potential capability of the facility to meet the operational criteria for the design helicopter operating in Performance Class 1. As outlined in S ection 6, t he design and construc tion of the helipad must comply with the current technical standards, codes and recommended practices defined by CASA , the BCA , and other relevant guidelines for a h ospital based HLS. The helipad must have the capacity to accommodate the current and future fleet of Medical transport helicopters operating in Performance Class 1. Capacity for military class helicopters is not required. 8.2. Specific design r equirements 8.2.1. Helipad performance criteria The helipad must meet the following aeronautical performance criteria: Heal th Planning Unit Brief - Heliport v0.6 P age 8 of 15 capable of use by two medical transport design helicopters for the loading and unloading of patients and equipment capable of meeting the physical and operational needs of medical tran sport helicopters operating in Performance Class 1 include provision for helicopters with a larger D -value and maximum mass than the current fleet (7,000 kg). 8.2.2. Helipad design considerations The design of the rooftop helipad will require careful consideration of factors that may affect the safety or efficiency of helicopter flights and current and future hospital operations. Considerations will include: interference from /with electromagnetic fields of medical equipment such as MRI and sensitive medical equipment such as monitoring devices and plant acoustic insulation vibration disturbance impact of downdraft to adjacent public and patient areas proximity to hospital flammable liquid storage areas proximity to mechanical plant including air intake points and exhaust stacks and plumes that may be subjected to the effects of rotor wash the impact of approach and departure paths on future development of the hospital campus . The structural implications for supporting structures, noise levels and fire safely will be considered in detail during the design development phase. The boundaries of the operational airspace for the rooftop helipad need to be identified in the early stages of the project and effective measures identified and implemented to protect the airspace against possible future obstacle intrusion. 8.2.3. Lobby area The helipad lobby area must meet the following requirements : have restricted access controlled by the hospital security pass system have an airlock to provide shelter from helicopter rotor w ash winds have patient bays for holding up to two patients ; each bay will require a medical service panel (MSP) with two oxygen and one suction outlet have access to storage for two transport trolleys and storage for protective /safety clothing for up to four hospital support staff have access to handwashing facilities have manually operated (push button control) doors for access to the interior of th e fac ility which are located beside the helipad (rather than set back) and allow visual contact between pilots, crew and staff on the facility have lighting enabling full use of the helipad , including individual patient assessment, in all n atural light conditions have the capacity to dispose of gener al and clinical waste ensure ease of patient transfer from the helicopter to the lifts to the critical care areas (minimal change in gradient) the lifts will be configured to give members of the retrieval staff and associated hospit al s upport staff priori ty access over other hospital usersHeal th Planning Unit Brief - Heliport v0.6 P age 9 of 15 the lifts will accommodate at least one patient on a stretcher, a minimum of four staff and life support equipmen t, with capability to transport bariatric patients . Additional requirements include : Non -slip flooring Door protection to prevent trolley damage to the doors and frames Drainage and weather protection to prevent back flow of water into the lobby . 8.2.4. Visual aids The helipad will be equipped with visual aids including surface markings and aeronautical lighting. The aeronautical lighting will include an illuminated wind direction indicator mounted on the rooftop of the helipad lobby and services block. A supplementary wind spe ed indicator or an automated weather station will be provided to assist the helipad safety officer provide verbal advice of wind conditions to the helicopter pilot. 9.Functional relationships 9.1. Internal functional relationships The flight deck will have direct access to a lobby for patient holding prior to transfer either to: the helicopter, or the critical care areas in CH or CHWC. The functional relationships are outlined in Figure 1 Figure 1: Functional relationships Heal th Planning Unit Brief - Heliport v0.6 P age 10 of 15 9.2. External functional relationships The helipad will be located within the 24 hour acute clinical services zone of the CH . A direct link between the helipad and the critical care areas of the CH and the CHWC will be provided by two priority access controlled lifts. Direct travel links are required between the helipad and the CH and CHWC critical care areas to minimise travel time. Key external functional relationships are prioritised in the following table as per the criteria in Table 1. Table 1: Functional relationships Service/Unit Priority Comments ICU Direct Movement of patients and staff CCU Direct Movement of patients and staff NICU Direct Movement of patients and staff Interventional Suites Direct Movement of staff and patients to Theatres and Catheter laboratory Emergency Department Direct Movement of patients and staff including those requiring decontamination Medical Imaging Direct Movement of patients to CT & MRI Security Easy Movement of staff. e.g. black alert, staff from all points urgently attend General (Hotel) Services Easy Movement of staff, waste & transport trolley Mortuary Easy Movement of patients and staff Table 2: External functional relationship criteria Immediate (<1 minute) Being the shortest direct, horizontal route. The route must be an unimpeded r oute. Door to door travel time between the two areas or services identified as having an \"Immediate\" functional relationship must not exceed one minute.

Heal th Planning Unit Brief - Heliport v0.6 P age 11 of 15 10. Future service developments and innovation In the longer term beyond the operational life of the current fleet , variants of existing models and new types can be expected to operate at the CHHS rooftop helipad . It is anticipated that the air ambulance function will continue to be provided using helicopters in the medium twin engine grouping. The trend within this group of helicopters demonstrated by recent developments is that the engine power available and associated performance capabilities with one engine inoperative increases significantly with only slight increases in maximum mass and overall D -size. Notwithst anding the expected life span of the newly introduced AW139 types, the design helicopter for CH rooftop helipad needs to include provision for helicopters with a larger D -value and maximum mass than the current fleet. Any development in the near vicinity of the airspace connecting with the rooftop helipad will need to consider the operational impact of the helipad in relation to flight paths. Future developments need to be warned that some noise will be inevitable from the operations of this service. Heal th Planning Unit Brief - Heliport v0.6 Page 12 of 15 11.

Introduction In September 2016, ACT Government announced the construction of a Surgical Procedures, Interventional Radiology and Emergency (SPIRE) Centre to be built at Canberra Hospital (CH) . This infrastructure project is part of the ACT Government's 10 -Year Health Plan and is in response to the increasing demand on ACT hospitals and health services across the territory. The ACT Government 2017 Budget provided funding for the first stages of the SPIRE project which includes planning and the commencement of design. A Health Planning Unit (HPU) Brief is a planning document that defines the activities and functions to be undertaken within a unit/ service. This HPU Brief has been developed as part of the SPIRE planning component and articulates the operationa l requirements, functionalities and relationships for which the prospective design consultant can develop a suitable design response. ACT Health engaged Capital Insight Pty Ltd to undertake the HPU development in collaboration with staff from Health Services Redesign and Building Health Service's Program. Development of this document occurred between April and May 2018 with internal ACT Health stakeholders who have been identified within this document. Outstanding issues that require resolution over the next design phases are noted at the beginning of this document. 2. Description of the service The Department of Cardiology at the CH is the tertiary diagnostic and therapeutic centre for acute and chronic cardiac diseases. Cardiology is a specialist service d esigned to care for and facilitate consultation for inpatients and outpatients with suspected or proven cardiovascular diseases, and to provide advice on the management of cardiovascular diseases. CH provides level 6 role delineation Cardiology services to adult patients. It is the tertiary level referral service for the ACT and surrounding Southern NSW and provides lower complexity cardiac services to the residents of southern Canberra. Cardiology s ervices at the CH encompasses Acute Cardiac ( ACCU ) Interventional Cardiology Laboratories (ICL ) Cardiac Diagnostic and Imaging Services Ambulatory Cardiology Care The Cardiac Diagnostic and Imaging Services and Ambulatory Cardiology Care are outside of the scope of this document. This document outlines the functional requirements for the following the Cardiology Services at CH : ACCU Interventional Cardiac Laboratories . 2.1. Acute Cardiac Care Unit (ACCU) The ACCU is a discrete unit including step- down and telemetry beds for monitoring of patients with acute coronary syndrome, heart failure or life threatening arrhythmias. It provides a full range of invasive and non -invasive monitoring for cardiac patients , with access to the full range of cardiac investigations and 24 hour on call echocardiography, angiography, angioplasty and permanent pacemaker services. Facilities include: Multi day beds including acute beds and an ST -Elevation Myocardial Infarction (S TEMI) bed Health Planning Unit Brief - ACCU & ICL v0.7 Page 5 of 30 Sub-acute beds Chest Pain Evaluation Unit (CPEU) ACCU Procedure rooms Clinical Support area, including c entral analysis station for electrocardiography transmission 2.1.1. Multi day beds Provides acute inpatient and an ST -Elevation Myoca rdial Infarction (STEMI) bed. These beds are cardiac protected and require specialised cardiac monitoring, networked to a central monitoring station. 2.1.2. Sub-acute beds These beds provide an intermediary space between Acute Cardiology and ward beds. They a re cardiac protected and have telemetry monitoring. 2.1.3. Chest Pain Evaluation Unit This unit is a dedicated area within the ACCU used for the evaluation of chest pain, and to initiate treatment under protocol. It will require access to the ACCU procedure room for exercise stress testing (treadmill exercise testing) 18 hours per day . They are cardiac protected and have telemetry monitoring. 2.1.4. ACCU Procedure Room The procedure rooms provide internal access for the ACCU to dedicated non sterile procedure space i.e. cardiac ultrasound, stress testing, and advanced cardiac monitoring. 2.1.5. ACCU Clinical Support Area Location of staff station to support the staff functions within the clinical environment, including central monitoring and Central Analysis Station. 2.2. Interventional Cardiology Laboratories (ICL) The Interventional Cardiology Laboratories consisting of the C ardiac catheterisation Laboratories , Electrophysiology Laboratory, Procedure rooms and D ay unit are specialised diagnostic and interventional therapeutic services within cardiac services at the CH. The ICL is staffed by experienced interventional cardiology teams. Interventional activi ties are supported by the ACCU. 2.2.1. Cardiac Cathete risation Laboratories (CCL) The CCL will undertake both emergency and elective diagn ostic and interventional cardiac catheterisation procedures in dedicated cardiac cath eterisation laboratories. The CCL require dedicated control rooms to support the functionality. 2.2.2. Electrophysiology Lab (EP Lab) The EPLab activity ablation, myocardial biopsy and implantable c ardiac device. Some EPS are done as day procedures, although patients that receive ablation may require admission. The EP lab requi res a dedicated control room and computer equipment room to support the functionality and ensure compliance with design requirements . There will be a shared anaesthetic room between the EP lab and the hybrid laboratory. 2.2.3. ICL Procedure Room The procedure room will provide a dedicated clinical sterile space for transoesophageal echo cardiogram s and sterile procedures. Health Planning Unit Brief - ACCU & ICL v0.7 Page 6 of 30 2.2.4. Interventional Cardiology Day Unit The ICL day unit will support the ICL through the provision of a waiting, admission, holding, and recovery area, staffed by specifically trained nursing staff. 2.2.5. Hybrid Cardiac Catheterisation Laboratory (shelled) The Hybrid Cardiac Catheterisation Laboratory is a soft shelled space, which has capacity to support future development in interventional technolo gy and practice. The exact use will be determined by future demand. The Hybrid Cardiac Catheterisation Laboratory requires a dedicated control room and computer room. There will be a shared anaesthetic room between the EP lab and the hybrid laboratory . 2.2.6. ICL Clinical Support Location of staff station to support the staff functions within the clinical environment. Health Planning Unit Brief - ACCU & ICL v0.7 Pa ge 7 of 30 3.Scope of service The key components of the ACCU and ICL are summarised in the following table. Table 1: Functional Planning Units for Acute Cardiac Care Unit and Interventional Cardiology Laboratories HPU Room type (FPU) Current 2018/19 Projection 2026/27 Acute Cardiac Care Unit (3 pods of 8 beds) Acute beds & ST -Elevation myocardial Infarction bed 11 16 Sub- Acute beds 4 4 Chest Pain Evaluation Unit 4 4 ACCU Procedure Rooms 1 3 ACCU Clinical Support, including central analysis station 1 1 Interventional Cardiology Laboratories (ICL) Cardiac Catheterisation Labs 2 2 Electrophysiology Lab Incl. in above 1 ICL Procedure Room 0 1 Interventional Cardiology Day Unit 6 14* Hybrid Cardiac Catheterisation Laboratory (Shelled) 0 1 ICL Clinical Support area 1 1 *The determination of Cardiology Day Unit beds is based on the AIMS Projection formula, and supported by ACT Health ACTPAS report and Hardes modelling . AusHFG recommend 6 recovery beds per interventional laboratory. However this does not account for patients going directly from the interventional laboratory to inpatients wards. 4.Model of c are summary The vision for C ardiology services is to provide improved care and outcomes for patients with, or at risk of, cardiovascular disease. This means person -centred care from early diagnosis to end of life care, with improved access for vulnerable groups and a seamless patient journey. [5] The Model of Care (MoC) incorporate s concepts of a 'Healing Environment' including appropriate d\u00e9co r to create a relaxed ambiance for patients, acoustic attenuation in consulting and testing rooms to ensure adequate privacy for patients and single room s to increase privacy. Health care at CH is delivered in a way that is: person -centred - providing care that is respectful, responsive and focused on the patient's needs safe - avoiding harm to patients from care that is intended to help them effective - providing services based on scientific knowledge and which produce a clear benefit timely - reducing waits and sometimes harmful delays efficient - avoiding waste and reducing cost equitable - providing care that does not vary in quality because of a person's characteristics.Health Planning Unit Brief - ACCU & ICL v0.7 Page 8 of 30 The MoC for cardi ology services is an integrate d service including acute cardiolo gy inpatient beds, inpatient and ambulatory procedural services, and ambulatory chest pain evaluation. Patients attending for planned procedures will be directly admitted directly to the IC L, where they will be immediately directed to the Day Unit in the IC L. The Day Unit will be an extended day stay unit (07:30 - 22:00 hours Monday to Friday). Patients requiring inpatient management will be transferred to the ACCU or other appropriate IPU following their procedure . Day-only cases will be managed in the ICL Day Unit prior to discharge. Health Planning Unit Brief - ACCU & ICL v0.7 Pa ge 9 of 30 5.Workforce The workforce for the A CCU and ICL will be a multidisciplinary team consisting of Cardiology specialists, registrars and residents, cardiac nurs es, allied health includin g Cardiac sonographers, cardiac scientist's s , administration and operational personnel. Projected staff profiles have been developed to inform this stage of planning and will be subject to adjustment both in numbers and classification as better clarity is gained around MoC /service delivery models. Below is a s taffing profile table outlining workforce for ACCU and ICL which is required to develop the schedule of accommodation only (e.g. offices, staff stations and receptions).

Introduction In September 2016, ACT Government announced the construction of a Surgical Procedures, Interventional Radiology and Emergency (SPIRE) Centre to be built at Canberra Hospital (CH). This infrastructure project is part of the ACT Government's 10 -Year Health P lan and is in response to the increasing demand on ACT hospitals and health services across the territory. The ACT Government 2017 Budget provided funding for the first stages of the SPIRE project which includes planning and the commencement of design. A Health Planning Unit (HPU) Brief is a planning document that defines the activities and functions to be undertaken within a unit/ service. This HPU Brief has been developed as part of the SPIRE planning component and articulates the operational requirement s, functionalities and relationships for which the prospective design consultant can develop a suitable design response. ACT Health engaged Capital Insight Pty Ltd to undertake the HPU development in collaboration with staff from Health Services Redesign and Building Health Service's Program. Development of this document occurred between April and May 2018 with internal ACT Health stakeholders who have been identified within this document. Outstanding issues that require resolution over the next design phases are noted at the beginning of this document. This Health Planning Unit (HPU) Brief defines the activities and functions to be undertaken in the ED and co -located short stay inpatient units. It is not the role of the HPU Brief to design the space , but rather to articulate the operational requirements, functionalities and relationships for which the architect can develop a suitable design response . 2. Description of the service The Canberra Hospital Emergency Department (ED) is a Level 4 Emergency Departmen t as defined by Australasian College for Emergency Medicine (ACEM), characterised as a large, multifunctional tertiary or major referral hospital with capabilities for managing a wide range of complex conditions, and have a significant level of sub -special ty services. The ACEM Emergency Department Guidelines are intended to support clinicians in the design process and inform Government, health planners, architects and designers in the planning phase. The CH Emergency Department has department designation according to the Role Delineation guidelines as a level 6 Tertiary Service and Trauma C entre, with a Territory -wide and regional role. The level 6 role delineation provides a framework that describes the minimum support services, workforce and other requir ements for clinical services to be delivered safely. It delineates the level of clinical services, not hospitals or health facilities as a whole and inform s strategic service, clinical and capital planning. It provides timely, accessible and appropriate h ealth services to people with acute illness or injury. The ED will receive, triage, stabilise and provide acute health care to patients. This includes patients requiring resuscitation and those with emergent, urgent, semi -urgent and less -urgent conditions . The department includes a number of co -located short stay inpatient units as identified above, for patients that require additional time for assessment and treatment, but do not require an acute ED bed. The ED also requires the capacity to deal with mass casualty and disaster situations . 3. Scope of s ervice ED has a mixed cohort of elderly, adult and p aediatric patients who present with a wide range of conditions of varying urgency and complexity . The unit provide s care for adults and children in desig nated areas. There are particular patient types seen in the Emergency Department that may HEALTH PLANNING UNIT BRIEF - EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT v0.11 Pa ge 5 of 40 have specific psychosoc ial and treatment needs requiring consideration of treatment spaces to support these needs. Presentation occurs via ambulant entry , ambulanc e or police , helicopter and correctional services. The patient presentations types include: major trauma; medical and surgical - including neonatal, paediatric, adult and elderly; acute, complex elderly patients ; patients with physical and intellectual disabilities; forensic presentations including victims of child abuse, domestic violence, or sexual assault; psychosocial including mental health ; infectious diseases and immunocompromised; custodial patients, patients affected by chemical, biological or radiological contaminants . A child requiring a multi organ Paediatric ICU admission and individuals with a major burn, head injury or spinal injury may bypass the CH and be transported to an appropriate facility for definitive care. However, these patients can present and require initial management prior to transfer. A major function of the ED is to support education, training and research within the ED, to enable and support the delivery of a high quality service to both adults and children. Ongoing training of this team is a major focus of the ED into the future. Facilities for training and education will be provided within the Department to facilitate easy access by staff. These facilities will also be used to provide venues for internal meetings and fami ly conferences. In 2018, it is estimated that ED will manage 89,000 presentations, with strong growth projected into the future (noting that from 2008 to 2018 CH yearly average growth in ED presentations was 5.7%). While the caseload may be predictable, c hanging levels of demand must be anticipated. The following table outlines the scope of ED treatment spaces required to 2026/27 within the SPIRE project. Further demand modelling is required to identify final t reatment spaces and types required across the territory .

HEALTH PLANNING UNIT BRIEF - EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT v0.11 Page 6 of 40 Key features of the M odel of Care (MoC) include: co-location of tria ge nurse and registration clerk to streamline communication upon arrival and once triaged, patients will be escorted to the appropriate stream. Each stream will incorporate a waiting room. This will facilitate rapid movement of patients away from the front of house waiting areas, to an appropriate clinical area enabling assessment, treatment and observation by clinical staff hospital avoidance strategies territory -wide and these strategies integrated with the northern and southern Canberra ED network waitin g areas within streams may be utilised for patients awaiting results and waiting for access to a treatment space within the stream multidisciplinary teams, including allied health professionals will be accessible and provide a service within all clinical treatment areas movement of patients between streams in response to clinical need early involvement of a discharge liaison nurse with key populations increased use of care plans/pathways e.g. elderly or chronic illness volunteers engaged in providing suppor t to service provision medical, nursing and allied health students within teams providing opportunities to learn within a supportive structure focused assessment by teams allowing for early referral to an inpatient team, commencement on a pathway or admiss ion/ transfer to a defined clinical area external to the ED. Pathways allow for a more efficient way of managing common presentations right skill mix in the right place at the right time balance between maintaining privacy and facilitating line of sight timely access to turnaround diagnostics flexibility in design to enable changes of function and facilitate potential changes in model of care. Patient flow The ED must accommodate rapid flows between functional areas and be designed t o avoid congestion. In addition to dedicated patient bay/bed areas provision is required to cater for patient surges for extraordinary events through temporary utilisation of appropriate spaces (both indoors and outside). The c lerical desk and triage are the initial singl e point of contact for all patients attending the ED. Once the patient is triaged they will be streamed to an appropriate stream /sub -wait. The streaming process is flexible , facilitating optimal patient care, providing the ability to move patients from one stream to another should there be a change in the patient's condition. HEALTH PLANNING UNIT BRIEF - EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT v0.11 Page 7 of 40 Following initial assessment and review, patients may be transferred internally to other areas of the ED. From the ED, patients may be admitted to short stay units to continue their c are. Alternatively patients may be transferred to other services within the hospital (e.g. theatres, ICU, Inpatient Unit) , another hospital or discharged home . 5. Workforce Projected staff profiles have been documented within the Emergency Department Model of Care V0.7 October 2018. 6.

Entry The following access points will be the first interaction point for most unplanned patient presentations. Access points need to take into account provision for aged, bariatric, patients with a disability, carers and v isitors. A drop- off zone is also required. Additionally, after -hours access to the main hospital through ED is required in such a way that visitors do not walk through clinical areas of the ED and is visible to security office. Public and ambulance entrances will be access controlled after hours. Ambulant Entry A standalone, dedicated ambulant entry will be provided to the ED for ambulant patients, separate from the Ho spital's Main Entry for patients/carers who have not been involved in a contamination incident. The ambulance entry to the unit will be directly adjacent to the main ambulant ED entry to enable a single triage area. Ambulance Entry within the Ambulance Area There is a dedicated ambulance entry from the ambulance bay into the department. Retrieval Entry There is an entry way which facilitates easy access to ED by retrieval services. Decontamination EntryAn alternate entry point will be provided for those involved in a contamination incident that leads directly to the ED decontamination shower. Staff entry There is proximity card access from the staff zone to the ED. 7.1.2. Waiting areas Patients in general will not wait in a \"front of house\" waiting room. They will be rapidly assessed at the triage/clerical area, and be directed onwards to the relevant clinical stream. Within the stream they will be immediately placed in an assessment space if available. If not, they will be placed in the \"sub -waiting\" area which is an integral part of each stream. Treatment may be initiated in the sub -waits where clinically appropriate, and patients may return to the sub -wait area to finalise their treatment or for observation if app ropriate. Requirements: a minimal front of house waiting area, which is family friendly . waiting areas are to accommodate different patient groups including bariatric, elderly and those with accessibility requirements paediatric separation from adults including play area to cater for families and children of patients in the main ED area the sub -waiting rooms will be attached to, or within, each stream w ith the exception of the resuscitation stream each sub -waiting area is to be designed to be an integra l part of the stream each sub -wait is to be easily observable, enabling easy visual and physical interaction within the stream as a whole all sub -waiting areas are to have a beverage bay facilitate the provision of privacy for family groups generally space to accommodate educational- type material and an area for health and community related displays and demonstrationsHEALTH PLANNING UNIT BRIEF - EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT v0.11 Page 10 of 40 vending machines containing healthy and nutritional f ood and beverages , and an internet kiosk soft seating , appropriate for people with limited mobility e.g. with appropriate arm rests and height seating in waiting areas should be designed so that seats do not face the triage desk, thereby preventing the 'fish bowl' effect and enhancing patient privacy televisions in the waiting room with free to air and information loop adult a cute sub-wait area is to be capable of accommodating patients in a bed. 7.1.3. Security Control Monitoring Room A security control monitoring room is to be located in the ED to enable observation of the entrance, triage and wai ting areas. The office will monitor and facilitate after -hours access to the rest of the hospital. Triage / Registration 7.2.1. Triage Adults and paediatrics are received and triaged at a single location. Clerical r eception and nurse triage are collocated and are the focus of the initial presentation and associated clerical/administrative functions. Patients who are deemed stable may be interviewed across the desk. T hose patients with more complex conditions requiring a physical examination or discrete questio ning will be invited into the triage bay and assessed by a nurse. After triaging the patient will then be directed to the appropriate stream /sub wait area. The intent is to move away fro m one centralised waiting area. Located in the ED are treatment stream s that are comprise of a combined paediatric and adult resuscitation area, ED Mental Health pod, Fast Track pod, acute adult pod and paediatric stream. In addition there will be short stay and assessment areas including separate EMU s for adult and pa ediatric, C linical Forensic Medical Service (CFMS), Women's Assessment Centre (WAC) and MHSSU. Patients will be seen according to a combination of the urgency of their condition and their time of arrival. Requirements: the triage nurse and clerical desks a re to be shared to provide a single point of contact for the patient the triage nurse will have a clear line of sight to the main entry, ambulance triage and front of house waiting area there needs to be immediate access to the front of house waiting area for triage staff, to manage acutely unwell patients (i.e. patient collapse) there will be provision for segregation f rom violent/disruptive behaviour triage will allow visitors to communicate private information without compromising their privacy associated assessment area/s for triage will be sufficient in size to provide appropriate assessment of an acutely unwell patient. These spaces will allow triage to survey the waiting room and entrances yet still provide privacy to the patient. Assessment and treatment 7.3.1. Resuscitation The most seriously ill or injured patients will be treated in the resuscitation stream. Both paediatric and adult services will be provided. During resuscitation up to 15 people, along with significant amounts of equipment, may attend the patient at the same time. The resuscitation area will: HEALTH PLANNING UNIT BRIEF - EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT v0.11 Page 11 of 40 be open plan to enable clinical s taff to move easily and quickly between bays, whilst still affording patients privacy have the ability to be used for trauma patients or pati ents that require resuscitation be supported by a physiological monitoring system with associated central monitoring have direct and straight access from the ambulance entry to the resuscitation area have direct access to satellite imaging have overhead X -ray gantry in all resuscitation beds two of the resuscitation bays will be preferentially used for major trauma , these will need to be larger to accommodate the complex, large team and additional equipment and procedures have C -arm X -ray in the large resu s room and one other bay have ceiling mounted bariatric lifting equipment in the large resuscitations bay large resus room to have negative pressure capability staff station located centrally, with ready access to support areas including sterile store, cle an utility, pneumatic tube A viewing room for family members of deceased patients is required to be located within this area, co-located with the patient family lounge. This room needs to be located in a q uiet, discreet and private area, and will have dual access to enable a bed to be wheeled in from corridor and have an adjoining ensuite . 7.3.2. Fast Track Rapid assessment, investigation, and treatment of lower acuity patients will occur in Fast Track. Generally patients will be discharged home from this area, bu t if further management is required, they will usually be transferred to EMU or an inpatient unit. Medical staff, physiotherapists (including extended scope practitioners) , and other nursing staff will staff this stream . A single room/ procedure/isolatio n room with ensuite (not a dedicated room)is required in Fast Track for the management of correctional/custodial patients. This room is to be designed to provide a safe space to manage patients at risk of clinical deterioration, harm to others, or escape from custody. The room will be large enough to enable the prisoner to be accompanied by two correctional officers. It will b e located to enable ease of supervision and provide a direct line of sight from a staff station, minimise disturbance to other patients, protect the privacy and dignity of the patient and consider paths of access to and from the room. A consult room is req uired to be fit out for use by ENT / Ophthalmology and r equires a wall or ceiling mounted electronic visual acuity screen, computer and slit lamp, to accommodate Snellen chart Two procedure rooms are required for dressings, stitches, minor procedures and o ne room will require a plaster trap . Allied health assessment requires one plinth in the physiotherapy treatment room to accommodate a 400kg patient. Visibility from a central staff station to all rooms and the sub -wait area is required. 7.3.3. Adult Acute Stream Adult patients with severe or potentially severe conditions will be treated in acute assess ment beds . Patients will be dressed in a gown, connected to central monitoring and have investigations/interventions initiated. Patients who are mid treatment and s table, or considered suitable for relocation pending results may be moved to chairs within the adult acute sub -waiting room . Generally patients will be moved to either other areas of the hospital, including short stay units, or home. Requirements: solid wa ll between bays (1/2 length with remainder curtain) each space to have a ceiling mounted examination light treatment spaces to be arranged in pod configuration with two pods to have ability to shared amenities, given the number o f adult acute assessment spaces HEALTH PLANNING UNIT BRIEF - EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT v0.11 Page 12 of 40 physical separation between the adult acute and a dult EMU ceiling mounted bariatri c hoists to 250kg located in 2 adult a cute bays one of the two procedure rooms will require a plaster trap interview rooms required for non -clinical and indirect care in cluding allied health, police, distressed families Visibility from a central staff station to all rooms and the sub -wait area is required. Ward services interchange Wards person and Hospital assistance will be designated to the ED and will require an interchange/setting area for use between tasks. This interchange area will help to ensure Ward Services staff will be accommodated in a location which does not provide an OH&S risk to clinical areas and assists with maintaining work flow. Communication Cen tre Will be located within the ED Switchboard operations/workstations for up to four staff . A centralised single phone number for ED - direct dial for outside callers including general public . A central single Multi -Function Device. Wireless VOIP charging stations and two way radio stations . The ability to utilise the room for senior ED staff to co -ordinate urgent and emergent ED issues . 7.3.4.

ED Mental Health pod The ED -Mental Health pod should be located at the front of ED to allow ready access to the behavioural assessment rooms. The pod has a sub -wait area, and staff station and other clinical facilities as for the other ED streams. Entrance is access controlled, however people can move freely within the area. The pod is permanently staffed by ED nursing staff, medical staff, mental health clinicians and psychiatry medical staff. Behavioural Assessment Rooms HEALTH PLANNING UNIT BRIEF - EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT v0.11 Page 13 of 40 The Behavioural Assessment Rooms (BAR) provide a safe space within the ED to observe, assess and manage patients exhibiting behavioural disturbance, also pro viding time for the effects of drug or alcohol intoxication to wear off. An assessment will be made to determine the diagnosis, management pathway, or referral to an appropriate service for ongoing treatment. These space s within the ED are to be located a t the entrance and modelled on 'behavioural assessment rooms' (BARs). 7.3.6. Clinical Forensic Medical Suites (CFMS) The ED will accommodate examination suites for the Clinical Forensic Medical Service (CFM S). Staff from CFMS and C hild at Risk Health Unit (C ARHU ) will use the facility to assess and collect evidence in cases including: adult sexual assault childhood sexual abuse childhood physical abuse victims of general assault including domestic violence traffic medicine and collection under the Road Transport Act for the purpose of police bloods occupational exposure assessments on Australian Federal Police (AFP) Officers follow up assessments for all of the above. Patients appropriate to this service, who present to the ED, will be triaged. Patients requiring medical treatment will be streamed to the appropriate area depending on the severity of their injuries. When clinically stable, the patient will then be assessed within the CFMS area. A CFMS staff member will see the patient in the dedicated CFMS consultation room for forensic evidence collection. The only people with access to the consultation room will be the patient, staff members and support persons (including agencies Canberra Rape Crisis Centre, Domestic Violence Crisis Service, NSW counselling supp ort, AFP investigating officers). Preventing contamination of forensic specimens is paramount. The clinical suite is subject to a DNA decontamination process and register prior to and after each consultation to forensic and infection control standard. Poli ce will conduct interviews in the adjoining lounge room. Family and friends will also provide support within this space. The CFMS requirements include: a design that will facilitate a one way flow two consult rooms are required the unit will be accessed initially through a family/ waiting room this will lead into an interview room with access to ICT - computer and telephone this will then flow to the consult rooms which will have an ensuite the ensuite is to be accessible from th e consult room only family room to be accessible by swipe, to be an enclosed space where the door can be closed the family room is to have a beverage bay the family room is to have a less clinical feel, but still must be able to be decontaminated to forens ic standards. The requirements of the treatment/ consult room include: to be electronically access controlled with programming enabling access to CFMS staff only bank of lockable storage cupboards along the full width of the room which is to contain an examination trolley h1400 x w1000 xd600. Cupboard to have a bench within, and storage above the bench a locked, enclosed cupboard to have space allowance for a full height, single glass door, lockable forensic fridge (current size h2200 x d700 x w700) with a llowance for adequate ventilation one small wall is to be painted 18% Grey - wall is to be full height and at least 2m wide, to enable standardised forensic photography HEALTH PLANNING UNIT BRIEF - EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT v0.11 Page 14 of 40 consult desk to be positioned so that patient sits adjacent to desk all surfaces to withstand cleaning with bleach the examination beds are to be accessible from both side s and by a staff member sitting on a stool at the base of the couch. The couch is larger than a standard bed approx. 600x1700 a ceiling mounted examination light wall mounted speculum light source adjacent to the couch the ensuite is to have a curtain track around the entry door to enable a staff member to stand inside the ensuite, whilst maintaining patient privacy the shower is not to have a shower curtain (risk of forensi c contamination), and must have a accessible bench the specialised requirements of this department will require further investigation and articulation at the Room Data Sheet phase. 7.3.7. Women's Assessment Centre (WAC) The WAC is a discrete outpatient unit loca ted adjacent to the ED for the provision of care for women experiencing issues or difficulties in the early stages of pregnancy up to 20 weeks gestation, as well as women experiencing gynaecological issues. The unit will be staffed by appropriately trained obstetrics/gynaecology staff and will be under the governance of the division of Women Youth and Children. The unit will be staffed from 0800 to 2200 hours by registered midwives' with Women's Youth and Children medical staff rostered as required. As dema nd increases the staffing model and operational hours may change. At this stage of planning it is anticipated that the unit will be closed from 2200 to 0800 and all presentations will be assessed in the ED. When presenting problems obviously present as gy naecological/obstetric issues in line with agreed guidelines, patients once triaged will be discharged from the ED and transferred to the WAC. Alternatively if symptoms are ambiguous patients will be accessed by ED staff. Once transferred to the WAC, patie nts will be removed from the Emergency Department Information System (EDIS) and be transferred to the CH ACT Patient Administration System (ACTPAS). Adult women with undifferentiated abdominal pain will be seen in the ED rather than the WAC. Access to the WAC will be via both appointment, and as triaged through the ED. Women attending WAC via booked appointment will be required to be admitted in ACTPAS in order to capture their occasion of service. Women attending this service will usually require a pelvic examination as well as pelvic/vaginal ultrasound. For many women and their partners attending this service, this may be a time of particular loss and stress especially if there has been a foetal lo ss, the environment of the WAC is therefore to support privacy. The WAC specific design requirements are: one treatment rooms with gynaecological examination coach that can be accessed from both sides and the end of the couch examination light positioned to facilitate pelvic examinations fixed duress in all rooms adjoining ensuite play area within the sub wait dedicated space for confidential phone follow up and organising of appointments an environment that promotes auditory and visual privacy provide a n on-institutional environment homelike interiors promoting a calm and stress free environment provision of space for a wall mounted trophon disinfecting cabinet, space for soaking probes prior to disinfection, PPE rack.

The MHSSU will be operational 24 hours a day, 365 days a year and provides opportunity for extended clinical observation, crisis stabilisation, mental health assessment and interve ntion for admitted people for up to a 48 hour period. The unit design is intended to support brief therapeutic intervention including the establishment of pharmacological treatments, recovery focussed interventions and psycho -education. The MHSSU has the capacity to provide both voluntary and involuntary mental health care and is an approved facility under the Mental Health Act 2015. The MHSSU has the capacity to provide both voluntary and involuntary mental health care and is an approved facility under the Mental Health Act 2015 . Patients will be discharged home, or admitted to the acute mental health unit from this stream . A homely and therapeutic environment is required, balanced against the need for a safe environment for the patient cohort. D esign requirements include: integrated personal duress system which indicates at a central location within the staff station the loca tion of the duress call fixed duress in any area where people and staff mix to be located to allow for the easy internal transfer of patients from triage, ED Mental Health Pod and acute assessment bays location removed from p aediatrics to limit a ny perceived threat to children fittings and fixtures will be anti -ligature and in line with the latest AHFG anti -ligature recommendations and CHHS Clinical Procedure Ligature Risk Management for MHJHADS Inpatient Mental Health Units all treatment and therapy s paces will be access controlled all spaces where clients and staff mix will have dual egress clear lines of sight wi th no concealed unsecured areas HEALTH PLANNING UNIT BRIEF - EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT v0.11 Pa ge 16 of 40 furnishings to minimise the potential for fixtures and fittings being used as weapons, barriers or ligature points ensure that shared communal areas are residential in type but should avoid obvious potent ial risks of personal self -harm maximise natural light within the facility, particularly to communal areas that are used mostfrequently in the daytime the ceiling is to be designed/secured to ensure that clients cannot access the ceiling space. glass within the unit is to be \"JailGuard\" or equivalent fire detection and suppression systems are to be tamper resistant and anti -ligature in line with systems in all MHJHADS Inpatient Mental Health Units a designated vulnerable persons area, including a bedroom and separate lounge area toaccommodate their specific needs. C linical Support Areas 7.5.1. Decontamination Room/Disaster Store/Area Single person decontamination facilities will be designed within the ED, multiple person decontamination equipment will be located external to ED to enable decontamination prior to the entry to ED. Primary stock required to attend a decontamination incident will be located within ED, whilst the major stock will be stored externally. Whilst the location of the external store is yet to be determined, consideration for a location within SPIRE should be considered. A Primary Disaster store will store PPE for staff for immediate response to disaster presentations to the ED, including for respiratory infectious threat response, mass casualty presentations, and CBR presentations. This store is not for hospital -wide or scene response. The storage room should contain multiple power outlets, space for staff to change into PPE, and storage units A large storage area for hospital- wide disaster response, mass casualty decontamination equipment, PPE, will also be required. This should be located outside of the ED. The Emergency Management Steering Committee will be responsible for the disaster response, and will be located in the temporary command centre adjacent to ED. Will have a separate entrance to the single decontamination shower ambulance approach a nd o ffload areas must not allow access to public vehicle thoroughfare or parking. A single shower decontamination area will be provided within the ED, accessed from outdoors,then progress into ED. The Hospital Disaster Control Centre will not be located in the ED. A primary concern will be the protection of the ED from infiltration of contaminated patients. The multiple person decontamination process is under review following consultation with ACT Fire and Rescue who is the lead combat agency for this type of event. Depending on the type of incident and level of exposure the most appropriate treatment of decontamination will be determined by the lead agency in consultation with staff at ED. A central command centre will be located adjacent to the ED. The governance of the command centre is b y ACT Health Demand Management U nit. 7.5.2. Satellite Diagnostic Imaging Modalities proposed for inclusion in the ED are summarised in the following table. These modalities are in addition to mobile ultrasound and fixed x-ray gantri es in the resuscitation bays.

The future state is that the two fixed ultrasound will be located in the ED, as will the two general X -ray and one CT. 7.5.3. Diagnostic I maging Dedicated Diagnostic I maging services with allocated imaging staff will be required in the ED 24/7. Medical imaging modalities play a significant role in the treatment of patients within the ED. Modalities to be located within the ED includ dedicated x -ray facilities are to be located adjacent to the resuscitation stream to enable direct patient flow into those modalities. Where clinically appropriate , patients will be escorted to the req uired modality by a Wards person. If the patient is critically unwell/unable to be moved, the mobile x -ray/ultrasound will be taken to the patient bedside. There will be multiple portable ultrasound machines in use throughout the ED, these are to be store d in dedicated equipment bays. As with existing practice, these will largely be used by ED specialists, ED registrars, and for some applications by ED nursing staff. Within the resuscitation stream gantry style x -ray will be available along with C -arm capability. All medical imaging suites are to have dual egress from the imaging control room. A networked Radiology Information System and Picture Archiving and Communic ation System will manage data collection, retrieval and reporting throughout the facility. Mobile imaging equipment will be stored in a bay - mobile equipment. Resuscitation bays require gantry style X -ray in: - six adult resuscitation bays - two of those bays (trauma bays) will require a C -arm type gantry - one paediatric resuscitation bay X-ray room control bays will have dual egress from control room the CT scanner must be immediately adjacent to the resuscitation a rea. 7.5.4. Storage Requirements General and dedicated storage is required within the Department and within each stream. With expected increases in the number of older people in the ACT, the ED will need adequate space to store: wheelchairs/trolleys/crutches com mode chairs appropriate mattresses e.g. pressure relieving recliner chairs. HEALTH PLANNING UNIT BRIEF - EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT v0.11 Pa ge 18 of 40 A menities 7.6.1. Staff amenities Decentralised staff stations within each stream will provide write up for core staff whilst providing visibility to all patient beds. Staff need access to computers at each bedside, staff stations, in consultation, treatment and procedure rooms. Clinicians (nurse, physio, doctor, etc.) should have a tablet device to enter relevant patient information, order tests, review results, send outpatient referrals, provide discharge emails (to patient and GP). This should include entering information in a real time medical record, that all involved in the patients care can see. These handheld devices should also be the communication method between staff within and outside the ED. Staff toilets will be distributed throughout the ED. An emergency shower will be located within the ED. Staff lockers, staff room and staff offices will be located on the boundary of the Unit. Staff stations are located in each stream and r equire line of sight to all clinical areas ' staff areas are to be co -located to enable easy access and to be access controlled .

Introduction The ACT Government committed to an expansion of the Canberra Hospital in the 2016 election with the development of a Surgical Procedures, Interventional Radiology, and Emergency (SPIRE) Centre. In September 2018, the Building Health Services Program Strategy Steering Committee agreed in - principle for the eastern corridor (North End) of the Canberra Hospital Campus, Garran be scoped as the future site of the SPIRE project. This Health Planning Unit (HPU) Brief for Sterilising Services (SS) has been develop ed in response to the eastern corridor site proposal and will be used to inform early site planning, feasibility and proof of concept in the first instance. This HPU defines the activities and functions to be undertaken by the SS. It is not the role of the HPU Brief to design the space, but rather to articulate the operational requirements, functionalities and relationships for which the architect can develop a suitable design response. 2. Description of the s ervice The role of the SS is to provide a compr ehensive specialised sterilising service of Reusable Medical Devices (RMD) to Australian Stan dards for Canberra Health Services , Calvary Public Hospital Bruce (CPHB) and some private specialty clinics within the ACT and surrounding NSW region. SS pr ovides service for: reprocessing of cleaning and , trays, utensils , containers and other reprocessable items. Most of these items will have been used in surgical or medical procedures carried out in operating the atres or other clinical areas preparing , assembling, inspecting and pack aging instrument trays and packs including device functionality and safety checks sterilising completed trays and packs and providing disinfected items ac ceptable for patient use storing raw materials/components before they are assembled into instrument trays/packs storing goods processed in the department until they are ready for transfer to point of use collecting used items and distributing sterile products management of RMD purchases, repairs and maintenance purchasing and maintenance of sterilising equipment cleaning and reprocessing endoscopes and heat -liable accessories . T he decontamination life cycle represents each stage of the decontamination process. Cleaning Disinfection Inspection Packaging Sterilisati onTransportStorageUseTransportHEALTH PLANNING UNIT BRIEF -STERILISING SERVICES V0.1 Page 5 of 27 For effecti ve decontamination, minimum acceptable s tandards have to be reached at each stage of the decontamination cycle. Relative location of the unit Where viable, centralised sterilising units minimise duplication and facilitate effective auditing whi le delivering a one way flow of items between soile d an d clean areas. The Sterilising Unit should be located in an area that allows direct horizontal or vertical access to the Perioperative Suite and ease of access to departments in the hospital and the load ing dock. If vertically located to the Perioperative Suites then the Washers/Disinfectors n eed to be in one location directly beneath with the use of dedicated lifts. There should a lift for clean instruments and a lift for soiled instruments as per AS/ NZ 4187 - 2014. The main sterile storage should be accommodated in the P erioperative Suite to allow set- ups to be undertaken at all hours by Perioperative sterile stock room staff. This also allows Perioperative staff direct access to the sterile equipm ent and instrumentation when needed in an emergency situation. This store room will be stocked by Sterilising Services staff. 3. Scope of s ervice SS's are currently provide d from a number of facilities. Table 1: Location of Sterilising Services within ACT Health Directorate. Location Mitchell Mitchell Sterilising Service (SS) Calvary Public Hospital Bruce Unit (PRSU) Building 12 Central Reprocessing Unit (CRU) Building 2 The proposal to relocate the current sterilising service from Mitchell to the CH campus offers the opportunity to consolidate all prerinse , sterilising and central reprocessing services from a number of satellite locations, into a single centralised unit. A concentration of reprocessing activities will offer the potential to deliver major improvements in the efficiency and efficacy of the delivery of the current sterilising service. The C entral Reprocessing Unit in Building 2 performs high level disinfection reprocessing to flexible endoscopes and probes for the following CHHS departments including: Gastroenterology and Hepatology Uni t Cardiac Catheter Laboratory Intensive Care Unit Birthing Ambulatory Care Radiation Oncology Ward Areas. Sterilising methods used in CRU include steam sterilisation (with Reverse Osmosis (RO) capability) and low temperature sterilisation (hydrogen peroxid e). As well as providing pre -rinse capability the Pre Rinse Sterilising Unit located in Building 12 cleans, disinfects and sterilises approximately 60% of Reusable Medical Devices (RMD) used in the existing operating theatres. HEALTH PLANNING UNIT BRIEF -STERILISING SERVICES V0.1 P age 6 of 27 3.1. Customers The new SS unit will continue to provide both internal and external services to cus tomers of CHS . These will include but are not limited to: Internal to the CHS : Perioperative Services (CH ) Ambulatory and w ard areas within Canberra Hospital and Community Health Centres Calvary Public Hospital Bruce (loan RMD only) .

Model of service d elivery summary 4.1. Service objectives There are special requirements needed to produce sterile products. Und erstanding of the basic service objectives and principles allows the process flow of the department to be understood: decontaminate to a level compatible with the intended use of the product minimise adventurous contamination through control of the environment, personnel and materials produce items that are fit for their intended purpose within the specified timeframe. Decontaminate products in such a way as to safeguard patients and staff : within the constraints of the service, provide products in a timely manner ensure the location and facilities provide a high quality and cost- effective service provide adequate labellin g and instructions for safe use ensure the process is validate d, controlled and monitored hold appropriate documentation/records to demonstrate compliance. 4.2. Service requirements The service can be described under the following three headings, which provide an overview of the requirements of the sterile services function. environment - segregation of process, control through environment, personnel and materials equipment - fit for purpose, validated and maintained to current guidance and standards management - documentation to demonstrate compliance, validated training and qualification for those involved in decontamination, individual training records 4.3. Operational p rinciples The location of a potential new build should consider vehicular access an d effective delivery to and collection from the sterilising unit. Other considerati ons include distance from main users, turnaround time an d instrument inventory . While sing le use product s and devices are replacing the use of RMD in many clinic al servi ces, the complexity of patient care and associated equipment is increasing the need for sterilising services. This has concentrated the activi ties of s terilising services to support: surgical services procedural services specialist clinical services and as required oral health. As off campus facilities/services are also supported, systems of transport need to be available with timely delivery and access to pick up/deliver RMD. The SS unit must ensure a clear, effective separation of clean and dirty activities. It will provide an environment that minimises the risk of cross contamination of cleaned, disinfected and sterile RMD. The work flow must be unidirectional from dirty to clean to sterile. New generation major medical equipme nt and related infrastructure has resulted in major improvements to the efficien cy and efficacy of sterilising services such as: central chemical dosing systems for washer disinfectors HEALTH PLANNING UNIT BRIEF -STERILISING SERVICES V0.1 P age 8 of 27 automated systems to fee d to and from steam sterilisers and batch washe rs - the new unit will be fully automated where possible to minimise manual handling and optimise productivity. locally installed R everse Osmosis (RO) water supply to improve the quality of steam to units and chemically im proved disinfecting solutions to improve life of RMD. computerised instrument tracking systems to capture the entire production cycle fro m d econtamination, to sterilisation and to patient episode. All equipment and RMD will interface with the inventory management and tracking system t o capture recordable events in th e p roduction cycle as well as provide life cycle management of equipment and instruments. Gross debris and sharps will continue to be removed and disposed of at the conclusion of the surgical procedure in operating theatre /Interventional Suite in accordance with infection control policy. All used RMD will be collected from the operating theatres in closed puncture proof containers prior to transport to the SS unit . Transfer of the sterile RMD containers to the respective Peri-operative /Interventional Suites require s a trolley system whether open or closed. Once equipment is sterilised it will be returned to the service/department and stored at point of use. 4.4. Surgica l loan s ets The use of surgical loan sets requires careful coordination between surgical sup pliers, transport companies, SS unit staff and peri -operative suite loans coordinator/s. The surgical loan sets arrive 24 hours prior to the planned surgical procedure . The loan sets require manual checking against the supplier's inventory for contents. The loan sets then need to be disinfected/ decontaminated, packed and sterilised ready for use . Used Loan sets are disinfected, decontaminated and reprocessed prior to return to surgical suppliers. 5. Workforce The SS unit will be managed and staffed by the ACT Health Sterilising Services . Further data development will be required to inform the future workforce profile.

Environmental Services high standards of cleanliness are essential for all areas within the SS unit. Therefore a number of cleaning rooms may be requir ed so that the cleaning equipment can be segregated to the specific areas of use to minimise the risk of contamina tion from dirty a rea to clean. items returned to the unit for decontamination and sterilisation should have any sharps and biological waste removed at the source SS will be supported by the ACT Health Waste Management Plan and the Business Support Departure Document . This will include, but is not limited to: waste streaming and recycling - all waste containers should be foot operated. secure document disposal disposal room availability for holding SS's waste prior to collection. all waste will be removed through an ex it maintaining clean and dirty flows within the SS to the main loading dock. 7.3. Amenities for staff SS staff will require change room facilities with access to toilet, shower and lockers an internal restricted circulation pathway for staff to and fr om the change rooms is required make use of natural light where appropriate for areas occupied by staff. The SS unit is a large department that is required to provide essential training to staff who are generally unable to leave the unit. Hot desks may be located within the SS tea room and be a vailable for staff use for on line education. SS has multidisciplinary meetings with many clinical departments within the hospital and external customers where a meeting/training room is required.HEALTH PLANNING UNIT BRIEF -STERILISING SERVICES V0.1 P age 11 of 27 7.4. Safety and security requirements 7.4.1. Safety The design and equipment selection will seek to eliminate or reduce many hazards. Examples include: height adjustable work benches, packing tables and sinks for instrument cleaning and packing carrier and trolley systems that integrate with major medical equipment such as batch washers and steam sterilizers to reduce manual handling the use of automated systems for loading and unpacking major medical equipment the use of l ifters to manage loan equipment (as per WHS loan management policy) instrument boxes and packs will not exceed 7 kgs the feasibility of using automatic guided vehicles (AGVs) is to be assessed . 7.4.2. Security The unit will be secured, and only authorised staff will have access duress alarm will be required in the entry/r eception area CCTV monitoring will be required at all entry and egress points. 7.4.3. Emergency power and uninterrupted power supply An emergency back -up system for the power supply is required for high priority equipment, lighting and systems such as lifters and plant e .g. automated chemical management sy stem a nd R everse Osmosis water. data logging and computer equipment will be on uninterrupted power supply (UPS). power to the height adjustable packaging tables will be ceiling suspended. 7.5. Infection control Elimination of any risk of cross contamination or compromise to the integrity of sterile stock must be achieved through design wherever possible. Requirements include: restricted/controlled access to CSSD dirty to clean to sterile unidirectional workflow with the use of pass through equipment/hatch appropriate air handling systems and heat/moisture management as per AS/NZS 4187:2014 dedicated storage areas that prevent cross -contamination of consumables access to hand washing facilities availability of personal protection equipment in all areas of CSSD the use of suitable materials and finishes that are easily cleaned appropri ate facilities for cleaning and management /storage of waste provision of change facilities. hand wash basins and alcohol based hand rub (ABHR) at the entry and exit to all areas within the SS unit . As is current practice , all RMD will be reprocessed to eliminate the risk of transmission of prion diseases such as Creutzfeldt- Jakob and bovine spongiform encephalopathy . 7.6. Information Communication Technology (ICT) a PC and monitor will be required at each packing bench for use by staff packing complex instrument sets the ICT system must support use of an electronic instrument tracking system such as T -Doc in the SS unit and the p eri-operative suites a printer/scanner will be required for logging lo an sets as they come in from outsideHEALTH PLANNING UNIT BRIEF -STERILISING SERVICES V0.1 P age 12 of 27 all equipment will interface with the inventory management and tracking system to capture recordable events in the production cycle as well as provide life cycle manag ement of equipment and instruments. 7.7. Teaching, ed ucation and research the service will provide continuing education opportunities for all staff education and training facilities will be provided within the unit including e -learning hot desks and a meeting/tutorial room. 8. Design requirements 8.1. Overarching design requirements 8.1.1. Work flow Two classifications of goods will be received at the SS unit, contaminated items and raw materials. The functional design of the department must support a continuous flow from designated dirty to clean to sterile areas for all reprocessed items. These areas must be physically separated to avoid creating routes and cross flows that can potenti ally re -contaminate processed items or adversely affect the microbiological status of raw materials. 8.1.2. Lighting Natural lighting in the soiled /cleaning/decontamination room makes visual inspection easier and has a positive effect on staff morale . Roof lights are not recommended in the processing and storage areas. If unavoidable there should be insect -proof and waterproof , be double glazed and have drainage channels to prevent contaminating goods below. The quality of light is crucial for all aspects of decontamination and should be appropriate for the activity carried out in each operational area. Careful consideration should be given to the colour balance between artificial lighting and daylight. Task lighting, including magnification inspection lighting, is required where instruments and other items are inspected and should preferably be adjustable to suit the operative and the task being undertaken. Light fittings and controls in processing and storage areas should be carefully selected to avoid ledges or crevices where dust can collect. Light levels shall not be less than 400 lux at the working surface. In storage areas lighting should be good enough to enable labels on stored items to be read easily. 8.1.3. Noise Careful consideration should be given to the choice of finishes especially in the cleaning/disinfecting and packing rooms to achieve sound absorption while meeting cleaning and microbiological requirements . The offices and staff room should be sited away from the noisy areas. 8.1.4. Door sets Doors should be adequately sized to allow clear passage of equipment. Automatic/semi -automatic door closers make it easier for collection and distribution of trolleys to pas s unimpeded and prolong the fabric of the building. Where trolley movement occurs, protection is essential on all doors and door linings. Vision panels should als o be provided in doors that are frequently used. HEALTH PLANNING UNIT BRIEF -STERILISING SERVICES V0.1 P age 13 of 27 8.2. Specific design requirements The SS unit should be capable of continued operation during and after a natural disaster, except in instances where the facility sustains primary impact. Special design consideration is needed to protect essential services such as emergency power generation, heating and/or coo ling systems , water supply etc. A telephone or intercom system is required in the dirty, clean and sterile workrooms to allow communications without breaching of the 'Clean Barrier' Regime. Floor finishes should be easy to clean and safety flooring in wet areas such as the trolley wash area and soiled instrument decontamination area. Wall finishes shall be easy to clean with wall bumpers in all work areas to reduce damage from trolleys. Ceiling lighting, fittings and electrical wall fittings are to be flush mounted and sealed to prevent dust settling and insects from entering. All workstations to have a computer monitor and keyboard attached back to back for barcode labelling and printing functioning Accommodation is required for the parking of transport trolleys us ed for the delivery of ward imprest supplies Room temperature to be maintained in the range 18 degrees to 22 degrees Allow for AGV's. 8.2.1. Entrance areas - general Access for staff and visitors, the delivery of supplies, the return of contaminated goods and collection of waste. All entrances must be secure and controlled to prevent unauthorised access. A means of communication for the entrance points to staff occupied areas should be considered. Staff and goods entrances should be segregated. 8.2.2. Entry/Reception /Administration The design must facilitate direct access to the manager's office without having to cross internal areas of the C SSD and with access to external area for clients. 8.2.3. Contaminated Returns Holding Area The contaminated returns lobby provides secure, controlled access from outside the unit to the contaminated (including loan sets) returns area only. A buzzer/light system is required to alert staff within the unit to the arrival of goods. This area i s the reception point for soiled instruments from Perioperative Suites. Allowance for the storage of up to 15 soiled trolleys is required. An area where loan equipment is received from outside couriers is required. The area must have double door access to the outside of the unit for receipt of the sets. All re -proces sable items returned to the unit should be treated as potentially contaminated and be subjected to standard precautions. It is a receiving area f or contaminated return of containers and trolleys and is an area where the staff from the cleaning room collect goods. The room provides a space t o hold, unload, sort and prepare contaminated RMD that are rec eived from Perioperat ive Services, Ambulatory and War d Areas or external customers via: CH loading dock 2 a d edicated dirty lift from Perioperative Services3 am bulatory or ward areas . 2 Requires confirmation once location of this unit determined.

The use of Loan RMD requires careful coordination between medical equipment and transport companies. Dedicated space needs to be provided to receive, manage and dispatch these RMD. Delivery transport containe rs may be numerous, bulky and heavy. The process is labour intensive as the contents must be: unpacked checked against the suppliers inventory for contents and damage photographed reprocessed delivered to customer. On return, the RMD must be again checked. This return checking and delivery process requires an appropriate area with space to: stack transport containers on wheels benches for checking RMD workstation with computer for the instrument database. After checking and re -packing process the RMD are returned to the medical e quipment company via the CH loading dock 4. 8.2.4. Soiled/Cleaning/Disinfection Area Cleaning should completely remove all soil. The function of cleaning and drying processes is to consistently produce clean, dry and disinfected equipment. It is recommended that this process should be fully automated, controlled and v alidated. Washer -disinfectors should be of a pass -through design , and l ocated in such a way as to facilitate the installation of additional machines shoul d workloads incre ase. The main tasks of this area are: disassembly and preparation of reusable medical devices and associated equipment before cleaning, disinfecting and drying sorting and loading of medical devices into washer -disinfectors and other cleaning equipment such as ultr asoni c cleaners checking contaminated returns selective manual cleaning of RMD and accessories deemed unsuitable for automated cleaning, e.g. at open sinks transfer of processed items to the packing area facilitation of validation and routine testing of washer -disinfector and facilitation of maintenance of quality assurance/tracking records.

Key requirements : Should be located with external access and convenient and separate internal access to clean and dirty operational areas. There shoul d be no cross flows for staff accessing clean and dirty areas of the unit. Separate facilities for male and female staff are required with individual lockers5 for staff . S egregated shower are affording privacy WC, hand basins and wall mirrors - suitabl e to be used by a person living with a disability. Education and trai ning All staff need regular training. A training room should be provided if such an area is not available nearby. It should be separate to the main work areas, providing a space where teaching materials and work samples will be secure. 8.3. Other support areas The following components are required: dedicated reverse osmosis water filtration s ystem dedicated automated remote chemical management s ystem dedicated clean loading d ock6 co ntingency plan for steam generator waste disposal. 8.4. Endoscope Reprocessing Area A dedicated area is required for the cleaning and disinfecting of endoscopes and accessories. The endoscopy reprocessing area may be located in a dedicated fully self -containe d endoscopy unit or with in the SS unit collocated with the Perioperative Suites using shared facilities. If located within SS the process should be separate to instrument processing and follow a unidirectional dirty to clean pathway from cleaning to disinfection then storage. The reprocessing area will have three distinct zones: a dirty zone where used scopes are cleaned 5 Number will be dictated by the number of staff employed 6 Depends on final location HEALTH PLANNING UNIT BRIEF -STERILISING SERVICES V0.1 P age 19 of 27 a clean zone where automated flexible endoscope reprocessors (AFER) units are used to decontaminate scopes a storage zone with HEPA -filtered pass -through cupboards for the storage of cleaned scopes. The cupboard will pass through to the procedure areas where they will be used. The ability to efficiently and safely process endoscopes is critical to the functioning of the Endoscopy Unit. Endoscope and instrument processing is a multi -step procedure involving decontaminating dirty scopes/ instruments, sterilising of scopes and packaging/ storing of clean scopes. Processing of the endoscopes commences as soo n as the procedure is complete. Endoscopes, both flexible and non- flexible undergo a process of disinfection using chemical cleaning agents by manual washing or automated reprocessing machines. The process requires large sinks and tanks of disinfecting solution or automated machines. Instruments are leak tested, then manually pre- cleaned in an enzyme solution, followed by high level disinfection with an approved disinfectant in a fume cabinet or enclosed automated machine. Compressed filtered air is required for the drying process. Key requirements: the dirty and clean zones require negative pressure and be ventilated to remove vapours o f chemicals used in the process scope storage areas must be positively pressured and HEPA filtered to prevent co ntamination of clean endoscopes sinks for soaking and rinsing sufficiently sized to prevent tight coiling of the endoscope which may damage the fibre -optic cables in the instrument ultrasonic cleaner for accessory equipment used in procedures automated endoscope cleaning/ disinfecting machines compressed air to aid drying of endoscopic equipment after cleaning handwashing basi n s afety eyewash facility stainless steel benches with space to accommodate the length of the endoscopes storage for disinfected scopes on a bench or shelf. scopes may be stored in properly ventilated and temperature controlled cabinets which allow for endoscopes to hang without coiling preventing damage to either end of the scope. Specific designrequirements . 8.5. General circulation pathways to and from the Peri-operative Suites must be direct there must be separate entry and exit points for the movement of clean and dirty items the education/meeting room must be located on the periphery of the unit to enable access by company representatives and others without having to cross internal areas of the SS unit access must be provided for the maintenance and servicing of sterilisers and other major equipment such as the reverse osm osis water treatment plant room packing tables require power and data for use with comp uters, p rinters and instrument scanners air conditioning systems and controls must be configured to maintain appropriate environmental conditions natural light is highly desirable particularly in the packing area. Natural and artificial lighting mus t ta ke into account the bench layout and occupational health and safety requirements for staff supply staff will require access to manage bulk supply of chemicals (with the ability to manage pallets).HEALTH PLANNING UNIT BRIEF -STERILISING SERVICES V0.1 P age 20 of 27 8.6.

Approved _______________________________________________________ Chris Bone Deputy Director General Canberra Health Services _______________________________________________________ Date CHS Emergency Management Plan Page 5 of 20 VERSION CONTROL Proposals for amendment or addition to the contents of the CHSEMP are to be forwarded to: Hospital Emergency Management Coordinator Canberra Health Services ACT Health Version Approval Date Version Issue Date Detail 1 December 2018 New document CHS Emergency Management Plan Page 6 of 20 1 PART ONE: OVERVIEW 1.1 Purpose The Canberra Health Services (CHS) Emergency Management Plan ( the Plan ) has been developed to provide an overarching guide for the effective and efficient mobilisation and control of C anberra Health Services (CHS) resources in response to a disaster, major emergency or other incident occurring within the CHS or as part of a larger response required to support broader the Health Sector . This Plan should be read in conjunction with the: ACT Emerge ncy Plan ACT Health Emergency Plan CHS Hospital Emergency Operations Centre Procedure CHS Site Based Emergency Response Procedures The Plan is to ensure: Maximisation of the response capability to an emergency Co-ordination of resources Minimisation of d isruption to normal services Accountability for responses is clear Management of the recovery phase is seamless 1.2 Objectives The CHSEMP ensure s a safe, effective and coordinated response to incidents at CHS by: a. describing emergency governance and administra tive arrangements b. describing command, control and coord ination management arrangements c. defining triggers to activate the Hospital Eme rgency Operations Centre (HEOC) d. defining the hospital Incident Management Team (IMT) structure and functions e. describing escalation mechanisms both internally , whole of health sector f. describing staff skill acquisition, maintenance and training requirements g. allocating roles to staff and describing other emergency based vocational roles 1.3 Scope The Plan describes CHS emergency management responsibilities using the Prevention , Preparedness , Response and Recovery (PPRR) principles for the management and response to : internal emergencies and disasters external emergencies and disasters disasters for which sp ecific sub -plans have been developed, such as mass casualties The Plan applies to all CHS staff involved in PPRR. CHS Emergency Management Plan Page 7 of 20 1.4 Context The arrangements outlined in this Plan are based on the following core principles : a. health services are provided in a timely, ethical, equitable and flexible manner b. continuity of critical non -incident related essential medical servic es is an operational imperative c. control and coordination of an incident response will be at the lowest effective management level d. management arrangements recognise that the recovery phase may be a complex, dynamic and protracted process e. the provision of health services in an emergency may involve an adjustment to normal priorities to ensure the greatest good for the greatest number f. training programs and exercises support the effective response of ACT health sector personnel 1.5 Incident definition and classification - AIIMS The Australasian Inter -Service Incident Management System (AIIMS) is an integral part of emergency management doctr ine for fire and emergency services industry within Australia. The Hospital Commander (HComm) and those in charge of leading an emergency response should receive AIIMS training. AIIMS defines an incident as an event, occurrence or set of circumstances that : has a definite spatial extent has a definite duration calls for human intervention has a set of concluding conditions that can be defined is or will be under the control of an individual who has the authority to make decisions about the means by which it will be brought to a resolution AIIMS concepts follows five principals of management: 1. Flexibility - incident management scalability 2. Managemen t by Objectives - A common incident management plan across all agencies and personnel involved in the response. 3. Functional Management - clearly defined management structure, roles and responsibilities, information flows and scalability 4. Span of control - relates to the number of groups or individuals that can be successfully supervised by one person. Ideally, the span of control should not be more than 1:7. 5. Unity of Command - Integration of agency responses with clearly defined roles, responsibilities and i nformation flow. CHS Emergency Management Plan Page 8 of 20 AIIMS classifies incidents into three levels as shown in the following table: Incident Classification Description Level 1 Level 1 incidents are generally characterized by being able to be resolved through the use of local or initial response resources only Level 2 Level 2 incidents may be more complex due to size, resources, risk or consequence. They are characterized by th e need for: Deployment of resources beyond initial response or Sectorisation of the incident or The establishment of functional sections due to the levels of complexity or A combination of the above Level 3 Level 3 incidents are characterized by degrees of complexity and consequence that may require the establishment of significant resources and structure for the effective management of the situation. These incidents will usually involve delegation of all functions CHS Emergency Management Plan Page 9 of 20 2 PART TWO: GOVERNANCE 2.1 Canberra Health Service emergency management arrangements 2.1.1 Hospital Commander (HC omm ) and Incident Management Team (IMT) The Deputy Director General (DDG) CHS, the CHS Chief Executive Officer (CEO) or delegate may assume the role of HComm during an incident that requires the management of hospital resources and an escalation of command. The HComm establishes the Incident Management Team (IMT) and arranges the setup of the CHS Hospital Emergency Operations Centre (H EOC) if required . The hos pital IMT shall consist of: Hospital Commander Planning Officer Logistics Officer Operations Officer Hospital Emergency Management Coordinator Media/Public Information Officer Role cards for the HComm and IMT members and the IMT structure are set out in th e CHS HEOC Procedure. The HC omm is notified in the event of any Code Plan activation and monitors the situation. Where the incident is of sufficient duration, scale or complexity ( e.g. requiring an evacuation, has significant clinical impact or Level 2 incident or greater) , the HComm shall establish the IMT to manage the incident . For Level 3 incidents , the HComm maintains control of operations of CHS and incident control is escalated to the ACT Health Controller via the ACT Health Emergency Management Unit who will manage resources across all The ACT Health Sector. The HC omm shall act as the key liaison between CHS and the ACT Health Controller to ensure CHS has appropriate resources to manage th e incident. 2.1.2 Health Sector Emergency Management Committee (H SEMC) The Chief Health Officer chairs the Health Sector Emergency Management Committee. The CHS DDG and Emergency Management Coordinator sit on this committee , along with representatives of other e xternal Emergency Agencies. A representative from this committee also sits on the CHSEMC (see 2.1.3 below). The role of the H SEMC is to assist the Chief Health Officer in developing the ACT Health Emergency Plan and coordinate government and private health sector support and resources during emergency planning, response and recovery operations. 2.1.3 Canberra Health Services Emergency Management Committee (CHSE MC) Australian Standard 4083 -2010 Planning for emergencies - Health Care f acilities, states that facilities \"shall have plans to respond to emergencies and that these facilities shall have an emergency planning committee to oversee emergency prevention, preparedness, response and recovery, relevant to its size and function \". CHS Emergency Management Plan Page 10 of 20 The CHSEMC provides governance of emergency management program activities , ensuring systems, procedures and resources are in place to prevent or manage emergenc ies that could impact CHS. This committee monitors emergency management related risk across CHS a s well as staff training and exercises. All emergency management related plans and procedures require endorsement of the CHSEMC. 2.1.4 Hospital Emergency Management Coordinator Under the authority of the DDG CHS , the Emergency Management Coordinator is responsible for all preparedness and response activities , including CHS Emergency Response Plans and Procedures . The Emergency Management Coordinator provides overall facilitation of emergency management programming . 2.1.5 Chief Warden, Deputy Chief Warden, Building Chief Wardens, Wardens The Chief Warden is responsible for facilitating emergency response arrangements at all ACT Health facilities and facilitates the Fire and Emergency related training and exercise program of Wardens . The Deputy Chief Wardens are responsible for leading the response to incidents in the absence of the Chief Warden, unless under the control of emergency services or the HComm . Building Chief Wardens coordinate emergency response within each building at CHS sites . Wardens form part of the grass roots level of Emergency Code Procedure activation across CHS sites . CHS Emergency Management Plan Page 11 of 20 3 PART THREE: RISK MANAGEMENT 3.1 Risk Management This Plan has been developed based on the principles and generic guidelines on risk management as per the International Standard ISO 31000:2009. This standard has been adopted by many organisations (particularly emergency services organisations) as the basis for their approach to risk management. Risk Management in the context of this Plan is the systematic me thod used for identifying, analysing, evaluating and treating emergency risks. The diagram (right) demonstrates the risk management process and the links between the various stages of that process, as identified in the standard.

Examples include good building design, routine maintenance to buildings and grounds to mitigate and protect against fire, provision of back -up systems and safety monitoring. Many of these larger scale activities are undertaken by the Infrastructure Managem ent and Maintenance Branch, coupled with good on -site building and services maintenance programs . CHS works collaboratively with the ACT Health Emergency Management Unit and other key government and non -government agencies to identify risks, undertake comp rehensive site risk assessments and develop mitigation strategies . 4.2 Preparedness Preparedness incorporates activities that focus on essential emergency response capabilities through the development of plans, procedures, organisation and management of resour ces, training and public education and collaboration with emergency services. To assist with the effective management of an incident and to protect patients, visitors and staff during an emergency event or large scale incident there is a need to be prepare d. Examples include: Network wide and site-based exercises Education and training Staff immunisations 4.2.1 Education, Training, Exercises All staff are required to receive annual emergency management refresher training that includes information and instruction regarding emergency preparedness and response procedures e.g. fire and evacuation training. This training may be delivered either face -to-face or online. Information regarding fire, evacuation and emergency codes e.g. Code Red, Blue, Black etc. are incorporated into the site specific emergency response procedures. The se are also incorporated into the sites orientation/induction program. 4.2.2 Training for Specific Roles The CHS Emergency Management Coordinator manages the coordination of specialist IMT training to enable H Comm and members of the IMT to manage and coordinate emergency incidents. This includes a variety of emergency training exercises including multi -agency exercises. The HComm and key IMT roles are required to undertake Australasian Inter -Service Incident Management System ( AIIMS ) training. This training provides a common incident management framework that can be applied to any size incident. Staff that have roles at incident sites and as part of medical assistance teams are required to undertake Major Incident Medical Management and Support ( MIMMS ) training can be considered for deployment in Australian Medical Assistance Teams (AUSMAT). Key clinical sta ff CHS Emergency Management Plan Page 13 of 20 at CHS may also benefit from Hospital MIMMS (HMIMMS) training which provides training concentrating on hospital triage and bed management. Emergency Control Organisation (ECO) training and exercises are given to all Wardens across the network to enable them to manage appropriate Emergency Code responses and know when to escalate to management when necessary. The general scope of training, exercise and testing activities relating to CHS skills acquisition and maintenance incorporates: emergency management competency and general awareness training simulated role -played emergency management exercises desktop (discussion style) exercises emergency Code Plan testing, training trial horizontal and vertical evacuation exercising Emergency Control Organisation AS3745 -2010 warden competency training fire extinguisher training field-based (multi -agency) emergency management exercises (facilitated by emergency service organisations) 4.2.3 Emergency Response Procedure s Hospital Emergency Oper ations Centre (HEO C) Procedure The HEO C describes the emergency management command and control processes which will be used by CHS executive and I MT when responding to a range of incidents . This Procedure is usually activated for all Level 2 and 3 incidents. This p rocedure, whole or part, will be ex ercised at least once every year . Site Based Emergency Response Procedures These are intended to form the basis of initial emergency response to incidents. The objective of the Site Based Em ergency Response Procedures is for CHS staff, at short notice, to be able to mobilise resources in a co -ordinated response to extraordinary circumstances to achieve: rapid and appropriate response activation clearly understand command and control structure s clearly understand communication mechanisms clearly defined roles for all staff rapid and structured advanced assessment and treatment of clients, visitors and staff rapid and structured approaches to de -escalating threatening behaviours rapid and struct ured evacuation of clients and staff from affected areas access to clinical staff with advanced life support skills and equipment transition back to normal business with minimal disruption CHS facilities will comply with Australian Standard 4083 -2010 'Planning for Emergencies in Health Care Facilities' and where appropriate Australian Standard 3745 -2010 'Planning for Emergencies in Facilities' CHS Emergency Management Plan Page 14 of 20 Floor evacuation diagrams provide information to enable safe exit from a building in the event of an emergency. Floor evacuation diagrams must meet the requirements of AS 3745 - 2010 and are to be appropriately displayed . Fire and Safety Systems installed at all CHS sites includ e: Fire Indicator Panels Fire Alarms and Emergency Warning Intercommunicat ion System (EWIS) Warden Intercommunication Phones (WIP) Detection Systems Suppression Systems Fire Safety Systems such as fire doors and lighting are installed at CHS sites. The table below sets out the Emergency Code colour s used at CHS. Detailed response to these colour codes can be found in the site based Emergency Response Procedures. 4.2.4 Surge Capacity and Capability ACT public hospitals must develop and maintain detailed facility surge capacity plans that incorporate both outpatient an d inpatient surge capacity for the triage, treatment, and tracking of patients at the facility or in alternative sites of care during mass casualty incidents, infectious disease outbreaks or hazardous materials exposures. 4.2.5 Business Continuity Management CHS Business C ontinuity Management consists of a suite of p lans based on hospital business function s and are administered by responsible business units.

During normal business hours, the Hospital Emergency Management Coordinator shall confer with the H Comm if an incident appears to require escalation and the set -up of the H EOC. After hours, it may be the After-hours Hospital Manager who makes the decision to escalate to the Executive On-call on the basis of advice provided by senior management , business units , emergency management personnel, and external emergency services . If it is a Level 2 or 3 incident, the Executive On-call shall activate the HEOC, notify the designated Hospital Commander and begin establishing the I MT as per the HEOC procedure. 5.2 Hospital Emergency Operations Centre (HEOC) 5.2.1 HEOC Function The primary function of the HEO C is to support the HComm and IMT in strategic and operational emergency management response activities . The HEO C can be activated by the HComm at any time to support internal or external events. The common functions performed and terminology utilised in the HEO C include: Escalation The ACT Health Emergency Management Unit may activate the Health Emergency Control Centre (HECC) if the incident requires coordination and response of the larger health sector including public and private hospitals, liaison with Ambulance Controller, aged care facilities, Australian Red Cross, Australian Defence Force etc. The HEOC shall ensure regular sit uation reports are given to the HECC , if it is activated. Control The overall control of CHS response. Command The direction of operational activities of the CHS response. Coordination Ensuring individuals, agencies and networks are working together and aware of each other's roles and responsibilities. Records Management The necessity for the HEOC to maintain accurate records and collect, interpret and disseminate information. Operational Management Actions undertaken to meet demands created by the emergency. Public Information Participate in the development of public information via the HEOC, HECC, Public Information Coordination Centre (PICC) (if act ivated). Other tasks to consider include : briefings, fatigue management, timings for sit uation reports, handovers etc. Further information is available in the H EOC Procedure. CHS Emergency Management Plan Page 16 of 20 5.3 IMT roles and responsibilit ies overview 5.3.1 Incident Controller The Incident Controller (IC) is the person 'on the ground' who is in charge of the incident, in the absence of the emergency services, is usually the Chief Warden or delegate or After -hours Hospital Manager. The HComm will assume the role of I C if the incident requires escalation. In the event the emergency services or police are on site, the IC may not be a Health employee depending on the scale and type of incident. The H Comm shall still maintain command of hospital operations. 5.3.2 Planning Officer The Planning Officer is the person responsible for coordinating the Planning function of the IMT. Th e Planning Officer is responsible for the ongoing forecasting of incident response and management operations and Incident Communications at CHS. The Planning Officer reports to the HComm . 5.3.3 Operations Officer The Operations Officer is the person responsible for the Operations function of the IMT. Th is person coordinates the people who are the \"doers\" in the IMT and are responsible for implementing the outcomes of the Incident Action Plan and providing feedback on t he situation on the ground. 5.3.4 Public Information Officer The Public Information Officer is the voice of the IMT. This person is responsible for all external communications from the IMT. Responsible to the HComm , the Public Information Officer prepares all ma terial to external stakeholders. The Public Information Officer must liaise with ACT Health Public Information personnel when necessary. 5.3.5 Logistics Officer The Logistics Officer coordinates the fixers and finders of the IMT. The Logistics Officer is respon sible for resourcing of the incident response, including providing of people, equipment, facilities and food. For more detail regarding the HEOC and IMT, see the HEOC procedure including action cards for all roles .

The HComm will ensure that recovery matters relating to the normal operations of the organisation are adequately planned for with particular attention to the return to normal business, relevant notifications to authorities, debriefs and post incident support. There may also be a requirement for CHS to provide recovery assistance into a local community as a result of a disaster or emergency. The initial assessment is the responsibility of the HComm before handing over to the relevant Executive. 5.4.1 Return to Normal Busin ess It is essential that in developing a plan for a return to normal business the following is considered: determine the scope of recovery measures ensure Business Continuity Plans are activated at the site ensure financial costs and any performance issues arising from the incident are addressed notification to patients families and next of kin should it be required communication strategy for the return to normal business tasks and responsibilities for participating and supporting organisations 5.4.2 Post Incident Support People react in different ways to events that are extreme. Emergencies may have adverse short and long -term psychological effects on personnel and the individuals directly and indirectly involved. Provision for the ident ification and management of adverse psychological effects for responding personnel should be an integral part of planning. Early intervention strategies such as Psychological First Aid may minimise the psychosocial effects that may be associated with an emergency or disaster. Analysis of the requirement for psychological support must be considered as a component of initial hot debriefs following deactivation and reviewed again during follow up debriefing. For all staff, volunteers or patients who were directly involved in and/or affected by an incident, group counselling may be offered by CHS. Such support will take into account local needs and will be dependent upon the severity or complexity of the incide nt and its impact on individuals. Managers are to remind staff of how to access the Employee Assistance Program (EAP). Site Managers may also authorise one to one counselling for staff or volunteers who are severely affected by the incident and for whom th is course of action will provide some benefit. CHS Emergency Management Plan Page 19 of 20 5.4.3 Operational Debriefing Debriefs are an effective method of maximising the learning to be gained from an event or operation. Debriefs are about improving performance and should not be used as a method of appo rtioning blame for any failings identified. The debriefing process is designed to be entirely flexible and should be tailored to the situation and the officers involved. For this reason careful consideration needs to be given to the timing of the debrief, its location and those who are invited to attend. The overriding consideration should be given to maximising the benefit gained through the debrief and capturing the opportunity for individuals and CHS to learn from the experience. Every debrief should hav e a written outcome. This should record any learning points that arise along with recommendations for improvement. The HComm will determine who will conduct the debrief and the timing of this. A report will be provided at the conclusion of the debrief, identifying lessons learned and recommendations for changes to the Emergency Management Plan and related documents including Business Continuity Plans . Any recommendations will be tabled at an extraordinary CHS Emergency Management Committee meeting for consi deration prior to any amendments to specific procedures. Within 30 days of the incident IMT members and Executive Directors will, where necessary: ensure that there is a Work Health and Safety debrief re staff safety issues direct the conduct of hospital/ directorate debriefs attend CHS debrief if required attend multi -agency debrief as required 5.4.4 Hot Debrief A hot (or immediate post -incident) debrief is held immediately after the incident response and allows those involved to rapidly offload any arising issues or concerns. This shall occur within 48 hrs of the stand down. The HComm will conduct or delegate the conduct of a hot debrief where it may be required. This information will then be used to help guide and inform some of the direction of the formal debrief.

Identify Patients requiring Massive Transfusion Protocol Activation Potential patients are recognised as those suffering uncontrolled haemorrhage and coagulopathy. This will usually be in the setting of a massive transfusion represented by features such as: Immediate need for, or prior transfusion of, immediate release uncrossmatched (usually O Rh (D) negative) pRBC due to rapid haemorrhage and anaemia; Blood loss exceeding 150 mL/min; The need for at least four pRBC units within 4 hours in the setting of continuing uncontrolled bleeding; Replacement of 50% of the total blood volume within 3 hour (approximately 35m L/kg in an adult patient); Replacement o f the blood volume within a 24 -h period; this corresponds to about 70 mL/kg of body weight, or 5 litres in a 70kg patient; Presence of diffuse micro vascular bleeding; and The need for plasma and/or platelet replacement. Alert: It is recognised that massi ve trauma or pre -existing coagulopathy may induce massive non-surgical bleeding at losses less than these. Where there is a pre -existing coagulopathy, specific early correction is advised. 2. Notify Transfusion Laboratory The medical officer notifies the transfusion laboratory of activation Massive Transfusion Protocol , phone number 6244 2918 or 44239 ; Once a patient has been identified as requiring massive transfusion, blood tests to measure parameters should be labelled a s Urgent Massive Transfusion; The transfusion laboratory will notify the on -call haematologist; The laboratory to thaw Fresh Frozen Plasma (FFP). Four group specific pRBC units may be requested if current cross match sample available; and The laboratory will issue Red Cells to Plasma at a 1:1 ratio unless directed otherwise by the haematologist on call. 3. Measure parameters The following parameters should be measured early and frequently: Review Date Area Responsible Page CHHS15/079 1 14/04/2015 01/12/2018 CMA - ACT Blood Counts Transfusion CNC 7 of 13 Do not refer to a paper based copy of this policy document. The most current version can be found on the ACT Health Policy Register PT; APTT; and Fibrinogen Level Alert: These should be repeated after every 4 -6 red cell units transfused. With successful treatment, values should trend towards normal. Values indicative of critical physiologic derangement include: Temperature < 35\u00b0C; pH < 7.2, base excess > - 6, lactate > 4 mmol/L; Ionised calcium < 1.1 mmol/L; Platelet count < 50 \u00d7 109/L or < 100 x 109/L in head injury; > 1.5 \u00d7 normal; APTT 1.5 or <2.0g/L in obstetric hae morrhage. The majority of patients will initially be volume resuscitated with crystalloid, or possibly colloid: Red cells are used as anaemia develops. These may be uncrossmatched (group O). In general, group specific red cells should be used as soon a s they are available. Transfusion of platelets is less predictable, and usually occurs much later with dilutional coagulopathy. Cryoprecipitate is often unnecessary in simple dilutional coagulopathy i f plasma is replaced adequately; however, DIC with hyp ofibrinoginaemia should prompt aggressive replacement therapy. 4. Ensure surgical definitive haemostasis procedures to arrest active bleeding are considered. If mixed surgical and non-surgical bleeding continues in spite of treatment, initiation of damage control surgery should be considered, especially if the: pH <7.2 and/or; HCO 3 < 15 mmol/ L; Core body temp < 34\u00b0C; and There is ongoing coagulopathy . This usually includes abandonment of definitive surgical repair, rapid haemostasis, packing and closure. The patient is then transferred to ICU for warming, coagulopathy and inotropic management. A later definitive procedure is then undertaken. This may in clude: Operative surgical exploration; Orthopaedic fixation; and Embolisation by interventional radiology.

Initiate m easures to prevent and reverse hypothermia Utilise Blood/fluid warmers; and Utilise forced air warming blanket and warming mattress or un der patient warmers. This equipment is available from acute care environments, e.g. Resuscitation room, Operating Rooms, Intensive Care Unit. 6. Initiate m easures to prevent and reverse acidosis Prevention of tissue hypoxia is primarily used to prevent acid osis in the acute setting. In ICU, haemodialysis may be considered. 7. Specifically Correct Coagulation Deficiencies The use of platelets and cryoprecipitate is generally guided by laboratory tests. However, coagulation testing and thawing of plasma products of necessity introduce significant delays in product availability, so empirical use of coagulation factors may be necessary in certain circumstance. Frozen plasma products are thawed under controlled conditions to ensure the viability of the coagu lation factors they contain. Consequently there is a delay of 20 -30 minutes from the time of request until availability. Use may need to be anticipated; and Cryoprecipitate is used primarily as a source of fibrinogen (but also contains FVIII, VWF and F XIII). This is found in adequate amounts in FFP, and in dilutional coagulopathy FFP alone may be adequate. Coexisting DIC may increase fibrinogen requirements. Empirical use is unnecessary. Use should be guided by fibrinogen determinations. Back to Table of Contents It is important to inform the transfusion laboratory that the massive transfusion protocol is stood down .

Follow up Patients should be considered for management in the intensive care unit following massive transfusion, where attention to perfusion and early identification of bleeding or oozing should be undertaken, particularly as further dilution may occur until volume is replaced. Replacement of co agulation factors is not necessary unless there is active bleeding. In the event of bleeding transfusion should aim to keep: Hb>80g/L; Platelets >50x109/L; and PT and APTT<1.5 x control.
