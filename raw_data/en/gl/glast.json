My name is Kalie Hess, and I am a public health professional living in Augusta. I am writing in opposition to LD 96, LD 56, LD 833, and LD 1082. All of these bills are intended to create loopholes in the current, strong, and evidence -based immunization laws that Maine has in place, and that voters reaffirmed their support of with the vote to uphold LD 798 in 2020, with more than 70% of Mainers in support of our new school immunization law. Public health professionals are currently in a persistent battle to help people understand the safety of vaccines. There are numerous tracking and monitoring systems to ensure that vaccines that make it to the public are reliable and safe. And, it is worth noting, they are much safer than being exposed to t he illnesses that they prevent. According to the World Health Organization, vaccines prevented more than 10 million deaths between 2010 and 2015. 1 The scale of how effective vaccines are blinds us to the reality of the good they have done in our lives. My grandfather would recount stories of returning to school each year having lost more friends over the summer to what are now preventable diseases. We are incredibly fortunate to have vaccines and to not have to live with this reality. Unfortunately, bills like those being presented today have the potential to undo the progress we are making to improve health. There are many people who are unable to be vaccinated for medical reasons - these are the people that our vaccination laws aim to protect. Many of us have someone in our lives who benefits from community , or herd , immunity. For me, this was my dad, both when I was young and in his final years as he battled cancer. And, now that I am experiencing a high -risk identical twin pregnancy, when my children are born - likely to be premature and at higher risk for complications as infants - they will also benefit from community immunity until they are able to be vaccinated. These bills that aim to make it easier to opt -out of required school vaccinations will thr eaten herd immunity. The decision to not vaccinate is not a personal decision - it is one that puts so many people at risk, particularly young children and those who are unable to be vaccinated for medical reasons. The unfortunate reality here is that when other states have removed philosophical exemptions but kept religious exemptions is that the religious exemption rate climbs as people take advantage of this loophole , often without a religio n even supporting this stance . I have included after my testimon y a reference guide to the stances tha t most religious groups take on vacci nation , and you 'll find it interesting that nearly ever y form of religion supports vaccination as a way to support our most vulnerable citizens . If we reinstate religious exemptions, we can expect th e number of supposed religious exemptions to climb and undo the good that the citizens of Maine voted to uphold. Finally, I can't finish this testimony without mentioning the serious and concerning trend of vaccine misinformation that we are seeing right now. One of the leading spreaders of vaccine information in Maine, Dr. Christiane Northrup, is a frequently cited as an expert by the groups moving forward these bills. However, Dr. Northrup was recently banned from Instagram for spreading conspiracy theories about vaccines. The vaccine misinformation movement is growing because of social media and it galvanizes people to put forward misinformed and dangerous bills like these . Reputable medical and 1 https://www.who.int/publications /10- year -review/vaccines/en/ public health organizations globally support stronger vaccination laws enthusiastically and we should lean on their expert ise to guide our policy. It is easy to look at these bills in isolation and think that they are innocuous , but loosening Maine's vaccination laws both puts medically vulnerable people at risk and gives fodder to a dangerous vaccine misinformation mo vement. These bills also create the potential for pockets of extremely low vaccin ation rates at certain schools, increas ing the risk of preventable breakouts of disease in these communities and putting young children and medically vulnerable people who encounter these communities at risk. As a public health professional and a soon -to-be mother to two babies who will need community immunity to stay healthy, I urge you to vote in opposition to these misguided and dangerous bills. Thank you for you r consideration of this testimony. Kalie Hess , MPH Augusta , Maine 1 Religious Views of Vaccination At-A-Glance While there is a minority of Amish parents who do not vaccinate their children, vaccination is not prohibited by their religion.1 In 2010, T ibetan Buddhist spiritual leader and Nobel laureate the Dalai Lama helped vaccinate and launch a polio eradication drive in India .2 There are some faith -healing groups \u2014of which the Church of Christ, Scientist ( Christian Science ) is the most prominent \u2014that believe they can heal all things through prayer rather than throu gh medicine. Therefore, many of these worshippers strongly oppose vaccinations.3, 4, 5 The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter -day Saints has supported childhood vaccination for over 30 years . In July 1978 they stated, \"We urge members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter -day Saints to protect their own children through immunization. Then they may wish to join other public - spirited citizens in efforts to eradicate ignorance and apathy that have caused the disturbingly low levels of childhood immunization. \"6 There is no formal statement from Hindu authorities on vaccination, as Hinduism has several hundreds of sects , each with its own traditions and rules. Many areas of the world with large Hindu populations, such as India which is 80.5% Hindu, have taken proactive efforts to eradicate vaccine - preventable diseases like polio.7, 8 Many imams and other Islamic leaders have issued clear statements commenting that vaccination is consistent with Islamic principles.9, 10, 11 In particular, a 1995 conferenc e of Islamic scholars concluded , \"The transformation of pork products into gelatin alters them sufficiently to make it permissible for observant Muslim s to receive vacc ines containing pork gelatin.\"12 However, some specific select Muslim communities throughout the world have opposed vaccinations, including the Nation of Islam, whose leader Minister Louis Farrakhan once said that the 2009 H1N1 flu vaccine was designed to kill people.13 According to The Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania , the main legal entity that organizes worldwide activities by Jehovah's Witnesses , \"We have no objection to vaccines in general .\"14 While there is no singl e voice for Jewish communities, many rabbis have spok en out in favor of vaccinations noting the importance of preserving life (pikuakh nefesh ) and that, according to Jewish law, there is no objection to porcine or other animal -derived ingredients in vaccin es.15 There is no official statement on immunization from Sikh authorities . But generally, Sikhs do not have religious or societal issues against vaccination. 2 The Roman Catholic Church recognizes the importance of vaccinations and their use in the fight against infectious disease to protect both individuals and the larger community. It advocates use of alternatives, if available, of certain viral vaccines manufactured in cell lines with remote fetal o rigins . However , \"as regards the vaccines without an alternative, the need to contest so that others may be prepared must be reaffirmed, as should be the lawfulness of using the former in the meantime insomuch as is necessary in order to avoid a serious ri sk not only for one's own children but also, and perhaps more specifically, for the health conditions of the population as a whole - especially for pregnant women; the lawfulness of the use of these vaccines should not be misinterpreted as a declaration of the lawfulness of their production, marketing and use, but is to be understood as being a passive material cooperation and, in its mildest and remotest sense, also active, morally justified as an extrema ratio due to the necessity to provide for the good of one's children and of the people who come in contact with the children (pregnant women) .\" 16 1 Grens, K.
