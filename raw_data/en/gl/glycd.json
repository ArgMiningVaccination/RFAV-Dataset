While most of WVU students are of traditional college age and attend classes full-time, WVU has a number of students who have decided to fulfill their dreams by returning to school. You are considered a non-traditional student if: - You are a student over the age of 23. - You are a student who graduated from high school five or more years ago. Admission Requirements for Non-Traditional Students - Non-traditional students are required to submit an official high school transcript with their application. - Standardized test scores are not required if you graduated or would have graduated high school five or more years ago. If you graduated or would have graduated less than five years ago, we will accept the scores listed on the official high school transcript or sent to the WVU Office of Admissions from the testing center, or - If you are classified non-traditional but you have taken the TASC, GED or HiSET, please review the requirements on our [First-Time Freshman page](https://admissions.wvu.edu/how-to-apply/first-time-freshmen). - Students who are not attending WVU as freshmen, and decided to attend college elsewhere, will be considered for admission as a transfer student. Students must have at least a 2.0 grade point average in all college work attempted. Non-traditional students who have completed less than 24 transferable credit hours, at another accredited institution, must also meet the freshman requirements as listed above.
