Diverticulitis is a condition that occurs when pouches form in the wall of your colon, in areas that are weakened and stretched out, and become inflamed or infected. When these pouches aren't inflamed, the condition is called diverticulosis, according to the [National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases](https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/digestive-diseases/diverticulosis-diverticulitis/all-content) (NIDDK). Diverticulosis is a common condition. About a third of people 50 and younger in the United States have these intestinal pouches, per the NIDDK. Once Americans are 60 and older, the condition affects more than half of them. Not everyone who has diverticulosis gets sick. Many people don't even have symptoms from diverticulosis, according to the NIDDK.

If you do experience inflammation or infection, it's important to take it seriously. Diverticulitis sends about 200,000 Americans to the hospital every year, according to the NIDDK.

Waste products leave your body through the tubing as well. There are no scientifically proven benefits for this process. \"Colon cleanses are not standardized, so they may contain different substances in the irrigation, such as coffee or lots of water,\" Dr. Swaminath says about the potential risks of a colon cleanse for someone with diverticulitis. \"They have been reported to cause abdominal pain, dehydration and perforation that requires surgery to correct.\" Colonic irrigation may cause diarrhea, anal irritation, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, infection, and in some cases low levels of essential electrolytes, according to the Mayo Clinic.
