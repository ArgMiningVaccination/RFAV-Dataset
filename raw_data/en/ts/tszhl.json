Many people prefer natural remedies or simply want to avoid excessive medications. Whatever your reason, these are some of the best tricks you can try for all natural treatments for back pain. The best part is, these tips won't even cost you a penny, you just have to follow through with implementing them! 5 Natural Ways to Relieve Back Pain at Home Here are five simple, easy and even free things that you can do if you want to stop your back pain, or better yet, prevent it before it has a chance to start! Pay Special Attention to Your Posture Unsupported or bad postures put pressure on the spine and this can lead to damage to the sensitive network of discs, joints and muscles in your spine, as well as the rest of your body. This often expresses itself in the form of lower back pain or can be felt in the hips and knees. Slouching on the couch while marathoning your favorite show or lying on your stomach while working on a laptop in bed might feel comfortable in the moment, but it can leave you with a backache later on. Take some extra time to work on your posture. If you aren't sure how to do that, your chiropractor can teach you [corrective exercises](https://northatlantachiro.com/services/corrective-exercises/) that can help. Get Better Sleep It is generally recommended that a healthy adult sleep for at least seven to nine hours every night. The average American doesn't come close to that even most of the time. Restful sleep allows your body to heal itself. Nights spent tossing and turning can lead to even more joint and muscle aches than before you went to bed. You can try listening to soft music or reading a book if you are having trouble falling asleep at night. Make sure that you are getting plenty of exercise during the day, staying hydrated and providing yourself with a comfortable place to sleep if you want to wake up feeling strong and rejuvenated. Try Yoga Yoga is great for muscle and joint health. It gives you a very effective low impact way to stretch your body, especially your back. Yoga allows you to start slowly at your own pace and progress as you feel strong enough to do so. The stretching is not only wonderful for your muscles and joints, it also allows for improved circulation and flexibility which can help you physically feel a lot better too. Manage Your Stress Everyone is guilty of getting too busy and letting the stress pile up. Upper back pain, neck pain and stiffness or pain in your shoulders can all come from dealing with an excessive amount of stress. It is very important to remember to make time for self care. From the little things like listening to a good song or chatting with a friend to a more substantial spa day or vacation, you have to take time for yourself. If managing stress is a serious factor in your life, look into mindful meditation. It can be a great way to reduce anxiety and stress. Lift Correctly & Carefully When it comes to back injuries, incorrect lifting is a very common cause and it is completely preventable. Always bend at your knees to lift a heavy object. Never bend from the waist and use the muscles in your back to support the weight of the object. Many injuries have happened this way. It is not hard to lift correctly, it really is mostly about being careful and cautious when you lift.
