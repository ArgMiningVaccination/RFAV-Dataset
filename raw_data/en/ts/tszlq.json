Introduction After completion of the Human Genome Project, the National Institutes of Health turned the tools of genetic sequencing toward the study of the entire library of microbiologic life inand on the human body. These investigations, carried out worldwide, have determined that there are more than ten thousand different microbial species and more than one hundred trillion different individual organisms colonizing the average normal healthy human body. The actual quantity of individual \"non-human \"micro-organisms in the human microbiome outnumbers etic information nearly forms invisible \"organ \"or continuous living bio-shield (biolm) of non-human tissue that covers every square millimeter of skin; lines every ori ce gastrointestinal [GI], and urogenital as an indepen-dent, the hu- man body. The microbiome is composed of a vast complicated network of micro-organisms that criss-cross, bridge, and inter-connect, communicating (with each other and with us) via chemical,structural, electrical, and quorum-sensing throughout the entire body. 8No healthy organ system exists without a micro- biome. Network connections between organisms are capableof utilizing the equivalent of a type of biological \"internet \", providing parallel systems of communication, circulation, nutrient exchange, immunological, and structural supportthroughout the tissues and glands of the human body. 9 This diverse, ubiquitous amalgamation of human tissue with non-human micro-organisms interacts and cooperatesin every essential aspect of life, beginning with sexual attrac- tion, bonding, reproduction and conception onwards, support- ing the development of the entire body including the nervous,immune, digestive, respiratory, and sexual reproductive dysbiosis holism psychosomatics direction of cure Law of Similars individuality and susceptibility minimum dose homeostasisAbstract Human health is intimately linked to the ecology and diversity of the human micro- biome. Together, the human organism and the human microbiome work as a complexsuper-organism throughout the human life cycle. Microbiome science provides directevidence and substantiation of the fundamen tal principles of homeopathy, including holism, psychosomatics, direction of cur e, the Law of Similars, individuality and susceptibility, minimum dose, and homeostasis. Whilst many conventional (allopathic) medical treatments irreversibly damage the ecology of the microbiome and trigger chronic immune dysfunction and in flammation, the future sustainability of the entire eld of medicine depends on the ability to recognize these inconvenient biological truths and to embrace a safer approach based on this evidence. Fortunately, one of theoldest forms of clinically veri able, evidence-based, and ecologically sustainable medicine, that does not harm the microbiome, already exists in the form ofhomeopathy. received December 17, 2019accepted after revision February 17, 2020 published online May 14, 2020Copyright \u00a9 2020 The Faculty of HomeopathyDOI https://doi.org/ 10.1055/s-0040-1709665.ISSN 1475-4916.Debate 248 This document was downloaded for personal use only.

Article published online: 2020-05-14fundamental, synergistic symbiosis that functions as integrated and mutually inter-dependent spe- cies.11Not only does human life depend on the microbiome for normal healthy growth, development and survival, but the microbiome, which has adapted itself to the human organism,is reciprocally dependent on the human body for its own survival. 12 The microbiome is not simply an opportunistic super- infection representing a casual encounter with micro-organ- isms, but one of the most fundamental symbioses of nature, that has likely enabled the process of species evolution itselfto take place. The microbiome has provided the basis for the rapid development and ne-tuning of events such as con- sciousness, intellect and intelligence, personality andmood. 13Yet modern technological societies now stand on the brink of self-destruction, the result of biologically de- structive forces that were unleashed in the form of modernallopathic medical treatment, which threaten to destroy the microbiome and create an immunologic \"tsunami \"risking human health and species survival. The discovery of the human microbiome represents \"cut- ting edge \"science, and one of the most important milestones of modern medicine. Microbiome science reveals how long-standing assumptions and practices, rmly established over many decades as \"standards of care \"in allopathic medicine, are simply unsustainably destructive and irreversibly harm-ful to human, microbiome, and environmental health. Evi- dence-based insight garnered from microbiome science challenges and provides qualitative proof that the mostfundamental foundations of modern allopathic medicine, particularly man 's adversarial relationship with the environ- ment and other species in it, are destroying the microbiomeand promoting a worldwide epidemic of chronic in flamma- tory illness. 14The \"inconvenient truth \"is that modern medicine, a \"wunderkind \"of science and technology, has engineered a vast epidemic of human and environmental illness by systematically and unwittingly destroying themicrobiome and the environment. Ironically, the youngest branch of medical research, using the world 's most advanced and sophisticated tools of genetic sequencing, is providing evidence verifying the fundamental principles and premises of homeopathy (one of the most controversial and intensely debated elds of medicine). Most of the science emerging from the study of the micro- biome is fundamentally consistent with the principles and practices of homeopathic medicine, which has already beenin worldwide use for more than two centuries. Homeopathy may prove to be one of the most scienti cally justi ed, safest, and promising methods of supporting long-termhealth because it promotes both microbiome and environ- mental health and sustainability. True science (not just economically driven innovation) demands a fundamentalparadigm-shifting realignment of medicine to work within an ecologically sustainable framework of health promotion. To achieve this, the elds of both allopathic and homeopath- ic medicine must be re-examined in light of microbiome science to determine the course of future sustainable, well- ness-promoting healthcare.What follows is a summary of some of the most pertinent discoveries made in microbiome science that relate to thecurrent thesis. The Human Microbiome and Homeopathy The human microbiome has been described as an \"invisible biological organ \", which plays a critical role in metabolism, development and homeostasis, and directly modulates the host in flammatory immune response.15It is a \"super-organ \" that controls many functions that are equivalent to, and insome cases moreimportant than, thesolid organs of thehuman host. 16The microbiome regulates digestion and absorption of nutrients, along with growth and development of the immuneand nervous systems. It directly contributes to behavior and mood, social interaction, personality development, sexual development, sexual attraction, reproduction, and fertility. 10 The microbiome in fluences most (if not all) metabolic func- tions, including energy production, body temperature, and tissue growth.17It regulates the development and function of both the innate and adaptive immune systems,18prevents diseases of immune dysfunction,19neutralizes dietary carcinogens, andfavorably modulates the host 's immune response to resist infection and disease. 20The microbiome aids in complex carbohydrate fermentation and absorption, provides a signi - cant source of a range of essential vitamins (particularly those of the B and K groups), and keeps pathogenic micro-organisms in check. The GI tract microbiome aids in the development of GIbarrier function, integrity, and systemic immune responses, while promoting formation of a tolerant state between gut organisms and the immune system, which regulates tightjunction structure and function. 21 More than 200 years ago, without any knowledge of microbiology or genetics, the physician-scholar, and founder of homeopathy, Christian Friedrich Samuel Hahnemann, wrote: \"In the healthy human state, the spirit-like [invisible] life force (autocracy) that enlivens the material organism asdynamis, governs without restriction and keeps all parts of the organism in admirable, harmonious, vital opera- tion, as regards both feelings and functions, so that ourindwelling, rational spirit can freely avail itself of this living, healthy instrument for the higher purposes of our existence. \" 22 More than two centuries before its discovery and without technical knowledge of its existence, Hahnemann qualita-tively described the role that the human microbiome plays in health. He attributed this phenomenon to non-physical, spiritual forces, because it was not until microbiome scien-tists discovered that this \"invisible organ \"was made up of an extensive network of bacteria, viruses, fungi, archaea, and protists interacting directly with the human organism thathis observations could be attributed to the microbiome. Hahnemann described the qualitative behavior of the human microbiome long before it was detected microscopically, Homeopathy Vol. 109 No. 4/2020Human Microbiome, Conventional Medicine, and Homeopathy Whitmont 249 This document was downloaded for personal use only.

Microbiome science was actually pioneered in the early 20th century by the British homeopathic physicians John Paterson and Edward Bach, who studied the changes in thebowel flora associated with a wide range of systemic illnesses. Between 1927 and 1932, Paterson cultured more than 8,000 stool specimens and published results, nding that \"Homeo- pathic potencies are capable of completely altering the bacte- rialflora of the bowel, and this fact has been demonstrated in many hundreds ofcases \". 23He noted that the gut flora changed along with different diseases and that it was altered favorably with homeopathic curative intervention. These physicians also pioneered the use of a group of speci c homeopathic medi- cines dis- turbed (dysbiotic) stool from diseased individuals. This group of medicines, collectively known as the \"bowel noso- des\", proved to be effective as interventions, that continue to be used today to treat a wide range of disturbances both within and outside of the GI tract. In recent years, the bowel nosodeshave demonstrated particular bene t in re-establishing func - tional recovery in many individuals suffering from iatrogenic- induced dysbioses. In some respects, these homeopathicphysicians pioneered the rst study of fecal microbiome transplants by demonstrating the clinical bene ts of using stool-derived isolates to re-establish health and resolve in-flammation. This early research provided clinical evidence of homeopathy 's bene t in addressing dysbiosis long before it had even been named. Modern clinical research con rms that homeopathic medicines (not just bowel nosodes) directly alter many cellular functions ranging from messenger RNA expres- sion to protein synthesis. 24It is entirely tenable, based on both pre-clinical and clinical evidence, that homeopathic medicines act directly on the microbiome, both on individual organisms and on the collective super-organism, and that health and immune system bene ts arise directly via this route. The behavior of the microbiome coincides closely with what Hahnemann qualitatively described as a non-physical (spiritual, invisible) entity, or \"vital force \"that interacts with the human organism and continually guides it towardshealth. Hahnemann only had archaic language, unsophisti- cated in the elds of biochemistry, microbiology, and genet- ics (because these disciplines did not exist) to describe theseclinical phenomena. It is more than likely that what Hahne- mann qualitatively described as a \"vital force \"is precisely what molecular biologists have collectively called the micro-biome, since these two entities act identically in living systems. The entire eld of homeopathy is based on obser- vations made describing the characteristics of this entity,and if con rmed, homeopathy may turn out to be one of the earliest forms of sustainably managing the human micro- biome. Hahnemann may have been the rst to describe one of the most important, gentle, effective, and sustainable methods of manipulating the microbiome, foreshadowing its discovery by more than two centuries. The most important and fundamental principles of homeo- pathy can be veri ed by evidence revealed by microbiome science, re flected in the universal health principles of:\u0081Holism \u0081Psychosomatics \u0081Direction of cure \u0081Law of Similars \u0081Individuality and susceptibility \u0081Minimum dose. Each of these is brie fly outlined below. Holism \"As above, so below, as within, so without, as the universe, so the soul ...\" - Hermes Trismegistus Holism describes the phenomenon that every intervention (local or systemic) ultimately affects the entire body and allits parts, no matter if this was the desired or intended effect, or not. Results that are sometimes referred to as \"side effects \"(from allopathic medicines) are simply the predict- able systemic effects of locally applied treatments acting on the rest of the body. Conventional medical practices assert that single parts of the body are somehow distinct andseparate entities that can be studied and treated in isola- tion, without affecting the entire organism (in some way). This mistaken approach stems from a combination of a 16thcentury Cartesian philosophical exercise, separating the mind from the body (that has been repeatedly demonstrat- ed to be false) and convenience. Organ systems are theoret-ically categorized as separate and distinct entities, but these are arti cial distinctions that simplify the study and treat- ment, making it easier and more convenient for the practi-tioner. In actuality, every single organ system of the body interacts and is connected structurally, biochemically, hor- monally, electrically, and through the microbiome , 8with every other organ. Treating conditions and organs without regard for their holistic interconnection ultimately imperilsthe health of the entire organism, promotes polypharmacy, drug overuse, and contributes to the epidemics of addic- tion, 25antibiotic resistance,26and a wide array of other adverse outcomes that increase the risk and cost of conven- tional medical care. Even a rudimentary study of homeopathy demonstrates the bene t of prescriptions that are based on the holistic \"totality of symptoms \"of the entire organism. Prescribing from this premise increases global therapeutic ef cacy and long-term bene t. Homeopathic treatments are, by de ni- tion, based on addressing the totality of all the symptoms expressed by an individual. Even local prescribing, usinghomeopathic medicines, tends generally to improve the health of the entire organism rather than complicating it with untoward side effects. \"Homeopathic symptoms are manifestations of a singu- lar, pervasive, emergent disturbance of the state ofthe individual as a whole system or network of networks, not of a speci c body part or biological mechanism in isolation. \" 27 Homeopathy Vol. 109 No. 4/2020Human Microbiome, Conventional Medicine, and Homeopathy Whitmont 250 This document was downloaded for personal use only.

One of the plagues of allopathic medicine is the epidemic of adverse effects, which represent the unintended side effects oftreatmentsthat wereselectedonthebasisof local organ system management without anticipating or considering the systemic (holistic) effects on the health of the entire organism. 28 Psychosomatics Psychosomatics is an important corollary of the principle of holism that con rms the relationship between physical and mental/emotional functioning. Mental/emotional andphysical symptoms appear to be part of a continuum of health and illness that are almost always inter-connected. Most diseases have both mental and physical correlates.Nearly every single medicine (homeopathic and allopathic) affects both mental and physical functioning, 29depending on dosage, route of administration and duration of use.Homeopathic science includes the study of these effects and takes advantage of their connection in the therapeutic intervention process. By considering both mental and physical symptoms to- gether, as part of the same holistic totality, homeopathic treatment simultaneously addresses and impacts both, bydesign. Utilizing a psychosomatic perspective, as part of the process of case analysis and treatment, increases the thera- peutic ef cacy, global response rate, and quality of outcome. One of the key discoveries of microbiome science is the connection between the gut microbiome and cognitive- emotional-mental and physical functioning. Local changesin the GI microbiome profoundly affect the growth, develop- ment and health of the entire organism, and vice versa . Not only does the state of the GI microbiome impact the brain, itsmoods and cognitive abilities, 30but these moods, emotions and mental attitudes also impact the gut microbiome and alter microbial balance and diversity in the GI tract in the reverse direction.31The microbiome, which exists within the healthy brain, is integral to the development and mainte-nance of consciousness, memory, emotion and cognition. 32 The ecology of micro-organisms living within the brain iscritical to the nervous system function, and plays a role in thedenition of \"self\",i nfluencing the risk of developing mental, emotional and mood disorders. 33Animals raised in germ- free conditions display signi cant impairment in neurologic and social development, while in the wild it is the dominant male chimpanzees that are the most heavily parasite-ridden and microbiome-dense individuals of the tribe.34 Direction of Cure Homeopaths have long-observed clinically that when health deteriorates, illness and in flammation proceed along certain well-de ned gradient planes and pathways: from acute to chronic illness; from more super cial structures to deeper and more vital tissues, etc. Corresponding to these patterns of illness progression, there are mirror-image patterns that cor-respond to health-sustaining recovery. As recovery from a serious illness takes place, symptoms frequently progress through systems in the reverse order of appearance. As recov-ery proceeds, illness leaves deeper structures and vital organs and moves to more super cial structures and less vital organs; recovery proceeds in a cephalo-caudal, or dorsal-ventral pat- tern; centrifugally, and along gradient planes corresponding to embryological stages of development. These tendencies werewell described by the homeopathic physician and educator, Constantine Hering, 35and others.36 Homeopathic therapy frequently demonstrates the curi- ous phenomenon of \"direction of cure \", whereby as chronic illness improves or resolves, acute illnesses tend to recur: \"If any super cial in flammatory disease was suppressed, at this point it returns, and such a return is a further con rmation of the immune system reverting to its previous state \".37This phenomenon is more likely to be noticed if the holistic andpsychosomatic totality of the entire body is considered in the treatment and evaluation process. Microbiome science con rms that when acute illnesses are treated by methods that damage the microbiome and/or inhibit the immune system, then acute illnesses frequently appear temporarily to abate, and are later replaced by moresevere chronic states of in flammation. Routine and frequent use of antibiotics in early childhood is directly linked with an increased risk of developing chronic in flammation in the form of allergies, asthma, and autoimmune disease later in child- hood. 38-42Acute illness, treated without concern for the ecology of the microbiome or the integrity of the immunesystem, frequently progresses in this manner toward more serious pathology and chronic in flammatory disorders. The pediatric population suffers most heavily from these micro-biologically destructive events, with skyrocketing rates of chronic systemic in flammatory illness. 43 \"When continuously thwarted through anti-in flamma- tory drugs or other substances that hinder in flammation, [the body] loses the ability to react through strong in- flammation and enters a state of chronic low-grade inflammation, eventually turning on the chronic disease that one is predisposed to. \"44 Law of Similars \"Every action produces an equal and opposite reaction \" -Sir Isaac Newton, 3rdLaw of Motion The Law of Similars is a fundamental principle of homeopa- thy that describes the phenomenon that medicines demon- strate greatest effectiveness when selected on the basis of their (previously demonstrated/proven) capacity to evoke asimilar state of pathology most closely matching the state of a person who is sick and being treated. The degree of similarity between the medicine 's pathogenicity and the patient 's actual disturbance is directly proportional to the likelihood that the body will respond to treatment. The therapeutic response pattern produced by a similar pathogenic medicine results not from the drug 's pathogenic chemical/primary action, but from the body 's secondary biologically adaptive reaction to the drug. Homeopathy Vol. 109 No. 4/2020Human Microbiome, Conventional Medicine, and Homeopathy Whitmont 251 This document was downloaded for personal use only. Unauthorized distribution is strictly prohibited. \"The body as a complex adaptive system has the capacity for functional self-reorganization, emergence, and multi-scale self-similarity over global and local levels of organization. \" 27 This secondary adaptive response is always opposite to the drug 's primary chemical effects (i.e., the body 's second- ary response to the primary pain-relieving effect of opiates isan upregulation of pain receptors, increased pain sensitivity, and hyperesthesia). Similarly, by down-regulating in flam- matory pathways fashion, of non-steroidal anti-in flammatory drugs promotes compensatory up-regulation of these same pathways and shifts the host baseline equilibrium toward an in flammatory state. 45Ho- meopathic prescribing is based on both these phenomena: selecting a drug that is most similar to the actual pathology, and utilizing the body 'ssecondary adaptive response ten- dency. The use of similars may appear super cially paradox- ical (from a chemical perspective), but it is intuitive from a biologic perspective, since it recruits the body 's adaptive network response (homeostasis), integral to all living sys- tems.46Secondary adaptive reactions tend to be more sus- tained than the primary chemical drug effects since they arepart of the body 's adaptive response system rather than being dependent on the half-lives of chemical agents. 27 Homeopathy is unique in recruiting this paradoxical second- ary adaptive response pattern, but this phenomenon is conrmed by microbiome science. Microbiome science re flects this fundamental relation- ship between biological similars through the effects of different micro-organisms in the body. A wide diversity of commensal and symbiotic organisms are continuously nec-essary to promote cooperative ecological functioning, but certain potentially pathogenic organisms (pathobionts) are also critical for immune system regulation and develop- mental maturity. Pathobionts act synergistically in a bal- anced ecosystem and pathogenically in a dysbiotic system.These organisms are not only biologically important, but can also be critical in the regulation of immune function. \"A healthy, mature immu ne system depends on the constant intervention of bene cial bacteria. 'It goes against dogma to think that bacteria would make ourimmune systems function better, ... But the picture is getting very clear: the driving force behind the features of the immune system are commensals '\". 47 Acute infectious illness appears to be critical in immune system development. The greater the incidence of exposure tosimilar illnesses, the stronger the immune system 's capacity to resist chronic in flammation. 48The immune system develops and learns by experience with actual infections, and thefrequency of these infections is associated with reduced risk of developing allergic and in flammatory disorders. 39Young children with older brothers and sisters living at home, andthosewho attend a day-care centerduring the rst 6 months of life, have a lower incidence of both asthma and type 1 diabetes than those who do not. Early life exposure to a wide range ofinfectious organisms reduces the risk of autoimmune condi- tions in later life. 49The risk of developing allergies is inversely linked with birth order and family size. The number of infections within households in early childhood is directly associated with a lower risk of developing allergic rhinitis(unless antibiotic treatment is used). 50 Exposure to live infectious Mycobacterium species attenu- ates late-phase airway hyper-responsiveness 43Early life pulmonary expo- sure to Mycobacteria protects against the development of allergic bronchial in flammation.51The brains of mice exposed to live Mycobacteria prior to and during maze learning activi- ties are associated with reduced anxiety-related behaviors and faster maze completion times when compared with placebocontrols. 32A wide variety of pathobionts, including helminths, schistosomes and plasmodia species, demonstrate that expo- sure to living organisms capable of producing pathologicalchanges in immunosuppressed individuals provides signi - cant (paradoxical) benet, preventing and treating a wide range of similar immune-related illnesses. 52-59 Individuality and Susceptibility Homeopathy works ef ciently and effectively because it recognizes and utilizes differences in individuals, and treats them according to their varying susceptibility and sensitivi-ty. No two individuals are ever exactly alike (and microbiome science con rms this); nor do they respond in precisely the same way to the same stimuli. Treatment that is individuallytailored to match these differences is more likely to succeed. Homeopathy depends on the science of identifying indi- vidual differences and selecting the most similar medicine to match them. If the goal of treatment is resolution of illness and in flammation, then this approach is critical and makes this outcome more likely. If the goal of treatment is to suppress symptoms as part of disease management (as in allopathic medicine), then individualization is unnecessaryand has no bearing on outcome. Many healing modalities recognize the bene ts of indiv- idualization, including According Carl Gustav Jung: \"Analytical psychology, or Jungian psychology, empha- sizes the primary importance of the individual psyche and the personal quest for wholeness. \" 60 Microbiome science con rms that each individual micro- biome is unique and different, and that these differences are responsible for large variations in phenotypic gene expressionand behavior. 61Differences between individual microbiomes account for many differences in the ways that individuals process and respond to stress. These differences vary considerably, andare tremendously reliable both clinically and forensically. 62 Microbiome science con rms the phenomenon that in disease resolution and recovery of health, \"one size does not ta l l\". Even from a purely biological perspective, remediation and replenishment of the microbiome through probiotics must be tailored to individual variation if it is to be effective.63 Homeopathy Vol. 109 No. 4/2020Human Microbiome, Conventional Medicine, and Homeopathy Whitmont 252 This document was downloaded for personal use only. Unauthorized distribution is strictly prohibited. Most treatments tend to be more effective when they are aligned with individual differences: homeopathy proved this,while genetics and microbiome science con rm it. Minimum Dose The quantity of active material in doses of homeopathic medicines continues to be a source of con flict and contro- versy, ridicule, and skepticism; yet the phenomenon of delivering minuscule, in nitesimally small, quantities of homeopathic medicines continues to be supported by resultsboth in pre-clinical studies and in placebo-controlled, dou- ble-blinded, clinical trials. When all the criteria listed above are met \u2014namely if: (1) treatment is individualized holistically to encompass the psychosomatic totality of an individual 's characteristic and idiosyncratic symptoms; (2) the deepest levels of in flamma- tion are addressed in accordance with the predicted direc- tion of cure; and (3) the medicine is matched on the basis of the highest degree of similarity to the individual case at hand \u2014then only minute, nanoscale amounts of single medicines, delivered in a few doses, are necessary to initiate homeosta- sis-inducing healing reactions throughout the body. Materially large quantities (milligrams and grams) of drugs are typically necessary to initiate and sustain primary chemical drug actions in the body, particularly since thesedrugs (1) frequently depend on reaching high enough conc- entrations in the body to chemically saturate receptors on their target cells, and (2) are continuously subjected to activedetoxi cation and elimination by the liver, kidneys, lungs, skin, and the GI tract. In the case of homeopathic medicines, delivered in nanoparticulate concentrations, working bysecondary adaptive reactions, much smaller concentrations of medicine are necessary. Homeopathic medicines can be viewed as working through the process known as hormesis 27(also known as the Arndt -Schulz rule or Schulz 's law), which is a well- documented, non-linear physiological and cellular adaption phenomenon characterized by a biphasic dose -response curve, demonstrating low-dose stimulation and high-doseinhibition effects. The phenomenon of hormesis matches homeopathic empiric evidence and demonstrates how all substances exhibit non-linear and biphasic dose -response curves (in opposite directions), as concentrations change. Convergent expert opinion suggests that hormesis is a non- linear adaptive (not a pharmacological) process dependent on the reaction of a living organism, which utilizes it as a complex adaptive network response to stress. 64 Microbiome and pharmaceutical sciences demonstrate that the phenomenon of hormesis can be utilized therapeu- tically (outside of homeopathy) to increase survival in patients with infectious diseases through the mechanismof improving disease tolerance , an adaptive defense mecha- nism that decreases the extent of infection-associated tissue damage without directly targeting pathogenic micro-organ-isms. Drugs known to target and inhibit host intracellular damage control and repair pathways (anthracyclines and other chemotherapeutic agents) are effective in treatinginfections and sepsis when used in nano-doses due to this hormetic phenomenon. \"At least theoretically, this [hormetic] approach should have the advantage as compared to antimicrobial agentsin that development of resistance against the applied substances does not occur as no selection pressure is exerted on the pathogenic microorganisms. \" 65 Homeopathic treatment demonstrates similar character- istics in infections, and it is logical to suspect that it works bythe same mechanism. Substances that cause harm can be utilized (in nanoparticle or ultra-dilute \"homeopathic \" forms) to stimulate a return to homeostasis, and this is thebasis of the Law of Similars. Patients treated adjunctively with homeopathy for severe sepsis in the intensive care unit demonstrate a non-statistically signi cant survival bene ta t 30 days (verum homeopathy 81.8%, placebo 67.7%, p\u00bc0.19), and a statistically signi cant survival bene t day 180 (verum homeopathy 75.8%, placebo 50.0%, p\u00bc0.043). 66Im- proved survival 6 months after acute treatment suggests that homeopathic treatment promotes an adaptive network res- ponse surpassing any direct chemical effects of treatment. Conclusion The discovery of the human microbiome marks one of the most critical junctures in medical history and an opportunity to shift the paradigm of medical thinking away from an ecologicallydestructive methodology toward one that promotes health and well-being. Microbiome science provides a unique opportunity to reflect on the science and practice of conventional and homeopathic medicine. The convergence of these two diamet- rically opposed elds is an \"acid test \"of microbiome science and ecology. Allopathic medicine demonstrates signi cant short- and long-term risks relating to all aspects of care, fails to improvelong-term sustainablehealth, and causes signi cant damage to the microbiome, which results in an epidemic of chronic in flammatory illness and ecological devastation. \"It seems that the unhallowed principal business of the old school of medicine (allopathy) is to render incurable if not fatal the majority of diseases, those made chronicthrough ignorance by continually weakening and tor- menting the already debilitated patient by the further addition of new destructive drug diseases. \" 67 On the other hand, homeopathic medicine nds both pre- clinical and clinical veri cation in microbiome science and exhibits signi cant bene t in short- and long-term ef cacy, safety, and sustainability. It has been utilized worldwide for more than two centuries and has a track record documentedby numerous studies and research investigations. These facts may be \"inconvenient truths \"since much of the world 's (and 20% of the United States ') economy is heavily vested in conventional medical education, research, and treatment. Although homeopathy emerged from a vitalistic world- view, it is based on pure scienti c empiricism, which has Homeopathy Vol. 109 No. 4/2020Human Microbiome, Conventional Medicine, and Homeopathy Whitmont 253 This document was downloaded for personal use only.

Rather than rejecting or denying this science, it is critically important that it results in a shift of paradigm and a re-evaluation of assumptions. Funding should bediverted away from \"status-quo \"destructive and unsustain- able treatment modalities toward research, teaching, and the clinical application of homeopathic methods. Countries suchas India, which have already invested heavily in this infra- structure, should be emulated. The world is faced with an environmental catastrophe of epic proportions in climate change, but the eld of medicine faces a parallel epidemic of iatrogenic disability and chronic disease across all ages and socio-economic classes. The medi-cal system that has been blithely followed has led to some destruction of health of individuals and of society. The impending global climate catastrophe and the medical de-struction of our internal environments must be faced with the intelligent and the unbiased application of science (which, tragically, is not likely). Society must reject the \"fake news \" produced by organizations and associations that have vested interest in preventing change, and take action at all levels to shift health-care funding away from destructive modalitiestoward health-sustaining approaches. The future of modern medicine and environmental health depends on grasping the meaning behind microbiome sci-ence and agreeing to work toward health-care and environ- mental ecology. Failure to take this emerging science seriously means failure to wrest control from businessinterests and a system capable of exploiting human and environmental health for mere pro t. Highlights \u0081Human health is intimately linked to the ecology and diversity of the human microbiome. \u0081Together, the human organism and the human micro- biome form a complex super-organism. \u0081The principles of homeopathic medicine, including Ho- lism, Psychosomatics, Direction of Cure, the Law of Similars, Individuality and Susceptibility, MinimumDose, and Homeostasis, are all re flected in and substan- tiated by microbiome science. \u0081The only way forward in allopathic medicine is to abandon unsustainable practices that damage the microbiome and promote chronic illness. \u0081The future of medicine depends on incorporating micro- biome science, and one of the most practical ways of doing this is through homeopathy.
