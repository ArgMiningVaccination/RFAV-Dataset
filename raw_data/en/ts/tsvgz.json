This endeavour should help to formulate evidence-based recommendations for this nursing-sensitive outcome. Background: In health care settings, patients are prone to experience pain. Nurses play a vital role in pain prevention and treatment and make patients feel comfortable. Although nursing care is the most provided care, it is the least evidence based, resulting in over- or under-treatment. Identifying the scope of effective nursing pain interventions can contribute to promote a better quality of care and use of evidence-based practice. Design: Systematic scoping PsycINFO, Cochrane and Web of Science were searched up to November 2019. Western, controlled intervention studies executed by nurses involving adult patients in the hospital and community care setting were eligible for inclusion. The reviewers independently screened the title/abstract and full-text and performed a structured data extraction. In addition, they methodologically assessed the quality of the studies with the Cochrane Risk of Bias 2.0 tool. Results: Out of 5,697 studies, 47 were included. All studies had a (quasi)experimental design and were performed in a hospital or community care setting. Selected interventions were divided into three subcategories: (a) distraction interventions, like listening to music; (b) health education interventions, for example, improving self-management; and (c) pain prevention interventions, like numbing sprays, cold or hot application, specific positioning and pain-preventing devices. Risk of bias assessment resulted in two studies with a high score, 28 studies with a moderate score and 17 with a low score on methodological quality. Conclusion: This systematic scoping review provides an overview of the scope of pain interventions carried out by nurses in daily practice. More research is necessary to determine the full value these interventions.Citation: Giesen JH, Bakker-Jacobs Waal G (2021) Overview of Pain Interventions for Hospital and Community Care Nurses: a Systematic Scoping Review.

This paper provides an overview of the scope of interventions carried out by nurses that address pain. In addition we provided an overview of the quality of the included studies. Three main categories of pain interventions were found: distraction, health education and pain prevention interventions. Insight in the quality and results of interventions, like music or self-management interventions or application of warmth or cold, provides a basis for systematic reviews that can be used to determine their final value for the nursing profession. Introduction Meeting patients' basic human needs and guiding them to address themselves is the key task of the nursing profession. Essential care that all patients require is captured in the Fundamental of Care Framework by Kitson, et al. [1]. The Fundamental of Care Framework provides guidance for holistic and patient-centred nursing care, in which enabling or hindering factors of the context of care are considered for the delivery of high-quality care [2]. The relation between nurse and patient is the central point in the Fundamental of Care Framework in which empowering patients is an important aspect. Kitson, et al. [1], divide nursing care into three dimensions: physical needs like keeping the patient safe or fed; psychosocial needs like keeping the patient involved or hopeful; and relational aspects for the establishment of a working patient-nurse relationship. A key aspect of the physical needs dimension is keeping the patient comfortable and free of pain [1]. The International Association for the Study of Pain defines pain as: 'an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with actual or potential tissue damage, or described in terms of such damage' [3]. Pain is an important nursing-sensitive outcome because of its tremendous impact on a patient's comfort and quality of life [4,5]. Intensity, pain-related distress and functional impairment influence the severity of pain. The treatment depends on the cause of the pain, pain perception and pain behaviour, all of which differ from patient to patient [3]. Pain starts acutely and is often treated by taking away the cause of the pain, for example, with surgery, or to treat symptoms with analgesics like paracetamol, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or opiates. In addition, regional analgesia of continuous peripheral nerve blocks has become an acute treatment. Finally, there are non-pharmacological approaches, like transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation or the use of distraction, like music, books or videos [6]. When pain is persistent or recurrent and lasts longer than 3 months, it is classified as chronic. This form of pain can be divided into several subcategories: chronic primary pain, chronic cancer pain, chronic postsurgical and posttraumatic pain, chronic neuropathic pain, chronic headache and orofacial pain, chronic visceral pain and chronic musculoskeletal pain [7]. Chronic pain treatment is focused on remedying or minimising the pain and includes pharmaceutical interventions, surgery, physical therapy or a combination of an interdisciplinary therapy [8]. Adequate pain treatment and prevention is essential because pain seriously impacts a patient's well-being, quality of life and even recovery after surgery [5,9,10]. Boekel, et al. found that 55% of patients experience moderate to severe pain on the first post-operative day and patients with unacceptable pain had more complications (adjusted odds ratio 2.17, 95% Confidence Interval [CI] 1.51-3.10, p<0.001) [11]. Unfortunately, pain treatment is often suboptimal and since the mid-1990s, opioid use in Europe has increased rapidly. For example, approximately 20% of the population worldwide experiences chronic pain. Between 1990 and 2017, a quarter of this population was using opioid analgesics as a treatment. The percentage of patients using opioids has not changed over time [12]. Bosetti, et al. [13], stated that more attention needs to be paid to pain management to avoid misuse or abuse of pain medication. Hospital and community care nurses have an important role in helping their patients to be comfortable and pain free to improve quality of life. Although nursing care is the most provided form of care, it is the least evidence based [14]. Nurses are often guided by experience, intuition and tradition [15]. This can result in the use of low-value care that is harmful, inadequate or incomplete and affects a patient's safety or health outcomes [16,17]. Replacing low-value care by evidence-based interventions, also known as high-value care, improves the quality of care. Verkerk and colleagues [17], first identified low- and high-value nursing interventions by assessing Dutch clinical nursing practice guidelines. As a result, they identified 66 low-value care practices often used in clinical practice. For example, for pain they found that subcutaneous, transdermal, oral or intramuscular opioid administration is unsuited for post-operative pain management and intravenous administration is preferred because of its rapid and predictable effects [17]. In addition, to improve pain management by health care professionals, Berben, et al. [18], recommended that aspects like adequate knowledge, attitude, professional communication, organisational aspects and patient input should be taken into account. To increase the quality of care and to further professionalise nursing, it is necessary to reduce the level of low-value care and increase the level of high-value care [17]. To achieve this goal, first of all we need insights into in to the scope nursing interventions Citation: Giesen JH, Bakker-Jacobs Waal G (2021) Overview of Pain Interventions for Hospital and Community Care Nurses: a Systematic Scoping Review. Int J Nurs Health Care Res 4: 1265. DOI: 10.29011/2688-9501.1012653 V olume 4; Issue 10 Int J Nurs Health Care Res, an open access journal ISSN: 2688-9501that address pain. A systematic scoping review will guide this endeavour. Aims The aim of this systematic scoping review is to identify the scope of pain interventions carried out by nurses for adult patients in hospital and community care settings and asses their quality. Methods To identify pain interventions that are carried out by nurses we used a systematic scoping review as an approach. This approach is suitable to identify interventions in a broad field of evidence when the scope is not clear and helps researchers with inclusion criteria for full systematic reviews [19]. In addition we assessed the quality of the included to help research in prioritising interventions for further research. This systematic scoping review follows the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) for Scoping Reviews [20] and the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions [21]. In October 2019, we submitted a PROSPERO registration, ID CRD4202153093. This systemic scoping review was performed by the Improve! Project team, which includes five nursing scientists, an educational scientist and a researcher. Search Strategy We worked together with an experienced medical librarian to define a comprehensive systematic search strategy. This included both MeSH and free text terms related to nursing interventions focused on pain care, like 'pain management', 'pain measurement' and 'pain perception', in combination with 'nursing' and a special controlled trail filter; no additional added (Appendix S1). Medline, CINAHL, EMBASE, PsycINFO, Cochrane and Web of Science were searched up to November 2019. In addition, we checked the references of the included articles for additional studies. Eligibility Criteria Original research articles written in English or Dutch, published in peer journals in or after 2010 were eligible. We chose only to select studies published after 2010 to ensure inclusion of recent and up-to-date scientific nursing outcomes. According to the guidance of the Cochrane Effective Practice and Organization of Care group, studies were included if the data could be compared with a control or baseline measure, such as randomised controlled trials, controlled before-and-after studies or interrupted time series methods. In addition, the studies had to include interventions of a Western origin, be focused on pain care performed by a nurse and include adult patients >18 years. Finally, studies had to be conducted in a hospital or community care setting or contain an intervention transferable to these settings and executed in an Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development country. Studies involving women in labour or breastfeeding and/or Chinese, alternative or non-Western interventions were excluded. Screening Process All databases were searched separately in November 2019. All the resulting articles were imported to Endnote version X9.2. After removing duplicates automatically and by hand, Rayyan QCRI-a web and mobile app for systematic reviews (Mourad Ouzzani)-was used for independent title/abstract and full text screening with a team of four researchers. Studies were screened by a research couple and discrepancies were discussed until a consensus was reached; if needed, a couple consulted a third researcher. Data Extraction and Synthesis Using a structured format, the following data were extracted: author, year, country, study design, aim, participants, setting, study group, intervention, measurement scale and point and results. One research assistant extracted the data; one of the authors subsequently checked the extraction. Discrepancies were discussed until a consensus was reached, or a third team member was consulted. Quality Appraisal To give the reader an overview of the quality of the included studies we used the The Cochrane Risk of Bias (RoB) 2.0 tool [22], this was done independently by three researchers. Again, studies were assessed by a research couple and discrepancies were discussed until a consensus was reached or a third researcher was consulted. All assessment data were recorded in the RoB 2.0 Excel form and the algorithm function was used to determine the level of bias. In addition, a study was scored as high-quality when there was no risk found for the five bias assessment items. If at least one item had some concerns, the study was of moderate quality; when one or more items had some concerns, the study was scored as low quality [22]. ResultsDescription of the Included Studies The database searches resulted in 13,061 hits. After removing duplicates, the titles and abstracts of 5,697 papers were screened in Rayyan QCRI [23], in total, 227 full-text papers were screened for eligibility. Finally, 47 papers [24-68], met the inclusion criteria (Figure 1). No additional records were identified after checking the references of the included articles.Citation: Giesen JH, Bakker-Jacobs Waal G (2021) Overview of Pain Interventions for Hospital and Community Care Nurses: a Systematic Scoping Review.

The 47 included studies were performed in 14 different countries. Most studies were performed in Turkey (n = 14) [24 ,26,29,30,34,40,42,54,55,58,63,64,68,69], and the United States (n=12) [25,28,36,41,43,45,46,59,60,61,66,70]. In addition, four were performed in South Korea [29,37,49,50], four in Italy [27,31-33], two in Germany [53,56], two in France [48,52] and two in the United Kingdom [39,51]. Finally, countries where one study was performed were: Australia [38], Canada [35], Denmark [47], Greece [65], Finland [67], Norway [62] and Spain [44]. In total, 37 studies had a randomised controlled trial design [24,27-32,34,36-42,44,46-48,51,53-56,58-63, 65,66,68-70], of which two studies were pilot randomised controlled trials [32,56] and 10 studies used a quasi-experimental design [25,26,43,45,49,50,52,57,64,67], Most studies were performed in a hospital (n=39) [24,25, 70,69,26-41,44,47,52-60,63-68] or a specialised care centre (n=7) [36,45,46,48,51,61,62]; one study included patients from a hospital and community care centre [62]. In addition, one study was performed amongst nursing students of a university [42], but contained an intervention transferable to the hospital and community care setting and was therefore included. In 44 studies inpatients were involved, and in the remaining three studies outpatients were involved [45,62,69]. In total, there were >5,581 participants in the included studies, with a range from 17 to 497 per study. In one study exact number of participants was not reported [25]. The age of the participants approximately ranged from 19 to 78 years, four studies did not mention the range of age of the participants [25,26,41,43]. In addition, approximately 33.6% of the participants were male, 58.6% female and for 7.8% gender was not reported [25,26,41,43,50]. After data analysis, three pain intervention subgroups emerged: distraction (n=19), health education (n=13) and prevention (n=19). These subgroups were used to describe the study the results and quality scores (Table 1).

DOI: 10.29011/2688-9501.1012655 V olume 4; Issue 10 Int J Nurs Health Care Res, an open access journal ISSN: 2688-9501Results of Distraction Interventions The distraction intervention subgroup included 16 studies that tested 14 music interventions [31-33,36,38,46- 48,65,67,69,70], two virtual reality interventions [45,66] and three 'other' interventions, namely watching an DVD, distraction by an nurse and using a stress ball [51]. All studies were performed in a hospital or specialised treatment centre. In total, 1,452 participants were included with a range from 17 to 398 participants per study and an average age of 41 years (range 3-78 years). Music Interventions Music therapy as a distraction intervention included patients with fibromyalgia [69], patients receiving haemodialysis [31,32], patients with chronic pain [48], patients on mechanical ventilators [52], patients with obesity, patients who underwent abdominal surgery [46,65], patients who received a total knee arthroplasty [70], patients who underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy [47], patients with cancer undergoing chemotherapy [32], patients with cervical cancer [36], post-operative patients in the intensive care unit [38] and patients undergoing conscious surgery [51] (Table 2, Appendix 2). In 11 studies, an audio tape or music video was used with a duration varying between 20 and 30 minutes. Patients could select the music of choice in these studies. In seven studies, the patients listened to music after the procedure [25,36,46,48,65,67,70] with a variation of listening of one time or multiple times a day and at home. In three studies, music was listened to before/after and during the procedure [38,47,52] and in one study it was listened to only during surgery [51]. In six studies, there was a significant reduction in pain (p<0.05, 95% CI not reported) in the intervention group compared with the control group [36,46,48,52,65,69]. Allred, et al. [70], reported a significant effect in the intervention group, but not between groups. Cook, et al. [38] and Hutson et al. [51], found no effect. In addition, Vaajoki, et al. [67], showed only significant results on day two and Graverse, et al. [47], on day 7, although the intervention was performed on day one. Therefore, a confounder should be considered (Table 2, Appendix 2). In three studies, 15 minutes of live singing or saxophone music performed by the nurse was used [31-33]. Measurements were performed directly before and after the intervention that was preformed once a week. There was a significant reduction in the level of pain in the intervention group (p<0.05, 95% CI not reported) [31-33]. However, Burrai, et al. [32], did not find a significant effect between groups. In addition, in one study [31], there was a significant reduction in systolic blood pressure (p<0.001, 95% CI not reported) and diastolic blood pressure (p=0.045, 95% CI not reported) (Table 2, Appendix 2). Virtual Reality Interventions Two studies had a virtual reality intervention including patients with a hematologic disease [45] and patients with pain [66]. Patients wore virtual reality googles during the procedure [45] or for 15 minutes three times a day or as needed [66]. In both studies patients could choose a virtual reality programme they liked. There was significant pain reduction (p<0.04, 95% CI not reported) up to 72 hours post-intervention in hospitalised patients with pain [66]. However, Glennon, et al. [45] reported that patients who wore virtual reality googles during the procedure showed no significant decrease in pain experience (Table 2, Appendix 2). Other Distraction Interventions Hudson, et al. [51], evaluated patients with varicose veins listening to music, watching a DVD, interacting with nurses and using a stress ball during conscious surgery. Distraction by a nurse (p=0.022, 95% CI not reported) and using a stress ball (p=0.002, 95% CI not reported) reduced pain significantly compared with the control group. There was no effect found for listening to music (p=0.17) and watching a DVD (p=0.18, 95% CI not reported) (Table 2, Appendix 2). Results of Health Education Intervention Results This subgroup included 13 studies [25,34,39,44,46,49,50 ,53,54,56,57,62,64], of which seven tested a self-management intervention [39,46,49,50,53,56,62] and six provided educational information [25,34,44,54,57,64]. All studies were performed in a hospital or specialised medical centre. One study was also performed in a community care setting [62]. Studies included >1,943 patients, with an estimated range of 39-436 patients per study and an age range of 41-70 years, one study did not provide the exact numbers of participants [25]. Self-Management The studies focused on health education by stimulating self-management included patients undergoing knee replacement [39], abdominal [46] or gynaecological [49,50], surgery as well as patients with cancer [53,56,62]. The interventions focused on patient-directed self-management of pain [39], teaching for pain management [46], a structured educational programme on patient-Citation: Giesen Waal G (2021) Overview of Pain Interventions for Hospital and Community Care Nurses: a Systematic Scoping Review.

There was a significant effect of the intervention (p < 0.05, 95% CI not reported) reported in two studies focusing on patient-controlled analgesia [49,50] and the Pro-Self Pain Control Program [62]. In the other four studies, there was no significant effect [39,46,53,56] (Table 2, Appendix 2). Educational InformationThe studies focusing on health education by providing educational information included patients with various medical-surgical diagnoses [25], patients who underwent thoracotomy or pulmonary procedures [54], patients who underwent digestive cancer surgery [57], patients with lung cancer [34], women undergoing breast screening exams [44] and women who underwent mastectomy/breast conserving surgery [64]. Interventions used were a script-based communication intervention [25], patient education booklet [34], face-to-face information/emotional support [44], active patient participation in the management of daily nursing goals [57] and information about surgical pain and analgesics [64]. All six studies had a significant effect on pain (p<0.05, 95% CI not reported) (Table 2, Appendix 2). Results of Pain Prevention InterventionThis subgroup included 19 studies: four focused on using a numbing spray [27,28,41,43] three assessed a specific position to reduce pain [26,37,59] five examined the application of cold [29,35,40,55,60], one examined the application of warmth [30]; three evaluated a 'Buzzy' device [58,61,63] and one each focused on changing the needle [24], using a shot-blocker [42] and using a transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation device [68]. All studies were performed in a hospital or specialized centre and one study on a university. In total, 2186 participants were included with a range from 32-497 participants per study and an average age of 51.50 years (range 19-63 years). Numbing Sprays Of the studies focused on using a numbing spray to prevent pain during intravenous catheterisation [27,28,41-43], two reported a significant effect (p=.001, 95% CI not reported) [27] and (p<.001, 95% CI not reported) [28]. Edwards and Noah [41], found no difference in the pain levels of the intervention and control groups and Falitico and Rayn [43], actually found increased pain in the intervention group (p=.049, 95% CI not reported) (Table 2, Appendix 2). Specific Positioning A specific position to prevent pain was used in three studies [26,37,59]. The exaggerated lithotomy position, in which patients lie on their back with legs in the air to relieve pain after a laparoscopic cholecystectomy, had a significant effect (p.000, 95% CI not reported) [26]. Choi and Chang [37], found a significant increased incidence of backache due to a resting intervention in patients who underwent dural puncture (p=.007, 95% CI not reported), but no differences in the incidence of headaches. In addition, raising the head of the bed did not have a significant impact on pain or discomfort in patients subjected to angiography [59] (Table 2, Appendix 2). Application of Cold and Warmth Application of ice bags was used for patients subjected to femoral catheter removal [29], sternal incision pain [35], chest tube removal [40], chest tube incision [55] and spinal infusion [60]. In three out of the five studies, the application of cold reduced pain significantly (p<0.05, 95% CI not reported) [29,35,55], the other two studies reported no effect [40,60]. In one study, heat was used to reduce pain during catheter incision in patients receiving chemotherapy; pain reduction was significant (p=0.011, 95% CI not reported) [30] (Table 2, Appendix 2). Special Devices ('Buzzy') In these studies, a combination of cold and vibration delivered by a 'Buzzy' device was used by patients receiving an intramuscular injections [61,63] or intravenous catheterisation [58]. In all three studies, there was a significant reduction in pain (p<0.05, 95% CI not reported) [58,63] (Table 2, Appendix 2). Special Devices (Other) In trauma patients receiving intramuscular diclofenac sodium, the two-needle technique significantly reduced pain (p<0.001, 95% CI not reported) compared with not changing the needle [24]. In addition, in students receiving an intramuscular vaccination, a shot-blocker device, to prevent too deep of a needle puncture, no effect on pain prevention [42]. Finally, in patients who underwent inguinal herniorrhaphy, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation significantly reduced pain up to 24 hours (p<0.001, 95% CI not reported) Waal G (2021) Overview of Pain Interventions for Hospital and Community Care Nurses: a Systematic Scoping Review.

In addition, seven had high risk of bias on one or more items and were therefore scored low quality [36,38,45,65-67,69]. None of the studies was considered high quality because blinding to the distraction interventions was not possible (Table 3). Of the health education interventions, nine of the 13 were scored moderate quality [25,34,44,49,50,54,56,57,65] and four low quality [39,46,53,64]. Blinding patients for the health education interventions was also not possible, and therefore none of the studies were considered high quality (Table 3). For the pain prevention interventions, two of the 19 were considered high quality due to a low risk of bias on all assessment items [24,41], 11 were moderate quality [26-30,35,40,42,43,55,63] and six were low quality [37,58-61,68] Because blinding of patients was possible for some of the pain prevention interventions, a high-quality score in this intervention category was possible (Table 3).

In total, 47 studies were included from a comprehensive search through six databases up to December 2019; we also checked the references included studies. We were able to identify three main categories of nursing interventions: distraction interventions (like listening to music, using virtual reality, talking to a nurse, watching a DVD or squeezing a stress ball), health education interventions (like promoting self-management and providing educational information) and pain prevention interventions (using a numbing spray, placement of the patient in a specific position, applying cold or warmth, a 'Buzzy' device, the two-needle technique, a shot-blocker and a transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation device). For quality assessment, we used the RoB 2.0 [22]. The inability to blind patients and nurses from the intervention was a main problem in the assessment of the risk of bias. Comparison with Other Studies When comparing our results with other studies, we found that distraction reduces pain, which is caused by shifting a patient's attention to more pleasant stimuli. A combination of audio and visual distractions has a higher effect than audio distraction alone [71]. This supports the application of easy-to-use distraction interventions like listening to self-selected music, being immersed in virtual reality or having a conversation with a nurse in which the preferences of the patients should be considered. Another distraction intervention is live music performed by a nurse. Not all nurses can play an instrument - it is time consuming and does not fall within the scope of the nursing profession. These doubts need to be taken into consideration when researching and applying new interventions and attention needs to be given to the work context [72,73], especially considering that one of the main barriers found for implementing evidence-based nursing care is insufficient time on the job [74]. Ball [75], found that 86% of the surveyed nurses reported one or more important care activities left undone due to lack of time. In addition, we found two studies focusing on virtual reality. A recent systemic review on the effect of virtual reality on depression, anxiety, fatigue and pain showed that virtual reality can be an effective intervention for pain in adults and paediatric patients with burn injury and to reduce acute or chronic pain from medical procedures. Although the quality of the studies was not consistent, the patients found virtual reality to be a pleasant experience [76]. When comparing the health education interventions, self-management and providing educational information, we found a strong connection with the psychosocial and relational aspects of the Fundamental of Care Framework, like keeping the patient informed and involved and ensuring goals are set [77]. By using these aspects, nurses can keep the patient comfortable and pain free. This is an example of how the three dimensions are connected. Nevertheless, nurses in the hospital setting are mainly focused on tasks and not yet able to integrate the physical, relational and physical elements of care and promote personcentred fundamental care [78]. Studies on pain prevention like application of cold (cryotherapy) and warmth and a 'Buzzy' device have shown significant results on pain reduction and are easy-to-use interventions for nurses. In their narrative review, Garcia et al. [79], found that these procedures are beneficial for chronic pain and appear to be a safe therapy with minimal adverse effects. However, for application of a 'Buzzy' device by nurses, we found only additional evidence in research with children; this was the same for application of numbing sprays [80]. Limitations Some limitations should be taken into consideration when reading this systemic scoping review. First, almost all studies were performed in the hospital setting. In three studies, outpatients were involved and in only two studies in the health education category patients received an intervention after admission or at home. We did not find rigorous evidence for interventions in the community care setting. However, interventions like music, virtual reality, and distractions by a nurse, application of hot or cold and other special devices do not seem to be limited to the hospital setting and could be applied by community care nurses. The health education interventions are often more complex, and it is advisable to assess them for applicability in the community care setting. Second, the algorithm function was used to determine the Citation: Giesen Waal G (2021) Overview of Pain Interventions for Hospital and Community Care Nurses: a Systematic Scoping Review. Int J Nurs Health Care Res 4: 1265. DOI: 10.29011/2688-9501.10126513 V olume 4; Issue 10 Int J Nurs Health Care Res, an open access journal ISSN: 2688-9501risk of bias in the RoB 2.0 tool [22]. In total, 14 out of the 47 studies scored moderate quality because blinding patients was not possible due to the nature of the intervention. Therefore, using the RoB 2.0 tool may not be suitable for assessment of the quality of nursing studies. We chose to use the algorithm function for transparency, but this approach was perhaps too strict for our kind of research. Third, all studies presented limited statistical results, including almost no standard deviations or confidence intervals; hence, it is hard to determine the impact of effects. Fourth, this study was designed to identify nursing intervention in the area of pain. Therefore, we could not give a final answer whether the interventions should be valued as high- or low value care. However, we did identify interesting research areas and gave an overview of the quality of the studies that can be used as a basis for systematic reviews. In order to be able to identify all studies about pain interventions of interest of nurses, one should avoid the nursing filter in the search strategy. In addition, when a search strategy without a nursing filter is used special attention is required on applicability of the intervention in the nursing profession. Finally, we focused on Western medicine and excluded alternative medicine. Sandvik, et al. [81], found, in their scoping review on pain relief in patients in the intensive care unit, interventions like hypnosis, simple massage, spiritual care, passive exercise and acupuncture as non-pharmacological options for pain treatment. However, not all of these interventions fall within the scope of the nursing profession or they would require nurses to receive additional, extensive training. Areas for Further Research We identified the scope of pain interventions that are easy to use and can be carried out by nurses, like virtual reality, providing educational interventions and application of cold. To confirm their status as high- or low-value care more systematic reviews on the individual pain intervention topics are necessary. In addition, almost all studies were performed in a hospital. Although multiple interventions like application of cold or listening to music seem to be applicable in the community care setting or other areas, it is advisable to research the transferability of these pain interventions. Moreover, patient comfort and quality of life should be addressed. Conclusion In this systemic scoping review, we assessed 47 studies on nursing pain interventions, mostly performed in the hospital setting. We identified three main categories: distraction interventions, health education interventions and prevention interventions. These include interventions like listening to music, promoting self-management and application of hot and cold. The overall quality of pain interventions researched was moderate to low. We recommend systematic reviews in clusters of pain interventions that can be carried out by nurses, to determine their status as high or low value care. Relevance to Clinical Practice Identifying the scope of pain interventions executed by nurses for adult patients in hospital and community care settings gives insight in relevant research areas for the nursing profession. This systematic scoping review is the first step to help formulate evidence-based recommendations for nursing-sensitive outcomes and to assess their full value. References 1.
