What is Rapid Drug Detox & Ultra-Rapid Detox? Both treatments are medical procedures used to treat patients suffering from opioid addiction. The entire treatment process takes just a few days, hence the name. However, there are dangers associated with these procedures, and they have become a highly controversial form of treatment. The main perceived benefit of these methods is the speed at which they are completed. The anesthesia-assisted detoxification process means that the discomfort of withdrawal can largely be avoided. Rather than stretching out the opioid withdrawal process over weeks and months, rapid detox treatment programs promise to fast-forward a patient through withdrawal while under heavy sedation. How Does it Work? [Detoxification](https://anrclinic.com/drug-detox/) (detox for short) is the physiological, [natural](https://anrclinic.com/blog/natural-drug-detox/), or medicinal removal of toxic substances from a living organism, including the human body. Advanced Rapid Detoxification process is a procedure used to 'cleanse' a patient from opioids. However, this method of detox is outdated, often leading to more relapses than recoveries. A patient will usually undergo the procedure in a hospital, clinic, or intensive care unit. In anesthesia-assisted opioid detoxification, general anesthesia is used to sedate the patient, and the opioids are flushed out of their system, often using an opioid antagonist. Is It Safe? What Are the Risks? In short, no\u2014rapid opiate detox is not safe. Unfortunately, the opiate blocker Naltrexone, the drug used during the advanced rapid detox procedure, is often misused and administered at incorrect dosages by many rapid detoxification centers. As is often the case with the treatment, there is no regard for each patient's individual needs, medical history, opioid intake, or the brain's endorphin-receptor balance. The Rapid Detox process only manages withdrawal symptoms; it does not treat the actual root cause of drug addiction or drug abuse which can include psychological side effects. This can often cause adverse reactions. The lack of balance in the endorphin system leads to substance use disorders, which are as much a physical illness as they are behavioral health issue. This situation may even entail treating co-occurring ailments such as eating disorders or serious mental health illnesses. The National Institute on Drug Abuse also published [an article](https://archives.drugabuse.gov/news-events/nida-notes/2006/10/study-finds-withdrawal-no-easier-ultrarapid-opiate-detox) based on a research study, noting that \"Withdrawal No Easier With Ultrarapid Opiate Detox.\" Drugs Detoxification: Naloxone and [Naltrexone and Naloxone](https://anrclinic.com/blog/naloxone-vs-naltrexone/) are both used in the medication-assisted treatment of opioid disorders. They are opioid antagonists, which means they bind to opioid receptors in the brain and block the effects of opioids. While they are both very similar drugs, they are used for different purposes in patients addicted to opioids. Naltrexone is a drug normally used for the treatment of opioid use disorder (OUD). Naltrexone induction typically involves injection or can come in tablet form for the purpose of blocking the effects of opioids. Naltrexone maintenance therapy is used as a form of relapse prevention. Naloxone is an opioid antagonist used strictly to treat an opioid overdose and reverses the effects rapidly. Naloxone comes in injectable form, as well as a nasal spray. Also known as Narcan, this drug is the antidote for an opioid overdose. Rapid Detox VS ANR Today, we know that the rapid opiate detox process cannot correct the critical chemical imbalance present in the brain of someone who has abused opioids. Detoxification merely manages the secondary effects of drug addiction. While still promoted as an effective option for opiate addiction, this addiction treatment is outdated and is not nearly as effective as Accelerated Neuro-Regulation or [ANR](https://anrclinic.com/what-is-anr/). How Much Does Rapid Detox Cost? Rapid detox costs can start in the thousands and go as high as $24,000 USD. Drug addiction therapy, such as rapid detox programs or rehab programs, may be the single most important financial investment an individual will ever make. For what we now know to be a relatively risky treatment option with a chance of serious adverse events, it can be a high price to pay to undergo a rapid opiate detox procedure. Especially with no guarantee of long-term success. Advanced Neuro-Regulation treatment, however, eliminates the dependence with zero complications or side effects. Since the treatment revolves around rebalancing the endorphin-receptor system, our patients wake up with no cravings, as the neurobiological cause of cravings and dependency is resolved. How Much Does ANR Cost? ANR opioid addiction treatment costs $19,500, which includes: - A personalized procedure and treatment plan tailored to your medical history and needs - Pre-admission preparation appointments - In-patient hospitalization in a fully accredited and licensed health facility - Private room - 24/7 care and monitoring by expert medical staff - Follow-up appointments after discharge (optional) ANR is classified as an elective procedure, meaning it is a non-emergency service requiring scheduling and payment in advance. Neither federal health insurance programs, such as Medicare or Medicaid, nor commercial insurance companies currently cover the cost of the ANR opioid dependency treatment. Nonetheless, we believe that everyone, without exception, should have equal access to top-quality medical care, regardless of their financial situation or other individual factors. For this reason, we offer several [financing options](https://anrclinic.com/financing/) to anyone in need that can minimize the economic burden and help you cover the cost of treatment. Why We No Longer Do Rapid or Ultra-Rapid Detoxification [Dr. Waismann](https://anrclinic.com/dr-andre-waismann/), who developed RD 25 years ago, has since redefined the objectives and therapeutic goals of healing opiate dependency and has achieved unparalleled worldwide success with a different type of treatment: ANR. It's essential to understand what treatment methods are most effective in overcoming opioid addiction. 24,000 recoveries worldwide have shown that Accelerated Neuro-Regulation (ANR) works better than any other traditional methods for treating opioid use disorder, including traditional drug rehab and [home remedies](https://anrclinic.com/blog/home-remedies-for-opioid-withdrawal/). The History of UROD Treatment Programs In the 1990s, Dr. Andre Waismann redefined opioid dependency treatment and pioneered the RD and Ultra Rapid Opioid Detoxification treatments (UROD). Due to Dr. Waismann's success, these methods of dependency treatment became widely and quickly adopted, which led to facilities using accelerated detoxifications without enough knowledge or experience to perform it effectively and safely. It was a groundbreaking development at the time and can be credited for helping many individuals with their addiction. It paved the way for further research and development in the field of addiction and laid a foundation for far more advanced techniques and methods such as ANR. [Dr. Waismann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andre_Waismann) himself took a great level of care to perform his form of detox properly, while many other centers did not take the time to learn the necessary information to perform the procedure as safely and effectively as possible. Some RD clinics promote their services as having high levels of success, but they fail to mention the equally high amount of complications experienced. Rapid Detox Centers There are more than 80 rapid opioid detox clinics and anesthesia-assisted facilities around the world. Some treatment providers have even resorted to using Dr. Waismann's name and reputation to promote their addiction center. It is important to note that Dr. Andre Waismann is only associated with the ANR clinics around the world and no longer runs a rapid detox center. Dr. Waismann is the world's leading authority in the field of addiction and substance abuse treatment; ANR is the sole method for opiate dependence that he supports and performs. There are currently 5 ANR centers: [Arcadia, Florida](https://anrclinic.com/opiate-detox-florida/) - Thun, Switzerland - Tbilisi, Georgia - Ashkelon, Israel - Goi\u00e2nia, Brazil The field of addiction medicine is evolving, practice guidelines changing, and with new research comes new information. As a medical care professional who has dedicated his career to helping individuals overcome addiction, Dr. Waismann abandoned any practices involving RD nearly 20 years ago. His current practice revolves around ANR, a method proven to be extremely safe and effective \u2014 leading to thousands of patient recoveries. Relapse After a Treatment It is never recommended to stop opioids suddenly, especially if not under proper medical supervision. The brain is in a state of imbalance, and withdrawal symptoms will appear shortly after disrupting its new 'normal'. During active withdrawal, you will likely experience the following physical symptoms: - Elevated heart and respiration rates - Increased body temperature - Body chills and cold sweats - Nausea and vomiting - Diarrhea - Headache - Runny nose and watery eyes. You may also experience mental health disorders, with symptoms such as: - Depression and mental health problems - Insomnia - Anxiety - Anger - Trouble thinking clearly - Eating disorders The duration of all symptoms will depend on what type of drug was being abused and at what dosage. Take [heroin detox](https://anrclinic.com/heroin-withdrawal-detox//), for example. Rapid detox under sedation tries to 'wash' the heroin out of the body as quickly as possible. Sometimes general anesthesia is used to help the patient going through withdrawals, but this doesn't address the root of the problem causing drug cravings. Overcome Opiate Addiction Quickly Although anesthesia-assisted rapid detox is generally deemed unsafe, in large part due to the negligence of providers, it is clear why anyone would want to beat their addiction as fast as possible. ANR can be performed over a weekend and is an incredibly safe opioid treatment thanks to our access to modern ICU medical equipment, a highly qualified team of trained medical professionals, and a proven worldwide method that addresses the biological root cause of opiate dependence. Entering a 90-day or other long-term inpatient rehab program is not realistic for most people between family and work obligations. With ANR, it is possible to get back to living within days without fear of relapse or dangerous side effects. No other drug abuse or opiate addiction treatment can promise such results. Why is ANR a Better Choice? ANR relies on science-based medicine and 30 years of clinical and healthcare experience from Dr. Waismann, who identified the biological root cause of opioid dependency and addiction in the 1990s. While RD was considered a great feat at the time, Dr. Waismann's profound experience and further research have led him to denounce it for opioid addiction treatment and led to the development of ANR. ANR's greatest advantage is the ability to restore each person's endorphin-receptor balance in the brain on an individual level. Under heavy sedation, a patient's vital signs are closely monitored by staff and drugs are administered according to the individual's specific requirements. This scientific treatment protocol has allowed us to bring each patient we treat to an optimal chemical balance. Ultimately, individuals who receive the ANR treatment method can resume a life free of opioid dependence. As of today, ANR is the only treatment that addresses the root cause of opioid dependency. ANR proves that withdrawals and cravings can be physically reversed with modern medicine and individual endorphin-receptor evaluation. Out of Dr. Waismann's determination for better patient outcomes than what rapid detox could achieve, ANR was born. ANR has helped over 24,000 people overcome their dependence on opioid drugs. The [ANR Clinic](https://anrclinic.com/) remains committed to providing science-based research, education, and treatment to individuals battling opioid dependence or addiction, their families, and fellow medical professionals in the field of addiction treatment. If you have tried quitting opioids or have undergone RDq and you relapsed, please know it is not your fault. Opioid dependence is not a matter of character or willpower but that of a biological imbalance. ANR can restore not only the brain's balance but hope for a future free from drugs. Start your road to recovery today. People addicted to opioids are often looking for a quick solution to their addiction problem. RD or URD programs promise fast results with fewer withdrawal symptoms due to anesthesia. Now we know these methods are not safe, and there are better options available like ANR.
