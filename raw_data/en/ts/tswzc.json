It is our 'guardian', a defensive army that protects us against all kinds of external enemies: the immune system is a fundamental bulwark, and keeping it responsive and healthy is the basis for our daily well-being. Keeping it working properly is also essential to be able to detox the body of the waste that accumulates every day: so how to boost the immune system so that it works at its best? How to strengthen the immune system Many elements of our lifestyle can have a negative impact on our immune system, first of all stress; but through good habits you can do a lot to build a healthy immune system: - regular physical exercise helps to strengthen the immune system; - a healthy diet is also essential, without abusing alcohol and instead eating plenty of fruit and vegetables rich in valuable vitamins and micronutrients; - sleeping at least 7-8 hours every night is important, because nightly rest is the moment when detoxification of our organism takes place; - reducing stress, seeking moments of relaxation is essential, because being under pressure is among the first causes of the weakening of immune response. Improving lymphatic system, boosting the immune system, purifying the body: 3 benefits in 1 for staying healthy Strengthening immune response also means improving the way in which the lymphatic system works: the lymph flowing in the tissues and collecting waste, collected in lymphatic capillaries, flows towards the lymph nodes where it is awaited by the cells of the immune system, ready to intervene to cleanse and detox the body of any waste. The immune system and the lymphatic system are therefore closely connected and the proper functioning of one is necessary for the other, just as both are essential for cleansing the body and thus maintaining a good state of health. icoone is in fact the right choice to obtain all three results with a powerful anti-stress treatment, thanks to the immediate relaxing effect it gives: its innovative handpieces, equipped with microstimulators that can generate up to 21,600 microstimulations per minute, provide so-called Multi Micro Alveolar Stimulation, a unique and effective stimulation that mobilizes the skin and subcutaneous tissue down to the deepest layers, with countless positive effects: - the deep-down micro-massage stimulates the sympathetic nervous system, blood capillaries and lymphatic capillaries encouraging the drainage of liquids from the tissues; - improved lymphatic drainage enhances the effectiveness of the immune system in the lymph node stations; - the immune system booster helps to detoxify the entire body, cleansing it of wastes; - the relaxing effect combats the onset of stress, one of the greatest threats to the proper functioning of the immune system.
