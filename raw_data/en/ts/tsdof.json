Dr. Roby Taylor Myers, Owner & Lead Chiropractor at East Coast Elite Chiropractic-Sports Performance & Rehab I appreciate all the support over the last 2 years while setting up my new practice. I have had successful results with over 90-95% of my patients with disc injuries/ neck/ back pain in utilizing the DTS table as a stand alone treatment. I will be honest- it was a tough decision initially because of the financial investment/ commitment while I was starting practice. I am glad that I decided to integrate the DTS into my practice from the start because of the referrals and the wonderful response from my patients. Thanks again for all your help over the last 2 years and continued support. Dr. Michael Sobran Herbal & Nutritional Supplements FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS What supplements do chiropractors recommend? As healthcare practitioners, chiropractors often counsel their patients on proper nutrition to support their overall health. Chiropractors often suggest supplements that support [bone, joint, and muscle health](https://www.scriphessco.com/shop-by-department/nutritional-supplements/bone-and-joint-health/), such as vitamin D, calcium, magnesium, and [omega-3 fatty acids](https://www.scriphessco.com/shop-by-department/nutritional-supplements/essential-fatty-acids/). To help patients maximize their treatment efforts in the office, chiropractors also recommend supplements like turmeric or ginger to help reduce inflammation. Please note: individual supplement recommendations will vary and are dependent on each patient's medical history. What are considered herbal supplements? Herbal supplements are derived from plants and are touted for both their therapeutic and medicinal properties. Available in many forms - from pills and capsules to teas and tinctures - some of the most common herbal supplements include echinacea, ginseng, valerian root, and St. John's Wort. While [herbal supplements](https://www.scriphessco.com/shop-by-department/nutritional-supplements/dietary-supplements/) are marketed as remedies for a range of health issues and made from natural resources, it is important to note that they can still have adverse side effects and interactions with other medications. It is crucial to consult with a healthcare practitioner before incorporating any herbal supplement into your daily routine. What are most herbal supplements used for? Herbal supplements are increasingly popular treatments for everything from promoting general well-being and boosting energy levels to improving mental clarity and supporting digestion. Some of the most popular herbal supplements include echinacea, ginkgo biloba, garlic, turmeric, and ginger root. [Echinacea](https://www.scriphessco.com/products/vita-super-c-daily-immune-enerygy-chewables-60ct-827-0548/) is thought to strengthen the immune system and fight off infections while ginkgo biloba has been shown to enhance cognitive function and memory. Garlic is used to lower cholesterol levels and prevent heart disease, while [turmeric](https://www.scriphessco.com/products/douglas-laboratories-infla-guard/) and ginger root have anti-inflammatory properties that can help alleviate pain and reduce inflammation. It is essential to consult with a healthcare professional before taking herbal supplements, as some may interfere with prescription medication or cause adverse side effects. What is the difference between a dietary supplement and an herbal supplement? Dietary and herbal supplements are often confused with one another, but key differences set them apart. A [dietary supplement](https://www.scriphessco.com/shop-by-department/nutritional-supplements/dietary-supplements/) is taken to provide vitamins, minerals, or amino acids to the diet when simple food intake is insufficient. Dietary supplements consist of controlled amounts of active ingredients regulated by the Food and Drug Administration. Herbal supplements, however, are derived from plants and used as natural alternatives to common medical interventions. These supplements are not always regulated by the FDA and may contain ingredients unapproved by the conventional medical establishment. While both types of supplements have benefits, it's important to understand the potential risks associated with each variation. What is the most popular nutritional supplement? Hands down, multivitamins are the most popular nutritional supplement on the market. These dietary supplements combine vitamins and minerals essential for overall health and wellness in one convenient dose. While not intended to replace a healthy diet, multivitamins deliver the nutrients your body needs to function at optimal performance. Each multivitamin brand offers options for people with different nutritional needs, gender, and age. "}
