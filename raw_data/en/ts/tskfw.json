This technique works directly with the physical, emotional, and spiritual aspects of wellbeing. It can be used to help treat various conditions of the mind and body. The forms of energy therapy that we use are Reiki and Therapeutic Touch. Reiki Reiki is a form of energy therapy that means \"Spiritually guided life force energy.\" It is a \"laying on of hands\" form of energy healing - a healing technique based on the principle that the therapist can channel energy into the patient by means of touch, to activate the natural healing processes of the patient's body and restore physical and emotional well-being. A treatment feels like a wonderful glowing radiance that flows through and around you. Reiki treats the whole person including body, emotions, mind and spirit creating many beneficial effects that include relaxation and feelings of peace, security and wellbeing. During a Reiki session, energy is channeled through the practitioner into the client on all levels: physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual. Ultimately, the client will feel less stressed and more relaxed. Therapeutic Touch Therapeutic Touch (TT) is a method of healing based on the assumption that human beings are complex forms of energy, and the ability to enhance healing in another is possible. In this technique, hands are used to direct human energy for human purposes. There is usually no actual physical contact. The benefits are very similar to Reiki. TT is promoted by some to improve conditions such as pain, fever, swelling, infections, wounds, ulcers, thyroid problems, colic, burns, nausea, premenstrual syndrome, diarrhea, and headaches. It is also said to be useful in treating diseases such as measles, Alzheimer's disease, AIDS, asthma, autism, multiple sclerosis, stroke, comas, and cancer. In practice, TT is generally promoted as a complementary therapy, to be used with standard medical care. "}
