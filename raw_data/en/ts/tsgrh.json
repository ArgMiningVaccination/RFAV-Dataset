Vaccines can sometimes become our lone warriors and help us to provide with relevant precautions. Vaccines have enormous impact on our health and therefore some vaccines are given just after few months to childbirth in order to prevent them from health adversities. Vaccine preventable diseases can be serious and may require hospitalisation if things go down. Immunity and health can be effective tools against many adverse health disorders you may usually not know about. Today we are going to share some health diseases that can be prevented with the help of vaccines. How do Vaccines Prevent Diseases? We spoke to Dr. Sumeet Nigam, General Physician from Sahara Hospital, Lucknow to ask for his views on vaccine preventable diseases. He told that vaccines are actually [immunity boosters](https://www.onlymyhealth.com/black-walnuts-health-benefits-expert-tips-1642686496) that provide you with natural defences against the development of diseases. Usually the germs attack the bacteria and virus as they invade your body. Then they gradually increase and attack multiple locations because of which you fall ill and can even get hospitalised. Vaccines are given in diseases that are very severe and cause adverse implications if it is not prevented. Our body is able to nullify the affect of diseases or virus attack on the body by providing response similar to real infection due to vaccination. Children are at higher risk of catching majority of diseases. People may have minor symptoms after getting vaccinated but it can be beneficial for them on the long term. We have seen a big example of this in COVID-19, where vaccines were the only live saviours. Vaccine Preventable Diseases 1.
