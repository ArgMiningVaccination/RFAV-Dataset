How Addiction Weakens the Immune System Individuals struggling with substance abuse disorders suffer from myriads of side effects as a result of the massive consumption of substances. For instance, long-term drug use weakens your immune system. [Substance abusers](https://www.northernillinoisrecovery.com/substance-use-disorder-treatment/) may experience addiction-related severe problems, such as heart conditions, respiratory illnesses, cognitive problems, and liver diseases, among others. On the other hand, weakened immunity makes them vulnerable to recurring infections. Chronic abuse of [alcohol](https://www.northernillinoisrecovery.com/treatment/alcohol/) impairs the functioning of the liver and pancreas, which disrupts the immune system. Drinking has also been associated with body conditions such as pneumonia, which increases the chances of contracting viral related flu. At this time, when the world is trying to contain the COVID-19 virus, individuals should stay safe by avoiding the consumption of alcohol. [Marijuana](https://www.northernillinoisrecovery.com/marijuana-addiction-rehab-center/) is also another intoxicating drug whose main effects include harming an individual's immune system.
