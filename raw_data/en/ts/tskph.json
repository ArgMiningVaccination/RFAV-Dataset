A colleague asked me when I shared that I would be taking a detox break. I am not sure if there is a specific definition, but to keep it simple, to me \"detox\" is about giving your mind and gut some much-needed rest. But we do that every weekend don't we? Not really. It's like your vehicle, you don't drive it every day and it's 'resting' in the parking. Yet once in a year, if not more, you need to spend time and money in servicing it. That is what our mind and body need too. And just like our vehicles need the right treatment, place, and people around to do the servicing, so do we for our detox. \"I have been thinking of doing it too but am just not able to do it\". This was not just me saying it aloud but every second person I spoke about it reiterated the same thing. So, after having a great detox experience, sharing some things that worked for me: 1.The starting point was changing my place and routine. Just like at work you can't get different results by doing the same activities, how can your body and mind get the same? So, visiting a friend or a relative is not a detox? Or a holiday? It's like asking if a car wash is not servicing. You are constantly caught up in social requirements of engagement. That's a little time out and maybe good for your mind but it's a not a holistic investment. 2. We often say, \"it's all in the mind\". But there is a lot in the gut too! I was surprised to learn how much of our aches, pains, anxieties, concerns are related to our intestine and just giving it a little rest could do wonders. A five-minute acugraph (done for assessing energy alignments required for acupuncture) told me that headaches or pain in the legs was due to the stomach and intestine! It's not always our bones and muscles. Giving the gut rest means real rest through feeding it only simple liquids and surprisingly we can do it for multiple days. By the way if you missed it, its \"simple\" liquids, like lime juice, aloe vera juice, vegetable soups etc. Alcohol, tea, and coffee though very tempting liquids won't help the detox! 3. Food is such an integral part of the diet and routine. We talk about it, think about it all the time. How can one survive on lime juice and watermelon? Filling my time with activities helped me not to focus on what I was missing. Remember the need to change the place? It is important to select a place that has healthy distraction like a good view, walking area, healthy activities like yoga, spa, Zumba, chatting with people beyond TV and food. Reading is not always as distracting and can often take the mind back to food unless it's an engaging page turner. So physical engagements work better than lying on a swing or couch. 4. Staying away from phone calls and unwanted advice from others who weren't going through the detox is crucial. The last thing you want is someone pitifully asking you why you are doing this to yourself, sympathizing and making you sound like a victim. Remember our mind thinks that we like things that we do frequently and begins to long for it more. So, if we crib, play the victim, it will start engaging in it more and there goes your detox! 5.Taking time off for detox and not trying to do it while working or having a busy schedule is critical. You cannot give your mind rest if you are thinking of the call you need to join at 4 p.m. There is great power in nothingness as well for some time. 6. If you have any existing aches, injuries, or issues, working on them during your detox is critical. So, we now add one more word to what detox is, it is not only giving your mind and gut rest but also focus on healing. Some of the healing comes with rest but some may need extra intervention. Again, my learning of how much external heat and cold administration in the form of packs, compresses, saunas can cure vs medicines was exhilarating. However, this will be required under the supervision of a health professional. 7. While a lot of people don't enjoy the company of strangers, it's not a bad idea to try it during your detox. Instead of taking a group of family and friends along, try to be there by yourself. Speak with strangers without the pressure to make them your friends. It is delightful to see how much you can share with strangers and get off your mind when you don't feel evaluated or judged. We will talk more about this in a future article. 8. Paying attention to how you feel and sharing any discomfort immediately is important. Every person reacts differently to circumstances so prefer to be in an environment where health professionals are handy. Remember, detox is meant to relax you, not punish you. Push your boundaries but don't push yourself if it is beginning to get painful or exceeding your threshold. Don't go by what others say. You are the best judge for how much you can push yourself. As long as you feel good, you are getting the desired outcome of the detox! Occasionally invest your time, money, and energy in detox, it does wonders to your mind and body and surely got me off quite a few unwanted medicines! As it is said \" If you eat wrong, medicine is of no use. If you eat right, medicine is of no need\". Gift yourself the freedom from "}
