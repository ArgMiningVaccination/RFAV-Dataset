It is an integral part of Anthroposophical Medicine which was founded by Dr. Ita Wegman and the spiritual scientist Rudolf Steiner. Anthroposophical Medicine is a 'whole' Approach which expands upon conventional medicine and includes an anthropo- sophical view of the human being as Man of body, soul and spirit. A three fold being who as an individ- ual is always developing and who, between birth and death, illness and health takes part in world evo- lution. Out of the working together of the four bodies and their intimate and complicated relationship to the surrounding world of nature, the knowledge of illness arises, forming the basis for Anthroposophical Medicine. Through the study and understanding of human development, illness and healing, a rational and secure approach to therapy and medical practice arises. The basic elements of Eurythmy Therapy are to be found in speech and music. They are transformed into movement which is prescribed in a specific way in therapeutic practice. The 'forming forces' living in speech and music - vowels and consonants, rhythms and sounds whether expressed or heard are taken up in Eurythmy Therapy and modified for healing. Each movement stands in a specific relationship to the human being and Eurythmy Therapy helps to harmonize and regulate body, soul and spirit. It also helps balance and heal the inner organs of the body. The therapy is always based on a solid understanding and knowledge of the human being as seen in the light of anthroposophy. A medical doctor is present where possible in the therapeutic process. The aim is to re-enliven and regulate the natural functions of the human organism through specific movement exercises which help strengthen and heal. 2. Indications and Counter Indications in Eurythmy Therapy Eurythmy Therapy may be prescribed by a medical doctor for a wide range of illnesses and conditions: Acute or chronic conditions of the sense organs, the nervous system or rhythmic system, blood circula- tion, metabolic system, urogenital system or movement apparatus. It can also be prescribed for malfor- mations (teeth, bones, etc), developmental disturbances, psychosomatic and psychological conditions, e. g. personal crisis. It has proved helpful as a prophylactic and in convalescence and after care. 3. The Training and Curr iculum The Eurythmy Therapy training follows the basic four year eurythmy training and generally lasts two years. Both are based on the anthro posophical picture of the Man. Alongside artistic activities, great emphasis is laid on the students own motivation and understanding. A sense of responsibility, the abil- ity for self reflection is all part of the training process. Independent study and thematic project work is expected. Anatomy and physiology, already studied in the basic eurythmy training are deepened in the Eurythmy Therapy training. Educational goals and key qualifications are to be found in the appendix. 4. Training Centres All training centres are run independently and create their own curriculum which is the responsibility of the training course leaders. They ar e also responsible for the delivery of the curriculum, and the or- der and priority of subjects taught. Delegated training course leader s meet together regularly as pa rt of the Medical Section at the- Goetheanum, Dornach, Switzerland. They review the fundamental principles and further development of the training. Curriculum teaching methods and assessment criteria are agreed. The International Training Leaders Conference has representatives from all the training centres, fully established and recognized by the Medical Section, or new initiatives seeking recognition. The group has the task of keeping centres informed of new developments, criteria and conditions. They are also there to support initiatives in their striving for Medical Section recognition. This is usually possible within a year of ap- plying. The head of the Medical Section makes the final decision. Eurythmy Therapy Training: Framework Curriculum 5 5.
