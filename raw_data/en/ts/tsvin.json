It significantly impacts an individual's life; therefore, it is essential to acknowledge the effects of the disease on physical and mental health. Our systematic review aims to highlight the areas of life affected by cystic fibrosis and evaluate various non-medical treatment options that may support the mental health of CF patients. We selected PubMed, Google Scholar, and MEDLINE (Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online) as our databases. We initially found 146,095 articles and narrowed the number of articles down using filters, exclusion and inclusion criteria, and various combinations of Medical Subheadings (MeSH) and key terms. We decided to use a final count of nine articles for our systematic review. The studies we included highlighted the negative impact of cystic fibrosis on mental health, like depression and anxiety, as well as on sleep, physical health, and overall quality of life. Several non-medical interventions, such as logotherapy, psychological interventions, complementary and alternative medicine, and many more, have been shown to enhance the mental health of many participants. Studies suggested that such therapy options may greatly benefit individuals with cystic fibrosis and their current treatment plan. This review indicates that non-medical therapy options can enhance the mental health of individuals suffering from cystic fibrosis and that it is crucial to bring more attention to preventing and treating mental health issues in cystic fibrosis patients. However, as current data is limited, more research with a larger number of participants over an extended period of time is necessary to better evaluate the efficacy of non-medical interventions on mental health.", "sitename": "Cureus", "date": "2023-04-06", "cleaned_text": "On May 25, 2018, the GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) went into effect and changed how organizations deal with personal data of customers located in the EU.
