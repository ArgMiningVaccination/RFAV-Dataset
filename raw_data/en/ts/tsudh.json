In order to achieve this strategic goal while working to bring the pandemic to an end , OHA must meaningfully engage with communities most impacted and often left out of the decisions that affect their lives . In alignment with this commitment to eliminate health inequities while allocating potentially life -saving health resources , the goal o f the COVID -19 Vaccine Advisory Committee (VAC) is charged with co-creat ing a vaccine sequencing plan focused on health equity to ensure the needs of systemically affected populations, including communities of color, tribal communities and people with inte llectual and developmental disabilities , are met. Guiding Definitions, Frameworks and Values The Oregon Health Policy Board adopted the following definition of health equity in December 2019 that provides OHA its values to achieve its strategic goal: Oregon will have established a health system that creates health equity when all people can reac h their full health potential and well -being and are not disadvantaged by their race, ethnicity, language, disability, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, social class, intersections among these communities or identities, or other socially determi ned circumstances. Achieving health equity requires the ongoing collaboration of all regions and sectors of the state, including tribal governments to address: The equitable distribution or redistribution of resources and power; and Recognizing, reconcil ing and rectifying historical and contemporary injustices. The COVID -19 VAC will ensure that communit y voices and health equity are centered in discussions about vaccine sequencing . OHA will take history into account, and will honor and elevate community experience . 2 In order to create a COVID -19 vaccine sequencing plan that helps e liminate health inequities, OHA is asking the COVID -19 VAC to: Focus on equity : Center the voices of communities of color , tribal communities and people with intellectual, developmental and physical disabilities . Acknowledge systemic inequities : Illuminate the institutional, systemic and structural barriers that perpetuate inequity that have silenced the voices of communities over time. Address the root causes of inequities : Identify, examine, and challenge where power, privilege and racism lie in the past vaccine distribution systems and advise on a vaccination plan designed to eliminate health inequities. Partner meaningfully : Commit to partnership so that communities can actively participate in COVID -19 vaccine sequencing . OHA commits to: Co-creating vaccine sequencing with the COVID -19 VAC through transparent decision -making. Decisions made by others outside of OHA that impact COVID -19 vaccine sequencing and distribution will be clearly articulated, and the COVID -19 VAC will help determine how to communicate those decisions to communities and partners. Membership The COVID -19 VAC will have representation that includes but is not limited to : Organizations and community members who can speak to community health needs , such as: o Tribes , Native and indigenous people o Regional health equity coalitions o Communities disproportionately impacted by COVID -19 Hispanic/Latino /a/x Black/African American Pacific Islander 3 Asian People with disabilities (physical, intellectual and developmental) Migrant and seasonal farmworkers People over age 65 People experiencing homelessness Immigrant and refugee communities Justice -involved individuals People in congregate settings Partners engaged in vaccination delivery , such as: o Hospital s o EMS o Pharmacy o Local Public Health o Migrant Health o Federally Qualified Health Centers o Rural Health o Tribal Health o Long term care facilities Scope The COVID -19 VAC will co-create vaccine sequencing plan s for Phases 1b , 1c and 2, with the goal of ensuring that communities most impacted by COVID -19 are prioritized . These phases are described in general terms under the CDC Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP ) recommendations. Using OHA's definition of health equity, the COVID -19 VAC will: Advise OHA on the ethical principles that should guide decisions on sequencing of COVID -19 vaccines . Review data on COVID -19 and immunization inequities . Using the ethical principles , create the vaccine sequencing plan for Phase 1b, 1c and 2 . 4 Out of Scope The Oregon COVID -19 vaccine strategy include s some decisions and process es that may not be able to be changed. Other decisions will be under the purview of health systems and out of scope for the COVID -19 VAC. Vaccine doses will be allocated to states by the federal government and the number of doses O regon receives is not within the state's control. When OHA does not have decision - making ability, the COVID -19 VAC will receive transparent communication and will be engaged to shape external communications about COIVD -19 vaccine . Vaccine distribution and allocation decisions are out of the scope for the COVID - 19 VAC. Schedule COVID -19 VAC meetings will begin on January 7, 2021. Meetings will occur weekly until COVID -19 vaccine sequencing plans are completed in February 2021 . COVID -19 VAC meetings are open to the public and meeting materials, including emails, are subject to pub lic disclosure under Oregon Public Records Law. Resources The COVID -19 VAC will be facilitated by Nhu To -Haynes, NTH Consulting, LLC. The COVID -19 VAC will be staffed by members of the OHA Public Health Division and the COVID -19 Response and Recovery Unit . OHA will provide background information and resources, including, but not limited to: CDC ACIP Recommendations COVID -19 and immunization data ; other data available upon request General contact information 5 The COVID -19 VAC email address for meeting materials, questions and comments is covid.vaccineadvisory@dhsoha.state.or.us .

Oregon COVID -19 Vaccine Advisory Committee January 7, Oregon Health Authority's Equity Framework Background on mRNA vaccines and trials Allocation of COVID -19 vaccines Oregon's initial sequencing 2Centering community feedback \"Western medicine hasn't been created or studied around the lives of people from other cultures. Historicallyit's been very white, leaving out a lot of people from otherbackgrounds. How can the Latino community trust that thevaccine was created with appropriate consideration to theirlifestyles?\" -Listening session participant 3OHA health equity framework 4Centering equity Health equity must be at the center when considering the allocation of scarce critical resources in the face of a public health crisis. OHA defines health equity as follows: 5Health equity definition Oregon will have established a health system that creates health equity when all people can reach their full health potential and well -being and are not disadvantaged by their race, ethnicity, language, disability, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, social class, intersections among these communities or identities, or other socially determined circumstances. Achieving health equity requires the ongoing collaboration of all regions and sectors of the state, including tribal governments to address: -The equitable distribution or redistribution of resources and power ; and -Recognizing, reconciling and rectifying historical and contemporary injustices 6Draft equity focus for Vaccine Advisory Committee Focus on equity : Center the voices of communities of color, tribal communities and people with intellectual, developmental and physical disabilities. Acknowledge systemic inequities: Illuminate the institutional, systemic and structural barriers that perpetuate inequity that have silenced the voices of communities over time. Address the root causes of inequities: Identify, examine, and challenge where power, privilege and racism lie in the past vaccine distribution systems and advise on a vaccination plan designed to eliminate health inequities. Partner meaningfully : Commit to partnership so that communities can actively participate in COVID -19 vaccine sequencing. 7COVID-19 Vaccine in Vaccine: Phase 1a Phase 1a distribution is broadly defined at the federal level as including: Health care personnel Long Term Care Facility residents Oregon had flexibility to define who is included in phase 1a. OHA is working with various partners to finalize how we define health care personnel broadly for inclusion in this phase, as well as consideration of our diverse congregate care settings. OHA is continuing to center our focus on health equity as we work with our partners to consider our definition of recipients in phase 1a. 9Phase 1a Distribution Priorities Beyond defining the phase 1a group, OHA is working to make sure the following priorities are ensured during vaccine distribution: -Access to vaccine for those who want to be vaccinated in phase 1a -Informed consent takes place -Linguistically accessible and culturally responsive information is available about the COVID -19 vaccine 10Phase 1a Distribution Priorities These priorities are critical to be responsive to the diversity of people living in Oregon, and to mitigate historical and contemporary injustice and stigma of communities of color, tribal communities, people with disabilities, and longstanding mistrust of the system and distrust of vaccines. 11Phase 1a Distribution: Hospitals This includes: all hospital employees (clinical and non- clinical), contracted individuals, volunteers and students, and includes acute care psychiatric hospitals. This includes all health care professionals and all other employee or contracted staff types e.g., including but not limited to administrative, dietary service, and environmental service staff. Also included in this group: -Traditional Health Workers* who provide services in a hospital. -Health Care Interpreters who provide services in a hospital. *Includes Doulas, Peer Support, Wellness and Personal Health Navigators and Community Health Workers 12Other groups included within Phase 1a Group 2: Residential care and other congregate care settings Group 3: Day treatment facilities and outpatient facilities serving high risk groups Group 4: Public health, early learning, and death care sites 13Phase 1b Distribution Priorities 0-12 staff and educators 14Allocation of COVID -19 vaccines 15Federal Vaccine Allocation Process The first vaccines for prevention of COVID -19 in the United States were authorized for emergency use by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in December 2020. Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) provides advice to the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) regarding the use of vaccines. 1618 19 HCP: Healthcare provider LTCF: Long term care facilitiesProposed groups within Phases 1b and 1c 20 21Background on COVID- 19 vaccination mRNA vaccines, safety and side effects 22mRNA COVID-19 vaccines Your body naturally uses mRNA to send instructions when building proteins. mRNA technology is new in vaccine production but is already being used in cancer treatment. It has been studied for more than ten years. 23mRNA COVID -19 vaccines The COVID -19 mRNA vaccines give instructions to our cells to make a harmless piece that looks like the \"spike protein\" on the surface of the COVID -19 virus. 24Spike ProteinmRNA COVID-19 vaccines Our immune system sees these fake spike proteins and builds antibodies that recognize them. In the future our immune system will now recognize when the COVID -19 virus enters the body and can fight it. 25Vaccine Safety and Testing 26mRNA vaccines Pfizer 2 doses 21 days apart Vaccine efficacy = 95% 162 cases of symptomatic disease in placebo; 8 in vaccine group 10 cases of severe disease; 9 in placebo, 1 in vaccine Efficacy in those over 65 years old = 94% Requires ultra- cold transport 27mRNA vaccines Pfizer 2 doses 21 days apart Vaccine efficacy = 95% 162 cases of symptomatic disease in placebo; 8 in vaccine group 10 cases of severe disease; 9 in placebo, 1 in vaccine Efficacy in those over 65 years old = 94% Requires ultra- cold transport Moderna 2 doses 28 days apart Vaccine efficacy = 94.1% 185 cases of symptomatic disease in placebo; 11 in vaccine group 30 cases of severe COVID and 1 death, all in placebo group No difference in efficacy by age or ethnicity Normal freezer temp 28Who was included in the vaccine trials? Emergency Use Authorization Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) is a mechanism to facilitate the availability and use of medical countermeasures, including vaccines, during public health emergencies, such as the current COVID -19 pandemic. Under an EUA, FDA may allow the use of unapproved medical products, or unapproved uses of approved medical products in an emergency to diagnose, treat, or prevent serious or life- threatening diseases or conditions when certain statutory criteria have been met, including that there are no adequate, approved, and available alternatives. 30Restrictions on COVID -19 Vaccines with EUA Not authorized for use in children under age 16 Further studies and approval necessary before children can be vaccinated 31Are the COVID -19 Vaccines rigorously tested? Yes-over 70,000 people participated in trials. No skipped steps Both trials included a minimum of 8 weeks of follow -up for at least 50% of their participants by the time of EUA application Does NOT imply that the authorization was done too quickly or that the vaccine is not safe 32Safety evaluations Three independent advisory committees reviewed the results: 1.The Vaccine and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee (VRBPAC) that advises the FDA 2.The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) that advises the CDC 3.Western States Vaccine Safety Committee 33Side effects after vaccination Mild to moderate, more common after second dose Generally, more frequent and severe in those <55 -Systemic adverse reactions usually occur in 1- 2 days and usually last 24 hours -The most common: injection site reactions (84.1%) fatigue (62.9%) headache (55.1%) muscle pain (23.6%) fever (14.2%); 34Questions? 35COVID-19 Data Update and Influenza Vaccination Uptake Dean Sidelinger Health Officer and State Epidemiologist January 7, 20212Overview COVID- 19 data update, including racial and ethnic disparities One model for COVID vaccine uptake is adult influenza vaccination. Starts anew every season. Universal recommendation. Well developed OHA tracking/reporting systems. Almost half of adults get a flu shot each season. Disparities in adult influenza immunizations are also well known. Rates of adult influenza immunization are a lower bound for what to expect with COVID vaccination. How adults immunize themselves for influenza is a good indicator of how well immunized their children and families are for other vaccines too.Data Sharing We will be sharing data visuals.

Oregon's Black and Latinx populations are also younger than national averages. Adjusting for age, the gap in Latinx adult immunization is 17%, and for Black adults is 14%. 13Oregon Disparity Summary Influenza immunization disparities are not observed for other racial groups. Younger adult age and gender (male) are also associated with lower immunization rates. Immunization gaps for adult Latinx populations vary across Oregon counties (from 4% to 24%), but without a clear urban(15%) to rural(12%) divide. 14COVID Vaccination & Disparities OHA is currently planning to track COVID vaccination rates across populations by: Age Gender Race/Ethnicity County 15COVID Vaccination & Disparities Other planned measures include Vaccination by high- social vulnerability communities (CDC index definition) Use of non- local providers by Race/Ethnicity (measure of local access issues) COVID vaccination among adult populations with no prior immunization seeking Time and drop- off between first and second COVID vaccine doses by age, gender, and race/ethnicity. 16 "}
