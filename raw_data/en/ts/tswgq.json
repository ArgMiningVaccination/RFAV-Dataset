Regardless of its origins the purpose of this medicine is to address healing on the level of the soul and to reconnect us to who we really are. It can help us to reclaim a part of ourselves we may have lost, identify a trauma we may wish to release or even reveal a piece of ourselves yet to be discovered, an untapped part of our soul yearning for connection. Amy uses a variety of sound techniques in her Shamanic healings including voice, drumming and rattling. These instruments have been shown to encourage alpha wave production that both modulates and calms the brain assisting us to shape happier and healthier thought processes in the neo cortex; the brain of possibility. These techniques are combined with herbs, oils, visualization, meditation and ceremony tailored specific to each client. Amy loves to help clients to bring ceremony and ritual back into their lives. We have lived in ceremony for thousands of years but more recently as a people we have become somewhat disconnected and soul sickness is appearing more frequently. When important life-changing moments including the great or even more commonly the traumatic events go unacknowledged we can become discouraged, lost, haunted or disconnected and sick. Shamanic ceremony helps our limbic brain identify clearly and acknowledge the end of something and the dreaming in of a connection to something new and amazing. It is a pathway to honouring the evolution of our lives, not only what has passed but what is to come. Native American Shamans refer to this as walking the path of beauty. All sessions are one on one with Amy in a safe and relaxed environment. Healings take approximately two hours. "}
