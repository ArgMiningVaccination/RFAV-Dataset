I could not sleep, bend or cough with out extreme pain. The pain went from my low back to my leg. I was seen by Dr. Mike Rodriguez the same day I made an appointment. His front office was soooo helpful. They helped me contact my insurance carrier and get my claim number they made my appointments and Dr. Mike was the best...... He examined me, when over the findings of my injury and gave me a treatment plan. Within a couple of days my low back pain was almost gone and I have no pain down my leg at all. Two weeks ago I thought this was going to be a long affair. I am back to work and continuing to see Dr. Mike and his staff. I continue to get better and better. I would not hesitate sending anyone to Dr. Rodriguez's office..\"", "sitename": "Yelp", "date": "2019-10-03", "cleaned_text": "Energy Chiropractic Center [(26 reviews)](#reviews) [Chiropractors](/search?find_desc=Chiropractors&find_loc=Riverside%2C+CA) Photos & videos Review Highlights \" [Mike](/biz/energy-chiropractic-center-riverside?hrid=ZuVK5S2oAa1ux3PkrmjlZw&rh_ident=Mike&rh_type=people) for over ten years so when we got in a car accident we chose to undergo therapy at Energy Chiropractic.\" [ in 6 reviews](/biz/energy-chiropractic-center-riverside?hrid=ZuVK5S2oAa1ux3PkrmjlZw&rh_ident=Mike&rh_type=people) \" [Rodriguez](/biz/energy-chiropractic-center-riverside?hrid=uJoADpmcAx51IpFNaUNS-A&rh_ident=rodriguez&rh_type=phrase) and his staff are kind, polite and make the whole experience about you and your treatment.\" [ in 12 reviews](/biz/energy-chiropractic-center-riverside?hrid=uJoADpmcAx51IpFNaUNS-A&rh_ident=rodriguez&rh_type=phrase) \"All of his staff are super friendly and the office as a [whole](/biz/energy-chiropractic-center-riverside?hrid=2A1ulf32kqCgd7xsO2_Uhw&rh_ident=whole&rh_type=phrase) is very welcoming.\" [ in 2 Hours Mon Tue Wed Thu Fri |Closed now| Sat Sun Amenities and More Ask the Community Yelp users haven't asked any questions yet about Energy Chiropractic Center.

I seriously doubted that i would feel any better from the service. OMG was i wrong, Dr Rodriguez and his assistant was amazing. A few hours after the procedure my pain level went from a 7 to a 4 and i was able to walk a bit quicker. They are very thorough, professional and caring. Once I'm back to normal, i will be going back for adjustments periodically. Thank you, thank you thank you! Irene Jones - 12/10/2022 Dr Mike is the best and only person I trust for an adjustment. I have been coming to him since 2014 I believe and when ever I need an adjustment he makes it right. Super nice and caring. - 1/6/2022 I called to make a new patient appointment. The lady was very friendly, was able to give me a same day appointment. I sat in the waiting room for an hour and 20 minutes past my appointment time seeing other patients walk in and out. Needless to say I left, will not be returning. - 6/21/2021 I do warehouse manual labor. I haven't been to the chiropractor in 5 or 6 years because my original doc retired and the other 2 places didnt help much. After hurting my back at the gym and losing sleep and work i tried this place and had a great experience. The staff is professional and personable. For treatment i used and lying down massage chair that was great, icyhot massage and TINS unit and then a neck, thoracic and lumbar adjustment. Perfect chiropractor. - 2/11/2019 Definitely a place that knows what they're doing. Dr. Rodriguez was very patient with me and my pain lol. I've had my ankle pain for 5 months nobody was able to fix it till I came here my lower back pain I had for atleast 3 months we was able to fix my back on one adjustment I feel way better 1 out of 5 stars I give it 10 thank you Energy Chiropractic - 10/21/2018 Went in to see about a massage as my normal bi-weekly masseuse was busy, and would love a super close backup for emergency. I mean how cool would that be??!! Front desk people were rude and uninterested from the moment I walked in, dismissed me back out the door I came in from - without a break in their conversation. How dare I interrupt them!? Owner was pompous when initially opening to all close residents, yeah sorry I don't want your car mobile detailed in front of my house weekly with the noise and them blaring the radio and yelling on phones. Maybe I shouldn't be home during the day was the response. Maybe you should use your own damn parking lot that by the way NO ONE uses is my response. He did stop the weekly detail so yay one positive. Their clientele parks in front of me daily and they Currently have someone that works there that has someone pick them up daily. They park in front of my house for hours and let their kids out to play in my yard and they leave trash almost EVERDAY. 1-my neighborhood is not your parking lot, 2-my yard is not a park take them to one so I can have peace, teach your employees courtesy 3-stop leaving your trash everywhere nasty. Maybe before going home at night clean up the trash in the street and yards that your clients and employees leave?? Ive attempted to interact with blatant disinterest in return soooo zero stars should be an option. I even called to report an issue with vagrancy at night when hearing breaking of something which turned out to be their AC and Water how about a thank you? Nope I was disrupting them then too. UNawesome employees, UNawesome work ethic, UNawesome UNawesome UNawesome. Sucks too as I usually love lmy local businesses. - 1/7/2019 I was experiencing severe lower back pain and was grateful they were able to get me in the same day. The front desk staff was helpful and welcoming upon my arrival. I felt Dr. Rodriguez was very thorough during my visit, especially when discussing my symptoms in order to move forward with treatment. I could barely walk, let alone sit when I arrive and I left feeling alot better physically and satisfied with the service I received. - 4/5/2017 FANTASTIC! They got me in the same day and Dr. Rodriguez was professional and caring! He listened to me, he asked questions to make sure he had the whole picture before any treatment was done. Once that was completed he had some pre adjustment treatments done to relax the muscles. Andrew his assistant is friendly, nice and comforting when he performs the pre adjustment treatments. FINALLY the adjustments, they were painless and relieving, Dr. Rodriguez knows his stuff! I highly recommend and will now be a regular patient to help relieve my back pain. - 4/4/2019 Dr. Rodriguez, is a miracle worker! my husband hurt his back he could barely walk and within a week Dr. Rodriguez did his magic and he was all good. He is very caring, kind and explains everything to details. He's the best! - 8/8/2018 Beware people with private insurance this business will literally suck your insurance dry. I just went to this business for a regular checkup, just had my back adjusted and they billed my insurance an insane amount, such injustice to say the least be aware.
