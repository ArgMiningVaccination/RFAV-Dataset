My focus is therapy & medication. I am not convinced the short term therapy that is the fad today, is enough to deal with scars most of us have over our lifetime. In my opinion Psychodynamic Psychotherapy is the treatment. It takes time, it takes effort both on your & my side, and it produces results. With medication, my belief is the lowest dose and least number of medications, needed to make a person functional. I start low & adjust till desired results are achieved.

It has proven ineffective and has divided the practice of medicine into specialties, forgetting that the body functions in a constant state of homeostasis- all systems reliant on each other to function optimally. I believe that treating the underlying issue, down to the molecular basis, is what needs to be addressed in order to treat and eventually heal the disease. Unfortunately diseases have been categorized into separate entities when there is a common thread that is shared between them. My goal is to heal the mind & body as whole through integrative medicine.

(517) 901-7190 Lansing, MI 48911 & Online See more therapy options for Bloomfield Hills Transgender Psychiatrists As a gender-diverse individual, why might I want to see a therapist who is also gender diverse? A [trans or gender-diverse](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/transgender)client may want to see a therapist who is also trans or gender diverse because the client may feel safer sharing their experiences and more confident that the therapist will understand, validate, and support them. But trans or gender-diverse clients can also benefit from therapy with cisgender therapists; this is a personal decision based on the connection between the client and the therapist, and if that connection is strong, therapy will be successful. What if I cannot find a therapist who shares my gender identity? Therapy can still be effective if a therapist does not share a client's [gender identity](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/gender); a large body of research indicates that the most important factor in successful therapy is the therapeutic alliance. A therapist can also be interviewed for sensitivity and competence on gender identity and expression to ensure they possess appropriate knowledge and skills. Many therapists have excellent training and extensive experience working with gender-diverse clients, and that expertise can be invaluable despite a therapist not sharing the same firsthand experiences. How can I recognize a good therapist for working with gender-diverse clients? An experienced therapist should be able to help clients explore their gender identity and expression, alleviate discomfort related to their gender identity, treat mental health challenges and trauma, address existing relationships and communication with family members and loved ones, and determine the next steps pertaining to nonmedical or medical gender-affirming interventions. To recognize a good therapist, clients can ask about these topics and explore their comfort and connection with the clinician. How might I inquire about a therapist's experience working with transgender clients? Clients should feel comfortable asking therapists directly about their experience working with transgender or gender-diverse clientele. For example, clients may ask about the therapist's training and education with regard to gender identity, how many trans clients they've worked with in the past, and what sorts of matters were discussed. You may wish to inquire how a therapist specifically supports the needs of transgender clients or clients questioning their gender identity. A good clinician who is nonetheless not the right fit for you is often happy to make referrals to others based on the concerns you articulate in a preliminary conversation.
