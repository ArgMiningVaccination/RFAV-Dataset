That requirement is specified in section 202(e)(3) of the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974. The purpose of that provision is \"to help Congress use the early months of the year to adopt authorizing legisla- tion that must be in place before the regular appropria-tion bills can be considered.\" 1 The Role of Authorizations /G1E/G0B/G14/G0C/G13/G14/G10/G1F/G0C/G20 /G09/G0F/G13/G0B/G15/G10/G18/G21/G09/G13/G18/G15/G0E /G22/G0C/G18/G17/G0C/G0F/G17/G14/G1A/G0C/G13/G15/G0C/G1A/G14/G17/G0A/G10/G18/G23/G14/G0C/G13/G24/G15/G0C/G13/G11/G25/G14/G17/G0C/G15/G1B/G0C laws. One is an \"organic,\" or \"enabling,\" statute, which creates a federal agency, esta blishes a federal program, prescribes a federal function, or allows a particular federal obligation or expenditure within a program. That type of authorization may allow a federal agency, program, or function to continue indefinitely, or it may allow it to continue only for a specific period. Such an authorization may constitute a direct spending program because it provides the direct authority to draw money from the T reasury to implement the statute, or it may simply spec-ify a purpose for which a subsequent appropriation is made available. Although enabling statutes, particularly those whose implementation depends on fu ture appropriation action, are necessary for programs to operate, authorizations of that type are not the focus of this report. Instead, this report focuses on the second type of law described by the term \"authorization\": a specific provision that authorizes the appropriation of funds to carry out the program or function established in the enabling statute. Such a provi-sion constitutes guidance to the Congress regarding the amount of funding that will be necessary to implement the enabling statute. An authorization of appropriations may be contained in the enab ling statute or may be pro- vided separately. Such an authorization may set a specific dollar amount (definite authorization) or allow the appropriation of \"such sums as may be necessary\" (indefi- nite authorization) and may be permanent, multiyear, or annual. For the purposes of this report, an appropriation is considered unauthorized when it is made available for a program after that program's authorization of appropria-tions has expired. This report does not address appropria-tions that have never been authorized. House and Senate rules\u2014dating from the 19th cen- tury\u2014generally preclude the Congress from considering appropriations that are unauthorized. In both the House and the Senate, legislation containing unauthorized 1. H. Rept. 99-433, at 114 (1985) (Conference report accompany- ing the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985, which amended the Congressional Budget Act to include the requirement for this report).2 UNAUTHORIZED APPROPRIATIONS AND EXPIRING AUTHORIZATIONS /G01/G02 /G03appropriations is subject to a point of order.2 However, House and Senate rules are not self-enforcing. An indi- vidual Representative or Senator must raise a point of order for the rules to be enforced. If no Member raises a point of order, an unauthorized appropriation may pro- ceed through the legislative process. Although this report is intended to aid the Congress by identifying those authorizations of appropriations that have expired or will expire, it should not be considered definitive regarding the application of House or Senate rules. What constitutes an \"unauthorized appropriation\" under such rules is determined by the precedents of the House or Senate, and the applicability of those rules is determined by the respective Office of the Parliamentarian. Listings of Unauthorized Appropriations and process that at one time had an explicit authorization of appropriations that has since expired (see Appendix A) or will expire this year (see Appendix B). Each listing includes the number and name of the public law containing the last authorization, the last year that the authorization was in effect, and the amount (definite or indefinite) authorized in that year. In separate versions of this report, the listings of public laws in the appendixes are displayed in three ways-by House authorizing committee, by Senate authorizing commit- tee, and by appropriation subcommittee. The information in this report is drawn from CBO's Leg- islative Classification System, a database reflecting all public laws that contain nonp ermanent authorizations of appropriations\u2014up to and including laws enacted during the first session of the 111th Congress.In general, House and Senate rules require the appropria- tions committees, in their reports on general appropria-tion bills, to identify any programs that are funded in the bills but lack an authorization\u2014including programs for which an explicit authorization of appropriations has never been enacted. This CBO report, as specified by law, covers only programs that at one time had an explicit authorization that either has expired or is scheduled to expire. Many laws also establ ish programs with an autho- rization of appropriations that does not expire. The reports of the appropriations committees as well as this report exclude programs with that type of authorization because its effect is permanent. Programs Funded in Fiscal Year 2010 with Expired Authorizations fiscal year 2010 whose authorization of appropriations has expired. If the applicable 2010 appro- priation law or its legislative history provides an explicit amount of funding for a program, that amount is shown under \"Unauthorized FY 2010 Appropriations\" in that appendix. If no specific amount is provided (as in the case of a small program that is funded at an unidentified level in a large appropriation account, or a program that is funded in several appropri ation accounts), CBO deter- mines whether the program is still being funded and, if so, how much is allocated for it. If that amount cannot be determined, the listing notes that the specific dollar amount of the unauthorized 2010 appropriation is \"not available\"\u2014meaning that it is not specifically identifiable. The Congress has appropriated about $290 billion for fis- cal year 2010 for programs and activities whose authori-zations of appropriations have expired (see Tables 1, 2, and ). Large programs or agencies with expired authoriza- tions include the National Institutes of Health ($31 bil-lion), the Federal Bureau of Investigation ($8 billion), and the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Childr en ($7 billion). Many pro- grams originally authorized in the Violence Against Women and Department of Justice Reauthorization Act of 2005 (Public Law 109-162) and the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, 2003 (P .L. 107-228) have been 2. A point of order is an objection raised by a Member of Congress against a piece of legislation or a procedure on the grounds that it violates the rules of the House or Senate. The Presiding Officer decides whether to sustain or overrule the point of order on the basis of the specific rule and precedents under it. The decision of the Presiding Officer is subject to appeal to the full House or Sen- ate, where it can be waived, generally by a and $22 billion, respectively).3 /G01/G02/G03/G04/G05/G06/G07/G08/G09/G03/G07/G05/G0A/G0B/G0C/G05/G0D/G0C/G01/G0E/G0E/G06/G05/G0E/G06/G07/G09/G03/G07/G05/G0A/G0B/G0C That Expire on the end of fiscal year 2010. (Appendix B shows the amounts authorized to be appro-priated in 2010 for the expiring programs and activities, not the amounts actually appropriated for that year.) Definite authorizations (specifically, those contained in laws under the jurisdiction of House and Senate authoriz- ing committees) that will expire by the end of this fiscal year total about $733 billion (see Tables 4, 5, and 6). Most of that amount, about $680 billion, is authorized in a single law, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2010 (P .L. 111-84). Typically, authorizations for defense funding are renewed annually. In contrast, the 2010 authorization for intelligence activi- ties has not yet been enacted. In the interim, lawmakers have enacted section 8079 of the Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2010 (division A of P .L. 111-118), which deems as authorized its appropriations for intelli- gence activities until the specific authorization for those activities is enacted. Some of the larger definite authorizations for programs that are expiring at the end of 2010 include the America Competes Act (P .L. 110-69, with authorizations of $15 billion), the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 - Aca- demic Competitiveness Grants (P .L. 109-171, with an authorization of $1 billion), and several provisions of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (P .L. 110-140, with authorizations of $1 billion). In addition, during the first few months of fiscal year 2010, lawmakers enacted temporary authorizations that will expire during fiscal year 2010. Those authorizations are for the Federal Aviation Administration (through March 31, 2010), for surface transportation programs (through February 28, 2010), and for the Small Business Administration (through January 31, 2010). 3. Several laws enacted in fiscal year 2009 and the early part of 2010 contained reauthorizations for agencies or programs with annual appropriations. They include the Serve America Act (through 2014), the Ryan White HIV/AIDS T reatment Extension Act of 2009 (through 2013), and the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2010 Source: Congressional Budget Office.
