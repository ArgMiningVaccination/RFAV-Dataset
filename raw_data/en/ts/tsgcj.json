Acupuncture is thought to be used as a method to relieve pain and it can be used to help combat infertility. There are certain conditions that affect fertility and acupuncture can help promote relaxation and increase your chances of fertility. It's not a program that is completely guaranteed to work, but it's worth trying to see if it could help you! Treating Infertility with Acupuncture It's recommended that you start acupuncture about three months before you start treatments like in vitro fertilization, also known as IVF. You can also use acupuncture along with other fertility therapies to try and improve your chances of conceiving. When you first visit your acupuncturist for treatment, you can expect them to ask questions about your lifestyle and what fertility concerns you may have. The actual acupuncture session can last anywhere from 30 minutes to an hour and will vary for each person. You should expect to get these treatments anywhere from 1 to 3 times a week. Acupuncture has very little pain and you may experience a mild, dull ache. It's important that you tell your acupuncturist if you're taking aspirin or any other medication that may thin your blood. You should also expect to rest after an appointment so that you can continue with the relaxation you'll experience during the session. Acupuncture can also help relieve some of the symptoms that are associated with fertility treatments such as bloating and nausea. This can help you feel more comfortable and continue a relaxed state of mind. Contact Your "}
