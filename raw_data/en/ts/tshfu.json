Sophrology blends Western and Eastern traditions from a fusion of [yoga](/a-z/yoga), [meditation](/a-z/meditation), and Zen. In the practise of sophrology, people combine techniques such as [mindfulness](/a-z/mindfulness), [breathing](/information-support/exercise-ms/build-your-own-exercise-routine/breathing-exercises), meditation, body awareness, gentle movements, [visualisation](/a-z/visualisation-guided-imagery), and hypnosis. Although research into sophrology is developing, people have anecdotally reported benefits of calmness, management of anxiety and stress, pain management and increased focus. My name is Audrey Zannese, I'm French but have made England my home since 2005. I was [diagnosed](/information-support/newly-diagnosed) with MS in 2006 whilst doing my PhD and I was recommended a mind-body practice called sophrology by a French neurologist when I started treatment. From this point onwards, MS gave me a more purposeful and meaningful life. My journey started in Toulouse, South-West France, in 2004 after my Masters exams. After examination and being given [steroids](/a-z/steroids-methylprednisolone) intravenously, the doctors concluded it was [optic neuritis](/a-z/optic-neuritis) and, contrary to many people with MS who wait years for a diagnosis, MS was mentioned to me as a possible cause at that time. But, I wouldn't hear about it and just put it down to [stress](/a-z/stress) and lack of [sleep](/information-support/wellbeing-ms/sleep) during my exams. Unfortunately, it happened again, although to a lesser degree, so I went for tests and my MS diagnosis was confirmed. At the time, I was already doing a PhD in Biological Sciences in England. I felt lonely and ashamed. In fact, I only shared the dreadful news with a handful of people. When I started treatment, I decided to return to France for a few weeks to be surrounded by my family. I was given [Avonex injections](/a-z/avonex-interferon-beta-1a) and was really scared of the side effects. Sophrology is a mind-body practice that's very popular in France. To me, a trained scientist with a logical mind and no experience or interest in meditation or [complementary therapies](/a-z/complementary-and-alternative-medicine), it seemed a crazy suggestion. However, I was in such a bad place when he recommended it that I decided to give it a try. If it hadn't come from a doctor, I would've never tried. I saw a sophrologist and I engaged with the practice to see where it would lead me. To cut a long story short, it completely transformed my life. The exercises were very accessible and easily incorporated into my daily life. I quickly became autonomous with them. I wasn't afraid of the next [relapse](/information-support/ms-symptoms-diagnosis/managing-ms-relapses) anymore. I was confident I had everything in me to deal with any challenge and I was finally capable of enjoying my life and being happy. Not only did I complete my PhD, but I also completed three years of post-doctoral research. However, sophrology was such an important part of my daily well-being that I wanted to make it an integral part of my life. At 34, I changed career and trained as a sophrology practitioner. I've since founded 'Step Into Sophrology'. Through my organisation, my aim is to help other women living with chronic illness, pain, and fatigue to help to manage their symptoms using sophrology. Sophrology changed my life and I implore the MS community to give it go.
