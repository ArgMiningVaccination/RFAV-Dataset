The dysfunction rooted deep in these experiences can lead to other health and relationship issues if not addressed. Because all these issues build on top of each other, it can feel too big to handle. It may also be hard to find a practitioner who completely understands. Hope is not lost! This is where I can help. My holistic approach with Acupuncture, Chinese Medicine, Ahai 7D Energy & Shamanic Healing, and other natural modalities will support you on the level you're ready for. If you have these symptoms, chances are there is a deeper energetic/emotional/spiritual root to be resolved: Chronic gut health issues, nervous system imbalance, and lowered immunity from stress Overwhelm that has you stuck and confused in life Coping with food, alcohol, and other addictions Poor body image and self worth Inability to prioritize your needs over family, work, etc. Having a negative, hopeless, or cynical mindset Difficulty moving through grief and loss Identity crisis with life transitions Low self confidence and mistrusting your judgement Dependent on doctors & authority figures for advice Ready to release the obstacles to your joy, step into an empowered state of wellbeing and truly heal? - \"Brandy has been an invaluable resource for a medical issue that my doctor was little to no help with... She's thorough with diet suggestions (this greatly impacted my issue), supplying herbs, tinctures, and other important suggestions and information. Brandy is personable and very knowledgeable. I would recommend her to my friends and family!\" Ashley Pitcher - Doula & Mom of 3 Access A HUGE Toolkit In Our Holistic Work Together I have been in the wellness world for over 20 years. I combine my many modalities such as Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), Distance Energy and Shamanic Healing, Yoga, and more to help you heal on every level. About Brandy Falcon I'm Brandy Falcon, and I've been helping women and their families heal on every level for over 2 decades. My clients call me a Modern Medicine Woman because I marry Traditional Chinese Medicine, Shamanic Healing, and Lightwork with my strong science background. What I find is that most women can only get so far with conventional therapies that don't address the root cause of their issues. Sometimes these relationships and medicines can make you feel dependent and less confident. You may feel frustrated, unheard, and overlooked. What you really want is to become self-reliant and find deeper meaning in your life as you heal. I can guide you on a wellness journey that helps you experience freedom and joy. "}
