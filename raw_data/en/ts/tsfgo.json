She is also a lovely, caring, sweet, positive lady that I always love to see! She's wonderful! - 1/18/2023 I saw Dr. Crystal for an initial consult. The appointment was easy to schedule over the phone. I was able to schedule to see her within a week - this has been imposible with other providers in the community. Dr. Crystal's receptionist was very friendly over the phone and in person. Dr. Crystal explained her services clearly, was very forthcoming, and overall nice. She answered all my questions and gave me simple and useful recommendations of exercises I can do to prevent pain and injuries. I will definitely keep coming to see her. - 12/12/2018 Dr Crystal has been taken care of my son (5yo) and me since he's 3. She's awesome with children and has helped me with my scoliosis and lordosis ever since. I can walk in and be sure that I'll be out pain free. - 8/12/2019 Dr. Crystal and her staff are kind, knowledgeable and attentive. Dr. Crystal is full of energy and always makes me feel so comfortable and at ease when I come in for an adjustment. She is also able to take walk-ins which is great. I love knowing that I can stop by anytime. - 2/28/2018 I LOVE LOVE LOVE Dr. Crystal. Have been going to her for almost 2 yrs. and haven't been satisfied with 4 other chiropractors -- so I drive 90 minutes to continue my appointments with her. I LOVE that her kids can occasionally be found passing through the office. She's so down to earth and also the only female Chiroporactor I know with 3 kids - so her expertise with adjusting this momma's sore maternity back is truly exceptional and well qualified. I have even trusted her to adjust my baby's spine shortly after birth, wanting my baby to checked for any undetected birth trauma and quite simply for his maximum comfort in life. I trust this Dr. with my health, my family's health, and would HIGHLY recommend her to anyone looking for the BEST chiropractor in the area. If you want a family-oriented Dr. this is the place to go, hands down! - 10/1/2018 Dr Crystal gave me another great adjustment. She knows how to take care of all my ailments! - 8/28/2018 It is such a pleasure to find an engaging, personable, and professional practitioner. Dr. Crystal is all of these and more. I feel better, stronger, and maybe a little faster! Her adjustments are firm but not jarring, her skill is apparent when, without me telling her where I feel discomfort, she finds it with her capable hands and manipulates my body into a more balanced state. Thank you so much! - 8/24/2018 I am a believer. I've always wanted to go to a chiropractor but my mom always was like \"Nah\", okay now that I'm 30 with a 5 year old I feel like I'm in the body of a 50 year old! I went to crystal not knowing what to expect and was thrown off because she seemed more like a friend rather than a medical professional. Wellll fast forward a month and I must say I feel so much better! She's great and she knows what she is doing. I have pretty bad posture and because of that I had a small little \"bump\" in my neck. I attribute that to sitting at a computer chatting with my friends on aol instant messenger for HOURS in the early 2000s ;) well, that's gone now! Is she magic?!? I go weekly for adjustments right now and it's my favorite part of the day. I look forward to coming in. I've never had to wait more than 10 min (usually no wait at all) to see her. I self pay, and it's totally doable. I will continue to go to her as long as I need! - 5/22/2018 If you are looking for a great chiropractor, look no further. Dr. Crystal is very experienced and knowledgeable in the field of chiropractic. You will definitely feel at ease in her hands and you will definitely feel even more at ease after your adjustments. I have gone to another chiropractor in the past who did not adjust me as well as Dr. Crystal did. To think of it, I truly do not know anyone that is not pleased with her work. She is truly amongst the best. Also helps that she is very nice and friendly! - 12/17/2015 Dr. Crystal is a true miracle worker. I have struggled with aches and pains for years, I have only recently considered chiropractic therapy and I am sold! Crystal spends time with you, educates her patients. She offers awesome mini seminars and a newsletter to help you learn about your body and how to take the best care of it possible. Crystal Chiropractic is the best in town, hands down!!
