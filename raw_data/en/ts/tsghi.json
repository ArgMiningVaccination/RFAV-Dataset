LONDON \u2014 Post-Brexit Britain is leading the Continent's vaccination race and has some lessons to offer. With the rushed implementation of the Brexit trade deal causing [bureaucratic chaos](https://www.politico.eu/article/supermarket-pleas-mount-as-brexit-leaves-ni-shelves-bare/) and [confusion](https://www.politico.eu/?p=1573962) for [many sectors](https://www.politico.eu/article/5-ways-brexit-got-real/) and a highly transmissible strain of the coronavirus ripping through the country, Boris Johnson's government desperately needs a good story to tell. And while the vaccine rollout has been far from perfect, the U.K. is so far beating its former EU partners hands down. The country has administered over 3 million doses to people across the U.K. since it began vaccinating against the coronavirus [in early December](https://www.politico.eu/article/first-person-in-the-world-receives-pfizer-biontech-coronavirus-vaccine/), with more than [415,000 people in England](https://www.england.nhs.uk/statistics/statistical-work-areas/covid-19-vaccinations/) having already received both shots required for maximum protection. In pure scale, the second placed European country, Italy, is miles behind, with around 900,000 jabs. And the U.K.'s per population figure of 4.5 injections per 100 people \u2014 though well behind [world-leader Israel](https://www.politico.eu/article/israel-coronavirus-vaccine-success-secret/) on [24 jabs per 100 people](https://www.politico.eu/article/coronavirus-vaccination-europe-by-the-numbers/) \u2014 is double that of Denmark, Europe's runner up on that metric. After the U.K., just [eight countries](https://www.politico.eu/article/coronavirus-vaccination-europe-by-the-numbers/) among the EU27 have an inoculation rate of one per 100 people or more. You may like These are some of the reasons behind Britain's rapid vaccine rollout. Early regulatory approval The U.K.'s first advantage was in getting going early. The country's drugs regulator, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), was the first in Europe to approve the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, [back on December 2](https://www.politico.eu/?p=1537456) \u2014 weeks ahead of the European Medicines Agency. This opened the door to nearly 1 million doses of that jab \u2014 [manufactured in Belgium](https://www.politico.eu/?p=1519388) \u2014 being delivered to the U.K. by the second week of December. Since then, the MHRA has also authorized [the vaccine developed by the University of Oxford and AstraZeneca](https://www.politico.eu/?p=1562534), and a [third by U.S. drugmaker Moderna](https://www.politico.eu/?p=1569446) (though that was [two days behind the EU](https://www.politico.eu/article/eu-regulator-green-lights-moderna-coronavirus-vaccine-for-use/)). These prompt decisions were possible because the U.K. [changed national medicine regulations](https://www.politico.eu/?p=1442793) in the fall to enable the MHRA to give temporary authorization to a vaccine that meets safety and efficacy standards but has yet to finish the licensing process. This mechanism was available to all EU countries, but they opted for a more rigorous licensing procedure in which the companies, rather than taxpayers, accept liability if there are problems. With the end of the Brexit transition period just weeks away, the U.K. would have felt little political pressure to sign up to the EU's commitment to roll out vaccines to all countries at the same time. Operating outside the EMA process, even though it was vastly accelerated, meant avoiding the [inevitable extra bureaucracy](https://www.politico.eu/article/pressure-mounts-on-eu-regulator-to-approve-coronavirus-vaccine-quickly/) of working with 27 other countries. Other factors helped: Not only is the MHRA internationally known for its extensive experience in approving vaccines, but its staff was largely freed up because it didn't have to take part in any EU-level drug assessments due to Brexit. The EU, meanwhile, has yet to approve the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine. Early deals and production capacity Kate Bingham, chief of the government's Vaccines Taskforce between May and December, held early conversations with vaccine producers, getting ahead of the EU in the first weeks of the vaccination race. By mid-August, Britain had [signed in-principle agreements](https://www.politico.eu/?p=1434114) securing four types Pfizer/BioNtech, Valneva, GSK/Sanofi, Novavax and Johnson & Johnson's Janssen. This might have been helped by long-standing relationships between Bingham's team and the pharma sector \u2014 a closeness that has nonetheless been criticized. Suspicion lingers that the U.K. was [quicker than the EU](https://www.politico.eu/?p=1420368) in securing deals for some, though not all, of the vaccines because Brussels fought much harder to shift liability clauses in the contracts from taxpayers to the companies. On price, too, the U.K., as a much smaller market, will have struggled to secure as favorable a deal. How much less favorable will remain unclear, however, as the details of the deals with the manufacturers are not public. Then there is production. AstraZeneca officials said Wednesday that they're scaling up manufacturing of their vaccine very quickly and are on track to be able to release 2 million doses a week by the end of March. This vaccine is being manufactured in Britain, and the effort has been aided by an [18-month agreement](https://www.wockhardt.co.uk/about-wockhardt/wockhardt-news/wockhardt-announces-covid-19-vaccine-partnership-with-uk-government.aspx) between the government and generic drugmaker Wockhardt, signed in August, to fill the vials and package up to 100 million doses for use in the U.K., at a north Wales manufacturing facility, in the coming months. The U.K. is also developing new clinical trial capability to accelerate vaccine development using human challenge studies, where young healthy volunteers will receive the vaccine prior to being infected with the virus \u2014 an approach used to fight other diseases, including typhoid and flu. Clear targets In its [vaccines delivery plan](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/951284/UK_COVID-19_vaccines_delivery_plan.pdf), published on Monday, the government set itself a target to vaccinate 14 million people by mid-February. In this first phase, efforts are focused on the priority groups identified by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI): care home residents and their carers; frontline health and social care workers; people aged 70 or over and clinically extremely vulnerable individuals. According to the JCVI, these groups account for 88 percent of the U.K.'s coronavirus deaths. In contrast, the European Commission produces recommendations for which groups to vaccinate first, but EU countries are free to go their own way. Priority to first dose The British government made a [decision in late December](https://www.politico.eu/article/uk-decision-to-prioritize-first-coronavirus-vaccine-shots-will-save-lives-say-experts/) to prioritize the administration of the first dose of the vaccine, upon the recommendation of the JCVI. In contrast to the EU's more cautious approach, the plan is to give as many people in the at-risk groups their first dose, rather than providing the required two doses in as short a time as possible. However, everyone will still receive their second dose, and this should be within 12 weeks of their first. The clinical logic is that one dose provides a substantial degree of protection while allowing scarce vaccine resources to be rolled out to more vulnerable people quickly. But the decision has raised eyebrows in the EU, with some scientists questioning whether such a big gap could reduce effectiveness, since the two doses were given 28 days apart during clinical trials. Only Denmark is taking a similar approach so far in the EU, but others, including [Germany, are considering whether to follow suit](https://www.politico.eu/?p=1564346). User-friendly appointment system Booking an appointment with the U.K.'s National Health Service (NHS) for a jab is an easy process that can be made online or via telephone, without the need for a GP consultation. Hundreds of thousands of people in the four priority groups have received letters inviting them to make appointments. By comparison, individuals in France must see their GPs five days before getting the jab and [give their written consent](https://solidarites-sante.gouv.fr/IMG/pdf/guide_vaccination_contre_la_covid_ehpad_-_usld.pdf) after being informed of potential contra-indications. The procedure is intended to prevent adverse reactions that could cause deaths, but has been blamed for France's slow take-up. French Health Minister Olivier V\u00e9ran said the country's slowness is a deliberate policy intended to allow time for an information campaign against vaccine skepticism. The French government is also set to launch [Thursday](https://www.connexionfrance.com/French-news/France-Covid-19-Online-vaccine-reservations-open-this-week-for-75s-and-over) an online platform and telephone hotlines for booking vaccination slots. Elsewhere in the EU, regionalized health systems have led to complications, and in Germany, [technical issues with online booking](https://www.politico.eu/article/coronavirus-story-kiel/) have prevented some people from getting a jab. Large vaccination network The U.K. government has committed to ensuring that every person has a vaccination center within 10 miles of their home. The network in England includes seven mass vaccination centers, with dozens more opening in the coming weeks. These are located in large venues, such as the ExCel conference center in east London, Bristol City's Ashton Gate stadium and Manchester's Etihad tennis club. People in England will soon be able to get jabs at one of the around 1,200 GP-led vaccination hubs and [community pharmacy sites](https://www.politico.eu/article/uk-pharmacists-on-stand-by-for-speedy-coronavirus-vaccine-deployment/) set to open by Friday, and the 206 hospital hub sites that should be up and running by the end of this month. In addition, mobile sites will be deployed in remote rural areas. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has pledged 24-hour, seven-day-a-week vaccination centers in England as soon as possible, with Wales and Scotland also considering the idea. Although the vast majority of jab sites are GP-led, Britain has not shied away from private entrepreneurship. NHS England [has selected Asda](https://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/business/asda-becomes-first-supermarket-provide-store-covid-vaccinations-3094196) to become the first supermarket to provide in-store coronavirus vaccinations starting on January 25. Its vaccination center will operate from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m., seven days a week. Other Asda sites are being assessed and could join the program. Boots, a chain of independent pharmacies, is opening its [first jabs site this week](https://www.boots-uk.com/our-stories/boots-is-preparing-to-start-covid-19-vaccinations-in-its-halifax-pharmacy-this-week/), and a [YouGov poll suggests there's vast support](https://yougov.co.uk/topics/politics/articles-reports/2021/01/11/government-handling-covid-19-vaccine-rollout) for including this type of businesses in the vaccine rollout. This idea has been proposed in other EU countries such as Spain, but critics there have pushed back, arguing that the involvement of private providers could undermine the country's public health care system. Military and volunteer support The U.K. military has been working hand in glove with the NHS. One example: The Armed Forces are contributing to the vaccination campaign by transporting doses around the country and identifying areas not covered by the vaccination network. There are also 21 quick reaction forces on standby that could be deployed to hospitals, local vaccination services and mass vaccination centers if the NHS needs extra hands. This option is available to EU countries with big enough armies, such as Italy, Germany and Greece, but the picture on the Continent is mixed. Germany has already deployed thousands of troops to help with logistics despite some initial resistance from the anti-militaristic left. Spain has also used its army to guarantee the distribution of doses throughout the country, hit by a snow storm last week that caused widespread disruption. Britain can also tap into the network of more than 200,000 people who have expressed their interest in volunteering in roles such as stewards and first-aiders. Fight against the skeptics The U.K. was among the first countries to devise a communications campaign to tackle misinformation and misgivings among some people about taking the vaccine. By mid-November, Whitehall had already [come up with a plan](https://www.politico.eu/article/uk-gears-up-anti-vax-battle/) to fight the anti-vaccine movement on multiple fronts, including a rebuttal team aided by government departments spreading positive messages in their areas and working with social media firms to take down damaging content. Public figures, including Queen Elizabeth and wildlife broadcaster David Attenborough, have revealed they have received the inoculation. Britain is helped in that its population is less skeptical than in countries like France, where polls suggest that as many as 58 percent do not want to be vaccinated. Just 25 percent of the Brits [surveyed by YouGov in early December](https://yougov.co.uk/topics/health/survey-results/daily/2020/12/07/6cd00/2) said they didn't feel confident about the safety of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine. Many EU countries are also ramping up publicity and are taking a similar approach, notably Poland and Romania, which [recruited start tennis player Simona Halep](https://republica.ro/simona-halep-primul-influencer-cooptat-intr-o-campanie-fara-precedent-influencerii-solutie-evidenta-recunoscuta) to spread the pro-vax message. Why the EU's strategy might win out The U.K. is well ahead of its former EU partners for now, but that could change rapidly \u2014 particularly when the more easily deployed Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine is approved for use in the bloc. Brussels' more cautious approach to the science and greater interest in protecting taxpayers from liability issues may also yield benefits in the long term.
