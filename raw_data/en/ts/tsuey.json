It came with a \"bonus\" healing for me\u2014a greater understanding of God's divine government, power, and influence. Over a period of a few days, I noticed Tilley exhibiting symptoms associated with allergic reaction, including skin irritation. I mentally affirmed the truth\u2014that God's kingdom is harmonious in all seasons. I knew that the symptoms, the material beliefs called \"allergic reaction,\" were not law to God's ideas or creation\u2014which included Tilley\u2014and therefore could not touch or influence them. It didn't matter what the season; Tilley was always safe and unharmed. In Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures, Mary Baker Eddy states, \"All of God's creatures, moving in the harmony of Science, are harmless, useful, indestructible\" ( [p. 514](https://login.concord.christianscience.com/concord3/search/?query=SH+514%3A28%E2%80%9330&book=tfccs.main.sh)). I was grateful for this correction of thought; however, the original symptoms persisted, and others appeared. I wondered what else I needed to address in prayer. About a week before this, Tilley had had a rabies vaccination, as required by law every three years. I now recalled reading on the receipt from the veterinarian what to do if your dog should have an allergic reaction to the vaccine. I had specifically prayed at the time, refuting the possibility of an adverse effect, because creations of God are spiritual and not governed by material so-called laws of cause and effect. I extended this to world thought, as we were hearing a lot about vaccines in the news related to the coronavirus pandemic. Now I took more time to reason spiritually that a vaccine could neither help nor harm. We are all subject to God's laws, and therefore can experience only eternal wholeness, immunity, and goodness. Reports to the contrary have no power or authority and cannot influence our experience. Mrs. Eddy writes: \"Rather than quarrel over vaccination, I recommend, if the law demand, that an individual submit to this process, that he obey the law, and then appeal to the gospel to save him from bad physical results\" (The First Church of Christ, Scientist, and Miscellany, [pp. 219-220](https://login.concord.christianscience.com/concord3/search/?query=My.+219%3A29%E2%80%931&book=tfccs.main.hb.kj)). I contacted a Christian Science practitioner for prayerful treatment. The practitioner assured me of Tilley's exemption from physical ailments and then commented that I should pray more about exasperation than vaccination! Dictionary.com defines exasperate, in part, as \"to irritate or provoke to a high degree; to annoy extremely,\" and a few synonyms for exasperate are incense, anger, vex, inflame, and infuriate. Those words described the political atmosphere I'd been hearing about, and I realized I needed to address this error. Science and Health states: \"Nothing is real and eternal,\u2014nothing is Spirit,\u2014but God and His idea. Evil has no reality. It is neither person, place, nor thing, but is simply a belief, an illusion of material sense\" ( [p. 71](https://login.concord.christianscience.com/concord3/search/?query=SH+71%3A2+It&book=tfccs.main.sh)). I reasoned that if Spirit, God, is All, then there can be no opposite to Spirit, and that this belief of provocation is a hypnotic lie with no basis in Truth. Also, because I am a spiritual expression of the one Mind, God, I could not be mistakenly impressed or wrongly influenced. On no level could I indulge this lie about personal power and influence, because that would be denying the one influence\u2014the Christ, Truth\u2014and the one, infinite power, God. This Bible verse came to thought: \"Let us consider one another to provoke unto love and to good works\" ( [Hebrews 10:24](https://login.concord.christianscience.com/concord3/search/?query=Hebrews+10%3A24&book=tfccs.main.hb.kj)). I realized that the only power is reflected in love and good works and that provocations to anger and reaction were beliefs that had no power at all. As I continued to pray along these lines, Tilley soon exhibited more energy and resumed eating, and the other symptoms disappeared the next day. She was completely healed. I'm very grateful I had the opportunity to pray about this. I realized that provoking and reacting\u2014whether related to a vaccine, to politics, or to our individual lives\u2014have no power because they have no spiritual basis. God is the source of all good and only good; therefore, our well-being is constant. The only action that can be expressed or experienced is \"to provoke unto love and to good works.\" Stephanie Bonnell Caledon, Ontario, Canada "}
