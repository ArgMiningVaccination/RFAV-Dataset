Acupuncture an ancient practice rooted in the ancestral science of Chinese medicine, helps promote that natural healing potential. By balancing the body, mind and spirit and restoring overall energy balance, acupuncture can help people embrace optimal wellness without medication or invasive medical procedures. What Is Acupuncture? Acupuncture is a procedure that uses tiny needles inserted into the skin to help balance a person's energy. The needles are inserted at specific locations along the patient's body that align with energy points. This triggers the body's natural healing capabilities, helping restore balance to both the mind and body. The Philosophy Behind Acupuncture Traditional acupuncture works on the belief that the body is controlled by an energy flow, known as qi (pronounced \"chee\"), that travels through pathways called meridians. Acupuncturists believe that problems or blockages with the flow of energy along these meridians is responsible for many ailments. Toxins, stress, trauma, hormones and even the foods we eat can all contribute to blocking qi. While some practitioners still follow the traditional philosophy of qi, others have also started incorporating a more integrative approach, supported by research and western medicine principles. For example, many of today's acupuncturists view the acupuncture points as places that stimulate nerves, invigorating the body's natural pain fighting and healing processes. Common Ailments Treated with Acupuncture One of the main focus of acupuncture treatment is the reduction of pain and improvement of overall health. It may be used to reduce pain after surgery or medical and dental treatments. Patients with chronic headaches and migraines can also greatly benefit from acupuncture treatment, and it is commonly used for muscle and back pain, stress relief and overall wellness. Patients with neurological conditions also report relief after acupuncture treatments. Acupuncture can also help support better immune and nervous system function. This, in turn, promotes improved overall wellness and helps the body heal itself naturally when illness or injury occurs. The History of Acupuncture It is believed that acupuncture originated in China in 6,000 BC. In its earliest days, acupuncture treatment was performed using sharp bones. As early as 198 BC, ancient Chinese documents that talked about meridians and qi were found. These early practitioners theorized that balance and health came from qi, and when it was out of balance, the body struggled with illness. Acupuncture procedures were first documented in The Yellow Emperor's Classic of Internal Medicine, a book that was published around 100 BC. Over the next few centuries, precise acupuncture points were developed, and the procedure became mainstream in China. During the Ming dynasty of the 14th through 16th century, the acupuncture points were officially recorded. The practice fell out of favor in China in the 18th and 19th centuries as Western medicine took over, and in 1929 it was outlawed in China. Yet over those years it spread to other Asian countries, particularly in Japan. It then experienced a revival in 1949 under Communist China, and soon the knowledge began to spread again. In 1971 a member of the US press corps was treated with acupuncture in China, and he described his treatment to the New York Times. American interest in the practice began to grow, and today people across the country benefit from acupuncture treatment. 14 Health Benefits of Acupuncture If you are considering acupuncture for the first time, you may feel curious about these techniques.
