And... welcome once again to cold and flu season. Nobody wants to be sick during the holidays, so we're sharing some tips to help keep you from sniffling through Thanksgiving dinner. Regular weekly acupuncture sessions can help to strengthen and regulate immunity according to studies, boosting \"killer\" T cells that helped drive your body's overall immune response to pathogens. In Traditional Chinese Medicine, acupuncture is used to strengthen wei qi (defensive qi). The body's defensive qi resides just under the skin and can be regulated and strengthened through acupuncture. The simple act of relaxing the body during an acupuncture session is beneficial to the immune system. In addition to acupuncture, there are herbal remedies that provide a terrific boost to your body's defenses. Yu Ping Feng San - or Jade Windscreen - dates to the 13th Century. It's typically used to provide relief from respiratory issues and has anti-inflammatory properties. It amps up the immune system by strengthening the lungs. Since most germs enter the body through the nose and mouth. It's a blocking formula... taken to help prevent you from catching the colds of your family or co-workers. If you can already feel the tickle of a cold, then Gan Mao Ling is in order. A complex mix of herbs, it helps to open nasal passages and attacks many of the symptoms of the common cold. Take it as soon as you begin to feel the start of a cold and Gan Mao Ling can shorten the length and severity of the illness. Cold Quell is used to tackle cold or flu that has already taken root. The formula includes Gan Mao Ling, but adds herbs, which treat more debilitating symptoms like fever. It is designed to boost the functions of the liver and spleen, to help clear toxins out of the body more quickly. Yin qiao san, which includes honeysuckle and mint, acts as a fever reducer once you're really feeling the effects of a cold or flu. It also helps alleviate the painful effects of a sore throat. Since there is overlap between these herbal remedies, it's recommended that you consult your herbalist about what would be best for your situation. One more tip: as soon as you begin to feel that cold coming on draw a very hot bath - as hot as you can tolerate. Soak yourself (or at least your feet) in the water and let the heat get the sweat going in order to pull toxins out of the body. Also, remember when getting dressed for the cold weather that the scarf is your friend! And studies have shown that keeping your nose warm is a good way to keep from letting viruses invade the body. No matter how you're feeling, the team at East Village Acupuncture and Massage is always here to help keep your body in fighting shape all season. "}
