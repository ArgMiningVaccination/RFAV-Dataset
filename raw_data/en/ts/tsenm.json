She got me through my pregnancy, during which my hip kept moving out of place. She was able to make my pain go away instantly and give me so much relief. The office is very small and cute, with a couple chairs in the waiting room and a small desk with and iPad where you check in. There are also a few toys for kids in case they get antsy! Valentina P Dr. Jennifer Dahlseid was fantastic. I have dealt with foot pain for several years and was told by my medical doctor it was part of getting older and nothing could be done. I was to the point I could not walk when first getting out of bed in the morning. I visited Dr. Jennifer 4x for treatment for plantar fasciitis. She treated me and gave me simple stretches to do at home. My foot pain is gone! I have no pain or issues when waking in the morning. I am more than happy with the treatment. T H Although I have a long road to complete recovery, my stomach pain was nearly eliminated after ONE WEEK! Absolutely amazing! I am so grateful for Dr. Dahlseid. I finally have answers, and relief after just assuming I'd have to just live with my stomach pain. If you have unexplained stomach pain, go see her! Jean S I had horribly painful plantar fasciitis in my right foot. Jennifer was fabulous and worked diligently with different techniques to get me pain-free! She listens carefully, and goes right to work! I will definitely go back to her should I have any other chiropractic needs???? Heidi M Dr. Larson is truly the best! He is extremely knowledgeable, experienced, compassionate and cares deeply about all aspects of his patient's health and wellbeing. He takes the time to listen and works to address your concerns quickly. After the very first visit, I knew he would be the one who could help me relieve my severe rib pain and anxiety that I had been struggling with for over 4 years. He was also able to help make significant improvements in my autistic son's behavior. I really can't say enough about how great it is to get the pleasure of working with him! Highly recommend! :) B Truly knowledgeable, compassionate, flexible, patient Doctor's. I am 58 years old and they were able to diagnose a genetic disorder that my regular doctor's missed. They truly care about your over all health. They will take the time to sit with you and answer all of your questions and explain everything in detail. They will do research for you if they do not know the answer to your questions. Tracy M Dr.Dahlseid is highly recommend!! She is very informative and has helped me out on a lot of issues I was having. Zach C "}
