'Garbhini' means pregnant woman and 'paricharya' means ideal protocol. It includes the ideal dietary and lifestyle protocol followed by a pregnant woman to attain optimum health of progeny and prevent any complications. The guidelines for prenatal care start even before conception. The couple planning to have a progeny shall follow purification procedures (panchakarma), proper diet and life style modifications as part of preconception care. The prenatal care begins from the very first day when the woman expects the conception (usually due to missed menstrual cycle). [Su. Sa. Sharira Sthana 10/3]. The conceived woman shall be treated with special care just like a pot filled with oil. As the slightest oscillation of such a pot causes spilling of the oil, similarly the slightest exertions or excitements to the pregnant woman can initiate adverse outcomes. [Cha. Sa. [Sharira Sthana](/index.php?title=Sharira_Sthana) Jamnagar, India [10.47468/CSNE.2020.e01.s09.026](https://doi.org/10.47468/CSNE.2020.e01.s09.026) General aspects of prenatal care in Ayurveda Fetus is dependent on mother in every aspect during intrauterine life. So, the health of fetus is totally dependent upon the maternal health. The ultimate aim of preconception and prenatal care is healthy progeny. It includes: 1. Physical dimension 2. Psychological dimension 3. Spiritual dimension 4. Social dimensions 5. Diagnostic and therapeutic dimensions Apart from the general prenatal care, month-wise special care especially in the dietetics, is also advised. This monthly regimen is planned considering the intrauterine growth and developmental milestones of the fetus and nutritional requirements of mother. This makes a unique addition in prenatal care in Ayurveda. Physical dimension of prenatal care It includes both diet (ahara) and activities (vihara). Diet during pregnancy The diet (ahara) consumed by the pregnant woman gets transformed into the nutrient fluid (rasa) which is having a threefold action: a) Nourishing the body elements of the mother b) Providing nourishment to the growing fetus c) Helping the formation of breast milk. [Cha. Sa. [Sharira Sthana](/index.php?title=Sharira_Sthana) 6/23] Whatever the diet consumed by the pregnant woman becomes congenial to the fetus. So, diet of a pregnant woman should be designed considering the place of living, time, season and digestive capacity. [Ka. Sa. Sutra Sthana 18/24,25] The diet prescribed for pregnant lady should satisfy the following criteria: 1. Palatable 2. More liquid in nature 3. Predominantly sweet in taste 4. Unctuous 5. Processed with appetizing drugs [Su. Sa. Sharira Sthana 10/3] She should always include butter, ghee and milk in her diet. [A.Hr.Sharira Sthana 1/43] Use of hot water, milk and meat is emphasized by Acharya Kashyapa. Milk provides nourishment and stability to the fetus. Meat provides nutrients for nourishment to the fetus and suppresses the aggravated [vata](/index.php?title=Vata). Meat soup(mamsa rasa) is considered as the best preparation for a pregnant lady. Meat treated with milk or mixed with sour articles or salt is also beneficial. [ Ka.Sa. Khila Sthana 24/6,7,11,12] Yogaratnakara provides a list of recommended dietary items during pregnancy as mentioned below. - Two varieties of rice (Shali and Shashtika) - green gram(mudga) - wheat (godhuma) - flour of parched rice (lajasaktu) - butter - ghee - milk - curd mixed with sugar and condiments - honey - sugar - jackfruit - banana - fruit of gooseberry (amalaki) - grapes (draksha) - sour and sweet substances. - anabolic and gratifying edibles.

Contemporary medical science gives importance to diet in terms of supplementation of essential macro and micro nutrients. In pregnant women's diet the emphasize is given mainly in supplementation of iron, calcium, folic acid, DHA, iodine, and vitamin D. The World Health Organization guides use of multiple micro nutrient powders for point-of-use fortification of foods consumed by pregnant women. However, routine use of multiple micro nutrient powders during pregnancy is not recommended as an alternative to standard iron and folic supplementation during pregnancy for improving maternal and infant health outcomes. [[3]](#cite_note-3) High food quality, together with adequate macro- and micro nutrient intake in pregnancy, is crucial for the health status of the mother and child. Most conditions that occur in adulthood originate in fetal life. Moreover, some epigenetic events, modified by diet impact more than one generation. [[4]](#cite_note-4) Life style guidelines for pregnant woman The lifestyle protocol is indicated for maternal and fetal health commonly. [A.S. Sharira Sthana 2/58] The pregnant woman desirous of a healthy progeny should avoid all non-congenial diet and activities. She should protect and uplift herself through good conduct. [Cha. Sa. [Sharira Sthana](/index.php?title=Sharira_Sthana) 8/21] Daily bath and worshiping the sun are recommended.[ Ka. Sa. Sharira Sthana 5/15]. Anointment with cooling agents, musk, sandal and camphor, wearing garlands, moonlight bath and gentle massage are also recommended. [Y.R. Ksheera dosha Chikitsa] The objective of all these protocols is to preserve optimum health in views of physical, mental and spiritual aspects. Positive mental attitude of mother helps for better progeny. Contra indications during pregnancy (garbhopaghatakara bhava) Diet to be avoided - Excessive heavy to digest, hot and pungent substances [Cha .Sa. [Sharira Sthana](/index.php?title=Sharira_Sthana)4/18] - Intoxicating substances like Excessive use of meat[Cha.Sa. [Sharira Sthana](/index.php?title=Sharira_Sthana)4/18] - stale, putrefied and wet [Su.Sa. Sharira Sthana 10/3] - Pulses, edibles producing burning sensation (in abdomen), heavy or sour substances, edible tuber called surana, hot milk, garlic and onion.[Ha. Sa. Tritiya Sthana 49] Activities to be avoided - Harsh or violent activities [Cha.Sa. [Sharira Sthana](/index.php?title=Sharira_Sthana)4/18] - Ride over vehicle running Awakening in night Sharira Sthana 10/3] - Prolonged stay in hot Sthana 2/60] - clay[Ha. Sa. Tritiya Sthana 49] Psychological and Spiritual dimensions of prenatal care Maintaining a pleasant status of mind is very essential throughout the period of pregnancy as well as during post-natal period. Even while describing the treatment of intra uterine growth restriction, the importance of mental health of pregnant woman is emphasized. It is advised to make the pregnant lady happy continuously through all possible means. [A.S. Sharira Sthana 4/25] The psychological and cognitive development of fetus depends on the psychological status of mother and father and the topics listened by the woman during pregnancy. [A.S. Sharira Sthana 1/66]. Various studies related to maternal mental health and its association with birth outcomes and child behavior has proven the fact that maternal mental status has a strong influence on baby. [[5]](#cite_note-5) The studies related to pre-natal stress and the pregnancy outcome suggest that exposure to high levels of maternal cortisol during pregnancy can be negatively related to offspring cognitive skills. [[6]](#cite_note-6) From the very first day of pregnancy, the woman is advised to remain in high spirit, pious, wearing ornaments, clean white garments and perform religious rituals, do auspicious deeds and worship deity and priest. [Su. Sa. Sharira Sthana 10/3]. She should use meritorious, auspicious, clean, new and intact (unbroken) garments and ornaments possessing masculine names. [ Ka. Sa. Sharira Sthana 5/12] Activities to be avoided for preservation of mental health - Contact with dirty, disfigured, foul smelling, awful looking substances [Su.Sa. Sharira Sthana 10/3] - Listening to very much exciting stories [Su. Sa. Sharira Sthana 10/3] - Unwanted outing, visiting lonely haunted tree, cremation ground etc. [Su.Sa. Sharira Sthana 10/3] - Acts disgrace[Su. Sa. Sharira Sthana 10/3] Amulet for pregnant woman - The pregnant woman is advised to wear amulet made of Operculina turpethum (trivrit ) in her waist during pregnancy. After delivery she is advised to wear it over her head. [Ka.Sa. Khila Sthana 10/181] - For prevention of abortion, intrauterine death of fetus, premature delivery etc. a protection band (varana bandha) is also recommended which is to be done before 8th month. A special spiritual strategy called 'matangi vidya\" is recommended for such rituals by acharya Kashyapa. [Ka. Sa. Kalpa Sthana 6/80] In current clinical settings, these practices are not followed. However, the scientific studies on these practices may provide newer insights in preventive antenatal care. Social dimensions of prenatal care The pregnant woman shall be well behaved with everyone. Respecting and treating the elders, priests etc. in good manner is recommended. [Su. Sa. Sharira Sthana 10/3], [ Ka. Sa. Sharira Sthana 5/15]. Behavior of husband and attendants: Affectionate and gentle behavior of husband and servants towards the pregnant woman helps in maintaining the healthy status of pregnancy. She should be pleased with things of her desire and those which are wholesome. [A. Hr. Sharira Sthana 1/43] Room settings: Her sleeping and sitting place should be covered with soft cushion or mattress. They should not be very high and should possess elevated upper portion for head rest to make it perfect and very comfortable. [Su. Sa. Sharira Sthana 10/3] The abode should be fumigated with fragrant drugs and it should be free from insects like mosquito etc. Vedic hymns should be recited by the people well versed in it and vocal and instrumental music should be played by the musicians. [Ka.Sa. Sharira Sthana 5/14] Effect of music on maternal psychology and fetal well being is a well explored area of research. [[7]](#cite_note-7) [[8]](#cite_note-8) [[9]](#cite_note-9) Diagnostics and therapeutics Diagnosis Diagnosis of pregnancy is explained purely based on symptoms in Ayurveda. The three-fold method is applied in antenatal examinations for pregnancy and assessment of fetal growth in uterus. Inspection (darshana) The specific clinical features seen by direct observation in a pregnant lady are: - periodic increase in size of abdomen [A.S. Sharira Sthana 2/8] - Sa. [Sharira Sthana](/index.php?title=Sharira_Sthana)4/16] Palpation(sparshana) The growth and development of fetus and other changes in pregnancy can be assessed by palpation in view of following: - enlargement of abdominal Sthana](/index.php?title=Sharira_Sthana)4/16] Interrogation (prashna) The symptoms of pregnancy are elicited through proper history taking. The first symptom, i.e. amenorrhea in a married woman is taken as an indicator for suspecting the pregnancy. [Cha. Sa. [[Sharira Sthana] 4/16] Symptoms related to the gastro intestinal system are mentioned as initial symptoms of pregnancy. - Dislike/aversion for food(anannabhilasha). - Excessive salivation (asyasravanam). - Anorexia(arochaka). in sour substances(amlakamata). - Vomiting(chardi)[Cha. Sa. [Sharira Sthana](/index.php?title=Sharira_Sthana)4/16] Psychological symptoms like alternate desire for things with opposite qualities, aversion of previously appreciated fragrance etc.[Su. Sa. Sharira Sthana 3/15] are also observed as symptoms of pregnancy. General fatigue, excessive sleep, excessive yawning, getting unconscious accidentally are also listed among the symptoms of pregnancy. [A.S.Sharira Sthana 2/8] All these features can be assessed through simple interrogation in the clinical set up during antenatal visits. Contemporary Approach Systematic supervision of a woman during pregnancy is called antenatal care (ANC). Contemporary antenatal care has two main components. - Careful history taking and examination (general and obstetrical) - Advice given to the pregnant woman. The supervision should be regular and periodic in nature according to the need of the individual. [[10]](#cite_note-10) The aims and objectives of the antenatal care include the screening of high-risk cases, continuing the risk assessment and preventing/detecting the complications at the earliest stage to ensure a normal pregnancy with delivery of a healthy baby from a healthy mother. World Health Organization's 2016 recommendations on antenatal care (ANC) for a positive pregnancy experience prioritize person-centered health care, well-being of women and families, and positive perinatal and maternal outcomes. This model guides pregnant woman about frequency and time of contact for consultation of an obstetrician. Table 3: Antenatal care model by WHO (2016) examination: Proper personal history, family history, history of present and past illness, medical and surgical history are needed to be taken along with the obstetric and menstrual history. The obstetric history includes status of gravida, parity, number of deliveries (term, pre term), miscarriage, pregnancy termination and living issues. In menstrual history, cycle, duration, amount of blood flow, and first day of last normal menstrual period (LNMP) are to be noted. Calculation of the expected date of delivery: This is done according to Naegele's formula by adding 9 calendar months and 7 days to the first day of LNMP. [[12]](#cite_note-12) Examination includes general physical examination, systemic examination and obstetrical examination. Obstetrical examination It includes both abdominal and vaginal examination. 1. Abdominal examination: a) Inspection: To note the condition of uterine ovoid, contour of uterus, undue enlargement of uterus, skin condition of abdomen, incision scar mark on abdomen etc. b) Palpation: Height of the uterus is measured by placing the ulnar border of the left hand placed on the upper most level of fundus and an approximate duration of pregnancy is ascertained in terms of weeks of gestation. Alternatively, the symphyseal fundal height (SFH) is measured with a measuring tape. Obstetrical grips (Leopold maneuvers) [[13]](#cite_note-13) c) Auscultation: Auscultation of distinct foetal heart sounds (FHS) not only helps in the diagnosis of a live baby, but its location of maximum intensity can resolve doubt about the presentation of the foetus. 2. Vaginal Examination Strict aseptic precautions should be taken during per vaginal examination during pregnancy. Any history of vaginal bleeding contra indicates the vaginal examination. The diagnosis of position and presentation of fetus may be difficult to diagnose accurately by internal examination during pregnancy when the cervix remains closed. Pelvic assessment and test for cephalopelvic disproportion are best done just after the onset of labour or just before the induction of labour. During labour, accurate information can be obtained by the palpation of presenting part through the open cervix. Lab investigations - Routine investigations : Blood: Hemoglobin, haematocrit, ABO, Rh grouping, blood glucose and VDRL. Urine: Protein, sugar and puss cells. - Special investigations : Serological tests: for rubella, hepatitis B virus and HIV. Genetic Screening: This includes maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein (MSAFP), triple test at 15-18 weeks for mother at risk of carrying a fetus with neural tube defects, down syndrome or other chromosomal anomaly. Non-invasive screening for chromosomal anomaly should be a routine to all pregnant women irrespective of their age. [[14]](#cite_note-14) - Ultrasound Examinations : 1st trimester: Presence of an intra uterine gestation sac, and presence of yolk sac or fetal pole within the gestation sac confirms pregnancy. USG is the best method to estimate the gestational age dating. Booking (18-20 weeks) scan is advised for detailed fetal anatomy survey and to detect any structural abnormality including cardiac. It is also helpful in placental localization. 2nd trimester: It is more helpful in assessing the fetal growth using biometric paramrters. The parameters used are biparietal diameter (BPD), head circumference (HC), abdominal circumference (AC), and Femur length (FL) 3rd trimester: All the information of second trimester sonography can be obtained in third trimester. Effective fetal weight, placental maturation, amniotic fluid index etc. are also evaluated. There are many biophysical tests for prenatal fetal surveillance during late pregnancy which includes ultrasonography, doppler stress test (CST)etc. [[15]](#cite_note-15) Special therapies recommended during pregnancy Medicated Enema During the eighth month of pregnancy, evacuative enema (asthapanabasti) is advised for the elimination of retained fecal matter followed by unctuous enema (anuvasanabasti)with oil medicated with ghee processed with madhura group of drugs for cleaning the collected feces and then therapeutic enema(niruhabasti) is given.[A.Hr. Sharira Sthana 1/34-35] Unctuous enema is continued in ninth month also. In current practice, the decoction of dashamula herbs and sesame oil processed with same herbs is used for giving evacuative enema after completion of 8th month of gestation. The dashamula group of above drugs(dashamula) or oil processed with sida practice. Different practices and protocols regarding enema therapy (basti) are followed. Evacuative and unctuous enema in alternate days for a maximum of 8 days is one protocol. In another protocol, initially, one evacuative enema followed by 3-4 unctuous enema on consecutive days is given.The decision depends upon the physician's view(yukti) as per the condition and strength of the pregnant lady. In case of severe constipation and if the patient is very weak, initial unctuous enema followed by evacuative enema is effective. This kind of enema therapy is useful for facilitating easy delivery. Research works are being conducted on both evacuative enema and unctuous enema as part of prenatal care with an objective of promoting easy delivery. Two research works were conducted on evacuative enema with 200 ml of decoction of drugs of dashamula added with powder of 60 ml of oil processed with dashamula. This enema was given after the completion of 8th month, along with unctuous enema (matra basti) using 60 ml of oil processed with dashamula in alternate days for a duration of 6 days. These studies have reported early engagement of fetal head & timely onset of labour in 90.90% of cases as a result of the above mentioned enema(basti) procedure. [[19]](#cite_note-19) [[20]](#cite_note-20) A single blind comparative study, conducted in 45 primi-gravida and primipara full term pregnancy cases, per rectal administration (matra basti) of castor oil showed better results in the augmentation of labour and shortening the first stage of labour as compared to 2.5 IU of oxytocin in 1 pint of Ringer Lactate fluid administered as per the protocol of induction. [[21]](#cite_note-21) Vaginal Tampon During the ninth month, vaginal tampon(yoni pichu) with medicated oil is advised. [ Cha. Sa. [Sharira Sthana](/index.php?title=Sharira_Sthana) 8/32]. Oil processed with sida cordifolia(bala taila), formulations like dhanwanthra taila are in current practice for vaginal tampon during ninth month of pregnancy. Filling of vagina(yoni poorana) with castor oil(erannda taila) with the same oil is beneficial in promoting the onset and progression of normal labour. Medicated water for bath The cold decoction of pulp of Aegle marmelos(bilva), Gossipium water prepared with all fragrant drugs(sarvagandhodaka) should be used for bathing by the pregnant woman.[A.S. Sharira Sthana 3/14] Cold decoction of pounded leaves of drugs capable of suppressing [vata](/index.php?title=Vata) is generally advised. [A.Hr. Sharira Sthana 1/68] Commonly used medicines for promotion of health of mother and fetus: Some herbal formulations are mentioned as preventive medicines for habitual abortions in particular months. These are prescribed in general also for promoting the proper growth and development of the fetus. Powder or paste of the drugs can be used along with milk. Now a days, these are available in tablet/capsule form also. drugs in the form of milk decoction (ksheera kashaya)in each month of pregnancy are widely prescribed by Ayurveda practitioners, mainly in southern part of India. |Month||Drug| Therapeutic measures to be avoided - Excessive nourishment(santarpana) and excessive emaciation(apatarpana) [Su.Sa. unguents. [Su.Sa. Sharira Sthana 10/3] - All [Panchakarma](/index.php?title=Panchakarma)(shodhana procedures) [A.Hr.Sharira Sthana karma)[Y.R. Ksheeradosha Chikitsa] General guide Lines for treatment of diseases during pregnancy - The diseases of pregnant woman should be treated with use of soft(mrudu), sweet(madhura), cold(sheeta), pleasing and gentle drugs, dietetics and behavior. [Cha. Sa. [Sharira Sthana](/index.php?title=Sharira_Sthana)8/22] - Even though the purification procedures are contra indicated in pregnancy, in case of acute or serious conditions,emetics can be given followed by use of sweet and sour edibles mixed with carminative drugs. anuvasanabasti) should not be used frequently,but if the disease is acute, moderate use of these can be done. [Cha. Sa. [Sharira Sthana](/index.php?title=Sharira_Sthana)8/22] - After eight months, diseases curable by purification measures like emesis etc. can be treated with gentle form of those therapies or procedures giving similar benefits. Strong emetics are contraindicated. Instead of strong oral purgatives, suppositories can be used.[Cha. Sa. [Sharira Sthana](/index.php?title=Sharira_Sthana)8/22] - But, in case of very serious conditions, for saving the life of pregnant woman, the drastic measures and pungent drugs may be used even if those are harmful to the fetus.[ A.S. Sharira Sthana 2/63] Benefits of prenatal care in Ayurveda By the practice of prenatal care including monthly regimen, the entire body, especially the reproductive tract, placenta, fetal membrane(garbhadharini), abdominal area, sacral region, flanks and back become soft. [Vayu](/index.php?title=Vayu) moves into its right path and direction, urine, feces and placenta are excreted or expelled easily by their respective passages. Woman gains strength and complexion and she delivers easily at proper time a desired, excellent and healthy child possessing all the qualities and long life.[Cha. Sa. [Sharira Sthana](/index.php?title=Sharira_Sthana) 8/32] Current Researches - In current scenario the group antenatal care as compared to individual care offers an opportunity to increase quality of care and improve maternal and newborn outcomes. Group antenatal care holds the potential to increase healthy behaviors, promote respectful maternity care, and generate demand for services. Group ANC improves women's health literacy on how to prevent and recognize problems, prepare for delivery, and care for their newborn. [[23]](#cite_note-23) - A systematic review on existing antenatal care models in different countries reveals that most of the models report fewer than half the characteristics associated with quality maternity care. [[24]](#cite_note-24) - A multi-center operational study has demonstrated the feasibility and effectiveness of Ayurvedic interventions for ante natal care in primary health care level settings. Total 1174 patients completed the full course of Ayrvedic interventions in the form of tablets for antenatal care in PHC set up. Significant results were found in improvement of haemoglobin percentage, relief in symptoms like vomiting and edema. 85.46% women underwent normal delivery. The 90.22 % babies were observed with optimum birth weight. The study could improve the awareness in public regarding the integrated approaches in antenatal care and promote the institutional delivery among the rural population. [[25]](#cite_note-25) - Research works are being conducted in different institutes of Ayurveda on the effect of rejuvenation therapy(rasayana)as a means of providing micronutrients during pregnancy in different trimesters. [[26]](#cite_note-26) - A randomized controlled clinical trial in managing the first trimester pregnancy with rejuvenation therapy(rasayana), nasal instillation of medicine (nasya), showed better outcome as compared to the control group with micronized progesterone therapy orally. The treated group was administered combination of herbs like form in a dose of 10 gms twice a day with cold milk. Nasal instillation of milk processed with leaf bud of Ficus bengalensis(vatashunga), 4 drops in either right or left nostril for 3 consecutive days, just after the pregnancy test is positive, was also done. Better results were reported in subjective parameters like associated symptoms during pregnancy like vomiting, giddiness, abdominal pain, constipation, and heaviness in breast and USG parameters like gestational sac, crown rump length and nuchal thickness. [[27]](#cite_note-27) - The racemosus(shatavari), Sida when administrated as medicated milk in enema form(per rectal) or oral route had shown appreciable result in the treatment of intra uterine growth restriction as well as oligohydramnios. [[28]](#cite_note-28) The outcome of the studies reveals that per rectal route of administration of the above drugs in the form of medicated milk has better effect than the oral administration. The 450 ml of medicated milk given in the form of enema for 10 consecutive days, showed remarkably significant results in parameters of fetal biometry, estimated fetal birth weight, amniotic fluid index as compared to the control group of L-Arginine sachet(6.5g) in two divided doses for 10 days. The animal experimental study also showed promising results in maternal weight gain, maternal well being and successful delivery of the pups without any adverse effects. [[29]](#cite_note-29) Concept of designer baby The term designer baby simply means a baby whose genes have been chosen by the parents and doctors so that it has some particular features. The genetic makeup of the baby has been artificially selected by genetic engineering combined with in vitro fertilization to ensure the presence or absence of some particular genes. Such genetic engineering techniques are believed to be capable of altering full range of biological traits from gender to susceptibility to disease and eventually appearance, personality and even IQ. These techniques are highly useful in cases of genetically transmitted disorders to prevent the occurrence of the particular disease in the baby by gene modification. But, ethical, legal and social controversies still exist in this field. Bioethicists are concerned about the fact that imperfections of the technology may introduce errors like off-target cuts. Even successful edits may have disastrous consequences, including irreversible damage to the health of individuals, assaults on human dignity, issues related to justice inequality, and unpredictable and unknown threats to future generations. [[30]](#cite_note-30) Ayurveda recommends the natural and simple way of designing the baby through preconception and antenatal care. A special term \"Garbha Sanskar\" is given to the practices aiming to the creation of a desirable progeny based up on the guidelines from Ayurveda and other treaties related to Indian culture by modifying them through the contemporary approach.
