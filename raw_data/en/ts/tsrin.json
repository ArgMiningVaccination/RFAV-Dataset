Ideally, it should be quiet. Close the door if you can, this will only take a few minutes! - Sit in a natural position. - Breathe normally. - Focus on your breath. Try not to overthink this, nothing needs to be forced: just focus on each exhalation and inhalation. That is Meditation 101. If you mind wanders (and since you're human, there's a good chance that it will), try to sit back and \"observe\" your thoughts. Don't analyze them. And don't scold yourself for losing focus. It's all part of the process. "}
