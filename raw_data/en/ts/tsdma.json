Through cutting edge and progressive treatment plans, our patients reach their health related goals allowing them to return to what they do best. A lot of people do not understand or know where to go to help improve their state of health. The TEAM at ChiroConcepts is changing that every day! We pride ourselves on great customer service and amazing patient care. We want our patients to experience WORLD CLASS with every treatment, every time. Our Commitment to Your Health and Well-Being We believe that good health is more than just the absence of acute disease, but a state of well-being where you are able to express your full potential. Vibrant health not only increases feelings of ease, happiness, and contentment, it can help you achieve all the positive things in life. Western medicine has many wonderful tools and techniques available, but often misses the mark when it comes to the whole of the mind/body system. As dedicated chiropractors, providers, and practitioners, we are able to treat the whole person. By cultivating health and well-being, we help you live a joyous, energetic life. We do this not just through our cutting-edge treatments, but through education and support in proper health maintenance. Our Promise to You! Our promise is that we will help you reach and express your full potential that you may achieve all in life that is good. We realize that good help and guidance is vital. We recognize that good, quality health is not merely the absence of disease but is a state of well being in which every body system, organ, and yes, cell can express its full potential without interference. To this end we are committed to you, your family and your friends, to treat through alternative healthcare and to educate in the care and maintenance of the human frame and body. It is our purpose to treat you with dignity and respect with the hope that you might enjoy a life filled with joy and vitality. This is our promise to you. About Our Founders Doctors Matthew Schindlbeck, D.C. and Puneet Arora, D.C. founded ChiroConcepts in 2012 as a community of alternative health care practitioners offering the best care and value to the people of North Texas. Our success comes from two areas that we pride ourselves in. The first is our reputation for our outstanding patient care and customer service. The second is our ability to have sound business practices which are a result of the strong relationships that we have built while being in practice. Dr. Matthew Schindlbeck, D.C. became interested in chiropractic care when low back pain almost sidelined his high school football career. He got such great results that he was inspired to help others, and eventually earned his doctorate from Northwestern College of Chiropractic. Dr. Puneet Arora, D.C. also experienced serious back pain when he was a teenager. He tried working with a primary care physician, who prescribed pain killers and muscle relaxants as well as physical rehab. However, it was not until he went to a chiropractor that he experienced permanent relief. Since then, he has been passionate about helping other people who are suffering from back pain. We now have six ChiroConcepts locations, each of which is locally and privately owned. Alternative Medicine in North Texas Searching for quality alternative medicine in Dallas and North Texas?
