Our team of surgeons, medical oncologists and radiation oncologists works together closely to ensure that each patient receives comprehensive care. Our surgeons are highly skilled in minimally invasive techniques, including [robot-assisted surgery](/programs/robotic-surgery), performed at UCSF since 2016. After surgery, patients receive care in our Thoracic Enhanced Recovery After Surgery Program. Bringing together a team of experts from different disciplines, this program follows a protocol before, during and after chest surgery that has been shown to decrease complications and improve results. Our medical oncologists provide leading-edge treatments that are generally more effective and easier on patients than many traditional cancer therapies. These include targeted therapies, which attack the cancer without damaging healthy cells, and immunotherapy, which harnesses the patient's own immune system to fight the cancer. In some cases, we also perform genetic testing of tumors, which can help us choose the most effective treatment plan for individual patients. During treatment, our patients have access to many support services designed to enhance their overall wellness, such as smoking cessation classes and support groups, nutrition education, mental health care and integrative therapies. Alongside our commitment to providing excellent patient care, our team is dedicated to finding safer and more effective cancer treatments through research. Interested patients may have the option to receive promising experimental treatments by joining a clinical trial.
