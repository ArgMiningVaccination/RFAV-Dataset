Copyright Published by Jo hn Wiley & Sons, Ltd. A B S T R A C T This is the protocol for a review and there is no abstract. The ob jectives are as follows: T o evaluate the effects of interventions to improve vaccine upt ake among adolescents in low, middle and high-income countries. B A C K G R O U N D Vaccines are among the most successful and cost-effective pub- lic health interventions available for preventing the morb idity and mortality caused by vaccine-preventable diseases ( Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2006 ). However, vaccine-pre- ventable diseases remain a major cause of morbidity and mor- tality among adolescents and young adults ( Decade of Vaccines Collaboration 2013 ). Vaccinating adolescent girls before the on- set of sexual activity with vaccines against human papillomavi rus (HPV) can substantially reduce the risk of cervical cancer later in life. Therefore, with most vaccines, the public health benet s of vaccinating adolescents is mainly observed in early to late adu lt- hood. Globally, cervical cancer is the fourth most frequent cancer among women with an estimate of 530,000 new cases reported in 2012 ( World Health Organization 2015 ). Cervical cancer ac- counted for 7.5% of all female cancer deaths globally in 2012 (World Health Organization 2015 ). Many vaccine-preventable diseases and deaths among young adults are due to low vacci- nation coverage among the adolescent group. In addition, ther e are no adolescent vaccination policies in the majority of low- an dmiddle-income countries (LMICs) ( Principi 2013 ;World Health Organization 2015 ). There is therefore a need to conduct studies that can inform public health policy-makers on better strategi es to increase vaccine uptake among adolescents. Immunisation with an effective vaccine results in individuals ac- quiring protective immunity against the targeted pathogen. When sufciently large number of individuals are vaccinated within a population, herd immunity develops and this prevents the sp read of the targeted infectious disease within both vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals ( Lee 2005 ;Mackroth 2010 ;Zipursky 2010 ). Due to their immature immune systems, infants and younger children are more vulnerable to infectious pathogens than adults. Therefore, most vaccines are administered early in life ( Principi 2013 ;Rodewald 1998 ). However, immunity in- duced by some vaccines, such as diphtheria, tetanus and pertussi s, wanes over time, leading to suboptimal immunity and less her d immunity around the onset of adolescence ( Decade of Vaccines Collaboration 2013 ;Lee 2005 ;Mackroth 2010 ;Zipursky 2010 ). It is therefore necessary to give booster vaccines during adole scence to maintain protective immunity. In some settings, these boo ster 1 Improving vaccination uptake among adolescents (Protocol ) Copyright \u00a9 2015 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by J ohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.vaccines are never administered to adolescents and young adult s (Principi 2013 ;World Health Organization 2015 ). Vaccines given during adolescence include, among others, those against HPV, tetanus, diphtheria and acellular pertussis (T dap), as well as meningococcal disease ( Gilkey 2014 ;Harris 2009 ). Future vaccines, such as those against human immunodeciency virus (HIV) and Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb), are likely to target adolescents as the primary population ( Gowda 2012 ;Zipursky 2010 ). Extending vaccination throughout the life course, includ- ing adolescence, is a strategy advocated by the Global Vaccine Ac- tion Plan (GVAP) 2011-2020 ( Decade of Vaccines Collaboration 2013 ). The rationale for the strategy of reaching individuals throughout life is to achieve the highest reduction in the incid ence of vaccine-preventable diseases. Therefore, it is crucial to achi eve optimal adolescent vaccination uptake ( Clements 2004 ;Mackroth 2010 ;Zipursky 2010 ). We propose that studies that can inform health policy-makers on potential approaches to improving the uptake of vaccines among adolescents are urgently needed. This is particularly so in sub-Saharan Africa where there are few est ab- lished national programmes for vaccinating adolescents. The World Health Organization (WHO) denes adolescents as persons aged between 10 and 19 years ( WHO ;WHO 2009 ). Targeting adolescents with relevant vaccines offers three ben e- ts: catch-up on missed vaccinations, boosting of waning im- munity primary immunisation with new vaccines ( Brabin 2008 ;Mackroth 2010 ). The WHO recommends meningitidis ,Bordetella World 2014 ). recommend vaccinating adolescents against measles, mumps, rubella, varicella, hepatitis B and polio if they have not previously been vaccinated as a catch-up strategy ( Lee 2005 ;Society for Adolescent Health & Medicine 2013 ;World Health Organization 2014 ). Despite these recommendations, most LMICs are yet to implement adolescent-focused vaccination policies ( Shapiro 2007 ). Optimal vaccination coverage rates among adolescents would re- sult in reduced morbidity and mortality associated with vaccine - preventable diseases, as well as reduced disease spread to chi ldren and the elderly ( Lee 2005 ;Principi 2013 ;Zipursky 2010 ). The 2014 global statistics show that 25% of the world population (1 .8 billion) consists of young people aged 10 to 24 years ( Population Reference Bureau 2013 ), suggesting that optimal vaccination cov- erage among the large number of young persons would achieve enormous public health benets, which include reduced disease transmission through herd immunity and a healthier populat ion (Mackroth 2010 ;Zipursky 2010 ). A logical strategy for improv- ing vaccine uptake is the introduction of national routine ado- lescent immunisation programmes in LMICs. This strategy has been proposed by the GVAP 2011-2020 ( Decade of Vaccines Collaboration 2013 ). The Decade of Vaccines Collaboration states that \"the benets of immunisation should be more equitably e x-tended to all children, adolescents and adults\" ( Decade of Vaccines Collaboration 2013 ). Some high-income countries have reported high vaccine uptake among adolescents ( Principi 2013 ). In most LMICs, especially in sub-Saharan Africa, routine adolescent va c- cination programmes do not exist ( Shapiro 2007 ). In all settings, effective interventions are needed to increase and sustain hi gh and equitable uptake of vaccines among adolescents. Our review wil l establish the strategies associated with high vaccine uptake i n all settings and assess the applicability of these strategies in LMICs. Description of the condition Adolescent vaccination delivery strategy Most countries lack specic healthcare programmes for adoles- cents, leading to less contact between adolescents and the healt h- care system ( ; Wiysonge 2012b ). In many settings, adolescents usually turn to physicians only when they are ill and so there are limited oppo r- tunities to inform them that vaccines are important and should be administered ( Cawley 2010 ;Principi 2013 ). Healthcare provider advice that a vaccine is best administered as soon as possible in a vaccination centre only works for infants and children but not for adolescents ( Principi 2013 ). Adolescents are more interested in their current health condition than possible future vaccine- preventable diseases ( Principi 2013 ). Schools have been used ex- tensively as a delivery platform for vaccinating large number s of school-aged children ( Barry 2013 2010 2009 2013 ;Robbins 2011 ;Tsu 2009 ). However, school-based vaccination programmes may not be entirely successful in coun- tries with suboptimal school attendance rates ( Mackroth 2010 ; Warren 2004 ;Watson-Jones 2012 ;Zipursky 2010 ). School atten- dance rates in some LMICs are variable and often poor due to fac- tors such as geographical location, socio-economic status and gen - der (Mackroth 2010 ;Warren 2004 ;Watson-Jones 2012 ;Zipursky 2010 ). Strategies such as mass immunisation campaigns can be used to complement school-based vaccination programmes in set- tings with poor school attendance rates ( Clements 2004 ). Common barriers to adolescent vaccination The most common barriers to vaccination include lack of knowl- edge about vaccines and vaccine-preventable diseases, negative at- titudes towards vaccination from adolescents, parents, teache rs and healthcare providers, poor vaccine infrastructure programmes and nancial constraints ( Gowda 2012 ;Machingaidze 2013 ;Society for Adolescent Health & Medicine 2013 ). Lack of knowledge about vaccines and vaccine-preventable dis- eases in key role-players, such as parents, teachers, adolescen ts and healthcare providers, is a major challenge that hinders optim al vac- cine uptake by adolescents ( Brabin 2008 ;Cawley 2010 ;Gowda 2 Improving vaccination uptake among adolescents (Protocol ) Copyright \u00a9 2015 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by J ohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.2012 ;Harris 2009 ;Mahomed 2008 ;Society for Health & Medicine 2013 ;Wiysonge 2012a ). Parents (dened as one who nurtures and raises a child or a relative who plays the role of guardian) ( Oxford Dictionaries a ) are routinely involved in the decision-making process about vaccine administration to the ir children. T eachers (dened as a professional person who teaches or instructs) ( Oxford Dictionaries b ) can play a crucial role in adolescent vaccination uptake since school-based vaccination pro- grammes, where they exist, are a popular platform for vaccinat ion of adolescents ( Barry 2013 ;Tsu 2009 ). Healthcare providers give advice to parents and adolescents on vaccination. The ability of healthcare providers to keep up-to-d ate with knowledge on vaccines is essential, particularly when new vaccines are recommended ( Gowda 2012 ;Principi 2013 ). Health- care providers should continuously read the latest editions o f the WHO adolescent vaccine guidelines to improve their knowledge of vaccines ( World Health Organization 2014 ). Careful and fac- tual advice on vaccination to adolescents and their guardians by healthcare providers will result in more willingness to get v acci- nated. In some situations, the nal decision on whether an adolescent will be vaccinated or not may be entirely dependent on the par- ents. For example, adolescents, and in particular those at an e arlier age (10 to 13 years old) ( WHO ;WHO 2009 ), may not have an independent nal decision on whether to get vaccinated ( Barry 2013 ;Principi 2013 ). Therefore, educating adolescents about vac- cination may have long-term positive benets on vaccine uptake among this age group ( Barry 2013 ;Principi 2013 ). It is likely that more vaccine-informed adolescents may be more able than less informed peers to positively guide and influence their parent s and peers on vaccinations. In addition, adolescents are future par ents and investing resources in educating adolescents about vaccinat ion will likely lead to improved uptake of vaccines by their childre n (Barry 2013 ). Hence, adequate knowledge and positive attitudes towards vaccination among parents, teachers and adolescents ma y improve the uptake of vaccines among adolescents ( Gowda 2012 ; Mahomed 2008 ). Another factor that may influence vaccine uptake among adoles- cents is vaccine safety. Adolescents' fear of adverse events fol lowing vaccination may lead to less interest in getting vaccinated, res ult- ing in reduced vaccination coverage ( Principi 2013 ). The high cost of new vaccines and the unavailability of vaccines are known barriers to achieving high vaccination coverage among adolescents in LMICs ( Perlman 2014 ;Principi 2013 ). For exam- ple, although the high cost of HPV vaccines (two doses are re- quired) precludes access, continued price reduction for HPV will allow governments in LMICs to provide the vaccine to the target population ( Kaddar 2013 ;Perlman 2014 ). In Africa, several coun- tries, namely Rwanda, Uganda, Cameroon, Tanzania, Lesotho and South Africa, have introduced HPV vaccination to prevent cervi- cal cancer through school-based programmes ( Perlman 2014 ).Description of the intervention Interventions to enhance the uptake of vaccines by adolescents may be multi-pronged: Adolescents and their communities-oriented interventions Interventions to 'inform' or 'educate' enable adolescents and their communities to understand the meaning and relevance of vaccination ( Willis 2013 ). Such interventions may be delivered face-to-face or via written mail, telephone conversation, audio visual presentation or drama, printed materials, websites, multi-media campaigns or community events ( Willis 2013 ). These types of interventions may be directed at individuals, groups and providers and may include information about vaccine-preventable diseases; the risks an d benets of vaccines; where, how and when to access vaccine services; and who should be vaccinated ( Oyo-Ita 2014 ;Williams 2011 ;Willis 2013 ). Adolescents and communities may receive education about vaccines through prominently displayed poste rs in waiting rooms, brochures, e-mails and website resources (Stincheld 2008 ). Client reminder/recall interventions involve reminding members of a target population that vaccinations are due (reminders) or late (recall). Reminders and recalls are delivere d using various methods, such as telephone calls, letters or postcards ( Briss 2000 ;Oyo-Ita 2014 ;Stincheld 2008 ;Task Force on Community Preventive Services 2000 ;Williams 2011 ; Willis 2013 ). The contents of reminder/recalls may include personalised information related to a specic upcoming or missed appointment, or may be more focused on promoting general awareness of available vaccines ( Stincheld 2008 ;Willis 2013 ). We will not include adolescent reminder/recall of immunisation services in this review, as there is already a Cochrane review on this intervention ( Jacobson 2005 ). Adolescent or community incentives involve providing nancial or other incentives to motivate people to accept vaccinations ( Briss 2000 ;Oyo-Ita 2014 ;Task Force on Community Preventive Services 2000 ). Incentives can be rewards or gifts ( Task Force on Community Preventive Services 2000 ). Legislative interventions This involves a proof of vaccination record during school or college entrance. These are laws or policies that require stude nts to show proof of immunisation records prior to school admissio n; failure to do this denies admission ( Briss 2000 ;Oyo-Ita 2014 ; Task Force on Community Preventive Services 2000 ). Provider-oriented interventions 3 Improving vaccination uptake among adolescents (Protocol ) Copyright \u00a9 2015 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by J ohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.Provider reminder/recall interventions inform vaccinators that individual clients are due (reminder) or overdue (recall) vaccinations. Reminders may be delivered through client charts , computer or postal/electronic mail among many others ( Briss 2000 ;Oyo-Ita 2014 ;Task Force on Community Preventive Services 2000 ;Ward 2012 ;Williams 2011 ). We will not include provider reminder/recall of immunisation services, as there is already a Cochrane review on this intervention ( Jacobson 2005 ). Audit and feedback for vaccinators involves retrospectively evaluating the performance of the vaccinators in administerin g vaccines and providing feedback to them ( Briss 2000 ;Oyo-Ita 2014 ;Stincheld 2008 ;Task Force on Community Preventive Services 2000 ;Williams 2011 ). This information is given to providers to motivate them to improve immunisation services . Provider education involves giving information regarding vaccinations to providers to increase their knowledge and to encourage them to adopt positive attitudes towards vaccinatio n. T echniques by which information is delivered can include written materials, videos, lectures, continuing medical educa tion programmes and computerised software ( Briss 2000 ;Stincheld 2008 ;Task Force on Community Preventive Services 2000 ; Ward 2012 ;Williams 2011 ). Health system interventions Outreach programmes include school-based immunisation and mass campaigns. School-based immunisation outreach is intended to improve delivery of vaccinations to school-going children aged between ve and 18 years ( Task Force on Community Preventive Services 2000 ). School-based interventions usually include vaccination-related education o f students about either provision of vaccinations or referral f or vaccinations ( Briss 2000 ;Oyo-Ita 2014 ;Task Force on Community Preventive Services 2000 ). Mass campaign outreach programmes target adolescents both in school and out of school. For the age group that is out of school, mass campaign outreach programmes can be used to complement school-based vaccination programmes in settings with poor school attendancerates ( Clements 2004 ). Expanding access in healthcare settings to increase the availability of vaccines in the medical or public health clinical settings in which vaccinations are offered. This can be achieved using several methods such as: reducing the distance from the setting to the population; increasing or changing the hours during which vaccination services are provided; delivering vaccinations in clinical settings in which they were previously n ot provided (e.g. emergency departments, inpatient units or subspecialty clinics); or reducing administrative barriers to obtaining vaccination services within clinics (e.g. developing a 'drop-in' clinic or an 'express lane' vaccination service) ( Briss 2000 ;Stincheld 2008 ;Task Force on Community Preventive Services 2000 ). Reducing out-of-pocket costs. This can be implemented by subsiding the costs of vaccines, paying for vaccinations, providing insurance coverage or reducing co-payments for vaccinations at the point of service ( Briss 2000 ;Oyo-Ita 2014 ; Task Force on Community Preventive Services 2000 ). Multicomponent interventions Multicomponent interventions are approaches that include mor e than one intervention, with the aim of addressing a variety o f bar- riers and health concerns in relation to adolescents vaccine up- take. Such interventions would enable communities to be aware of the immunisation services available to them, demonstrate the utility and relevance of these services, provide community mem - bers with the knowledge and information base to effectively t ake advantage of the services, and to also incorporate a variety of asso- ciated provider or health system strategies to improve tion rates ( Briss 2000 ;Oyo-Ita 2014 ;Task Force on Community Preventive Services 2000 ). How the intervention might work A logic model of interventions used to increase adolescent vacci - nation and the associated health outcomes is shown in Figure 1 . 4 Improving vaccination uptake among adolescents (Protocol ) Copyright \u00a9 2015 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by J ohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.Figure 1. Logic framework on interventions for improving up take of adolescent vaccines No logic model or conceptual framework has been described that shows an integrated perspective on interventions to increase vacci- nation among adolescents. The evidence-based conceptual model of factors that influence HPV vaccination among adolescent girls has, however, been described ( Fern\u00e1ndez 2010 ). This model sug- gested a useful framework for examining the impact of persona l, interpersonal, organisational and broader community as wel l as societal factors on vaccination ( Fern\u00e1ndez 2010 ). Our logic model proposes that such factors, alone or in combination, will have a n influence on adolescent vaccination. Interventions improve vaccine uptake among adolescents throu gh the following: Increasing demand for immunisation services by adolescents, for example: interventions to inform or educate adolescents and/or their parents; interventions to remind or recall adolescents and/or their parents; nancial and non-nancial incentives for adolescents and/or their parents; and vaccination requirement for high school or university attendance. Enhancing access to immunisation services through provider-oriented interventions, such as: education, audit and feedback to healthcare workers;reminders and recall for healthcare workers; and supportive supervision of healthcare workers. Enhancing access to immunisation services through health system-oriented interventions, such as: reliable cold chain systems; improved vaccine stock management; regular outreach sessions, i.e. school based programmes and mass campaign programmes; expansion of vaccine services; and integration of immunisation with other health services. Increasing both demand for and access to immunisation services, for example multicomponent interventions. Why it is important to do this review There is a knowledge gap around interventions to improve vac- cine uptake among adolescents, especially in LMICs. Adoles- cents represent 25% of the global population. High-income coun- tries (HICs) have reported high adolescent vaccine uptake, yet in LMICs there are no existing programmes for routine vaccina- tion of adolescents. Our review proposes to evaluate the evid ence on the strategies that can be adopted to improve vaccine uptake among adolescents and to assess the applicability of these str ate- gies in LMICs. Such strategies will not only improve the uptak e of current vaccines among adolescents, but are also likely to increa se 5 Improving vaccination uptake among adolescents (Protocol ) Copyright \u00a9 2015 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by J ohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.the uptake of future vaccines against tuberculosis (TB) and HIV . In addition, this review will be used to formulate new policie s on the vaccination of adolescents where none exist and to advocate f or strengthening existing adolescence vaccination policies. We ar e not aware of any previous systematic review that has assessed in terven- tions to improve adolescent immunisation. However, a number of reviews have assessed various strategies to improve immu nisa- tion coverage in children or the whole population ( Jacobson 2005 ; Kaufman 2013 ;Oyo-Ita 2014 ;Saeterdal 2012 ;Williams 2011 ; Willis 2013 ). One review assessed the reminder/recall interven- tion in a whole population. This review only found one study o n a reminder and recall intervention in adolescents ( Jacobson 2005 ). The authors found that an autodialer intervention was not su c- cessful in signicantly increasing immunisations ( Jacobson 2005 ). In the other reviews, concepts such as vaccination strategy inter - ventions and barriers to immunisation have been well describ ed (Jacobson 2005 ;Kaufman 2013 ;Oyo-Ita 2014 ;Saeterdal 2012 ; Williams 2011 ;Willis 2013 ). In our review, we will use a similar approach among the adolescent population. O B J E C T I V E S T o evaluate the effects of interventions to improve vaccine upt ake among adolescents in low, middle and high-income countries. M E T H O D S Criteria for considering studies for this review T ypes of studies We will consider the following study designs: randomised con- trolled trials (RCTs), non-randomised controlled trials (non- RCTs), interrupted time series designs (ITS) and controlled be - fore-after studies (CBAs), which meet the quality criteria used b y the Cochrane Effective Practice and Organisation of Care (EPOC) Group ( EPOC 2015a ). We will include both individually ran- domised and cluster-randomised controlled trials. For cluster - RCTs, we will only include those with at least two interventio n and two control clusters. Following the EPOC Group criteria, we will include an ITS study only if outcomes are measured during at least three points before and three points after the inter vention, and we will exclude simple pre-post designs. For a CBA study to be included in the review, it must include at least two interven tion groups and at least two comparable control groups, with simult a- neous data collection. We will exclude CBA studies and non-RCTs that have only two study locations, in accordance with the EPOC Group criteria for inclusion of studies in systematic reviews of effects ( EPOC 2015a ).T ypes of participants Adolescents (dened as individuals aged 10 to 19 years) eligib le for WHO-recommended vaccines and their parents or healthcare providers. In the case of studies with interventions directed at mixed pop u- lations of children and adolescents, or adolescents and adults , we will exclude a study if specic data for adolescents are not repo rted. T ypes of interventions Intervention Adolescents and their communities-oriented interventions, for example: interventions to communicate with adolescents and/or their caregivers about adolescent immunisation; nancial and non-nancial incentives for adolescents and/or their caregivers. Legislative interventions: vaccination requirement for high school and university attendance. Provider-oriented interventions, for example: any intervention to reduce missed opportunity (e.g. audit and feedback, provider reminders); and health education, training and supportive supervision. Health system interventions, for example: interventions to improve the quality of services, such as provision of reliable cold chain systems, provision of tran sport for vaccination, vaccine stock management; outreach programmes, e.g. school-based immunisation outreach and mass campaign outreach for age groups that will be out of school; expanded services, e.g. extended hours for immunisation services; increased immunisation budget; integration of immunisation services with other services. Other interventions intended to improve adolescent immunisation coverage, including multi-component interventions. Exclusions We do not plan to include interventions to remind or recall recip - ients or providers of immunisation services, as there is alre ady a Cochrane review on this topic ( Jacobson 2005 ). Equity considerations The listed interventions are likely to have less or no impact o n ado- lescents who are not attending formal schooling ( Mackroth 2010 ; 6 Improving vaccination uptake among adolescents (Protocol ) Copyright \u00a9 2015 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by J ohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.Warren 2004 ;Watson-Jones 2012 ;Zipursky 2010 ). Therefore, we propose to assess other interventions aimed at non-school att end- ing adolescents, such as mass campaign programmes ( Clements 2004 ). For studies addressing school-based interventions or mass campaign interventions, we will conduct a subgroup analysis if sufcient data are available. Comparisons Standard immunisation practices in the study setting. Alternative interventions. Similar interventions implemented with different degrees of intensity. T ypes of outcome measures Primary outcomes Vaccination coverage (the proportion of adolescents who have received the recommended dose of the vaccine in a study). Secondary outcomes Cost of the intervention. Knowledge, attitudes and beliefs. Adverse events following immunisation. Adverse effects of the intervention. Incidence of vaccine-preventable diseases. Proportion of adolescents completing the schedule. We will include studies that meet the inclusion criteria but do n ot report the outcomes needed for this review and describe them in the table of 'Characteristics of included studies'. Search methods for identication of studies We will develop comprehensive and highly sensitive search str ate- gies, with the assistance of the Cochrane EPOC Group T rials Search Co-ordinator, for both published and unpublished arti - cles, with no restrictions on language or publication date. The search strategies for the electronic databases will incorpora te the Cochrane EPOC Group search studies ( EPOC 2015a ), combined with selected MeSH and free-text terms relating to adolescent vaccination up- take literature globally. Electronic searches We will search the following databases for primary studies up to 21. Sept. 2015:Cochrane Central Register of Controlled T rials (CENTRAL) 2015, part of The Cochrane Library ( www.thecochranelibrary.com ); MEDLINE, Direct; Scopus; Science Citation Index and Social Sciences Citation Index, ISI Web of Knowledge (for papers citing any of the included studies in the review). We will search the following databases for related reviews: Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (CDSR) 2015, part of The Cochrane Library (www.thecochranelibrary.com ); Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effectiveness (DARE) 2015, part of The Cochrane Library ( www.thecochranelibrary.com ); PDQ-Evidence.

Published by J ohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.Data collection and analysis Selection of studies T wo authors (LH and BK) will screen the titles and abstracts to select potentially eligible studies. We will then obtain the full text of potentially eligible studies and two independent author s will conduct the nal selection for inclusion in the review. We will resolve any disagreements regarding the inclusion of studie s by discussion or by consulting a third author. We will use a PRISMA flow chart to summarise the search and selection of studies for th e review. We will include a table of all included studies in the n al review and document the reasons for exclusion of studies. Data extraction and management T wo authors will independently extract data from selected stu dies using an adapted version of the Cochrane data extraction form. Disagreements on study selection and data extraction will be r e- solved by consensus between the two review authors, failing w hich a third author will arbitrate. Prior to use, we will pilot the data extraction form on at least four studies identied randomly f rom the list of included studies. The data extraction form will include the following eligibili ty cri- teria: Setting of the study (city and individual RCT , cluster-RCT studies. of participants: adolescents, caregivers, health providers. Type of interventions: frequency, timing, delivery method, venue of delivery, deliverer of adolescent and community heal th, health system and multi-component interventions. Types of outcomes measured: vaccine coverage (i.e. proportion of adolescents immunised in a population based on the different interventions), knowledge, attitudes and bel iefs, cost of intervention, adverse effects of the intervention, ad verse events following immunisation, proportion of adolescents completing schedule and incidence of vaccine-preventable diseases. We will include studies that meet the inclusion crite ria but do not report the outcomes needed for this review and describe them in the table of 'Characteristics of included studi es'. Assessment of risk of bias in included studies We will apply the Cochrane EPOC Group (non-RCTs), controlled before-aft er studies (CBA) and interrupted time series (ITS) studies to det er- mine the risk of bias of all eligible studies. For each included study, we will report our assessment of risk of bias, i.e. low, high o r un- clear risk for each domain, together with a descriptive summary ofthe information that influenced our judgement. T wo review au- thors will apply the criteria and we will discuss any disagreem ents with a third review author. Measures of treatment effect We will express the result of each study as a risk ratio with its cor- responding 95% condence interval (CI) for dichotomous data, or a mean difference with its 95% CI for continuous data. We will group studies with broadly similar types of participant s, in- terventions, study designs and outcomes to get feasible resu lts for an overall estimate of effect. We will analyse ITS studies usi ng a regression analysis with time trends before and after the in terven- tions. We will present the results for the outcomes as change in level and slope ( Ramsay 2003 ). Unit of analysis issues If investigators report cluster-randomised trial data as if t he ran- domisation was performed on the individuals rather than the clus- ters, we will request the intra-cluster correlation coefcient (I CC) from the study authors; failing this we will obtain external es- timates of the ICC from similar studies or available resource s (Campbell 2000 ). Once established, we will use the ICC to re- analyse the trial data to obtain approximate correct analyses . We will adjust the data by inflating the standard errors, i.e. mu ltiplying them by the square root of the design effect ( Higgins 2011 ). We plan to report the effect estimates and the corrected standard e rrors from cluster-randomised trials with those from parallel-grou p de- sign trials, noting that the analysis of data from that speci c study suffers from unit of analysis error ( Higgins 2011 ). If insufcient information is available to control for clustering in this way , we will enter data into RevMan using individuals as the unit of a naly- sis. We will then perform sensitivity analyses to assess the potential bias that may have occurred as a result of the inadequately con- trolled clustered trials. We will also perform sensitivity a nalyses if we obtained the ICCs from external sources, to assess the pote n- tial biasing effects of inadequately controlled cluster-rando mised trials ( Donner 2001 ). Dealing with missing data Where necessary, we will contact the corresponding authors of included studies to supply any unreported data. We will descri be missing data and dropouts for each included study in a 'Risk of bias' table, and discuss the extent to which the missing data cou ld alter our results. For CBA studies where relative measures a re not available, we will estimate the difference between outcome me a- sures at two time points for both baseline and after the inter ven- tion and then compare the difference between the groups. On the other hand, if ITS studies are incorrectly analysed by the auth ors and provide the data points, we will re-analyse ITS studies us ing 8 Improving vaccination uptake among adolescents (Protocol ) Copyright \u00a9 2015 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by J ohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.a regression analysis with time trends before and after the i nter- vention, which adjust for autocorrelation and any periodic cha nge (Ramsay 2003 ). Assessment of heterogeneity We anticipate substantial variation in study results due to d iffer- ences in the type of intervention, the type of setting, study d e- sign and risk of bias. We will describe in detail the anticipate d variation to be assessed based on clinical/contextual heterog ene- ity, i.e. the facility at which vaccination was provided (school or healthcare centre), high- versus low-income countries, gender di f- ferences, whether the recipients were healthy or not. School at ten- dance rates in some LMICs are variable and often poor therefor e we anticipate variation in equity with the type of interventi on that targets this group. On the other hand, knowledge of and attit udes to adolescent vaccination are different between HIC and LMIC vaccine recipients. We will examine statistical heterogeneity be- tween study results using the Chi\u00b2 test of homogeneity (with s ig- nicance dened at the alpha level of 10%). We will quantify any statistical heterogeneity between study results using the I \u00b2 statistic. We will regard heterogeneity as substantial if the I\u00b2 is grea ter than 30% ( Higgins 2011 ). Assessment of reporting biases We will use a funnel plot to investigate the risk of publicatio n bias by intervention type, provided 10 or more studies are include d in the analysis for each intervention type. We will critically e x- amine the funnel plot for asymmetry both visually and with th e use of formal tests. For continuous and dichotomous outcomes, we will use the test proposed by Egger ( Egger 1997 ) and the test proposed by Harbord ( Harbord 2006 ), respectively. In situations where asymmetry is detected by either test or by visual assess ment, we will perform further exploratory analyses to investigat e it. This will include reviewing the included studies for small sample s ize studies and their intervention effect. Data synthesis We will pool data from studies of similar interventions, sim ilar participants, similar outcomes and similar study designs in a meta- analysis using the random-effects model if there is no signica nt statistical heterogeneity, methodological difference or hig h risk of bias. If we encounter variation between studies in the report ed in- terventions, participants, study designs and outcome measur es, we will not pool the results but summarise the ndings in a narra tive format. We will report ITS studies as changes in level and slop e. If ITS studies are incorrectly analysed by the authors and prov ide the data points, we will re-analyse them using a regression an alysis with time trends before and after the intervention, which adj ustfor autocorrelation and any periodic change. Overall, we will in- terpret the study ndings by taking into account the methodolo g- ical quality of the studies and the strength of evidence. For ea ch observed effect, we will explicitly state the strength of evid ence and draw conclusions. 'Summary of Findings' table and assessing the of certainty of evidence We will use the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of evi- dence at outcome level ( Guyatt 2008 ). We will set out the main ndings of the assessment across studies in 'Summary of nd- ings' tables prepared using GRADE proler software ( GRADEpro GDT ). We will include the following outcomes in the Summary of Findings table: vaccination coverage, cost of intervention, kn owl- edge, attitudes and beliefs, adverse events following immu nisa- tion, adverse effects of the intervention, incidence of vaccine-p re- ventable diseases and proportion of adolescents completing t he schedule. The GRADE approach results in an assessment of the certainty of a body of evidence as high, moderate, low or very low ( Guyatt 2008 ). High certainty evidence implies that \"further research is very unlikely to change our condence in the estimate of effect\". Moderate certainty evidence means that \"further research is li kely to have an important impact on our condence in the estimate of effect and may change the estimate\". Evidence is considered of lo w certainty if \"further research is very likely to have an import ant impact on our condence in the estimate of effect and is likely to change the estimate\", and very low certainty if \"we have very li ttle condence in the effect estimate\" ( Balshem 2011 ). Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity Where sufcient data are available, we will conduct subgroup ana l- yses, which will explore the effects of: vaccine given including f re- quency of the vaccine; availability of a policy on adolescent vac- cination including vaccination schedule; equity (school-based in- terventions or mass campaign programmes); and country income status (World Bank classication as either HICs or LMICs). We will use the Chi\u00b2 test for subgroup differences to test for sub group interactions. Sensitivity analysis Where sufcient data are available, we will conduct, if applicabl e, a sensitivity analysis to establish whether the meta-analysi s results for the treatment effect are influenced by study designs and overal l risk of bias. We will perform sensitivity analyses by excluding st udies with a particular study design and studies with high risk of bi as.
