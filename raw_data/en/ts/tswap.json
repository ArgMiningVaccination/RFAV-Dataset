It is a symbol of the true perseverance of nature. Although this plant has a high value, it can be quite a troublesome for the gardeners. The dandelion botanical name \"Taraxacum officinale\" speaks for its usefulness and refers to the healing effect. Namely, 'Taraxacum' comes from the Greek and means 'anti-inflammatory' and 'officinale' refers to the common name for herbs. However anti-inflammatory effect is not the only benefit of the dandelion. Dandelion can help to fight inflammation, boost immune system, act as an anti aging agent in skin care products and even treat type 2 diabetes, cancer, and HIV. In this article we write about 18 benefits of the dandelion which are all backed by science. Traditional and Modern Uses of Dandelion According to Chinese old medical text (659 A.D), this plant was used at the time for example to treat indigestion, inflammation of the caecum and inflammation of the breast. In the West, the dandelion became known as a medicinal plant around the 10th and 11th centuries, when an Arab healer wrote about the usefulness of this plant in his medical journal. Once introduced in Europe, dandelion became a valued medicinal plant throughout Europe. In folk medicine, dandelion is referred to as the elixir of life because it purifies the body of residues and negative energies. Because of its cleansing effect, it is also called blood purifier, laxative agent, liver cleanser and fatigue remover. Today, dandelion is used to treat skin conditions, lymphatic inflammation, anemia, to improve gastrointestinal tract function and liver metabolism. The bitter ingredients in dandelion flowers are extremely beneficial to the body by stimulating the activity of the stomach and digestive glands, thus promoting the digestion of food. This flower surpasses any vegetable in its richness of nutrients. Dandelion contains: - Various acids necessary for organism (eg amino acids and fatty acids). - Sugars (eg inulin - which is necessary to form fructose). - Minerals such as [iron](https://ecosh.com/iron-deficiency-anemia-causes-and-12-main-symptoms-that-signal-iron-deficiency/), [zinc](https://ecosh.com/zinc-deficiency-symptoms-causes-risk-factors-and-natural-treatment/), boron, calcium, silicon. - In addition, vitamins A, [B](https://ecosh.com/b-vitamins-necessary-for-the-function-of-the-nervous-system-brain-and-cardiovascular-system/), C, [K](https://ecosh.com/vitamin-k-deficiency-symptoms-causes-risk-groups-and-the-best-natural-sources-of-vitamin-k1-and-k2/)and E. You can eat all parts of the dandelion - flowers, stems, leaves and roots. However, the root contains the most active ingredients just at the time of flowering. In addition, the roots include many beneficial and valuable substances that have a overall strengthening effect on the body, such as up to 15% protein, inulin, 10% glycoside taraxacin, Diuretic Effect of Dandelion Dandelion has been recommended to use as a diuretic. However, it is not yet known which substances are responsible for the diuretic effect (the increased production of urine). Some scientists have suggested that the diuretic activity of this plant may be due to the high potassium content of the leaves and roots. Although most conventional diuretics reduce the amount of potassium in the body, dandelion contains so much potassium that, despite its diuretic action, it does not lower potassium levels. What is a Diuretic? Diuretics are substances that promote diuresis, the increased production of urine. They are also anti swelling agents. Diuretics promote the elimination of electrolytes and water from the body through a variety of mechanisms, thereby reducing the amount of extracellular water. Some animal studies have shown that dandelion can help to normalize blood glucose levels. Also, it has an antimicrobial, antibacterial, anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. Tube studies have shown that dandelion extracts also have antitumor activity in liver, colon, and melanoma cancer cell lines. Dandelion Can Potentially Cure Cancer This mighty root boosts immune system and improves blood. According to Dr. Carolyn Hamm from the Windsor Regional Cancer Center in Ontario, Canada - dandelion root extract is the only thing that helped with chronic myelomonocytes. This form of cancer usually affects older people. For example, John Di Carlo, a 72-year-old cancer patient in a hospital, was sent home to die after all efforts to cure his leukemia failed. He told CBC News that as a last chance, it was suggested to him drink dandelion tea. Maybe it should have been the first choice in his treatment plan, because the cancer came back only four months later. His doctors associated it with drinking of dandelion tea. Recent studies have shown that dandelion root extract can work very effectively on cancer cells, as demonstrated by Di Carlo's practice. Within 48 hours after contact with the dandelion extract, the cancer cells began to degrade. The body replaced them with whole new cells. In addition, further studies have shown that the extract is also useful for other cancers such as breast, colon, prostate, liver and lung cancer. The taste of dandelion root tea is not as pleasant as other teas, but it is certainly more comfortable than undergoing chemotherapy or radiation therapy. Traditional cancer therapies damage the immune system by killing all cells, even the healthy cells. Dandelion root has the opposite effect - it strengthens the immune system and only kills diseased cells. However, Dr. Hamm warns that the root extract can negatively affect the effects of chemotherapy. Therefore, it is always better to consult your doctor about your diet and consumed food supplements. Eating Green Vegetables and Drinking Dandelion Tea Will Strengthen Your Health For example, dandelion roots and stems help fight diabetes. It`s because they stimulate the pancreas to produce insulin, which in turn stabilizes the blood sugar level. If you have digestive problems or you need to get rid of toxins, the dandelion tea may be exactly what your doctor prescribes as a herbal remedy. The liver produces bile in the digestive system and also filters blood from chemicals and other impurities. According to Dr. Ax, vitamins and minerals found in this plant help to cleanse and maintain the liver. These beautiful yellow flowers are also rich in antioxidants and vitamin C, which help the body fight infections such as bacteria that cause urinary tract infection. However, if you start to drink dandelion tea every day - you can defeat this health issue. Leaves are bitter but perfectly edible. The leaves are high in fiber, which helps improve bowel function. In addition, fiber reduces the risk of obesity, heart disease and irritable bowel syndrome. The leaves are also high in vitamin A - one cup contains 100% of your daily requirement. Vitamin A is critical for maintaining healthy eyesight and also helps prevent premature skin aging. If you don't want to eat a cup of bitter leaves, you can add them to your morning smoothie or salad. Mix them in your blender with your favorite fruits or vegetables that balance the bitter taste. 18 Benefits of Dandelion Backed by Science 1.
