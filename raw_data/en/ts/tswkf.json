Its embrace by Australians from all backgrounds, of all ages, and from all parts of the nation is perhaps the most rewarding aspect of the work of Council members, staff, and volunteers. On a crisp and clear Canberra morning on 4 April, I was privileged to participate with other Council members in the dedication of the Flanders Memorial Garden in the Memorial grounds. We watched with quiet reverence as sacred soil from Flanders was mixed with soil from significant locations and military heritage sites from each Australian state and territory and placed in the garden. This important ceremony was a fitting and solemn tribute to the men of the Australian Imperial Force who lost their lives or became casualties in the fighting around Passchendaele in 1917. The previous evening, the sacred soil had been marched past the names listed on the First World War Roll of Honour by Australia's Federation Guard and placed in the Hall of Memory, adjacent to the Tomb of the Unknown Australian Soldier. The Australian War Memorial safeguards the memory of those who served and died, and whose sacrifice defines what it means to be Australian. The Flanders Memorial Garden ceremonies demonstrated the continuing importance of the Memorial's role as the soul of our nation, and the national place for commemorating Australia's experience of war. As the Memorial reached its 75th year, Council focused on ensuring that the stories of the last 100 years were told and that those of the next 100 years could be realised. The centenary of the First World War is a priority for Council, with one of the most important initiatives being the delivery of the Spirit of Anzac Centenary Experience. Touring Australia, with the support of the Department of Veterans' Affairs, the Commonwealth Bank, and Telstra, SACE reached 23 locations and more than 368,016 people across the country. The connection to our history and culture felt by the visitors was evident from the many glowing expressions of appreciation the Memorial received from each local community. The reach of our commemorations of Australian sacrifice extended internationally with the loan of the Menin Gate lions to the City of Ieper. The dedication ceremony of the lions at the Menin Gate on the eve of Anzac Day reinforced the enduring relationship between Australia and Belgium, and in particular the people of Flanders, because of our shared history as allies in the First World War, and the extent of sacrifice in the Third Battle of Ypres in 1917. As we move towards the end of the centenary period, the Memorial is focused on ensuring Remembrance Day 2018 presents an opportunity for Australians to remember and reflect on the Armistice and all that came before it - to remember the 62,000 lives that were lost during the First World War. G ove r n a n ce 2 AUSTRALIAN WAR MEMORIAL ANNUAL REPORT 2016-2017 Looking to the future, it is essential that the Memorial offers past and present service personnel and their families and friends a place to reflect on their service and sacrifice, today - they should not have to wait a generation to see their stories told. Every member of Council is committed to ensuring we honour their service, preserve their heritage, and tell the stories of our Australian forces in accordance with Charles Bean's vision for a world-class memorial, museum, and archive. Council has a bold plan for the Memorial's long-term future, to ensure it can continue to deliver on its mission and purpose, and we welcome the government's approval in the May budget of funding for a business case to allow us to continue telling the stories of those who have served. The redevelopment concept will see increased and improved exhibition space, collection storage, and visitor amenities, as well as new galleries, an education centre for school visitors, a larger theatre, orientation space, and room for large technology from contemporary conflicts and operations. Council is committed to the development of the Memorial's long-term collection storage needs at Mitchell. Development of the Mitchell site enables the Memorial to collect significant artefacts from a generation of service as the Australian Defence Force replaces its technology on land, sea, and in the air. This investment will safeguard our priceless National Collection, and ensure that the stories of our current serving personnel and veterans are preserved and can be told. During the 2016-17 financial year, Council oversaw the Memorial's advancement of its strategic purpose and direction as outlined in the Corporate Plan. We have seen developments in the digital arena as we move to ensure the Memorial's stories are accessible to every Australian, and are internationally available. Council approved the Digital Engagement Strategy in November 2016 and has been pleased to see the popular and moving Last Post Ceremony broadcast daily to up to 200,000 viewers. The launch of the For Country, for Nation exhibition in September 2016 was an opportunity for all Memorial visitors to hear the stories of service and sacrifice of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples told in their own voices. This reflects the Memorial's commitment to reconciliation through its Reconciliation Action Plan, and work done over the last decade and more to identify Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander service personnel whose stories have not been told. Three important official history projects have progressed over the past 12 months. Volume V, The good neighbour: Australian peace support operations in the Pacific Islands, 1980-2006 of the Official history of Australian peacekeeping, humanitarian and post-Cold War operations, was officially launched on 5 July 2016 by the Hon. John Howard OM AC at the Australian War Memorial. The official histories of East Timor, Iraq and Afghanistan project is underway, and will document the history of Australia's involvement in recent conflicts. The Memorial has commissioned a history of the medical legacies from the Vietnam War, which will document medical issues, both physical and psychological, related to this conflict. Through the Memorial's focus on public engagement and outreach, the past year has seen continued interest in commemorating the sacrifice of those Australians who have served, with strong attendance at the national ceremonies of Anzac Day and Remembrance Day. Continued engagement, support, and recognition of serving personnel and veterans is essential in allowing us to properly tell their stories. From 16-18 August 2016, the Memorial shared a significant milestone with Vietnam veterans, helping them to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the battle of Long Tan and Vietnam Veterans Day. Over these two days one of the most special events was a private performance given by John Schumann of his iconic song, I was only 19, to the veterans in the Hall of Memory. A personal highlight of the year was the opportunity for me to meet our Memorial volunteers at their annual meeting in November 2016. The Australian War Memorial is blessed to have these many selfless men and women who volunteer their time to ensure this wonderful institution remains relevant to each and every Australian. On behalf of Council I want to thank retiring Council member, Ms Jillian Segal AM, for her service as Chair of the Council's Finance, Audit and Compliance Committee. The Council has welcomed Ms Margaret Jackson AC, who has been appointed for a three-year term from June 2017, and we were pleased to see the reappointment of longstanding member, Mr Les Carlyon AC, who has received a further three-year term on Council, also from June 2017. I was also honoured to accept a further three-year appointment. Council also gratefully acknowledges the three service chiefs (ex officio): Vice Admiral Tim Barret AO CSC RAN; Lieutenant General Angus Campbell AO DSC; and Air Marshal Leo Davies AO CSC for their contribution to Council. Their steadfast support to the Memorial is generously given and very much appreciated. AUSTRALIAN WAR MEMORIAL ANNUAL REPORT 2016-2017 3 Finally, Council would like to thank the Memorial management, Leanne Patterson, Anne Bennie, Tim Sullivan, and Brendan Nelson. In an environment of fiscal restraint and challenge, they continually prove their dedication to the Memorial and their professionalism. I would also like to thank the staff of the Memorial and the information officers who volunteer their time. Their tireless efforts and dedication to this wonderful Memorial is truly inspiring. Mr Kerry Stokes AC Chairman Mr Kerry Stokes, Chairman of the Council of the Memorial, and Ms Anita Herczegh attend a Last Post Ceremony commemorating Lance Corporal Luke Nathan Gavin. Mr Lee Hsien Loong, Prime Minister of the Republic of Singapore, and Mrs Lee Helen Loong visit the Australian War Memorial escorted by Dr Brendan Nelson and Mr Kerry Stokes. 4 AUSTRALIAN WAR MEMORIAL ANNUAL REPORT 2016-2017 The Memorial is honoured to welcome visitors from across the world including the President of Afghanistan, Ashraf Ghani Ahmadzai; Leidos Australia senior executives; Tshering Tobgay; Mr Christophe Lecourtier, Ambassador of France in Australia and delegation; Mr Kim Young-woo, Chair of the National Defence Committee, Republic of Korea and delegation; King Willem-Alexander and Queen M\u00c3\u00a1xima of the Netherlands. 5 G ove r n a n ce St r u c t u r e The Australian War Memorial was established as a statutory authority under, and draws its authority from, the Australian War Memorial Act 1980 (the Act). The Act allows for the appointment of a Council and a Director as Chief Executive Officer of the Memorial. The performance of the Memorial and the accountability of its Council and management are subject to the Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Act 2013, which imposes key reporting, financial, and pecuniary obligations on the Memorial and its Council members. Many of these are modelled on provisions which apply under corporations' law, particularly those for directors. The Memorial is subject to other acts that bear on its operation, and is accountable to the government through the Minister for Veterans' Affairs. It has a strong link to the Department of Finance for budgetary processes, appropriations, grants, and financial management processes, and it follows the advice and guidance provided by the Australian National Audit Office (ANAO). The Memorial adheres to Australian accounting standards in the preparation of its financial reports and follows best practice in its financial management. COUNCIL OF THE MEMORIAL The Council of the Australian War Memorial is established by section 9 of the Act. The Council is responsible for the conduct and control of the affairs of the Memorial, and the policy of the Memorial with respect to any matters as determined by the Council. In particular, the Council: \u00e2\u00a2 establishes the strategic direction and vision of the Memorial \u00e2\u00a2 approves the goals and key objectives of the Memorial \u00e2\u00a2 approves the annual budget and monitors expenditure and financial reporting, including for major projects \u00e2\u00a2 ensures agreed corporate objectives are met \u00e2\u00a2 adopts a strategic plan, which includes a business plan with objectives and key reporting measures \u00e2\u00a2 ensures the Memorial has adequate financial resources to meet known and planned future commitments \u00e2\u00a2 ensures that systems, processes, and internal controls are in place for effective management and monitoring of the principal risks to which the Memorial is exposed \u00e2\u00a2 ensures that satisfactory procedures are in place for auditing the Memorial's financial affairs and that the scope of internal and external audit is adequate 6 AUSTRALIAN WAR MEMORIAL ANNUAL REPORT 2016-2017 \u00e2\u00a2 ensures decisions made are consistent with the ethos of the Memorial \u00e2\u00a2 ensures that the Memorial communicates effectively with the public and key stakeholders \u00e2\u00a2 monitors and evaluates the performance of the Director. Council performance Council reviews its performance at least once a year in terms of the achievement of targets associated with the outputs specified in the Business Plan. A report on Council activities is included under Internal Output 1.9, on page 81. New Council members are expected to undertake orientation training before attending a Council meeting, and all are provided with a manual outlining the functioning of the Council in terms of applicable acts and members' responsibilities. Section 18 of the Act empowers Council to constitute committees to assist Council in the execution of its functions and responsibilities. Accordingly, Council has established three Committees: the Finance, Audit and Compliance Committee (FACC); the Remuneration Committee; and the Roll of Honour Committee. Council Committee membership The Chief of Navy, the Chief of Army, and the Chief of Air Force (ex officio members of Council) are usually not formally Committee members, but are invited to attend all Standing Committee meetings other than Remuneration.

In 2016-17, as we marked the 75th anniversary of that opening, we continued to keep Bean's promise to remember that digger and his mates. One hundred years on from that terrible battle at Pozi\u00c3\u00a8res, on 23 July 2016, we told the story of one of those killed there, Captain Ivor Margetts, at the Memorial's daily Last Post Ceremony. The hundreds in attendance, including His Excellency Mr Christophe Lecourtier, French Ambassador to Australia, and Her Excellency Mrs Menna Rawlings CMG, British High Commissioner to Australia, listened raptly as Australian Army Warrant Officer Class One Joanne Davey told Margetts's story. Importantly she shared more with the audience than simply Margetts's time on the battlefield. Through the diligent efforts of the Memorial's Military History and Last Post Ceremony teams Warrant Officer Davey was able to share with them his life before the war - his football prowess, his studies at Hobart University, and his work as a teacher at Hutchins School in his home state of Tasmania- and to bring him to life as someone we can understand and know today, one hundred years on and living in a vastly different world. I am sure that the unknown digger who inspired Bean's vision of the Memorial would be comforted by the knowledge that we do remember him and his comrades. I am certain too that he would particularly appreciate that we remember them not as faceless individuals or simply names on a wall, but as men and women with loved ones, friends, family, and a life given for us, our freedoms, and in the hope of a better future. No doubt Charles Bean would also be proud that his idea, conceived on the battlefield where Margetts and so many others died, has grown into a world renowned institution and a place of national pilgrimage for Australians of all ages and backgrounds. In celebrating our 75th year the Memorial has undertaken a number of important and powerful initiatives. In September 2016 we officially opened For Country, for Nation, an exhibition dedicated to Indigenous Australians and their service to this country. C o r p o ra te O p e ra t i o n s 10 AUSTRALIAN WAR MEMORIAL ANNUAL REPORT 2016-2017 Created with the assistance of the Memorial's Elders and Knowledge Holder Guidance Group and featuring works by Indigenous and Torres Strait veterans and artists For Country, for Nation tells the stories of the more than 7,600 Indigenous Australians to have served in war and on operations over the last hundred years. The Memorial has worked hard to recognise these men and women who, just four or five generations after the First Fleet arrived, living in a desperately unequal Australia, not allowed to enlist to fight for the young country that had taken so much from their people, denied their own aboriginality to sign up and defend it. They found in the Australian Imperial Force, many for the very first time, a sense of equality. And then, having served, returned to desperate social inequality which to a large degree continued to exist through to and including the Second World War. The recognition of Indigenous service has also been strengthened throughout the year by the acquisition of several important Indigenous paintings, notably Rover Thomas's Ruby River Massacre 1 and Queenie McKenzie's Horso Creek Killings, both of which provide much needed context for the service of subsequent generations of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders. For Country, for Nation remains on display until September 2017 when a new exhibition focusing on Australia's elite special forces, from the Second World War Z force to today's SAS and commandos, is opened. The Memorial also conducted many important commemorative events throughout the financial year 2016-17. Prime amongst them were Remembrance Day 2016, the 75th anniversary of the opening of the Memorial, Anzac Day 2017, and the dedication of the Flanders Memorial Garden. Remembrance Day saw 3,700 attendees, including the Governor-General and Prime Minister, gather to mark the anniversary of the end of the First World War. The Honourable Jeff Kennett AC, himself a national serviceman in the 1960s, gave the commemorative address focusing on the critical issue of taking care of our veterans after they have returned home. On the evening of Remembrance Day 2016 the Memorial held a dinner to mark its 75th anniversary. The Honourable Kim Beazley AC delivered an address on the history and the place of the Memorial. He opened with the famed words of the funeral oration given by the Greek general Pericles for his fallen men: \"They gave their lives. For that public gift they received a praise which never ages and a tomb most glorious - not so much the tomb in which they lie; but that in which their fame survives, to be remembered for ever when occasion comes for word and deed...\" These words were first used on the Memorial's stationery, including certificates given to those making donations to the Memorial during its construction, in the 1930s. Those words remain as true today as they did 75 years ago. \"We, as a country, owe our veterans the best possible care in return for their willingness to lay down their lives for our country and our freedoms.\" The Memorial also proudly conferred Fellowship status on three highly deserving individuals at the 2016 Dinner- Rear Admiral Ken Doolan AO RAN (Retd), Mr Lee Kernaghan OAM, and Mr Garth Porter. The Memorial is grateful for their efforts on our behalf and to Mr Kennett and Mr Beazley for their generous words on what was a very important day in the Memorial's history. On Anzac Day 2017 too those in attendance were privileged to hear a speech, of a very different kind, but also of the highest calibre, as Sapper Curtis McGrath OAM, Afghanistan veteran and Paralympian, told of his own experiences as an army combat engineer. An audience of over 38,000 stood in the dark, doing their best to ignore the cold and light rain, as Sapper McGrath shared with them the experience of losing his legs to an IED blast and the importance of the quality of the care he received to his recovery. In a speech none present will forget, as the rain stopped and the dawn sky lightened, he outlined and praised the care he received at every stage, from the battlefield first aid he gave himself to his 'DUSTOFF' to surgery in a field hospital to rehabilitation to the ongoing love and support of his comrades in arms, his friends, and his family. His courage and his Dawn Service address, like Jeff Kennett's words on Remembrance Day, provide a timely reminder that we, as a country, owe our veterans the best possible care in return for their willingness to lay down their lives for our country and our freedoms. Vice Admiral Ray Griggs AO CSC, Vice Chief of the Defence Force, gave the National Ceremony Commemorative Address before veterans and current serving members marched in the traditional Anzac Day March. Thousands of members of the public stood, once more in the rain and the cold, to pay their respects as the men and women who had served marched past. The dedication of the Flanders Memorial Garden occurred, in contrast to the Dawn Service, on a bright and sunny April morning. Made possible with the generous support of the Government of Flanders, it now stands in the Memorial's grounds as a reflection of the enduring partnership between AUSTRALIAN WAR MEMORIAL ANNUAL REPORT 2016-2017 11 Australia and Belgium, and a moving monument to those who lost their lives in the fields of Flanders 100 years ago. Inscribed with the words of John McRae's famous poem In Flanders fields it is constructed from Portland stone, the same material used at the Menin Gate in Belgium. The garden contains soils from five key battle sites in Flanders and 20 sites of significant military heritage from each Australian state and territory, and features symbolic flowers such as the Flanders poppy. Other major commemorative events to occur this year include plaque dedications for the Dominion Yachtsmen Scheme, the Australian Army Training Team - Iraq, Z Special, the 50th anniversary of the battle of Long Tan and Vietnam Veterans Day: Stand-to service, and the 75th anniversary of Bomber Command. Beyond these major ceremonies, many visitors make the pilgrimage to the Memorial, often travelling to Canberra for the primary purpose of doing so. In the financial year 2016-17 some 1.1 million visitors made that trip and a further 5,614,989 visited our website to plan their trip, learn about our military history, or research the service of family members. The Memorial's volunteer education and visitor services teams continued to provide outstanding service to this ever-increasing audience. Our education program continued to engage with our younger generation, with 118,338 (page 61) students attending on-site programs and a further 45,000 (page 62) participating in our outreach programs. Our front of house staff also supported our other key activities including new and temporary exhibitions. Amongst the latter this financial year has been The deceiving eye which shows how Australian troops were educated in the use of camouflage in the Second World War. The exhibit features one of the most generous Cultural Gifts Programs donations given to the Memorial in a number of years - the eX de Medici work Cure for pain donated by Erika Krebs-Woodward. In addition to sharing stories of service, it is also the responsibility of the Australian War Memorial to stimulate and challenge visitors, Australian and international, to see the world through the eyes of others. To this effect we proudly opened the Witnesses and survivors permanent exhibition on 30 November 2016 in our Second World War gallery. Through the work of war artist Alan Moore and using the words, images, and artefacts of some of the survivors who later emigrated to Australia, this important exhibition tells the story of Australia's connections to the Holocaust. Known as the Shoah to the Jewish community it was the worst genocide of the 20th century in which some six million people, mostly Jews, Roma, gypsies, the disabled and political prisoners, were ruthlessly exterminated by Nazi Germany, and it is time this story was told here where our national soul is revealed. This year also saw the Memorial's Spirit of Anzac Centenary Experience (SACE) complete the final year of its three-and-a-half-year program. Over that time SACE, serving as the flagship of national commemoration and generously supported by the Federal Government, Commonwealth Bank, and Telstra, visited 23 locations, from capital cities to regional centres, and was experienced by 368,016 visitors. I wish to thank Brian Dawson, the SACE Project Executive Manager, and his team of Memorial staff for their outstanding efforts over this time. The success of this exhibition is largely due to their dedication and hard work. The Memorial also produced a number of notable works in other mediums from Dr Karl James's latest book, Double diamonds, a history of Australian commandos in the Pacific, to the documentary Afghanistan: the Australian story on DVD. Original research of this nature, based on rigorous historical study and conducted by leading experts on Australian military history, informs all of the Memorial's public engagement programs and is an important part of how we engage with the community in its own right. Our National Collections branch has had another strong year, in addition to the acquisition of high profile artworks by artists such as Rover Thomas and eX de Medici, the branch has continued our highly successful Victoria Cross Centenary Project. Under this project the Memorial has been able to display 82 of the 100 Victoria Cross medals awarded to Australians in the Hall of Valour. We are grateful to the families, associations, museums, and other groups who have generously loaned medals to the Memorial for display during Mr Gary Oakley, national president of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Veterans and Services Association and Memorial Director Dr Brendan Nelson attend the unveiling of the newly-acquired Rover Thomas painting, Ruby Plains Massacre 1. 12 AUSTRALIAN WAR MEMORIAL ANNUAL REPORT 2016-2017 this period and enabled millions of Australians to see these important national icons. Behind the scenes our conservators and Military Heraldry and Technology teams have also accomplished some amazing feats this financial year, particularly in completing the four year restoration of the Memorial's Lockheed Hudson Mark IV bomber. The Hudson, one of the RAAF's workhorse aircraft in the Second World War, performing roles as diverse as bomber, transport, and trainer, has been fully restored to wartime configuration and is on display at Canberra Airport until 2018. The support of Canberra Airport and Virgin Australia has been invaluable in making this possible and we are grateful to them for their generosity. May 2017 saw the Memorial take a major step forward with a completely revamped website. The new site is much more accessible, especially on mobile devices, easier to use, and the systems behind it will support our long-term strategy of digitising our collections, including future projects such as 3D scanning of artefacts that we don't have the space to display in the galleries. The website is supported by the excellent work of our social media team, who have connected and engaged with millions of people throughout the world through platforms such as Facebook, Flickr, and Twitter, enabling us to share stories of service and have stories shared with us in return. I would also like to highlight the Memorial's new brand campaign - ...for we are young and free. This campaign, produced by our Communications and Marketing team, acknowledges that we are still a young country, and one that is free in large part due to the sacrifice of the men and women honoured here. The Memorial has carefully sought to manage its operations under sound financial management principles and practices, and to conduct its activities within the available funding. We continue to seek support from government and non-government sources and are grateful to those companies and individuals who have invested in the Memorial's vision over this financial year. We are particularly grateful to our generous supporters and partners, including BHP Billiton Sustainable Communities, Mr Kerry Stokes AC, Seven Group Holdings, the Seven Network, Boeing Australia, Qantas, Lockheed Martin, BAE Systems, Thales Australia, Kingold, RSL Victoria, RSL Queensland, RSL New South Wales and Services Clubs, Virgin Australia, Canberra Airport and individual generous support from Steve and Ruth Lambert. I also thank the Commonwealth Government, the Department of Veterans' Affairs, and the Honourable Dan Tehan MP, Minister for Veterans' Affairs, for their ongoing support. My deep appreciation goes to Mr Kerry Stokes AC in his role as Chair of the Australian War Memorial Council. Mr Stokes has been very active in Memorial events and ceremonies, and his leadership and support to management is deeply appreciated. I thank him and all members of Council for their leadership, oversight, strategic direction, and guidance. I am also grateful to the partners and families of our Council who have supported them, including attending many Memorial events themselves, over this past year. All that has been achieved this year would have been impossible without the hard work, enthusiasm, skills, and knowledge of the Memorial's volunteers and staff. Their dedication in delivering higher numbers and a higher standard of service to our community this past year has been outstanding, and I thank them for their professionalism and personal engagement with the Memorial's mission. The leadership and support of my Assistant Directors - Leanne Patterson in Corporate Services, Tim Sullivan heading the National Collection branch, and Anne Bennie overseeing Public Programs - has been the final ingredient in making 2016-17 such a success. Their hard work and expertise has delivered extraordinary results this year and prepared us well for financial year 2017-18. We have well-developed plans for the final period of the centenary of Anzac and for the Memorial's long-term future, and hope to develop both throughout the next financial year.

As at 30 June 2017 16 AUSTRALIAN WAR MEMORIAL ANNUAL REPORT 2016-2017 BRANCH DESCRIPTIONS National Collection The National Collection branch develops, manages, conserves, researches, and interprets the National Collection and makes it accessible through an extensive range of programs. The Memorial's collection is an invaluable resource comprising the historical and cultural artefacts of Australia's experience of war and our involvement in peacekeeping, humanitarian, and other operational service. It underpins the Memorial's capability to tell the stories of Australian service in exhibitions and other public programs, to educate and inform its visitors, and to meet the information needs of public enquiries, researchers, and academic and official organisations. Each section of the branch manages a particular collection type and provides management information services to provide the essential historical and cultural contact of the collection. The National Collection branch is comprised of Art; Military Heraldry and Technology; Photographs, Film and Sound; the Research Centre; and Collection Services. Curators in these areas are responsible for researching and developing the collection; ensuring that it is accessible, well documented, and appropriately stored and conserved; and that its significance is understood. National Collection's staff provide intellectual input to the curatorial development and interpretation of exhibitions and public programs, deal with public and official enquiries, engage in archival research and access, and make collection material available online. Collection Services staff provide expert services in conservation, storage, movement, and physical handling of the collection, as well as management of the collection management system. The branch also manages the Roll of Honour and Commemorative Roll, national and international loans of Memorial material, and donations of historically significant material. The Branch maintains liaison with the Australian Defence Force and its history and heritage units through the Collections Coordination Group (CCG), which enables the Memorial to maintain its traditions of collection in the field during current operations. Public Programs The function of the Public Programs branch is to engage all Australians and international visitors to the Memorial in commemoration through ceremonies, exhibitions, education, interpretation, digital engagement, and marketing services. The branch develops and undertakes activities to enhance commemoration at the Memorial and throughout the Australian community. It does this by conducting major and minor ceremonies to mark anniversaries relating to Australia's experience of war, in particular Anzac Day and Remembrance Day, and by producing and conducting the daily Last Post Ceremony to remember those individuals who lost their lives in conflict. Through the exhibitions program the branch contributes to the remembrance and understanding of the Australian experience of war by developing and maintaining world-class museum exhibitions incorporating audio-visual and interactive displays, relics, photographs, and works of art. The Memorial's goals are further supported through a program of changing temporary displays and exhibitions in the Special Exhibitions Gallery. The Memorial's Touring Exhibition program has been able to continue due to much-appreciated support from sponsors. The Public Programs branch conducts research to identify the needs and expectations of visitors and major interest groups, and evaluates the extent to which those needs are being met. It conducts a program of public events and a range of visitor services, including those provided by the Memorial's volunteers and historians. The branch develops and implements education programs that are linked with national education curriculum, both for delivery on site and as part of its outreach strategy. A focused digital experience strategy provides a deeper and more connected Memorial experience through further development of the website and use of social media channels. The branch is also responsible for seeking, managing, and servicing fundraising and sponsorship opportunities; developing and coordinating marketing initiatives across the Memorial; providing public relations direction and support; supplying authoritative historical research and interpretation; and researching and writing the official history of Australia's involvement in peacekeeping, humanitarian, and post-Cold War operations. The Public Programs branch has had the responsibility for coordinating many Memorial activities relating to the centenary of Anzac. Corporate Services The Corporate Services Branch is responsible for the delivery of a range of internal and external governance, compliance, and resource management functions. Implementation of government reforms relevant to the Memorial is also coordinated by the branch. The branch facilitates the management of the Memorial's resources, including staff, finances, facilities, information technology, and office services. It provides grounds and property management, and security and records management services. It is responsible for corporate planning and issues relating to administrative law, public liability, fraud control, risk management, and ethics. Corporate Services also manages procurement and contract advisory functions, financial policy, internal audit, and asset management. The branch is also responsible for management of the Memorial Shop and e-Business. Executive functions and ministerial and parliamentary liaison are coordinated in this branch. AUSTRALIAN WAR MEMORIAL ANNUAL REPORT 2016-2017 17 The Memorial hosted international guests including Ms Marillyn A Hewson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Lockheed Martin Corporation; Mr Chris Seed, New Zealand High Commissioner to Australia; Mrs Patricia Adam, Chair of the Committee of Defence and Armed Forces of the French House of Representatives accompanied by His Excellency Mr Christophe Lecourtier, Ambassador of France to Australia; King Abdullah II ibn Al Hussein and Queen Rania Al Abdullah of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan; Mr Ermias-Selassie, President of the Crown Council of Ethiopia; Mr Jean-Marc Ayrault, Minister of Foreign Affairs and International Development of the French Republic. 18 AUSTRALIAN WAR MEMORIAL ANNUAL REPORT 2016-2017 SPOTLIGHT Conservation of the Hudson Bomber A16-105 Growing up as a kid in Canberra and going to the Memorial on a school trip for the first time left many lasting impressions printed in my mind. One that stood out the most was \"Somebody actually flew that aircraft in the war\". While working on the Hudson project, fitting parts that I manufactured into the cockpit, I had the opportunity to sit in the cockpit seat of the Hudson Bomber to adjust an instrument into the correct position. Sitting there in the cockpit seat thoughts I had as a kid 20 years ago came back to my mind: \"Someone actually sat in this seat and flew this airplane during the war\". But this time I had these thoughts as someone who had the opportunity to work on the Hudson as a qualified tradesperson. A lot can happen in 20 years, but the feeling felt a day old. \"Sitting there in the cockpit seat thoughts I had as a kid 20 years ago came back to my mind\" It was a great honour to utilise the skills I had developed as a tradesperson to contribute to getting this aircraft to the spectacular standard it is in today. I'm sure the guys that flew the aircraft would be very happy with the job we have done. Martin Tanti Fitter and Turner Collection Conservation Team I began working on the A16-105 in mid-2009. The first step in what was to be the next six years of my working life at the Memorial began with the restoration of the Boulton Paul turret, piecing together the structure from components spread across several pallets and two large flatbed trolleys. This was followed by a two-week research trip to New Zealand with a curator, gathering information and components to complete the internal fitout of the Hudson. Several institutions and private owners allowed us full access to their aircraft and spares holdings, making it a successful and informative visit. We returned full of enthusiasm and began the challenging task of the full restoration, moving the aircraft from the store into the workshop, and taking on Kim \"Woody\" Wood for his expertise in aero structures. \"It is inside where the countless hours of work have gone, returning this airplane to what it was like in 1943.\" As the project went on we found original design blueprints, allowing the in-house manufacture of a lot more of the missing items, and a higher level of detail and completion than we had initially hoped for. Working through the various stages of the interior was challenging, but enjoyable. Of all the aircraft projects I have been a part of during 15 years at the Memorial, A16-105 is probably the one which the most work has gone into, and which I am most proud of. From the outside, apart from the new paint and Boulton Paul turret, it appears that not a great deal has changed. It is inside where the countless hours of work have gone, returning this airplane to what it was like in 1943. To be a part of a team working on such a great project was a highly rewarding experience, and one which is now proving to be a great ambassador for the Memorial in the lobby of the Canberra Airport. Jamie Croker Senior Large Technology Object Conservator and Aircraft Maintenance Engineer Collection Conservation Team AUSTRALIAN WAR MEMORIAL ANNUAL REPORT 2016-2017 19 Working on the Hudson was a privilege for me. Up until then I had not worked on aircraft before. This had me carrying out work that was outside my comfort zone: I had not had to fabricate parts in aluminium in such detail as was required by the supplied blueprints. It also gave me the opportunity to tune in to some upholstery skills that I had not used in quite some time, and to carry out paintwork on such a large scale was a challenge that I thoroughly enjoyed. The interest in the aircraft shown by people is awesome. Talking to family and friends about the project has brought out a lot of interest and a number of stories about Hudsons and aircraft in general. It has got regular people talking and reflecting, and through this people have been motivated to re-visit the Memorial to look over the collection. It has been good to hear that people had been out to the airport to look at our Hudson. Most were impressed by the team's workmanship and the logistics of how it ended up in there. I am hopeful that we will be able to recreate this kind of public feeling in the future on other projects. Mark Aitken Workshop Manager Collection Services Half a decade ago I was working as the production manager in a large hanger in Wangaratta, Victoria, restoring and completely rebuilding warbirds for wealthy customers all over the world. It was a demanding role, balancing the personal requests of customers and the aviation regulatory authorities in order to once again fly aircraft such as Hawker Sea Furys, P40 Kittyhawks, P39 Aerocobras and many more. Eventually the opportunity presented itself to seek a position at the Australian War Memorial and ply my trade as a licenced aircraft maintenance engineer and specialist in aero structures, restoring Australian aircraft for display into the future. My main project was the Memorial's Hudson Bomber now on display at the Canberra Airport. \"I am very happy that the Hudson is now on display in a space that provides access to many people and tells a little piece of the story that is part of our history as a nation.\" I am very happy that the Hudson is now on display in a space that provides access to many people and tells a little piece of the story that is part of our history as a nation. The greatest sense of pride for me is knowing that there are people in our community who once served this country using this equipment that can catch a moment of their youth and reflect. Rev Kim \"Woody\" Wood Large Technology Object Conservator Collection Conservation Team The Memorial's Lockheed Hudson Mark IV Bomber was unveiled at Canberra Airport in December. The aircraft, which had been in the workshop for four years as Memorial conservators worked to restore its December 1942 wartime configuration, was delivered in sections and put together by the Memorial's Large Technology team. 20 AUSTRALIAN WAR MEMORIAL ANNUAL REPORT 2016-2017 On 11 November 2016 staff and volunteers celebrated the 75th anniversary of the Australian War Memorial. A stonemason involved in the construction of the Memorial, Mr McJannet, provided recollections of his experiences, and Dr Brendan Nelson farewelled outgoing Memorial Chairman Rear Admiral Ken Doolan. 21 OUTCOME AND OUTPUTS STRUCTURE All Australian government departments and agencies are required to measure their performance in terms of Outcomes. These are the results, impacts, or consequences of their actions on the Australian community. The performance of the Australian War Memorial is expressed in terms of a single Outcome: Outcome 1 Australians remembering, interpreting and understanding the Australian experience of war and its enduring impact through maintaining and developing the National Memorial, its collection and exhibition of historical material, commemorative ceremonies and research. The Memorial's Outcome will be achieved through the maintenance and development of the national memorial and a national collection of historical material, through commemorative ceremonies, exhibitions, research, interpretation, and dissemination. The Memorial delivers 13 programs, five of which are internally generated, to achieve the Outcome.

In July and August of 2016 the Memorial commemorated the centenary of Australian service on the Western Front at the battles of Fromelles, Pozi\u00c3\u00a8res, Romani, and Mouquet Farm. August 2016 included the 50th anniversary of the battle of Long Tan. These events were primarily commemorated on-site through a number of commemorative events, a full account of which are on page 30, under \"Other Commemorative Activities\". The Memorial grounds have been enhanced with the unveiling of the new Flanders Memorial Garden which was dedicated on April 2017. International relations were reinforced with the loan of the Menin Gate lions to their original hometown of Ieper (Ypres) in Belgium. The Memorial farewelled the Mephisto A7V tank in June 2017. This rare German tank, on display in Anzac Hall, was on loan from the Queensland Museum from July 2015 as part of the centenary of the First World War program. Attendance by the general public was maintained, with 884,177 general visitors entering through the front gates. While numbers attending regular ceremonies and programs fluctuated in comparison to last year, already high satisfaction ratings for many galleries and activities increased by 2-6 per cent. The average time spent at the Memorial by general visitors has been increasing steadily during this period from 2 hours 9 minutes in 2014-15, to 2 hours 20 minutes in 2015-16, to 2 hours 27 minutes this year. The Memorial diversified its offerings with an increase in smaller, tailored events and programs. Programs and tours tailored to meet the needs of specific audience groups have been gaining traction. Preparations are underway and expectations are high for the commemoration of Remembrance Day 2018, the 100-year anniversary of the end of the First World War. Memorial preparations for the post-centenary period has commenced with the release of a new branding campaign and new website. New audience research was concluded to inform these projects and assist in tailoring them to the needs of the Memorial's audience. AUSTRALIAN WAR MEMORIAL ANNUAL REPORT 2016-2017 23 COMMEMORATION PERFORMANCE INDICATOR Whether people were actively involved in commemoration by attending the national Anzac Day and Remembrance Day ceremonies and other commemorative ceremonies held at the Memorial. The Memorial's Anzac Day 2017 Dawn Service and National Ceremony was attended by a combined total of 45,000 members of the public. An estimated 38,000 attended the Dawn Service and 7,000 attended the National Ceremony. Numbers for the National Ceremony were down from 2016 figures due to inclement weather. Visitors to the Memorial on Anzac Day were polled as part of on-site survey conducted throughout April as part of an audience segmentation profile project. The results showed that the audience profile for April 2017 was different from the typical annual profile, with more local visitors and including a broader, more representative ratio of demographic groups such as younger families and retirees. The Remembrance Day 2016 ceremony was attended by 3,700 members of the public. The Last Post Ceremony has been becoming increasingly responsive to the needs of veterans, families and other stakeholders. Last Post ceremonies were attended by 143,016 people, down 7 per cent on figures from the previous financial year. Wreathlaying ceremonies had a 15 per cent increase in attendance, with a total of 11,032 people - including 7,038 students attending school wreathlaying ceremonies, a 35 per cent increase; 1,087 more than last year. ACCESSIBILITY PERFORMANCE INDICATOR Whether a significant number of Australians visited or had access to the Australian War Memorial and its services, including exhibitions, touring exhibitions, collections, website, Research Centre, and research and interpretive programs. The Memorial's audience profile has continued to evolve. While the percentage of first time visitors to the Memorial was similar - 34 per cent in 2016-17 and 35 per cent in 2015-16 - there was an 8 per cent increase in the recent under-two-year repeat visitor groups (4 per cent for both \"less than 12 months\" and \"1-2 years\") and a 7 per cent decrease in the longer-term repeat visitor groups of \"5-10 years\" and \"10 years and over\" (also 4 per cent each). The Memorial's domestic profile was comparable to that of 2015-16 with slight increases in Victorian and Queensland visitors and increases in retirees over 65 years. Of those interstate visitors surveyed, the following were the main motivations expressed for visiting the Memorial: \u00e2\u00a2 holiday or leisure (34 per cent) \u00e2\u00a2 specifically to visit the Memorial (23 per cent) \u00e2\u00a2 as part of a visit to friends and relatives (21 per cent). General public front gate attendance showed a 5 per cent increase this year, program and event attendances fluctuated while satisfaction and engagement levels were equal to or higher than the 2015-16 reporting year. The Memorial's touring exhibition attendances have been lower as the program restarted in December 2016 with new funding for a number of exhibitions including For Country, for Nation. Overall, a combined estimated total of just under 1.105 million people visited the Memorial's Campbell site or storage facility at Mitchell. A further 14,454 visitors attended the Memorial's touring exhibitions at other venues.

The Memorial continues to track visitor perceptions of the importance of the Australian experience of war in creating and shaping the Australian identity during the centenary period. This year there was a marginal decrease in visitors believing that this was \"very important\" or \"extremely important\", from 83 to 81 per cent. Learning measures are included in all of the Memorial's dedicated exhibition exit surveys. The Reality in flames modern Australian art and the Second World War exhibition pushed the comfort zone of the Memorial's typical visitors \"Touched home physically, more literature and art and recordings on the home front. Much more dominant. Not a choice, this was a worthy war.\" \"From the artwork I would conclude it [the Second World War] reinforced Australian identity.\" \"Psychological impact of servicemen and women and their families. Constant fear of threat and closer to home.\" with the inclusion of modern and abstract art. It successfully used modern art to provide a different viewpoint on the Second World War. Around half of the visitors who visited the exhibition were surprised to learn that the Memorial holds these artworks in its collection.

AUSTRALIAN WAR MEMORIAL ANNUAL REPORT 2016-2017 27 CORPORATE PLAN STRATEGIC PRIORITY: Commemoration of the Australian experience of war. PORTFOLIO BUDGET STATEMENTS PROGRAM COMPONENT 1.1 COMMEMORATIVE CEREMONIES assist Australians remember the Australian experience of war and its enduring impact on society. Major national ceremonies, particularly Anzac Day and Remembrance Day, and other commemorative ceremonies are conducted in an engaging, dignified, and appropriate manner, with assistance provided to organisations conducting commemorative ceremonies. OVERVIEW Commemoration to mark special dates and events takes many forms. The Memorial delivers a comprehensive program that includes the major national days of commemoration, such as Anzac Day and Remembrance Day, other significant dates and events in Australian military history, and smaller, more intimate ceremonies such as the Last Post. The Last Post Ceremony was first introduced to commemorate significant military anniversaries and events. Since its inception in 2013, the ceremony has evolved into one of the Memorial's most poignant and venerated traditions. Now a daily event, the Last Post Ceremony tells the personal story of one of the more than 102,000 Australian men and women who died in service of their country and whose names appear on the Roll of Honour. The commemorative program continues to receiving an increase in enquiries. These requests are often accompanied by further specific and meaningful elements, in particular for the Last Post ceremony. Since the inception of the Last Post Ceremony in 2013, over 900 requests have been received to commemorate individuals whose names appear on the Roll of Honour. In 2016, the Remembrance Day National Ceremony attracted a comparable audience to that of the previous year. The Commemorative Address was delivered by the Honourable Jeff Kennett AC and explored the issues of mental illness, including post-traumatic stress in the Defence environment and the resources required to support it. Almost 1,000 students and teachers attended the National Ceremony, and 102 students from schools across Australia laid poppies in honour of the more than 102,000 Australian servicemen and women who lost their lives in wartime. On Tuesday 25 April 2017, the 102nd anniversary of the ANZAC landings was commemorated with the Dawn Service, National Ceremony, and a special Last Post Ceremony. Poor weather threatened the Dawn Service at which Sapper Curtis McGrath OAM delivered a moving commemorative address regarding his experience in Afghanistan and the commitment of service personnel to the concept of a DUSTOFF: Dedicated Unhesitating Service to Our Fighting Forces. The heavens opened up for the National Ceremony affecting audience attendance and march participation. The Commemorative Address delivered by Vice Admiral Ray Griggs AO CSC RAN highlighted many of the events of the Second World War and their impact on Australia and Australians. Students and teachers from Australia and from New Zealand attended the ceremony. PORTFOLIO BUDGET STATEMENTS PERFORMANCE TARGET Three major ceremonies: the Anzac Day Dawn Service; the Anzac Day National Ceremony; and the Remembrance Day Ceremony.

RESULT Met The Last Post Ceremony was delivered in all weather conditions on each of the 364 days the Memorial opened. Incorporated into the scheduling were more than 160 family requests and ten association requests. Over 60 ceremonies commemorated significant military anniversaries or annual dates of remembrance. There have been many memorable occasions at the Last Post Ceremony over the past 12 months. Examples include the 50th anniversary of Vietnam Veterans Day the visit from His Excellency J\u00c3\u00a1nos \u00c3der, President of the Republic of Hungary and the First Lady, which coincided with the ceremony to honour a casualty in Afghanistan, Private Luke Gavin. The ceremony was an extremely moving experience for the visiting dignitaries, family members, and others present. The Australian Defence Force continues to support the ceremony through the voluntary commitment of Defence personnel to read the stories each evening. Of particular note is the regular involvement of Australia's Federation Guard which brings a special ceremonial element to the ceremony twice a month and on significant anniversaries. In the past 12 months, the Memorial has begun live-streaming Last Post ceremonies for online viewers through YouTube and Facebook, providing increased accessibility and broadening audience reach. The Last Post Ceremony is a culmination of effort from various teams across the Australian War Memorial. Through their hard work and dedication the ceremony is delivered daily in a professional and dignified manner that ensures continual meaningful engagement with visitors and the Memorial's digital audience. OTHER COMMEMORATIVE ACTIVITIES 50th anniversary of Vietnam commemorations August 2016 marked the 50th anniversary of the battle of Long Tan and Vietnam Veterans' Day. The Memorial held a special commemorative program over the period 16-18 August to honour and acknowledge those who served in Vietnam. On the evenings of 16, 17, and 18 August 2016, photographic images from the Vietnam War were projected onto the fa\u00c3\u00a7ade of the Memorial. Also projected were the names of the key theatres of the war, and the names of the 521 personnel listed on the Vietnam Roll of Honour. On Wednesday 17 August, a special performance of I was only 19 was conducted by Mr John Schumann and the late Mr Hugh McDonald in the Hall of Memory for a group of veterans nominated by Vietnam veteran associations and federations from around Australia. This unique performance gave the veterans the opportunity to gather beside the Tomb of the Unknown Australian Soldier, in memory of men and women who served this nation in the Vietnam War, and to remember those that did not come home. This special performance was filmed and streamed live for public viewing on screens in the forecourt of the Memorial. Mr Schumann and Mr McDonald performed the song again at the day's Last Post Ceremony to all veterans, their families, general visitors, and school students to commemorate this significant anniversary. At 5.30 am on the morning of 18 August 2016, the Memorial's Commemorative Area opened to the public where cadets from the Australian Defence Force Academy and the Royal Military College Duntroon recited the 521 names on the Vietnam Roll of Honour. During this time, visitors were able to enter the Commemorative Area and place poppies to remember the fallen. Following this, a stand to service was held at 7 am on the Memorial's Parade Ground. Approximately 600 veterans, families, visitors, and invited dignitaries gathered in the stillness of the morning to commemorate those who served in Vietnam. The ceremony included an address by the Governor-General of the Commonwealth of Australia, His Excellency General the Honourable Sir Peter Cosgrove AK MC (Retd), who laid a wreath at the Stone of Remembrance with Her Excellency Lady Cosgrove. Wreaths were also laid by representatives of the veterans of the battle of Long Tan and the families of those that were killed in this action. Wreaths were also laid by the Presidents of the Vietnam Veterans Association of Australia, Vietnam Veterans Federation of Australia, and the New Zealand Vietnam Veterans Association. The Last Post Ceremony story on this day was of Private Kenneth Gant, a Long Tan casualty, and included a recording of him singing Oh, Danny Boy, a gift for his mother before he departed for Vietnam almost 50 years earlier. AUSTRALIAN WAR MEMORIAL ANNUAL REPORT 2016-2017 31 Commemoration of the 50th anniversary of the battle of Long Tan and Vietnam Veterans Day included a musical tribute to veterans in the Hall of Memory, a Stand-to service, and flyovers, featuring aircraft from the era. 32 AUSTRALIAN WAR MEMORIAL ANNUAL REPORT 2016-2017 During a special dedication ceremony soil from battlefields and war cemeteries across Flanders was placed in the Flanders Memorial Garden, mixed with that collected by the Returned and Services League from significant military heritage sites in each Australian state. Five hand-crafted boxes containing the soil were transported by members of Australia's Federation Guard. AUSTRALIAN WAR MEMORIAL ANNUAL REPORT 2016-2017 33 For Country, for Nation exhibition launch On 22 September 2016, the launch of the exhibition For Country, for Nation was held. Displayed for 12 months, this unique exhibition presents the story of Australia's experience of war from the perspectives of Aboriginal, Torres Strait and Pacific Islander peoples. Approximately 200 people attended the launch, including a number of dignitaries, members of the Memorial Elders and Knowledge Holders Guidance Group, and members of Indigenous communities. The launch commenced with a traditional smoking ceremony to welcome guests prior to a Welcome to Country by Mrs Roslyn Brown, Chairperson of the United Ngunnawal Elders Council. The Chief of Navy supported the launch with the participation of the Royal Australian Navy Indigenous Group, Bungaree. This group, comprised of officers and sailors of the Royal Australian Navy, represents clans and nations from as far afield as the Torres Strait and the Western Plains of New South Wales. The members assisted in leading guests to the launch from the Last Post Ceremony and performed as part of the official proceedings wearing a mix of traditional dress and naval uniform, representing their traditional and military heritages. Senator the Honourable Arthur Sinodinos AO representing the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition, the Honourable Bill Shorten MP, provided remarks prior to the exhibition being officially launched by Squadron Leader Gary Oakley, National President of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Veterans and Services Association, and member of the Gundungurra tribe from the Blue Mountains region of New South Wales. The formalities concluded with the performance of On Every Anzac Day by Mr John Schumann and Mr Rohan Powell. Mr Schumann was commissioned in 2015, by the then Chief of Army, Lieutenant General David Morrison AO, to write this song to commemorate Australia's Indigenous soldiers. Flanders Memorial Garden dedication ceremony On 4 April 2017, a ceremony was held to officially dedicate the Flanders Memorial Garden. Developed with the support of the Government of Flanders, the garden reflects the enduring relationship between Australia and Belgium, and is a significant addition to the Memorial's commemorations of the centenary of the First World War. The evening before the dedication ceremony, members of Australia's Federation Guard transported five hand-crafted boxes containing soil from battlefields and war cemeteries across Flanders, from the Memorial forecourt into the Commemorative Area. The boxes were brought past the names listed on the First World War Roll of Honour and placed in the Hall of Memory. Resting adjacent to the Tomb of the Unknown Australian Soldier, they remained in symbolic vigil overnight. The following morning the boxes were collected by Australia's Federation Guard and taken to the official dedication ceremony, where the soil was placed in the garden by the Governor-General of the Commonwealth of Australia, His Excellency General the Honourable Sir Peter Cosgrove AK MC (Retd), the Secretary General of the Flanders Department of Foreign Affairs, Mr Koen Verlaeckt, the Chief of Army, Lieutenant General Angus Campbell DSC AM, the Regimental Sergeant Major of the Army, Warrant Officer Don Spinks OAM, and junior Legatees Thomas and Katherine Grice. Soil collected from key First World War heritage sites in each state and territory of Australia was placed in the garden by branch representatives of the Returned and Services League of Australia. The dedication included a traditional smoking ceremony, conducted by Ngunnawal Elder Ms Tina Brown to cleanse the foreign soil, enabling the spirits within to rest easy on Ngunnawal country within the grounds of the Memorial. Council member Wing Commander Sharon Bown (Retd) recited the commemorative poem by John McCrae In Flanders fields, the words of which are inscribed on the Flanders Memorial Garden. Adjacent to the garden is an interpretive panel which features a quote from British Field Marshal Lord Plumer who dedicated the Ieper (Menin Gate) Memorial, in 1927: \"It can be said of each one in whose honour we are assembled here today: He is not missing; he is here.\" VIP visits The Memorial conducted over 100 VIP visits in 2016-17 including visits by Their Majesties King Abdullah Il bin Al-Hussein and Queen Rania Al Abdullah of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, and Their Majesties King Willem-Alexander and Queen M\u00c3\u00a1xima of the Netherlands. A complete list of VIP visits and ceremonies is provided at Appendix 3. 34 AUSTRALIAN WAR MEMORIAL ANNUAL REPORT 2016-2017 PLAQUE DEDICATION PROGRAM To date, 220 commemorative plaques have been installed in the Memorial's grounds. All commemorative plaque records are released to the Memorial's website, with each record including a site map featuring a photograph and description of the plaque, along with its general location within the grounds. The program was closed in June 2015 with all current applications from that time progressed. With so many plaques now installed, only new requests from more recent conflicts are considered. Four commemorative plaques were installed during the year: Z-Special On 1 August 2016, a plaque dedication ceremony was held commemorating the service and sacrifice of members of Z Special Unit, Special Operations Australia. The Z Special Unit was a secret element of the Australian military forces, and an administrative and holding unit for Australian soldiers serving with Special Operations Australia during the Second World War. The plaque dedication attracted an audience of 1,100 including Z Special veterans, widows, siblings and other family members who had travelled from around Australia and New Zealand to attend this significant ceremony. During the proceedings, Air Chief Marshal Mark Binskin AC, Chief of the Defence Force, read a message on behalf of the Governor-General of the Commonwealth of Australia, His Excellency, General the Honorable Sir Peter Cosgrove AK MC (Retd) paying special tribute to the dedication and sacrifice of the men of Z Special Unit. The commemorative plaque was unveiled by Z Special veterans Mr Jack Tredea MM and Mr Jim Ellwood. Dominion Yachtsman Scheme On 4 May 2017, a plaque dedication ceremony was held commemorating the service and sacrifice of members of the Dominion Yachtsman Scheme. Recruited to the Royal Australian Navy Volunteer Reserve through yacht clubs, roughly 500 Australian volunteers served over a period of 60 years in the Atlantic and Arctic seas on convoy duty, and in the Mediterranean and Persian Gulf on special operations and bomb disposal. Seventy family members of those who served in the Dominion Yachtsmen Scheme travelled from around Australia to attend this plaque dedication ceremony. Special Operations Command On 29 May 2017, a plaque dedication ceremony was held commemorating the service and sacrifice of members of the Special Operations Command units.

AUSTRALIAN WAR MEMORIAL ANNUAL REPORT 2016-2017 35 Ceremonies conducted in the Memorial grounds included the Nurses and Midwives Wreathlaying Ceremony, and a Commemorative Plaque Dedication Ceremony in recognition of the service and sacrifice of members of the Z Special Unit. 36 AUSTRALIAN WAR MEMORIAL ANNUAL REPORT 2016-2017 Ceremonies were conducted to dedicate plaques to the Australian Army Training Team Iraq Association, and the Dominion Yachtsmen Scheme. The Memorial held a wreathlaying ceremony in recognition of the work of Legacy during the National Launch of Legacy Week. AUSTRALIAN WAR MEMORIAL ANNUAL REPORT 2016-2017 37 High-quality building, garden, and grounds presentation remains a top priority for the Memorial. The ongoing maintenance program ensures that the grounds and buildings are presented to the highest possible standard. Replacement of trees and other plantings was undertaken as required, as was maintenance of all sculptures and memorials, buildings, and the Pool of Reflection. A major refurbishment of the Commemorative Area has been completed. The original, badly weathered sandstone stringcourse and carved figures have been replaced to preserve the appearance and heritage value of the site. The project was generously supported by the Department of Environment through a $1 million grant from the Protecting CORPORATE PLAN STRATEGIC PRIORITY: Building the Memorial. PORTFOLIO BUDGET STATEMENTS PROGRAM COMPONENT 1.2 THE NATIONAL MEMORIAL AND GROUNDS assists Australians remember the Australian experience of war and its enduring impact on society. The Memorial building and grounds are conserved and developed as a national memorial to Australians who served and died in war. OVERVIEW The Memorial buildings and grounds are maintained as important commemorative areas. The Flanders Memorial Garden was installed in a location in the Western Precinct Sculpture Garden and within the Campbell precinct Site Development Plan (SDP). The garden included soil sourced from the First World War cemeteries in Flanders in which many soldiers found their resting place, and from locations around Australia. A full report of the Flanders Memorial Garden is at page 33, under \"Other Commemorative Activities\". A sculpture has been commissioned to commemorate General Sir John Monash and his significance as an outstanding Australian commander and general of the First World War. Planning for a families sculpture dedicated to recognising the families of Australians who have served in war, peacekeeping, and humanitarian operations is in the design stages, and is expected to be dedicated in July 2018. Tarin Kowt and Camp Holland memorials from Defence bases in Afghanistan have been installed as permanent structures in the western grounds. The five-year cycle for an update of the Campbell Site Development Plan has commenced, with the Johnson Pilton Walker review to be completed in 2017. Four new dedication plaques were placed in the western and eastern precincts, and a new plaque plinth has been approved for construction alongside the western access path to accommodate new plaques. See page 34 for further details. Enhancements to the Roll of Honour, with the additions of names previously not included or misspelled, have been implemented. Improvements to the way-finding and presentation of the Commemorative Roll was completed late 2016. Heritage and aesthetic considerations of the Commemorative Area remain important, as they enhance the visitor experience. These considerations are carefully managed in alignment with the Memorial's Heritage Management Plan. PORTFOLIO BUDGET STATEMENTS PERFORMANCE TARGET The Memorial heritage building, Commemorative Area, and surrounding grounds maintained and presented to the highest standard. RESULT Met Satisfied Very Satisfied Memorial Grounds Commemorative Area Overall Satisfaction Level Percentage of Satisfaction 100 90 80 70 40 30 20 10 0 60 50 FIGURE 3: Visitor satisfaction levels with the Memorial Grounds and Commemorative Area, 2016-17 Source: 2016-17 General Visitor Survey 38 AUSTRALIAN WAR MEMORIAL ANNUAL REPORT 2016-2017 National Historic Sites program. The works also included replacement and waterproofing of the Commemorative Area garden beds and re-grouting of the Christmas Bush granite flooring and the Pool of Reflection. As part of the Commemorative Area reconstruction project, new drainage and planter boxes have been installed. This will reduce the risk of damage to the building due to failing waterproofing and inadequate drainage. Detailed garden maintenance of the Commemorative Area and the Memorial courtyard on a weekly basis continues to keep these high-profile formal gardens at their best. The maintenance regime for the Pool of Reflection in the Commemorative Area and for the National Service Memorial Fountain in the courtyard continues at a high standard and has reduced conservation requirements. PORTFOLIO BUDGET STATEMENTS PERFORMANCE TARGET Access to the Memorial and visitor facilities of the highest standards. RESULT Met The implementation of the Campbell Site Development Plan continued this year, along with various minor new site developments for visitor amenities. A full width access platform was installed in the Commemorative Area entrance, using Christmas Bush granite sourced from the original quarry to ensure the works were sympathetic to the heritage aesthetic of the area. The work was designed in line with heritage and building code requirements. Design and documentation has commenced on the southern commemorative area stairs to upgrade the handrails, improve lighting for evening and night events, and meet safety and legislated requirements. Sixteen additional light poles have been installed across the Campbell Site, providing increased security and safety for the public, as well as many being fitted with power and data outlets to improve facilities for events. PORTFOLIO BUDGET STATEMENTS PERFORMANCE TARGET Building works that comply with relevant standards, codes, and regulations. RESULT Met All building works undertaken at the Memorial are in accordance with relevant standards, codes, and regulations. PORTFOLIO BUDGET STATEMENTS PERFORMANCE TARGET Management and conservation of heritage elements using the Australia ICOMOS Burra Charter. RESULT Met Memorial staff continue to liaise with heritage specialists as required to seek advice for building works in heritage-sensitive areas. An ongoing maintenance and conservation regime is in place to protect and repair the stonework in the Memorial building. Over the course of this year, this work included the removal of algal deposits from the sandstone; conservation and repair of chipped and damaged stone behind the Merchant Navy Sculpture; ceiling repairs above Airman and Sailor sculptures; rejuvenation of the grout in the Hall of Memory; and conservation and re-grouting of sandstone in the Hall of Valour. A regular maintenance regime ensures the longevity of the Lone Pine tree (Pinus halepensis). A replacement Pinus halepensis, derived from a seed taken from the original Lone Pine, was planted by Their Royal Highnesses The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge on Anzac Day 2014. It is anticipated that this tree will have grown to a suitable size when the original Lone Pine reaches senescence. The new pine is in a very healthy state, assisted by the fence and bird netting which will be expanded in the coming year. See also \"Heritage Management\" on page 98, Part 5. PORTFOLIO BUDGET STATEMENTS PERFORMANCE TARGET Timely completion of works to minimise impact on visitors. RESULT Met All minor works at the Memorial, including regular maintenance, cleaning, and conservation of the main building, are scheduled out of hours where possible and in consideration of significant public events. Any major works that may be disruptive are scoped and planned to ensure that intrusive elements of the work are scheduled at the most appropriate times, that alternative arrangements for visitors are made, and that the public is informed. As noted above, the two-year Commemorative Area Reconstruction Project has been completed. The area's significance and values have been preserved by removing deteriorating portions of sandstone, especially the string course and sculptural elements of the east and west AUSTRALIAN WAR MEMORIAL ANNUAL REPORT 2016-2017 39 walls, and reconstructing them with matching sandstone. Improving the drainage of the cloisters and gardens preserves their functionality as well as protecting the reconstructed stonework and the Memorial's lower galleries from water damage. PLAQUE DEDICATION PROGRAM Four commemorative plaques were installed during the year. Full details of these dedications can be found at page 34. ROLL OF HONOUR The Memorial's bronze Roll of Honour panels were updated for accuracy, with two in situ amendments made. CORPORATE PLAN STRATEGIC PRIORITY: Creating and sharing knowledge, expertise and the National Collection. PORTFOLIO BUDGET STATEMENTS PROGRAM COMPONENT 1.3 THE NATIONAL COLLECTION assists Australians remember the Australian experience of war and its enduring impact on society. A national collection of historical material related to Australia's military history that is developed, managed, preserved, and interpreted to make it accessible. OVERVIEW The centenary of the First World War and the associated theme of commemorating a century of service has generated an unprecedented level of engagement with the National Collection. As well as supporting Australians at home and overseas to understand the significance of milestones in the story of Australia in the First World War, National Collection staff have supported public engagement with the stories of significant anniversaries for the Second World War, Korea, Vietnam, the Gulf War, and peacekeeping operations. National Collection staff are also focused on ensuring the stories and artefacts of service of current and recent conflicts and operations around the world are collected. We are grateful for the support of the ADF in enabling National Collection staff to be deployed with colleagues in the ADF's history and heritage units into areas where Australians are serving. In the tradition of Charles Bean and John Treloar, staff are engaged in the field identifying and collecting objects and stories that relate to those operations, the people engaged in them, and their reflections on their experiences. The Memorial is grateful for collaboration with the ADF through the Collections Coordination Group, which facilitates the liaison between the Memorial and the ADF's branch history and heritage units. The Defence Capability Acquisition and Sustainment Group (CASG) provides technical expertise and project management in supporting the transfer of assets to the National Collection. We have been able to regularly commission Official War Artists to travel into operational areas, which is particularly significant in the centenary of the Official War Art program, created through the efforts of Charles Bean in 1917. Planning for a new 5,000 square metre storage facility at Mitchell is well advanced, with completion expected in December 2018. The new facility will accommodate the large technology collections, including aircraft and a number of new acquisitions relevant to contemporary and recent operations: two naval helicopters (a Seahawk and a Squirrel), an army Blackhawk, an FA18, and a P3C Orion will be acquired between 2018 and 2021. A number of land capability vehicles from operations in the Solomon Islands, East Timor, Iraq, and Afghanistan have been received. The new facility will enable a review of storage of large technology at Mitchell to make the best use of available space. The new textiles store has been operating successfully with new compactus, environmental and security controls, and new procedures to maintain its status as a clean store. Refurbishments of space in the Treloar A building and armoury have improved security and the general storage environment, and significantly reduced the risk of overcrowding. The project to clear an accumulation of undocumented items in transit and temporary stores has been completed. New procedures for managing donations of historical material are in place to ensure timely turnaround of documentation for donors, introduction of conservation assessments to better manage risk to the collection, centralisation of documentation on the collection management system, and a significant gain in efficiency from providing guidance to potential donors before material is delivered to the Memorial. These procedures will now be extended to include all acquisitions to ensure systematic documentation, risk management, and financial compliance. The project also led to new procedures for managing radiation hazards in items such as luminous dials and watches, certain kinds of lenses and metal hardeners, and electronic equipment. 40 AUSTRALIAN WAR MEMORIAL ANNUAL REPORT 2016-2017 The movement of the Menin Gate Lions to their original home at the Menin Gate Memorial in Ieper was a major undertaking of conservation and logistics. The lions will stand at the Menin Gate through the centenary of the battles in Flanders in which Australians suffered so heavily in 1917. The Memorial thanks the Royal Australian Air Force, the Commonwealth War Graves Commission, the Government of Flanders, and the City of Ieper for their support in this major international collaboration. There was a significant increase in the number of loan requests and items on loan with communities around Australia, and to overseas museums, galleries, and diplomatic posts commemorating events relating to the century of service and the First World War. The Victoria Cross Project has sought to display as many of the 100 Victoria Crosses awarded to Australians as possible in the Hall of Valour during the Centenary. So far, with the support of private owners and other cultural institutions for loans of the medal, a total of 82 Australian Victoria Crosses are on display at the Memorial. Linked to that project was the acquisition - courtesy of the generosity of the Department of Defence - of the weapons used by Corporals Mark Donaldson VC and Dan Keighran VC in the actions for which they were awarded the VC in Afghanistan. The Memorial already holds the weapons used by Corporals Ben Roberts-Smith VC MG and Cameron Baird VC MG, both of which are on display in the Hall of Valour. We were privileged to conduct oral histories with Keith Payne VC AM and his wife Florence Payne OAM on their careers and lives working to support veterans. A partnership with the Anangu Pitjantjatjara Yankunytjatjara (APY) Art Collective has produced a major new work for the National Collection exploring the theme of \"defence of country\" from an Aboriginal Australian perspective. The work is the product of a collaboration by more than 20 of the most senior artists from communities across the APY lands. Eight commissions with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander artists for the For Country, for Nation exhibition added significant new bodies of work to the Memorial's collection relating to the service of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in or supporting the Australian Defence Force. Two major acquisitions were subsequently included in the exhibition: Ruby Plains Massacre 1 by Rover Thomas, and Horso Creek Killings by Queenie McKenzie which tell stories of the violence against Aboriginal people that occurred even as they were enlisting in the armed forces. The first of a series of international engagements began with a reciprocal artist in residence program with the National Museum of Singapore (NMS). Australian artist Angela Tiatia and Singaporean artist Debbie Ding spent a month working together in Singapore and at the Memorial researching the collections to make new work interpreting the shared history of our countries in the Second World War to mark the 75th anniversary of the Fall of Singapore and all that it meant for our two nations. The Memorial is grateful for the support of the Anzac Centenary Arts and Culture Fund for its support of this program. Ben Quilty was commissioned to create a new series of works on the emotional impact of war. Called The longest war, the series depicts three women directly affected by the loss or injury of a loved one in Afghanistan. Renowned singer/songwriter, John Schumann, and his long-time friend and collaborator, the late Hugh McDonald, performed I was only 19 to Vietnam veterans in the Hall of Memory on Vietnam Veterans Day on the 50th anniversary of the Battle of Long Tan. Cinematographer Rhys Graham was commissioned to capture the performance and record video portraits with the veterans. Charles Bean's unfulfilled ambition to create an art gallery of the Official War Art Scheme is being brought to life -virtually. An online exhibition entitled Art of nation, is under development which will enable visitors to encounter the First World War art collection as Bean intended it to be displayed, view the paintings, click through to map views and historical images to compare landscapes and locations with their appearance today, and to track the journeys of featured artists through the theatres of the First World War. Created in November 2015, the Operational Records Working Group (ORWG) is the principal liaison point between the Department of Defence and the National Archives of Australia, and the Memorial in managing the transfer of relevant official records to the National Collection. Digitisation of official records progresses on the basis of conservation need, demand and availability. New releases included Royal Australian Navy reports of proceedings, and army vehicle registration books containing details for tanks, assault vehicles, armoured vehicles, machine-gun carriers, 15 cwt trucks, scout cars, and jeeps between 1938 and 1993. Official War Artist files relating to Ivor Hele, Frank Norton, Bruce Fletcher, Ken McFadyen, and Will Dyson were digitised and published online. Work is underway to create a nominal roll for the Malayan Emergency and Indonesian Confrontation from authoritative archival sources. This will be digitised, indexed, transcribed, and published online in a searchable format. The Anzac connections program to digitise the diaries and letters of Australians who served with the Australian Imperial Force during the First World War continued with newly digitised collections relating to doctors and musical AUSTRALIAN WAR MEMORIAL ANNUAL REPORT 2016-2017 41 This year we were very pleased to add to the following items to the National Collection: artwork by Ben Quilty; a donated manuscript from former POW Alexander \"Alick\" Russell Downer; Aircraftman Brodie McIntyre's didgeridoo; the flying log book belonging to Sergeant Len Dorricott, observer and air gunner with 460 Squadron \"G for George\"; the headstones of George Cross recipients killed in the Cowra Breakout. 42 AUSTRALIAN WAR MEMORIAL ANNUAL REPORT 2016-2017 Significant additions to displays at the Memorial included three Victoria Cross medals, on loan as part of the Victoria Cross centenary project; Mr Kerry Stokes accepted glass plates negatives of Australian soldiers taken during the First World War from the Mayor of Vignacourt, donating these to the National Collection; Corporal Cameron Baird's family attended the display of equipment worn during the action for which he was posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross; the eX de Medici painting Cure for pain was donated to the collection and put on display; Commanding Officer of HMAS Darwin, Commander Phillip Henry, presented two AK-47s seized during Operation MANITOU. AUSTRALIAN WAR MEMORIAL ANNUAL REPORT 2016-2017 43 performances, military bands and musicians. Collections related to the Battle of Hamel are being digitised and will be progressively released to the website leading up to the centenary of the battle in July 2018. Oral histories were recorded with 7RAR during its preparation for, deployment to, and return from Iraq. Curatorial deployments to the Middle East captured more than 30 interviews with Defence personnel in theatre and 2,000 images, as well as identifying objects for future collecting. The project to capture the history and work of the Joint IED Task Force was extended to include 20 EOD Squadron. A collaboration in an Australian Research Council (ARC) Linkage Grant with the Australian National University, researching Australians in Borneo during the Second World War is now in its third and final year. The project has involved interviews with Australian veterans, and fieldwork in Borneo with local people telling their stories about experiences with Australians in the Services Reconnaissance Department (SRD) and Z Special Unit. The project will include an exhibition opening in the first quarter of 2018, and has already produced 10,000 pages of new digitised web content, including maps, personal papers, official records, and new additions to the National Collection. The Memorial's first musical artist in residence, Chris Latham, was appointed with the support of the Department of Veterans' Affairs, the Anzac Centenary Arts and Culture Fund, and a private philanthropist. Latham will record music from the Memorial's rich collection of manuscript music. An initial suite of 100 pieces of music from the First World War will be recorded and the sheet music digitised and released online over the next two years. We are very grateful to Canberra Airport and Virgin Airlines for displaying our magnificently restored Second World War Lockheed Hudson in the airport terminal. The restoration took five years to complete, and involved the fabrication of 5,000 parts. In the short term, restoration projects will focus on completion of a Beaufort bomber that saw intense operational service in New Guinea; an OV-10A Bronco flown by Australian forward air controllers in Vietnam serving in USAF squadrons (with the support of a donation from Dick and Pippa Smith); and scoping work to conserve the V2 and its Meillerwagen (with technical and project management support from QinetiQ). As well as reprogramming the systemic maintenance of the large technology collection, major conservation work was done on the Centurion tank on display outside Anzac Hall, and a Bushmaster protected mobility vehicle and an eight-wheeled Australian Light Armoured Vehicle (ASLAV) were conserved for display in the grounds. Conservation specialists have faced some intriguing challenges, including extensive consolidation treatment to conserve friable paint on artworks, and preparing works for an extended program of display. Textiles conservators have been inspecting, conserving, and repacking the collection in the new Textiles and Small Objects Store, including re-rolling the largest flags and pennants, and conservation work on some of the oldest and most delicate banners for exhibition. Paper conservators have been involved in restoring and cleaning a large body of works on paper in preparation for exhibitions and loans, including washing, light bleaching, and removal of adhesives and stains. The impact in revealing original colours and details is often astonishing. Photo conservators and collection managers have rehoused more than 100,000 acetate negatives to ensure their preservation, and 156 glass negatives were conserved for reproduction in a new annotated publication of Charles Bean's Western Front diaries being written by Peter Burness AM. Spirit of Anzac Centenary Experience Staff from the National Collections branch travelled to the 23 locations that housed the national tour of the Spirit of Anzac Centenary Experience travelling exhibition to ensure that artefacts from the Memorial's collection received appropriately care. All artefacts from the travelling exhibition have now been returned safely to the Memorial, demounted from their display cases, assessed by conservation staff, treated where necessary, and returned to long-term storage. 44 AUSTRALIAN WAR MEMORIAL ANNUAL REPORT 2016-2017 Measuring just over four metres long, eX de Medici's painting Cure for pain appears as a lush garden composed of military helmets and masks, poppies, roses, and other flowers. Flitting among the flowers, or perched on helmets, are birds, including nightingales, finches and pigeons. Yet, far from an idyllic paradise, these symbols represent over a century of conflict in which Australia has been involved. Acknowledging both enemies and allies, Cure for pain is an expression of our common mortality, and our equality in death. Military hardware has long been a key feature of de Medici's work, and this prompted her appointment as an official war artist to the Regional Assistance Mission to the Solomon Islands in 2009. De Medici created a body of work that responded to the legacy of colonisation, the impact of the Second World War, and the role of Australian peacekeepers. Cure for pain continues that work as an official war artist, but broadens its scope to encompass Australian military history from the colonial era to the present. The military helmets evolved from de Medici's earlier use of the skull, which had been a feature of her watercolours since the late 1990s. However, the proliferation of skulls in popular culture led her to a reworking of this symbol. Skulls had saturated the contemporary art world and had become SPOTLIGHT Contemporary art donation provides new perspectives on death and commemoration a useful marketing tool; from highbrow fashion to a print motif on children's clothes in department stores, the skull had become a trite commodity. The skull had lost the force it once had as a central symbol in 17th century vanitas paintings, where it represented the transience of life and the vanity of human wishes; so de Medici was prompted to evolve the skull metaphor into the representation of a helmet. She expanded on this notion in an interview with the Memorial on 6 May 2010: \"The helmet sits at the same point as a skull. It is a skull. It is the exoskeleton of a skull. It's a mask. It's an instrument for other purposes that can cloak identity, for instance, which was my first use of it: the disguise of identity in aggressive situations.\" That same year, she began a series of watercolours devoted to military helmets, including Cure for pain. The helmets signify different conflicts in which Australia has been involved, starting on the left of the work with two Australian colonial helmets, referring to frontier conflicts as well as representing Australia's involvement in early international military conflicts. There are five helmets from the First World War, two helmets related to the Second World AUSTRALIAN WAR MEMORIAL ANNUAL REPORT 2016-2017 45 War, two gas masks, and a range of helmets and goggles related to post-1945 conflicts and peacekeeping operations. The helmets demonstrate the evolution of combat helmet design over more than a century. Like de Medici's moth studies at the Commonwealth Scientific Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO), and her ongoing series portraying weapons, these helmets have the appearance of specimens. De Medici's meticulously drawn helmets reflect her key observations that the helmet is both a mask and a metaphor for a skull, and that it serves as a contemporary vanitas representing death, violence, and commemoration. Cure for pain was generously donated to the Memorial - through the Australian Government's Cultural Gifts Program - by Erika Krebs-Woodward in 2016 and is on display as part of the exhibition The deceiving eye, located on the Mezzanine Gallery of Anzac Hall until 11 September 2017. eX de Medici, Cure for pain, 2010-2011, watercolour on paper, 114 x 415 cm, ART96843 AWM Licensed copyright. 46 AUSTRALIAN WAR MEMORIAL ANNUAL REPORT 2016-2017 PORTFOLIO BUDGET STATEMENTS PERFORMANCE TARGET The number of new items acquired, in accordance with the Collection Development Plan. RESULT Met A total of 5,366 new items were acquired in accordance with the Collection Development Plan Memorial Integrated Collection Access (MICA) The Memorial Integrated Collection Access (MICA) system is the collection management system used for the recording of all items accessioned to the National Collection, as well as other items such as the education collection, plaques, etc. Other Memorial systems such, as the Memorial website and the Digital Asset Management System (DAMS), rely on information from MICA to complete business functions. An \"object record\" within MICA can contain numerous individual items. For example, the Memorial's iconic \"G for George\" Lancaster bomber, while being a single \"record\" within MICA, contains many individual items, each detailing a different component of the aircraft such as its fuselage, wings, propellers, engine, etc. 2,396 object records (12,301 items) were added to MICA, and to the National Collection, in the 2016-17 financial year. Acquisitions Throughout the year, the Memorial continued its work in growing the National Collection and gathering artefacts and historically important items to tell the story of Australia's experience in war. Many interesting and unique pieces were accessioned during the year, including: Sandakan letter A letter written to Sandakan prisoner of war Herman \"Algie\" Reither by his mother in late June 1943. The letter came into the care of Sandakan death camp survivor Bill Sticpewich when Algie died after the two escaped from Ranau together. The letter was preserved in a New Testament and describes the comings and goings of different people from his extended family. It tells of his mother's declining health, farming difficulties, and news from home. eX de Medici artwork The artwork entitled Cure for pain was donated through the Australian Government's Cultural Gifts Program by Erika Krebs-Woodward. Restored Royal Enfield A restored Royal Enfield motorcycle originally issued to Lark Force at Rabaul was donated under the Cultural Gifts program. The motorbike is thought to have returned to Australia just weeks before the Japanese invasion. World Trade Centre images Two photographs of the World Trade Centre attacks on 11 September 2001 which have rarely been available on the commercial market, come from a series captured by Associated Press Photographer Richard Drew and are some of the most important images captured on that awful and portentous day. The images depict the collapse of the south tower and people falling through the air, having jumped to escape the heat from one of the burning World Trade Centre towers. Phillip Schuler portrait This significant portrait of Melbourne Age war correspondent and great friend of Charles Bean, Philip Schuler (1889-1917), was acquired from a private seller. As war correspondent for the Melbourne Age, Schuler enlisted following his time as a war correspondent and was commissioned as a lieutenant. Wounded in action at the battle of Messines, he died of wounds on 23 June 1917. \"G for George\" log books Log book owned by Sergeant Len Dorricott 460 Squadron, detailing flights of \"G for George\". Dioramas In 2016, contemporary artist Richard Lewer was invited to produce a new body of work in response to the Australian War Memorial's collection for the Art Gallery of South Australia's exhibition Sappers and shrapnel: contemporary art and the art of the trenches. Lewer's dioramas serve a different purpose to those initially commissioned by the Australian War Memorial in the 1920s: they focus closely on individuals or groups of soldiers, suspending moments in time to capture the daily routine of troops and their surroundings. These six dioramas serve as small sites of empathic re-enactment and present an engaging contemporary response to the topic of remembrance and how we remember Australia's involvement in the First World War. Sculptures Two early sculptures by renowned sculpture and former RAAF officer Robert Klippel, No. 11 Grief and No. 9 Anguish, were made in 1944 as Klippel was transitioning from being a model maker for the RAAF to a professional artist. They represent his experience of serving in the Second World War and losing his brother in combat. Sidney Nolan painting The remarkable work by renowned artist Sidney Nolan depicts Simpson and his donkey. Nolan completed this work as part AUSTRALIAN WAR MEMORIAL ANNUAL REPORT 2016-2017 47 of a large series of paintings on the subject of Gallipoli, most of which depicted soldiers and landscapes. While other well-known depictions of Simpson picture the soldier astride or alongside his donkey, Nolan's work features Simpson carrying the donkey across his shoulders. This painting was generously donated to the Memorial by Margaret Favilla. Escape map This Belgian map was used by Lance Corporal Frederick Peachey during his escape from German captivity in 1917, during the First World War. The escape route used by Peachey is drawn onto the map and there are more annotations on the reverse side. Also included are postcards sent by the Australian Red Cross Prisoner of War Department to Peachey after his capture at Bullecourt on 11 April 1917. The postcards never reached Peachey as he escaped before internment in Germany.

PORTFOLIO BUDGET STATEMENTS PROGRAM COMPONENT 1.4 EXHIBITIONS assist Australians remember the Australian experience of war and its enduring impact on society. OVERVIEW A broad range of changes have been implemented across the Memorial including new permanent exhibitions, small exhibitions and displays, and temporary exhibitions in the Special Exhibitions Gallery. The project to update the Conflicts 1945 to today galleries was completed in early October 2016, as planned. The new permanent exhibition significantly enhances the Memorial's coverage of Australian involvement in the Middle East, including: the First Gulf War; Operation Habitat; Maritime Interception Force; United Nations' weapons inspections; and the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. In response to stakeholder feedback, changes to the First Gulf War section of the new displays were implemented. Soon after the launch of the revamped galleries, three major works by Artist Ben Quilty were installed at the entrance to the Conflicts 1945 to today galleries. The works were completed in 2016 and portray family members of Australian soldiers who were killed or suffer post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) as a result of their service. 48 AUSTRALIAN WAR MEMORIAL ANNUAL REPORT 2016-2017 AFGHANISTAN: THE AUSTRALIAN STORY In October 2016, the Memorial launched the Afghanistan: the Australian story DVD. Directed and narrated by leading Australian journalist Chris Masters, the two-disc DVD includes a 50-minute feature documentary and extracts of the 38 interviews conducted with current and former Australian Defence Force personnel and their families. It also contains film and photographs drawn from the Memorial's Afghanistan: the Australian story exhibition. The Memorial took the opportunity to include new material that has become available since the exhibition was developed in 2013, particularly through the Department of Defence. Eleven new interviews were conducted by Chris Masters, focusing on the role of Special Forces in Afghanistan, an under-represented aspect of the current exhibition. New content collected and interviews conducted during the development of the DVD are currently being used to update the gallery experience. The updated version of the audio visual experience is due for completion in July 2017. GALLERY UPDATES Second World War galleries Completed at the end of 2016, recent work in the Second World War galleries includes the rearrangement of large objects to address visitor circulation issues and to reposition the LePkw Type 82 Kubelwagen and BMW motorcycle which have been subject to damage due to their open display. A new low-level two-section plinth with glass barriers for the display of large objects (the tankette; the BMW motorcycle; the Kubelwagen; the German Flak 38 anti-aircraft gun; and the Chevrolet lorry and Breda anti-aircraft gun) will be part of the changes to the galleries. The Holocaust exhibit A new permanent display titled The Holocaust: witnesses and survivors opened to the public in the Second World War galleries in November 2016. The exhibition tells the story of the Holocaust through the experiences of several survivors who made lives in post-war Australia. The exhibition has been developed by the Australian War Memorial with the support of the Jewish Holocaust Centre and includes over 85 collection items from both institutions. Many of these items are original documentation from Jewish men, women, and children who survived ghettos, and concentration and extermination camps. Hall of Valour The Victoria Cross Project has sought to display as many of the 100 Victoria Crosses awarded to Australians as possible in the Hall of Valour during the Centenary. So far, with the support of private owners and other cultural institutions, 82 Australian Victoria Crosses are on display at the Memorial. During the course of this project, the Memorial has acquired nine Australian Victoria or George Crosses for the National Collection: \u00e2\u00a2 Corporal Lawrence Carthage Weathers VC \u00e2\u00a2 George Pearse VC MM Warrant Officer Class II Keith Payne VC AM \u00e2\u00a2 Sergeant James Rogers VC DCM \u00e2\u00a2 Colin Matthews GC MC The Victoria Cross and medal group awarded to Private Reginald Roy Inwood VC (First World War) was demounted and returned during this period. Other changes to the space include the inclusion of the Order of Australia awarded to Keith Payne VC, and the display of the pistol belonging to Second Lieutenant Frederick Birks VC MM. A new display featuring the uniform items and weapon of Corporal Cameron Baird VC MG alongside the uniform and weapon of Corporal Ben Roberts-Smith VC MG was unveiled in the Hall of Valour on 14 September 2016. Corporal Baird was killed in the final moments of an assault in the Afghan village of Ghawchak on 22 June 2013. The new display features items of his uniform and the damaged M4 carbine he was using during the operation. The VC for Baird's action was the first awarded to a member of an Australian commando unit and has been on display in the Hall of Valour in 2014. Anzac Hall A project to update two new permanent displays in Anzac Hall commenced in early 2017. The first exhibition is centred on the Mark IV tank and focuses on the evolution of tanks during the First World War. The exhibition is due for completion in July 2017. The second exhibition is related to the battle of Milne Bay. Fought between 25 August and 7 September 1942, the battle is often described as the first decisive Allied victory over Japanese forces in the Pacific. The new permanent exhibition focuses on this significant battle and will include key objects including the captured Japanese Ha Go tank and battle relics. The launch of the display is scheduled to coincide with the 75th anniversary of the battle in August 2017. OTHER GALLERIES Eight displays of works on paper were completed, featuring in each of the permanent galleries. Four displays were changed over in the Reading Room, one focusing on Vietnam Veterans Day, and three focused on the 75th anniversary of the Memorial. Minor works to the display infrastructure AUSTRALIAN WAR MEMORIAL ANNUAL REPORT 2016-2017 49 The Holocaust: witnesses and survivors presents the experiences of survivors who made new lives in post-war Australia, and the works of Australian official war artist Alan Moore. At the exhibition opening, attended by members of the Jewish Holocaust Centre, Irma Hanner spoke about her possessions included in the exhibition. 50 AUSTRALIAN WAR MEMORIAL ANNUAL REPORT 2016-2017 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander stories of military service in times of war and peace are told in For Country, for Nation. Exploring themes of remembrance and tradition through family histories, objects, art, and photographs from across Australia, the exhibition was opened with a traditional smoking ceremony. AUSTRALIAN WAR MEMORIAL ANNUAL REPORT 2016-2017 51 and showcases were implemented in the Reading Room to coincide with the commencement of the 75th anniversary series of displays. Three small displays have been installed in the Captain Reg Saunders Gallery including an art and work on paper display supporting the commencement of the 75th anniversary of the Memorial, a photographic display titled A good little chap: Herbert Baldwin which included framed photographs and a small selection of film and objects, and Badhu Koewbu Kidhal, World War story as its told. The current display includes five works by Badhulgaw Kuthinaw Mudh (Badu Art Centre) on Badu (Mulgrave Island) in the Zenadh Kes (Torres Strait) that interpret Torres Strait Islander service during the Second World War and its enduring legacy for the Badu community. The works were commissioned by the Memorial in 2016. A strong focus on maintaining the high standard of the Memorial's 10,000 square metre exhibition space was continued throughout the year. Minor building works included the refurbishment of the Anzac Hall link bridge, mezzanine, viewing platform, and staircase which was completed in September 2016. Refurbishment of the space included the removal of the permanent Anzac spirit exhibition to enable the space to be used for temporary exhibitions. Continued development and modernisation of all gallery audio-visual infrastructure has yielded more reliable and flexible displays and provided a platform for future development. TEMPORARY EXHIBITIONS Mephisto: The devil's chariot To commemorate the centenary of the First World War, the temporary exhibition Mephisto: the devils chariot, continued throughout 2016-17 until closing to the public on 28 May 2017. The only surviving German tank from First World War, \"Mephisto\" was displayed at the Memorial for two years before returning to Brisbane in June 2017. Development of a new permanent display focused on the Mark IV tank has commenced and will open to the public early in 2017-18. WW1 Avenue of honour The Memorial launched two temporary exhibitions in the refurbished mezzanine in Anzac Hall. The first exhibition, WW1 Avenue of honour: Trent Parke, opened on 9 September 2016, featuring a series of images photographed at the Ballarat Avenue of Honour by Australian photographer Trent Parke. In 2014 Parke was invited to participate in the international exhibition The First World War now, presented by the renowned Magnum Photos agency in Bruges, Belgium, to mark 100 years since the German army's invasion of the city. In response, Parke produced a series of images photographed at the Ballarat Avenue of Honour, the longest avenue of honour in Australia and one of the earliest known memorial avenues planted in Victoria during the First World War. The deceiving eye On 21 March 2017, a new temporary exhibition, The deceiving eye, opened to the public for a period of six months. The exhibition features previously unseen camouflage photographs by Australian artist Frank Hinder that document his experiences in developing camouflage suitable for the Australian environment. The exhibition also focuses on the recently donated work Cure for pain, by artist eX de Medici, which explores Australia's military history and demonstrates the evolution of combat helmet design and camouflage over the last century. A small selection of objects including a \"Yowie suit\" for camouflage is also displayed. Reality in flames: modern Australian art and the Second World War The Special Exhibitions Gallery featured two new exhibitions. Reality in flames: modern Australian Art and the Second World War explored Australian modernist artists' creative responses to the Second World War featuring 90 works of art by important Australian artists including Albert Tucker, Russell Drysdale, William Dobell, and Stella Bowen. Reality in flames closed on 4 September 2016. For Country, for Nation For Country, for Nation opened to the public on 23 September 2016. The exhibition is the culmination of a significant body of research undertaken by the Memorial to discover the identities and stories of what are believed to be several thousand Indigenous men and women who served in our armed forces since and before Federation. The exhibition recognises the valuable and selfless military service of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, and their contribution to the Anzac legend. The Memorial is the custodian of a diverse range of cultural material relating to Indigenous service. The mediums of text, story, art, objects, photographs, dance, and music are used within the exhibition. The exhibition draws heavily on the Memorial's Indigenous art collection. A significant aspect of For Country, for Nation was the commissioning of Indigenous artists to tell their stories of family and community connections to the defence of Australia. Recently commissioned artists include Andrew Snelgar, Vicki West, Gabriel Nodea, Patrick Freddy Puruntatameri, and Clair Bates. From the shadows: Australia's Special Forces Development of the special exhibition From the shadows: Australia's special forces continues. The exhibition will cover the history and development of special forces from the Second World War to the present day, and focus on the capabilities of special forces operators, their role abroad and at home, and what they have done. The exhibition is being developed in collaboration with Special Operations Command 52 AUSTRALIAN WAR MEMORIAL ANNUAL REPORT 2016-2017 Australia and will include a number of loaned objects from units under the command of Special Operation Command (SOCOMD), individuals, and the Memorial's collection. The exhibition will open to the public in September 2017. Aftermath: the consequences of war Development of the special exhibition Aftermath: the consequences of war (working title) commenced in December 2016. Opening to coincide with the centenary of the Armistice in 2018, the exhibition will cover the past 100 years - from the end of the First World War to the present day. A home on a southern hill exhibition series The exhibition series A home on a southern hill was developed to mark the 75th anniversary of the opening of the Australian War Memorial on Remembrance Day 1941. Unfolding over the 75th anniversary year of the Australian War Memorial, A home on a southern hill is a series of exhibitions which tell the story of how the Memorial was brought to being, as well as exploring its history and continuing relevance. The series takes its name from a poem written by Will Dyson to accompany his 1928 cartoon, Calling them home, which depicts a ghostly bugler calling the spirits of Australia's war dead to the yet-to-be-built Memorial. They dreamed of leave that never came. Now each man is a living fame. But dreams it still. They dream of a call to a last route march, Back to a land where the grey gums arch. To a home on a Southern hill. The first exhibition in the series, (November 2016 to April 2017) told the story of the Memorial building from C.E.W. Bean's initial sketch, through the 1925 architectural competition and the set-backs and controversies of the 1930s, to its official opening on 11 November 1941. The exhibition series continues with To heal the nation (May-July 2017), which considers the ways in which C.E.W. Bean's experiences shaped his vision for the Memorial and reflects on the nature of commemoration. The third exhibition in the series, The Memorial in landscape, which focuses on the siting and landscaping of the Memorial, will be presented from August to late October 2017, in order to coincide with Floriade 2017, before its conclusion over summer with Telling their stories, which will explore how the Memorial communicates the Australian experience of war. TOURING EXHIBITIONS Development of a national tour for the special exhibition For Country, for Nation is underway as part of the revitalisation of the Memorial's Touring Exhibitions program. A national tour to capital cities and regional venues is expected to commence in April 2018. The 2016-18 extension tour of Remember me: the lost diggers of Vignacourt commenced in December 2016. The exhibition was displayed at the Glasshouse Gallery, Port Macquarie, NSW (17 December 2016 to 5 February 2017), and the Pinnacles Gallery, Townsville, Qld (25 February 2017 to 30 April 2017). The exhibition achieved a total visitation of 14,315. Remember me will tour to a further six venues over the next 18 months. To Flanders fields, 1917 the second exhibition in the Australians on the Western Front 1916-1918 series was produced in two sets to tour to metropolitan and regional club venues, as part of the continuing relationship between the Memorial and the NSW RSL and Service Clubs Association. THE SPIRIT OF ANZAC CENTENARY EXPERIENCE The Spirit of Anzac Centenary Experience (SACE) was the flagship community event of the Australian Government's Anzac Centenary national program. The Anzac Centenary Travelling Exhibition, which would eventually become Spirit of Anzac Centenary Experience, was first officially proposed in the report of the National Commission on the Commemoration of the Anzac centenary in March 2011. The proposal for a travelling exhibition was endorsed by the Anzac Centenary Advisory Board in its Report to Government in March 2013, noting that a travelling exhibition \"could be a flagship Anzac centenary project\". In early 2014 the Australian War Memorial contracted Imagination (Australia) Pty Ltd as the creative designer for a national travelling commemorative exhibition to tour to all states of Australia and the Northern Territory. In late 2014 Commonwealth Bank and Telstra committed significant funding and resources to further develop the project. The SACE was delivered by a partnership between Department of Defence, Department of Veterans' Affairs, Australian War Memorial, Commonwealth Bank, and Telstra. Governance of the project was overseen by the Spirit of Anzac Centenary Experience Executive Committee Chaired by the Envoy the Honourable Tim Fischer AC, with the Memorial represented by Dr Brendan Nelson AO. The operations of the project were managed by a Steering Group of the partners with the Memorial represented by Major General Brian Dawson AM CSC (Retd). The SACE project was funded by the deed partners in accordance with the Partnering Deed. AUSTRALIAN WAR MEMORIAL ANNUAL REPORT 2016-2017 53 The newly installed Middle East galleries opened to the public on the 6 October 2016. 54 AUSTRALIAN WAR MEMORIAL ANNUAL REPORT 2016-2017 The Mezzanine Gallery of Anzac Hall hosted two temporary exhibitions: Trent Parke's WW1 Avenue of Honour featured photographs made at the Ballarat Avenue of Honour, the longest avenue of honour in Australia and one of the earliest known memorial avenues to have been planted in Victoria during the First World; The deceiving eye presents changing approaches to camouflage from the colonial wars to the war in Afghanistan. AUSTRALIAN WAR MEMORIAL ANNUAL REPORT 2016-2017 55 \"Brilliant exhibition. Congratulations to all involved including the sponsors. This should be compulsory for all high school kids. Charles Bean would be proud.\" Tim Scott, Facebook, 22 April 2017. SACE was developed by Imagination (Australia) Pty Ltd in close consultation with the Australian War Memorial over a period of 14 months. The exhibition was designed to be highly experiential, with interactive technology employed throughout, allowing Australians around the country to see first-hand over 200 First World War artefacts from the Memorial's national collection, and interpretive materials spanning the wars, conflicts, and peacekeeping operations in which Australia has been involved. SACE was launched on 4 September 2015 in Albury-Wodonga and over the following 19 months toured another 22 locations across Australia: Launceston, Port Augusta, Perth, Bunbury (Eaton), Kalgoorlie-Boulder, Geelong, Orange, Newcastle and Sydney. Across all the tour locations a total of 368,016 people attended, including 49,707 students in school groups. Memorial staff travelled to each location to ensure the Memorial's National Collection items were appropriately cared for, particularly during bump-in and bump-out at each of the venues. All items have been returned safely to the Memorial. SACE was very well received, with 99 per cent of attendees who responded saying that they would recommend SACE to friends and family.

This resource has already received over 4,100 page views. The most popular online resource was Understanding Gallipoli with more than 8,900 page views. The Classroom showcase continues to be a popular site for young Australians to display their creative work. There has been a modest increase to over 130,000 visits to the Education components of the Memorial's website. A significant component of this (almost 35 per cent) was driven from our Facebook activity. Interest in the \"Education at the Australian War Memorial\" Facebook page has continued to grow, with the most popular posts being the Invasion of Malaya and the Soldiers in Residence reaching almost 50,000 users. \" \" \"It was fantastic. The website is also a wonderful resource. The young students thoroughly enjoyed it.\" Sacred Heart Catholic Primary School, NT, March 2017 Other interpretive activities The Soldiers in Residence program continued this year with four members of the Australian Army spending three weeks at the Memorial. The program allows veterans to familiarise themselves with both front- and back-of-house operations at the Memorial, and learn about commemoration and collection preservation. Of equal benefit is the soldiers' openness to share aspects of Australian Defence Force culture and practices that enhances understanding of their experiences. A Memorial Box, filled with uniforms, equipment, and artefacts, puts students in the place of those who served and waited for their loved ones at home. AUSTRALIAN WAR MEMORIAL ANNUAL REPORT 2016-2017 63 \"I was lucky enough to be selected to attend this program in July with Gnr Simon Hodgson. It was an amazing experience; one I will never forget. The one thing that really struck me during my time at the AWM was how much our service is valued by the public and how interested they are in our stories. We spent time with all of the departments at the AWM. I had no idea there was so much going on behind the scenes.\" Sgt Nick Neleman, October 2016 \" \" \"There is no doubt we are all proud of what our forebears did, but we should also be proud of what we are doing now. No matter how average you consider your service to be, your contribution to this nation's proud military history is highly valued.\" Sgt Nick Neleman, October 2016 One of the soldiers, Sergeant Nick Neleman, reflected upon his time at the Memorial in an article in Army, the soldiers' newspaper, in October 2016. In the article, he spoke eloquently of the experience and his realisation that his service and that of his colleagues, is immensely important and respected. In collaboration with the History Teachers' Association of Australia, the Department of Education and Training, and the Department of Veterans' Affairs, the Memorial continued to support the annual Simpson Prize competition. This First World War-themed, national essay-writing competition is for secondary students. Staff researched links to relevant source material from the Memorial's collection which were provided online to assist students with their research and writing. The sixth title in the Century of Service publications series, Comradeship: stories of friendship and recreation in wartime was developed by the Memorial's Education staff and published in collaboration with the Department of Veterans' Affairs in June 2017. The third book in the series, Ancestry: stories of multicultural Anzacs, (published in 2015), was runner up in the information category in the Children's Book Council of Australia Book of the Year Awards in August 2016. Memorial staff delivered four professional development sessions and familiarisations throughout the year, to 70 school teachers and 25 tour operators. These programs equip teachers to better use the Memorial's collection and historical content in the classroom, and promote the learning opportunities available on-site and online. In June 2017, the Memorial hosted a successful one day performance season of Troubie Productions' Dusted off, and Fightin' the Kaiser performed in the BAE Systems Theatre by Brett Hunt. Over 400 students and teachers attended three shows. The Memorial hosted the annual Legacy Youth (formerly Florance Foundation) visit of junior Legatees to the Memorial, this year facilitating 13 students on gallery tours, and at the National Ceremony on Anzac Day.

OVERVIEW The Memorial is focused on providing best practice communications with an emphasis on innovative and integrated digital, marketing and public relations activity. During this reporting period, the Memorial delivered two major communication outcomes: a redeveloped website and a new brand positioning campaign. The new website is strategically focused on building new audiences for the Memorial. Through the Digital Engagement Strategy we aim to deepen the community's connection with the service and sacrifice of those who have served our nation. Following a year of considered development, including extensive stakeholder engagement and market testing, a new national brand positioning campaign was launched in early June. The new positioning statement is \"...for we are young and free\". A subsequent campaign has been developed encourage visitation to the Memorial and its website, to reflect on the enduring impact of war. PORTFOLIO BUDGET STATEMENTS PERFORMANCE TARGET An engaging website and social media presence with accurate information. RESULT Met The Memorial successfully launched its new website on 30 May 2017. With a large migration of existing content and a new search function that covers the collection and rolls databases, this was a significant achievement. The new site features best practice usability and a clean design and provides greater access to our vast digitised collection. Since launching, the site the Memorial has received active feedback from some users of collection and rolls databases with specific searching needs. A clear road-map for future enhancements and further improved functionality has been developed, including the delivery of advanced search functionality, and access to the previous site. This ensures our researcher user base can access data in a way that they are comfortable with. PORTFOLIO BUDGET STATEMENTS PERFORMANCE TARGET High quality service to media to encourage suitable coverage in all forms of media. RESULT Met The Memorial continues to garner enviable media coverage for events, visits, exhibitions and commemorations. High quality content is regularly produced, carefully designed to appeal to the media and the community. The Memorial continues to liaise closely with media outlets and relevant stakeholders, building on strong existing relationships to leverage coverage which has been overwhelmingly positive. Focus on significant military anniversaries, events and ceremonies, exhibitions, and collection items has ensured the Memorial maintains a substantial presence across all types of media. Regular media and public relations activity continues to help promote projects and programs to regional, national, and international audiences. Throughout the reporting period 37 media releases were created, resulting in a high level of coverage. The media release issued on 14 September 2016, regarding the display of equipment worn by Corporal Cameron Baird VC MG generated significant local and national media interest across print, television, online, and radio. Relationships developed and fostered with media outlets resulted in the Director, as well as curators, historians, and other experts, receiving media opportunities to discuss the work of the Memorial. Alongside traditional media activity, the Memorial continues to foster excellent working relationships with non-traditional media entities, including documentary, film and program makers, and digital content creators (including The Dead Prussian podcast). The team welcomed numerous international film crews whose content will contribute to broadcasting the Memorial's mission and purpose to new audiences.

PORTFOLIO BUDGET STATEMENTS PERFORMANCE TARGET High quality marketing and promotional activities. RESULT Met During this reporting period, the Memorial embarked on a new national brand positioning campaign, aimed at assisting Australians to reflect on our nation's experience of war and the stories of our defence force personnel. The campaign builds on the Memorial's unique position as a place to reflect on the history of Australians in conflict and gain a deeper understanding of what it means to be Australian. A new positioning statement \"...for we are young and free\" was developed for the campaign. It tested well in focus groups and resonated with key stakeholders. The positioning statement features throughout the campaign and aims to encapsulate the Memorial's unique goal of honouring Australia's servicemen and servicewomen whilst encouraging audiences to find a personal connection to their stories of service and sacrifice. The campaign encourages people to reflect on service to our nation, and utilises the imagery and stories of actual servicemen and servicewomen from Australia's defence forces over the past 100 years. The campaign featured in print and digital and on localised television primarily through community service announcements. Ongoing marketing and advertising activity continues to help drive visitation and promote the Memorial's brand. A number of integrated marketing and advertising campaigns were implemented throughout the year in support of permanent and temporary exhibitions, and to promote commemorations, anniversaries, educational programs, tours, talks, and launch events. Marketing and advertising activity supported two major commemorative days: Remembrance Day 2016 and Anzac Day 2017. Ongoing promotion of the Memorial's permanent exhibitions included Australia in the Great War and Middle East, which targeted a national audience via television, print, and digital channels. A summer campaign - What's on this summer - featured the Middle East exhibition and highlighted the daily Last Post Ceremony, children's activities, and educational programs offered during the summer period. A major national marketing campaign promoting For Country, for Nation was launched and continues to run across numerous advertising channels driving awareness of and visitation to this exhibition.

Memorial branding - Centenary of the First World War The centenary brand continues to be widely used in support of many Memorial and non-commercial community initiatives across Australia. The brand, specifically designed for the centenary period and featuring the Memorial's logo, adorns much of the Memorial's marketing and media presence, enhancing the commemoration of significant First World War anniversaries throughout the remaining years of the centenary. Roll of Honour soundscapes The Memorial continues to focus on the Roll of Honour Soundscape project through the \"Remember me\" smartphone application. Designed to engage directly with primary school-aged children throughout the centenary period, this program records students speaking the names and ages of the more than 60,000 Australians who died during the First World War. These recordings are played in the First World War section of the cloisters in the Commemorative Area of the Memorial. Further promotional activity of the project occurred this year, alongside technical upgrades, to ensure continued public engagement. Commemorative crosses The Memorial's Commemorative Crosses project provides primary school-aged children with an avenue to mark their respect for those Australians who died in active service. Students are provided with a blank cross, on which they write individual reflections on those Australians who have sacrificed their lives in war and on operations. The crosses are collected and reviewed prior to distribution to embassies, private individuals, and organisations for use in commemorative activities. This year, an additional 40,000 crosses were produced, to supplement the 100,000 created at the beginning of the centenary period. During the reporting period, a total of 4,335 inscribed crosses were sent to the embassies of Egypt, France, Ghana, Iran, Israel, Japan, Korea, Malta, Myanmar, Sweden, and Turkey. Crosses were also sent to a variety of countries for non-embassy related activity. Thirty went to the United States of America, and 600 to France.

PORTFOLIO BUDGET STATEMENTS PROGRAM COMPONENT 1.7 RESEARCH AND INFORMATION DISSEMINATION assist Australians remember the Australian experience of war and its enduring impact on society. The conduct and stimulation of historical research and dissemination of knowledge and understanding of Australia's military history. A wide range of research and dissemination activities was undertaken during the year, including the publication of military history books and articles, media broadcasts, individual research projects, family history workshops, website provision of digitised official and private records, and the provision of military history information and research assistance through the Research Centre enquiry service and the Military History Section. The centenary of major events of the First World War on the Western Front has continued to generate unprecedented interest in the Memorial and its collections, commemorative activities, and stories of the Australian experience of war. The Memorial has assisted enquiries in record numbers, from people using the collections to trace their families' military history through to those performing academic research, writing books, or producing documentary films and news media. Official Histories: East Timor, Iraq, and Afghanistan On 1 July 2016, the full team of 13 project members began work. By November they were security-cleared and operating within a purpose-built secure environment with appropriate physical and network security infrastructure. A governance structure was established to coordinate the contributions and flow of records from all stakeholder departments and agencies: Defence; Foreign Affairs and Trade; Prime Minister and Cabinet; the Australian Federal Police; the National Archives or Australia; and the six agencies of the Australian Intelligence Community. Research for the six volumes of the official history series consists of two complimentary strands. The first is a comprehensive interviewing program. Around 350 interviews have been conducted, supplementing pre-existing interviews sourced from a range of stakeholder agencies. Successful research and interviewing visits have been conducted in Timor-Leste, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) Headquarters at The Hague. The NATO visit yielded not only valuable interviews, but a large trove of important documents. The second area of research for the volumes consists of an examination of documentary records from stakeholder agencies and departments. Though not without ongoing challenges, an adequate flow of documents from stakeholder departments has been instituted and is being closely monitored. The most significant challenge faced to date has been establishing an adequate flow of corporate records from the Department of Defence, the project's largest supplier, and records of crucial importance from the Australian Intelligence Community. This has caused delays, resulting in the project being three to four months behind schedule in its first year. With greater active support, it is expected that material will be received from these agencies in the near future. Independent history of the medical legacies of the Vietnam War An independent history of the medical legacies of the Vietnam War was commissioned by the Memorial Council and is being led by Dr Peter Yule, a research fellow at the School of Historical and Philosophical Studies at the University of Melbourne. Dr Yule will document and examine existing medical studies and research, and undertake new oral history interviews to enable the authoring of a broad history on the medical legacies of the Vietnam War. During 2016-17 excellent progress has been made by Dr Yule and his assistant in researching a variety of records, including those from the Department of Defence, the Department of Veterans' Affairs, and the Returned and Services League, as well as a large volume of secondary sources. Consultant epidemiologist, Dr Michael Fett, has made outstanding progress in summarising the scientific literature for the project, while the team of oral historians interviewed almost 100 Vietnam veterans. To date, three chapters of the book have been drafted. 72 AUSTRALIAN WAR MEMORIAL ANNUAL REPORT 2016-2017 Official history of Australian peacekeeping, humanitarian and post-Cold War operations The Memorial continues to deliver the six-volume Official history of Australian peacekeeping, humanitarian and post-Cold War operations, assisted by funding from the Department of Defence. Three volumes have previously been published by Cambridge University Press: - Volume II Australia and the new world order: from peacekeeping to peace enforcement, 1988-1991, by David Horner, was published in 2011 - Volume III The good international citizen: Australian peacekeeping in Asia, Africa and Europe, 1991-1993, by David Horner and John Connor, was published in 2014 - Volume V The good neighbour: Australian peace support operations in the Pacific Islands 1980-2006, by Bob Breen, was published in 2016. Three volumes are currently being finalised for publication as follows: - Volume VI In their time of need: Australia's overseas emergency relief operations, 1918-2006, by Memorial historian Steven Bullard has been published, and was launched by Professor the Hon Gareth Evans AC QC on 9 August 2017 - Volume IV The limits of peacekeeping: Australian missions in Africa and the Americas, 1993-2006, by Jean Bou, Bob Breen, David Horner, and Garth Pratten, has been submitted to the publisher for release in early 2018. - Volume I The long search for peace: observer missions and beyond, 1947-2006, by Peter Londey, Rhys Crawley, and David Horner, has been submitted to government departments and, subject to clearance, is expected to be published by mid-2018. The annual Summer Scholars program Scholars are selected through a competitive, merit-based selection process that is open to university students at a late stage of their history degrees - customarily honours graduates - and assigned individual research projects. Supervised by Memorial historians, three scholars successfully completed research projects related to the Memorial's historical research, collections, exhibitions, and publications: Nicole Townsend (Monash University) Road to ruin: Australians at the First Battle of El Alamein, July 1942 Emily Gallagher (The Australian National University) The rise and fall of Milne Bay: the battle of Milne Bay in Australia's national narrative of the Second World War Jaclyn Hopkins (La Trobe University) To mark the spot: Australian divisional memorials on the Western Front The scholars delivered public presentations on their findings at the conclusion of the program and their research reports are published on the Memorial's website. Bryan Gandevia Prize A generous bequest by the family and friends of the late Professor Bryan Gandevia in 2009 enabled the establishment of a prize to commemorate Professor Gandevia's contribution to the development of Australian military and medical history. The Bryan Gandevia Prize of $5,000 is one of the most generous awards for postgraduate studies in Australian history. It is awarded biennially to an outstanding honours, masters, or doctoral thesis on a significant subject within Australian military history, military-medical history, or military-social history. The 2016 Bryan Gandevia Prize, for theses submitted between 1 July 2014 and 30 June 2016, attracted a strong field of ten PhD and two honours history theses, all of high standard and worthy candidates for the award. The prize was judged by a panel of senior historians of the Australian War Memorial and a distinguished Emeritus Professor of Australian military, social, and political history. The adjudicators concurred in their judgment, unanimously recommending the award to Lieutenant David Woolley (Australian Army) for his thesis \"Not yet diagnosed: Australian psychiatric casualties during the Kokoda campaign, 1942\" (honours thesis, UNSW Canberra, 2015). Lieutenant Woolley delivered a public talk on his thesis at the Memorial on 29 June at which Professor Simon Gandevia presented the prize. This work has made an outstanding contribution to understanding an important but little examined aspect of the Australian military experience. The Memorial is exploring opportunities to publish the work to ensure its wider dissemination. Lieutenant Woolley is the third winner of the Bryan Gandevia Prize since its institution. Australia's involvement in post-Second World War Japanese war crimes trials A major investigation into Australia's involvement in post- Second World War Japanese war crimes trials, produced as a multi-volume law report series covering 310 trials (funded by an ARC grant in collaboration with the University of Melbourne), was published by Martinus Nijhoff in the Netherlands. A separate thematic volume on the historical and legal significance of the trials, Australia's war crimes trials 1945-51, was launched by the Hon Sir Gerard Brennan AC KBE GBS at the Memorial on 29 November 2016. AUSTRALIAN WAR MEMORIAL ANNUAL REPORT 2016-2017 73 As a centre for military history research, the Memorial proudly launched Bob Breen's The good neighbour, the first published volume of the Official history of Australian peacekeeping, humanitarian and post-Cold War operations, and Dr Karl James's Double Diamonds: Australian Commandos in the Pacific War, 1941-45. The Memorial's annual history conference 1916 year of attrition was well attended; three students were welcomed into the Summer Scholars program; and David Woolley spoke about the work that lead him to be awarded the Bryan Gandevia Prize for Australian Military-Medical History. 74 AUSTRALIAN WAR MEMORIAL ANNUAL REPORT 2016-2017 The Memorial is honoured to host visiting veterans and hear their memories of service: veterans of the Korean War spoke with Michael Kelly, historian; former members of Bomber Command attended a special wreathlaying ceremony; and refurbished sculptures in the Commemorative Area were welcomed with a Smoking Ceremony. AUSTRALIAN WAR MEMORIAL ANNUAL REPORT 2016-2017 75 Anzac connections The Anzac connections project is adding new collections to the Memorial website by delivering linked data, biographies of service personnel, and transcriptions of collections through crowd-sourcing tools. Collections of First World War letters and diaries continue to be digitised and published on the website. The #Daily Digger project on Twitter continues to provide a daily narrative of the First World War, with quotes and images taken from digitised diaries and letters of men and women who served in the conflict. This year the Twitter project focused on the centenary of America entering the war on 6 April 1917. A series of quotes were selected to highlight relevant comments written by Australian soldiers at the time. Beyond Allied histories: Dayak memories of World War II in Borneo In partnership with the Australian National University this major three-year ARC-funded research project is providing new insight into how different groups of people experienced the Second World War in Borneo. The research team combines anthropological expertise from Associate Professor Christine Helliwell of the College of Arts and Social Sciences at ANU, with curatorial expertise from Robyn van Dyk, Head of the Research Centre at the Memorial. As well as a scholarly book and articles, the project will generate an exhibition, which will be opening on the Anzac Hall Mezzanine area on 18 March 2018. Stories will be based on items from the Memorial's archive, including original letters and diaries, and research developed from the ARC linkage project, with an accompanying digitisation/web program to promote the archival collections in the online environment. Family history The Research Centre continues to offer a training program for researching family history. Workshops focus on how visitors can use the collections and services of the Australian War Memorial (and other institutional collections that relate to Australian military service) to discover their families' military service stories. A regular program of family history talks and workshops has been held in the Reading Room, attracting small but consistent audiences. Honour Rolls A number of Roll of Honour and Commemorative Roll research projects were undertaken, including enhancements of data to commemorate the 50th anniversary of significant events during the Vietnam War; the 75th anniversary of the Kokoda campaign; and the commemoration of nurses who died following the fall of Singapore. Three names were approved for addition to the Roll of Honour. The Commemorative Roll has been expanded by the addition of eight names. The centenary of the establishment of the Australian War Records Section The anniversary of the inception of the Australian War Records Section (AWRS) was celebrated on 16 May 2017. In 1917, the AWRS began collecting the relics, artworks, photographs, and documents that would become the foundation of the Australian War Memorial. Without the work of the AWRS, Australia's military history would have been collected by the British and recorded as a side note of the Imperial force. The opportunity to reflect upon and study our part in the global wars has helped build a sense of nationhood and identity. One hundred years on, the Memorial continues to collect, preserve, and commemorate the relics of the men and women who sacrifice themselves for our nation. The Memorial marked this anniversary on 16 May 2017 with a Last Post Ceremony commemorating Corporal Ernest Bailey, who died in the service of the AWRS. Wreaths were laid by the Memorial and on behalf of the descendants of Charles Bean and John Linton Treloar. A social media campaign featuring posts from Memorial curators discussing their favourite items from the collection drew attention to the AWRS centenary, and a number of Memorial exhibitions relating to the work of the AWRS, such as A good little chap and To heal the nation. Copyright Amendment (Disability Access and Other Measures) Bill 2017 This year saw successful changes to the Copyright Act 1968 in the passing of the Copyright Amendment (Disability Access and Other Measures) Bill 2017. The new act introduces a standard term of protection for the life of the author plus 70 years, does not differentiate between published and unpublished works, and consolidates the exceptions, allowing libraries and archives (and other cultural institutions) to make copies of copyright material for preservation purposes. These changes to the act will result in significant efficiencies for the Memorial in digital preservation and assist in unlocking orphan works for broader public use. 76 AUSTRALIAN WAR MEMORIAL ANNUAL REPORT 2016-2017 PORTFOLIO BUDGET STATEMENTS PERFORMANCE TARGET The number of visitors to the Research Centre's Reading Room. RESULT Met The Memorial's Research Centre continued to attract large numbers of visitors. 45,869 people visited the Reading Room during the period, approximately 12,000 more than in 2015-16, with 15,459 requests made for collection items. The increase in visitors can be attributed to a number of factors: the Family History Area volunteers were relocated into the Reading Room from their previous space adjacent to the Conflicts 1945 to today galleries; and a number of researchers are working on projects associated with significant anniversaries in 2018, particularly the centenary of the Armistice in November 2018.

The Memorial's annual history conference, 1916: the cost of attrition, was held at the Memorial from 20 to 22 July 2017, and was an outstanding success. The conference marked the centenary of major events of the First World War in 1916 and was framed by two significant commemorations at the Memorial: the centenary of the battle of Fromelles on 19 July 1916, and the centenary of the battle of Pozi\u00c3\u00a8res on 23 July 1916. The conference attracted 184 registrations, with attendees from schools and historical societies, veterans, ex-service organisations, universities, and museums. Over 100 conference delegates attended the welcome reception kindly hosted by the Ambassador of France, His Excellency M. Christophe Lecourtier, at the French Embassy Residence on the evening of 19 July 2017. The conference provided an absorbing program for a near-capacity audience, with a total of 18 speakers from the United Kingdom, Canada, New Zealand, and Australia. Highlights of the conference included the opening keynote address by Dr Tim Cook from the Canadian War Museum, who AUSTRALIAN WAR MEMORIAL ANNUAL REPORT 2016-2017 77 delivered an illuminating and challenging talk on the parallel experiences of Australia and Canada in the Great War, and divergences in national and popular memories. Delegates who attended the conference dinner in Anzac Hall were engaged by an address, 1916: brothers in arms, by First World War historian and author Dr Peter Pedersen who linked events on the Western Front in 1916 to the solidarity of soldiers of the British Empire and shared memories during commemorations on the former battlefields in 2016. The conference audience participated in question and answer sessions, and panel discussions produced some original and lively debate. The conference organisers received enthusiastic feedback from delegates and speakers, many of whom stated it was the best conference they had attended. For the first time since the Memorial's annual history conferences commenced in 1981, the conference was live-streamed online to encourage wider participation. The streaming reached some 300 unique viewers, with an average viewing duration of nearly 2.5 hours, most viewing more than one session at a time.

In accordance with its planned schedule, Council and the Finance, Audit, and Compliance Committee each met four times during the year. The Remuneration Committee and the Roll of Honour Committee each met once. The Chair of Council and the Director of the Memorial provided a briefing to the Minister for Veterans' Affairs after each meeting. The Memorial's senior management team met with senior representatives of the Department of Veterans' Affairs to discuss matters relevant to both parties. Through the process of Council and committee meetings, detailed papers and recommendations were presented by the Memorial's management. The major considerations and decisions undertaken by Council related to: \u00e2\u00a2 a program of events for the end of the centenary of the First World War \u00e2\u00a2 progress in relation to the Official history of Australian peacekeeping, humanitarian, and post-Cold War operations, the Official histories of East Timor, Iraq and Afghanistan, and the Independent history of the medical legacies of the Vietnam War \u00e2\u00a2 progress of the Spirit of Anzac Centenary Experience \u00e2\u00a2 further development of a Memorial Master Plan, including implementation of long-term storage solutions for the National Collection \u00e2\u00a2 development and implementation of a new branding position for the Memorial \u00e2\u00a2 implementation of a Digital Experience Framework and strategy. PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) continued as the Memorial's internal auditor.

A program of audits was approved by Council for the 2016-17 financial year and the outcomes of reviews undertaken were presented at each meeting. 82 AUSTRALIAN WAR MEMORIAL ANNUAL REPORT 2016-2017 INTERNAL OUTPUT PROGRAM COMPONENT 1.10 EXECUTIVE STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT Effective leadership and management of the Memorial in accordance with the requirements of the Australian War Memorial Act 1980. EXECUTIVE LEADERSHIP The Memorial's executive leadership and management framework includes a Corporate Management Group (CMG), consisting of the Director and three assistant directors; and a Senior Management Group (SMG) comprising all section heads and members of the CMG. During this past year, there were a number of important changes to SMG. Kristy Gosang commenced as acting Head of Finance on 29 August 2016, and Stephen Kay commenced as Head of Information Technology on 12 December 2016. Ms Gosang elected not to continue her contract with the Memorial, and Mr Chris Chapman, the Memorial's Manager Budgets and Financial Policy, has again stepped into the role of acting Head of Finance while the recruitment process is completed. The substantive Assistant Director of Corporate Services (ADCS), Ms Rhonda Adler, formally retired from her position in June 2017. Ms Leanne Patterson, who has been acting ADCS since 11 January 2016 while maintaining her responsibilities as Chief Finance Officer (CFO), has continued in role for the reporting period. At the time of preparing this report, a formal recruitment process was underway, the results of which will be reported in the 2017-18 Annual Report. The CMG meets weekly and considers a wide range of matters brought forward by its members or via papers from section heads. Quarterly reports are presented to monitor the Memorial's performance against a range of criteria. The CFO presents a set of financial statements on a regular basis and is able to provide direct advice to senior management. A corporate reserve was established to provide additional resources to deliver and support programs associated with the centenary period and other key commemorative activities. Funding from the general appropriation has been quarantined for this purpose. The Priority Projects Steering Group continues to have strategic oversight of a range of corporate priorities and programs, monitoring resource management, and project delivery against the key indicators of scope, budget schedule, quality, and risk. The Information Management Steering Group (IMSG) meets monthly and is key to determining the strategic direction of information management, information and communications technology (ICT), and web initiatives. This area of business continues to grow and underpins many of the Memorial's corporate objectives. The prioritisation of available resources is a major focus of IMSG. During 2016-17 the Memorial was granted additional funding of $6.4 million to modernise its IT capability. Program planning is underway for the implementation of this project over three years. The Assistant Director, National Collection, chairs the Reconciliation Action Plan (RAP) Working Group, which has produced the Memorial's Reflect RAP. The Reflect RAP is designed to identify and implement initiatives to help provide services to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander stakeholders, visitors, and users of our services. It provides a framework for further development of information resources and services, employment strategies, and engagement with the diversity of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander histories, cultures, and military service. The Memorial continued its efforts to secure corporate sponsorship and support through grants. A number of corporate sector partnerships have been secured or are in the process of being negotiated, including significant long-term partnerships with existing supporters such as Boeing, BAE Systems, Lockheed Martin, Qantas, Thales, RSL and Services Clubs RSL Victoria, and RSL Queensland. These organisations have partnered with the Memorial to deliver programs for Memorial visitors and students. Other individual supporters continue to provide financial support for the Memorial's projects and public programs. A full revenue generation report is at section 1.12 \"Revenue Generation\" commencing on page 91. The SMG meets weekly and is a forum for the exchange of information and discussion of corporate issues. Feedback from CMG and SMG meetings is provided to staff through weekly section meetings. In addition to weekly CMG meetings, a number of Project Control Groups (PCG) met on a monthly basis to monitor the performance of major projects. The focus of PCGs is to ensure projects are delivered according to their objectives, timeframes, and budgets. STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT The Memorial's strategic planning framework encourages participation by all staff, promoting the concept of one team working to achieve common goals and recognising the importance of communication and ownership of decisions. Annual business plans and accompanying budgets are developed to support Council directions and corporate plan priorities. Once developed, annual business plans influence AUSTRALIAN WAR MEMORIAL ANNUAL REPORT 2016-2017 83 The Memorial's activities could not be achieved without the dedication of staff and volunteers. The Voluntary Guides of the Australian War Memorial celebrated their 40th anniversary at a function in Anzac Hall. The Director, members of staff, and supporters took part in the 22 Pushup Challenge as part of a worldwide social media campaign marking the tragedy of suicide amongst the veteran community. The Vietnam Veterans Motorcycle Club stood proudly on the forecourt of the Memorial during their visit. 84 AUSTRALIAN WAR MEMORIAL ANNUAL REPORT 2016-2017 day-to-day operations. Achievements are monitored and reported quarterly to CMG and Council. RISK MANAGEMENT AND BUSINESS CONTINUITY PLANNING Fraud risk The Commonwealth Fraud Control Framework outlines the Australian Government's requirements for fraud control, including that government entities put in place a comprehensive fraud control program that covers prevention, detection, investigation, and reporting strategies. In January 2017 the Memorial undertook its triennial re-assessment of its fraud control framework. The resulting report and plan identified: \u00e2\u00a2 no risks above moderate \u00e2\u00a2 seven moderate risks \u00e2\u00a2 seven low risks \u00e2\u00a2 five very low risks Risks rated moderate to very low are managed within existing resources and are monitored and reported as part of the Memorials existing quarterly risk management framework. Business risk In October 2016 the Memorial undertook its triennial Business Risk Assessment. Senior management, with the assistance of PricewaterhouseCoopers, undertook a comprehensive analysis of the threats to the Memorial's ability to meet its objectives, and identified appropriate controls and mitigation strategies. Management of these key business risks have been incorporated into corporate and annual business planning processes. Progress against the proposed actions to address the high and significant risks are monitored by senior management and reported quarterly to Council. Risk benchmarking Each year the Memorial participates in Comcover's annual risk management benchmarking survey, which provides a basis to measure our performance against similar government agencies and identifies areas for possible improvement. In the March 2016 survey, the Memorial achieved an overall risk maturity rating of \"integrated\", which aligned with the results of the majority of Commonwealth agencies. The report also highlighted areas of potential improvement in the Memorial's overall risk management framework. In response, the existing risk management framework was reviewed and enhanced to incorporate current best-practice and risk management methodologies. A revised Director's Instruction was developed to consolidate various risk-related policies and documentation, and to inform staff of the organisation's underpinning appetite and tolerance in relation to the range of business risks. The results from the March 2017 survey, shows significant improvement in the Memorial's overall rating, moving from \"integrated\" to \"advanced\" as a result of the work undertaken since the 2016 survey. Evaluation and visitor research This year Evaluation and Visitor Research section completed a revision of the Memorial's domestic audience segmentation profile. Last undertaken in 2003, the psychographic study examines the existing and potential general public audience according to values, attitudes, and motivations. It provides an integrating framework for demographic and qualitative information collection in-house by the Memorial. Roy Morgan Research was engaged to perform this year's study. The study utilised focus groups, on-site exit surveying, a large online national survey, and current and retrospective profiling of the Memorial's exit surveys according to their proprietary profiling systems. The updated audience profile will be used to ensure that varying audience types are considered and targeted effectively through the variety of programs provided by the Memorial. The General Visitor Survey was conducted again in 2017. This year 725 respondents completed the survey as they exited the Memorial. The results set the benchmarking information used throughout this report. The section maintained its standard audience research priorities relating to caf\u00c3\u00a9 catering customer service survey; Big things in store; and exhibition evaluations. Summative surveys were concluded for the Mephisto: the devil's chariot temporary display and Reality in flames: modern Australian art and the Second World War special exhibition. A concept exploration survey was conducted for an exhibition on the consequences of war to inform the project team of visitor understanding and interests. The For Country, for Nation special exhibition exit survey commenced and is in progress for the duration of the exhibition. The combination of in-house studies and the external segmentation profile will help the Memorial to build on its strengths and overcome barriers to visitor engagement in the post centenary period. AUSTRALIAN WAR MEMORIAL ANNUAL REPORT 2016-2017 85 INTERNAL OUTPUT PROGRAM COMPONENT 1.11 RESOURCE MANAGEMENT Management of the Memorial's buildings and grounds, and its financial, human, and general service resources to the best advantage of external outputs. BUILDINGS AND SERVICES Buildings Energy management continues to be a priority for the Memorial, and technical initiatives have maintained efficient energy consumption on the site. The refinement of strategy for building climate control continues, with an emphasis on managing temperature and humidity parameters to meet the needs of collection material and energy efficiency. The Memorial partnered with ACTEW to conduct monitoring of the Building Management Control Systems in all buildings, with monthly performance reports on performance providing focus on maintenance and repair work for critical systems that are not operating as efficiently as their design and specifications allow. This project saw improved controls and collection storage conditions and highlighted several capital control upgrades required to provide ongoing energy savings. Replacement of fluorescent and conventional lighting with energy efficient bulbs and LED technologies was undertaken in the Campbell and Mitchell precincts, including a full upgrade to the Treloar C workshop high bay lighting, which is expected to produce additional savings and increased lighting levels. The next stage of the Mitchell Site Development Plan to determine long-term site development and corporate storage priorities for the Memorial's future growth and acquisitions has progressed. The concept design for the first stage large technology object storage building is well underway. The Memorial's Mitchell properties comprise land belonging to both the Australian Capital Territory and the Commonwealth, and discussions are underway to resolve any potential title issues which may impact the long-term redevelopment plans of the site. Major accommodation projects have been undertaken in Campbell and Mitchell. The design and construction of new secure office space to accommodate the official histories project was completed on the Campbell site, with staff relocated into the new accommodation from early December 2016. Several other projects were completed, including a new concrete path adjacent bus drop off on the east road, installation of a platform in the Commemorative Area to allow disabled access, and the upgrade to current standards of the Administration Building lift. Grounds Grounds maintenance contracts are managed to ensure outstanding grounds presentation at all times. Detailed grounds maintenance and horticulture contracts are managed separately to ensure professional services are delivered. A specialist gardener is contracted for garden maintenance of the Commemorative Area, Eastern Precinct, and memorials and sculptures throughout the Western Precinct, to ensure these locations are presented at a high standard. Additional underground electrical infrastructure for Anzac Day and Remembrance Day ceremonies was installed to improve the Memorial's ability to support audio-visual presentations and broadcast media involvement in on-site events. This work has reduced the potential risk to staff and visitors from accidents due to cables across roads and pathways. A regular maintenance regime for the Lone Pine tree (Pinus halepensis) continues to assist with its longevity, a replacement pine, grown from a seed taken from the original Lone Pine tree, was planted by Their Royal Highnesses The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge on Anzac Day 2014. It is anticipated that this tree will have grown to a suitable size when the original Lone Pine reaches senescence. The new tree is in a healthy state, and this is assisted by the fence and bird netting. The official opening and dedication of the Flanders Memorial Garden occurred in May and a new bronze dog water bowl was added to the explosive detection dogs' memorial, Elevation of the senses, in the Eastern Precinct. A major upgrade of the plantings around the Memorial's Administration Building was completed in early 2017, including rabbit-proofing of the garden bed and the rectification of concrete plinths around the building's fa\u00c3\u00a7ade. Planning for additional footpath behind Anzac Hall is underway to assist school group access, reduce slip hazards, and decrease the red gravel wash-off onto roads and into drains during heavy rain. Security Regular security risk reviews are undertaken to ensure a strengthened focus on Memorial security arrangements. Liaison with the Australian Federal Police (AFP) occurs for all high-profile visits and events. There is a particularly positive relationship with AFP (ACT Policing) for liaison, coordination, and the AFP's role in the Memorial's high-profile events and ceremonies such as Anzac Day and Remembrance Day. 86 AUSTRALIAN WAR MEMORIAL ANNUAL REPORT 2016-2017 Site vehicle access mitigation strategies and planning is underway in line with the Site Development Plan to include controls such as vehicle bollards and boulders. The upgrade of electronic security infrastructure continues. This includes closed circuit television (CCTV) and site lighting enhancements throughout the Memorial grounds. Proliferation of CCTV throughout the galleries and Memorial buildings continues. New baggage inspection and cloaking arrangements were introduced in May 2016. Inspections are conducted by security staff with a focus on the Main Building public entry points. The Emergency Planning Committee (EPC) met four times during 2016-17. Planning and conducting emergency evacuation drills for all Memorial buildings has continued, with improvements identified and implemented. Workshop services The Memorial's workshop supports a wide range of Memorial activities. Work this year included trades support for the For Country, for Nation, Home on a southern hill and The deceiving eye exhibits. Workshop staff were also responsible for the design and creation of the ceremonial soil boxes used in the dedication ceremony of the Flanders Memorial Garden, with the soil box for each state and territory of Australia made from timbers indigenous to that area. Each soil box was hand-crafted by our highly-skilled team of tradesmen. The Memorial's Workshop provides technical trades-based support and advice to all sections of the Memorial. The Workshop is also responsible for a wide range of building works, preparations for ceremonies, gallery maintenance, furniture construction, the installation of commemorative plaques and signage, and general building and grounds maintenance works. Records management Mail Room duties include records management, retrieval and rehousing of physical paper files, and the scanning of incoming mail. A review of records management processes and security risks has identified an opportunity to further centralise scanning of incoming mail. Mailroom and loading dock security is an ongoing focus, particularly in relation to potential security threats arising from incoming mail and deliveries. Development and review of mailroom policies and procedures ensures best practice mail tracking and receipt, while addressing security requirements. INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY Corporate systems The Information Technology (IT) section supports a broad range of information and communication technology-based systems underpinning operations such as administration; collection management; public access; gallery information and experience; retail; and online services. There is an excellent record of systems availability, achieved through dedicated attention to systems monitoring and timely, well-planned upgrades. Significant application and database changes were implemented for the Memorial website redevelopment project. This included a re-architecture of media storage to improve accessibility and maintenance, and a significant increase in data to improve search functionality. Continued support was provided for a number of initiatives associated with the centenary of the First World War, particularly in relation to the Last Post Ceremony, the Roll of Honour name projections, and Roll of Honour soundscapes. The year saw the conclusion of a project to upgrade the Digital Asset Management System (DAMS). The DAMS solution is a centralised repository for archival quality storage of digitised collection materials. The upgrade included the implementation of an out-of-the-box web client which reduced reliance on complex system customisations. Subsequent work has expanded the capability of the DAMS and introduced additional automated workflows to share information with the collection management system. The SharePoint-based electronic documents management system continues to support corporate information management and recordkeeping requirements. The system was further enhanced with additional workflows to transform paper-based approvals to digital processes to achieve organisational efficiencies and meet the implementation targets identified in the government's \"Digital Continuity 2020 Plan\". The retail system used by the Memorial's shop was upgraded. This included enhancements to the portable till, stocktake tools, and an upgrade of shop computers. The IT service management application was upgraded in order to maintain vendor support, technical currency, and integration compatibility. The upgrade enabled better system performance, reliability, and scalability. The section continues the upgrade and development of solutions to support management of the National Collection. These solutions support information management and enhance preservation, conservation and curatorial tasks, which enables the Memorial to make the collection and information accessible to the public. AUSTRALIAN WAR MEMORIAL ANNUAL REPORT 2016-2017 87 IT infrastructure The Information Technology section develops and maintains an in-house IT platform which supports its systems, including those referred to above. In addition to meeting the workload generated by the implementation or upgrade of system application projects, the infrastructure team also achieved the following: \u00e2\u00a2 Establishment of a security certified network and solution to support the IT requirements for the writing of the official history volumes relating to Australia's involvement in the conflicts of Iraq, Afghanistan, and East Timor. \u00e2\u00a2 Upgrade of hardware for recording and live streaming of the daily Last Post Ceremony.

This was following a review of our current internet infrastructure, and possible supply route changes for the Light Rail Project. Strategic planning and governance The Information Management Steering Group (IMSG) continues its oversight of information management, and IT strategy and policy. The Chief Information Officer (CIO) has represented the Memorial at meetings of the whole-of-government CIO forum and the Commonwealth Managers Forum on IT. FINANCE Financial planning and monitoring The Memorial has a well-established internal budget development and management process which ensures corporate priorities are funded to an appropriate level. Many new projects and activities related to the centenary of the First World War were funded from an internal reserve, with potential allocations forecast over several years to ensure adequate resourcing during the centenary period 2014-18. Funding strategies were also developed for a range of capital projects planned over the next ten years, including National Collection storage, gallery refurbishments, building works, site development, software upgrades, and IT hardware replacement. Regular financial reporting to senior management, Council, and the Department of Finance throughout the year included Memorial-wide financial results, budget review and analysis, cash balance reporting, capital management planning, and commercial operations. Financial policy The Head of Finance and the Chief Finance Officer (CFO) continued to participate in the development of whole-of-government reforms through developing input to key discussion papers and consultation processes, including review of valuation methodology for heritage and cultural assets. The CFO was also involved in activities to ensure that funding strategies for major projects and programs are achieved, including resource planning and forecasting for projects associated with collection development and long-term accommodation and storage needs. HUMAN RESOURCES Strategic people management/workforce planning The Memorial has identified the following strategic workforce priorities: \u00e2\u00a2 alignment of people and our business through positive performance culture \u00e2\u00a2 promoting organisational health and wellbeing \u00e2\u00a2 building leadership and management capability \u00e2\u00a2 attracting and retaining the right people \u00e2\u00a2 encouraging innovation and agility. Workforce planning continues to evolve within the Memorial to build and sustain a diverse workforce. This will deliver current and future business objectives and provide greater opportunity to attract, develop, and retain skilled, engaged, and committed employees. Critical capability gaps are being 88 AUSTRALIAN WAR MEMORIAL ANNUAL REPORT 2016-2017 identified to enable the development of tailored strategies to assist in mitigating future workforce risk. This will lead to greater linkages and alignment with business to achieve the Memorial's strategic objectives. Workforce development The Memorial fosters a culture of professional development and continuous learning in building capability, capacity, and bench strength for the future. Initiatives for 2017 included the continuation of: \u00e2\u00a2 a Leadership Development Program for leaders at the APS5-EL1 levels. The program provides leaders with a common language and understanding in fostering a culture of high performance and of staff being more fully engaged. The cohort structure of representatives from each business section supports networking and cross collaboration. \u00e2\u00a2 \"Learnhub\", the Memorial's online e-learning program where all staff can participate in a diverse range of training by participating in or registering to attend in-house face-to-face training. \u00e2\u00a2 specialist training programs, conferences and seminars continue to be a hallmark of the annual Learning and Development Plan in supporting the development of the range of expertise required within the Memorial. \u00e2\u00a2 accreditations provide currency in licensing and skills required for the job. \u00e2\u00a2 the Memorial's Studies Assistance Scheme continues to provide support to staff enabling them to undertake formal qualifications relevant to their expertise and career progression. People management and services Work is currently underway on improving and simplifying the annual performance assessment process, with focus on embedding regular feedback between staff and managers. The Workplace Relations Committee met regularly throughout the year and continues to be an important forum for staff consultation and policy development. Enterprise bargaining concluded in May 2017 with the majority of staff supporting a new agreement for approval by the Fair Work Commission in June 2017. The Memorial Security Team was presented with certificates in Government Security by senior members of the Attorney General's Department.

AUSTRALIAN WAR MEMORIAL ANNUAL REPORT 2016-2017 91 INTERNAL OUTPUT PROGRAM COMPONENT 1.12 REVENUE GENERATION Generation of revenue in support of the Memorial's mission and purpose. MEMORIAL SHOP Memorial Shop revenue was $2,072,158 in 2016-17 against a target of $1,855,488. Net profit was $492,798, compared to last year's $454,265, before notional overhead costs. Wage to sales, a key metric of retail performance, finished this year at 27 per cent, compared to 31 per cent in the previous year. Cost of goods finished flat on last year. Combined transactional activity for the shop and Orientation Gallery totalled 116,943, with the shop's average sale decreasing $0.57 to $20.62, driven by an increase in sales of lower-priced items. Net operating profit percentage finished at 24 per cent, compared to 21 per cent in the previous year. This was achieved by benchmarking the shop's operations to external retailers, training staff in retail metrics, and changing the supply chain to more economical suppliers. The majority of sales were merchandise developed by the Memorial and items produced under license with other suppliers, including the Royal Australian Mint and Australia Post. The centenary range included: \u00e2\u00a2 2017 medallion featuring a prominent image of troops on the Western Front \u00e2\u00a2 limited edition Digger bear \u00e2\u00a2 circulating and non-circulating coins commemorating key events in Australian military history \u00e2\u00a2 apparel and souvenir products featuring the Memorial's centenary logo. The Memorial expanded on its core range of products around the military services, poppy range, and educational items for school groups. The Memorial launched a number of publications, including The Good neighbour: Australian peace support operations in the Pacific Islands 1980-2006 by Bob Breen, One woman's war and peace by Sharon Bown, Fighting monsters by Richard Braithwaite, High in the sunlit silence by Tony Vine, and Secret code-breakers of central bureau: how Australia's signals-intelligence network helped win the Pacific war by David Dufty. Memorial souvenir publications sold through the Orientation Gallery and Memorial Shop, including an updated A place to remember, Hall of Memory, and Australian War Memorial guide book, all sold well. E-BUSINESS The Memorial's e-business revenue for 2016-17 was $1,029,570 (including the value of waivers and stock received free of charge) against a target of $1,072,497. Revenue is generated from: \u00e2\u00a2 costs associated with reproductions from the National Collection \u00e2\u00a2 user fees associated with commercial use of the material \u00e2\u00a2 the value of fees waived for use of materials for educational, private, or commemorative purposes \u00e2\u00a2 Memorial Shop products sold online. BEQUESTS AND PARTNERSHIPS The Memorial, like most cultural institutions, supplements its government budget allocation with partnership and fundraising programs. These programs aim to assist the Memorial to engage in new and innovative approaches to telling the stories of those who have served our nation. During this reporting period, the Memorial sought support to deliver a number of new and existing activities, publications, and exhibitions. To assist in this process, the Memorial has launched a focused, strategic program of partnership and fundraising activity, the Giving Campaign, focused on bequests and major gifts. During the reporting period, the Memorial generated $13,018,049 in partnerships, major donations, and bequests.

This is a common output that recognises the importance of promoting teamwork to achieve corporate priorities. The Performance Assessment Framework is a key strategy for ensuring individual work plans are aligned with the Memorial's business plan. This year saw the introduction of the Memorial's staff rewards and recognition program. Each month all staff are invited to nominate individuals or teams for their outstanding efforts and contribution. Each branch's achievements are recognised in each work group and shared with staff through regular updates. Regular senior management and section meetings continue to provide vehicles for effective communication across the Memorial. All-staff meetings are held periodically to provide updates from senior management on key strategic issues and major project developments. Specialist committees such as Workplace Relations; Work Health and Safety; Exhibition Planning; Emergency Planning and Evacuation; and Environment and Energy are essential forums for addressing cross-branch matters of importance. The Memorial's Employee Assistance Program, which provides counselling and support to staff and their immediate families, was accessed by a small number of staff. The majority of matters referred to this service continue to be of a non-work related nature. One indicator of the effectiveness of teamwork at the Memorial is the willingness of staff to contribute to major events such as Anzac Day and Remembrance Day on a voluntary basis. The involvement of staff is fundamental to the success of those events. This cross-organisational support is good for building teamwork across all areas of the Memorial. The German tank \"Mephisto\" leaves Anzac Hall after two years at the Australian War Memorial. The Memorial's successful collaboration with the Queensland Museum involved the cooperation of team members from throughout the Memorial. 94 AUSTRALIAN WAR MEMORIAL ANNUAL REPORT 2016-2017 The Menin Gate Lions, originally given to Australia in 1936, returned to stand on the bridge in front of the Menin Gate as part of First World War centenary commemorations. 95 ENABLING LEGISLATION The Australian War Memorial is established as a corporation by the Australian War Memorial Act 1980 (the Act).

The Memorial does not administer any legislation or have any appropriation directly related to the principles of environmental sustainability and development. Energy consumption Monitoring of the energy produced by the Memorial is conducted by the Building and Services section and reported quarterly to the Energy and Environment Committee. Consumption of electricity and gas is monitored closely and remains close to trend. The refinement of the control strategy for building climate control continues, with an emphasis on managing temperature and humidity parameters to efficiently achieve material conservation and energy efficiency needs. The Memorial partnered with ACTEW to conduct monitoring of the Building Management Control Systems in all buildings, with monthly performance reports providing focus on maintenance and repair work for critical systems that are not operating as efficiently as their design and specifications allow. This project saw improved controls and collection storage conditions and highlighted several capital control upgrades required to provide ongoing energy savings. Building refurbishments and enhanced external lighting upgrades conducted in 2016-17 have included the installation of LED light technologies which provide electricity and maintenance savings to the Memorial while enhancing safety. The replacement of the original mercury vapour high bay lights with LED lighting in the Memorial's Mitchell workshop has improved the light levels for sensitive restoration works, and will achieve a reduction in energy usage by more than 50 per cent. Water management Water consumption is monitored closely and any anomalies are promptly investigated and addressed. The Memorial is committed to continual lifecycle improvement for irrigation infrastructure utilising the latest technology to control and monitor consumption. The Memorial proactively manages the watering of gardens and grounds by scheduling irrigation according to seasonal changes and rainfall. Water saving measures are implemented for new building infrastructure, for example, improved irrigation control systems with leak detection and rain shut-off sensors; and upgrading to more efficient air-conditioning equipment including chillers, cooling towers, and humidifiers. Such measures water consumption and contribute to environmental sustainability. Waste management Waste management is reported to address and target waste awareness. The Memorial uses dedicated waste streams, comingled recycling, cardboard, classified, and general waste to reduce landfill. The introduction of follow-me-printing on all printers during the reporting period has led to quantifiable savings. Recycling of small cell batteries is ongoing at the Campbell and Mitchell sites, further extending the Memorial's commitment to being environmentally responsible. Wherever possible, the Memorial is committed to recycling waste produced from its sites. Non-general waste such as chemicals, paints, and solvents, are managed and disposed of appropriately by licenced service providers. Heritage management The Memorial's endorsed Heritage Management Plan guides management of the Memorial's heritage precinct. When required, heritage specialists provide advice regarding proposed building works in heritage-sensitive areas. Bird-deterrent installations around the Main Building continue to be refined and assessed for effectiveness. Maintenance of the Memorial building fabric is ongoing, including minor repairs to stonework and the implementation of a regular stonework-cleaning regime. Other general heritage conservation activities include regular conservation and cleaning of key sculptural elements. Before Anzac Day a major clean of sculptures and plinths was undertaken, the stonework in the Commemorative Area was re-grouted, and Parade Ground steps were cleaned. Improvements to the way-finding and presentation of the Commemorative Roll were completed late 2016. In order to assist with its longevity, regular maintenance of the Lone Pine tree (Pinus halepensis) continues. The new Lone Pine tree, planted by Their Royal Highnesses The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge on Anzac Day 2014, remains in a healthy state, assisted by fencing and bird netting. The new tree has already outgrown the original bird netting framework which will be enhanced next year as the tree grows. It is anticipated that this tree will have developed significantly when the original tree reaches senescence. WORKPLACE HEALTH AND SAFETY The Memorial is committed to safeguarding the health and safety of its employees, workers, and visitors by providing and maintaining a safe working environment. The Memorial aims to eliminate all preventable work-related injuries and illnesses through systematic risk management. The Memorial is committed to supporting and promoting the holistic wellbeing of its employees. The Memorial's work health and safety (WHS) function is managed through Human Resources, with assistance from a WHS Manager and WHS Advisor who provide advice AUSTRALIAN WAR MEMORIAL ANNUAL REPORT 2016-2017 99 to the WHS committee, assist with hazard and incident investigations and case management, and provide relevant training. This year the Memorial's workers compensation premium has seen a 31.7 per cent reduction. Factors driving this include early intervention programs, reduced claim numbers and costs, and the improved overall performance of the Comcare scheme. During the year, the Memorial's Rehabilitation Management System (RMS) was audited by Comcare. Areas for improvement are integrated into the annual Early Intervention, Rehabilitation and Workers Compensation Plan. In accordance with Schedule 2, Part 4 of the Work Health and Safety Act 2011 (WHS Act), the Memorial is required to provide details of the following matters in its annual report: Initiatives and programs A range of WHS initiatives and programs were conducted in the reporting period, including: \u00e2\u00a2 introduction of hazard labelling for the National Collection, enabling staff to identify the hazard profile of items and implement appropriate safe handling controls \u00e2\u00a2 continued growth of online information resources to help staff understand their responsibilities under the WHS Act, including child safety, electrical safety, inspection programs, and hazardous materials management \u00e2\u00a2 providing staff with appropriate training to support visitor emotion and distress \u00e2\u00a2 fostering a happy, healthy, and resilient workforce with delivery of a \"creating a positive workplace culture\" seminar for staff \u00e2\u00a2 significant uptake of voluntary flu vaccination programs for staff and volunteers \u00e2\u00a2 promotion of the Employment Assistance Program \u00e2\u00a2 implementation of a Domestic and Family Violence awareness policy to support staff \u00e2\u00a2 a Comcare briefing to Senior Management to explain premium results and enhance understanding of factors driving performance and trends \u00e2\u00a2 implementation of staff training workshops related to chemical handling and risk management, weapons handling, and disaster recovery for the National Collection. The Work Health and Safety Committee meets four times per year and assists the Memorial in developing, implementing, and reviewing measures designed to protect the health and safety of workers and visitors. The committee is made up of worker and management representatives, and provides a key consultation mechanism in accordance with relevant legislation. First aid officers are located throughout the Memorial buildings to ensure immediate assistance is available when required. Emergency response support includes cardiac defibrillators being available at both the Campbell and Mitchell sites. The Memorial has a zero tolerance approach to bullying and harassment, and has a number of contacts available should an employee or manager require advice regarding an instance of bullying or harassment. Contacts include trained HR professionals, harassment contact officers across all business areas, and the Employee Assistance Program. The Memorial addresses formal and informal allegations of bullying or harassment promptly and sensitively. The Memorial maintains a positive reporting culture. During 2016, 334 incidents were reported related to visitors, staff, contractors, and hazards. Visitor incidents are the area of highest frequency and continue to be less than 1 per cent of total visitor numbers. Visitor incidents are showing a downward trend. Initiatives and outcomes Risk reduction strategies implemented during 2016-17 included an enhanced focus on slip, trip, and fall incidents. This resulted in installation of a platform to the Commemorative Area, application of non-slip edging to steps and stairs, increased lighting levels, and enhanced workplace inspection programs. Success of these initiatives is shown with the rate of incidents trending downward for visitors and staff. Investigations and WHS Act Part 10 notices During 2016-17, one incident was reported to Comcare that met the notifiable incident provisions of the WHS Act. This incident related to a worker sustaining an electric shock from a power point. Comcare did not investigate this incident. The table below includes a summary of notifiable incident numbers and investigations for the past three years. There were no notices issued to the Memorial under Part 10 of the WHS Act.

Revenue from rendering of services is recognised by reference to the stage of completion of contracts at the reporting date. The stage of completion of contracts at the reporting date is determined by reference to the proportion that costs incurred to date bear to the estimated total costs of the transaction. Receivables for goods and services, which have 30 day terms, are recognised at the nominal amounts due less any impairment allowance account. Collectability of debts is reviewed at end of the reporting period. Allowances are made when collectability of the debt is no longer probable. Accounting Policy Interest revenue is recognised using the effective interest method as set out in AASB 139 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement. Accounting Policy Sponsorship Project-specific sponsorship funding which meets the requirements of a contribution in accordance with AASB 1004 Contributions is recorded as revenue when the Memorial obtains control of the contribution or right to receive the contribution, it is probable that the economic benefits comprising the contribution will flow to the Memorial, and the amount can be measured reliably.

All revaluations were conducted in accordance with the revaluation policy stated at Note 2.2A. Independent valuers conducted revaluations of heritage and cultural assets and property, plant and equipment, effective 30 June 2017. The Memorial has entered into net future commitments for the acquisition of buildings, heritage and cultural, plant and equipment, exhibition and intangible assets of $4,735,496 (2015-16; $3,438,000). Significant individual commitments relate to the National Collection, with commitments for fees, until 2063, for a cold storage facility to stabilise nitrate film ($1,521,000), sculpture commissions ($690,000) and commitments associated with the writing of the independent history of the medical legacies of the Vietnam War which will be accessioned into the National Collection when completed ($485,100). No indicators of impairment were found for non-financial assets. 118 AUSTRALIAN WAR MEMORIAL ANNUAL REPORT 2016-2017 Accounting Policy Assets are recorded at cost on acquisition except as stated below. The cost of acquisition includes the fair value of assets transferred in exchange and liabilities undertaken. Non-financial assets are initially measured at their fair value plus transaction costs where appropriate. Assets acquired at no cost, or for nominal consideration, are initially recognised as assets and income at their fair value at the date of acquisition. Significant donated Heritage and Cultural (Collection) assets are recognised at the time of acquisition, and other donated collection items are brought to account at the time of revaluation. Asset Recognition Threshold Purchases of property, plant and equipment are recognised initially at cost in the statement of financial position, except for purchases costing less than $2,000, which are expensed in the year of acquisition (other than where they form part of a group of similar items which are significant in total). The initial cost of an asset includes an estimate of the cost of dismantling and removing the item and restoring the site on which it is located. Revaluations Following initial recognition at cost, property, plant and equipment are carried at fair value less subsequent accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses. Valuations are conducted with sufficient frequency to ensure that the carrying amounts of assets did not differ valuations depended upon the volatility of movements in market values for the relevant assets. Revaluation adjustments are made on a class basis. Any revaluation increment is credited to equity under the heading of asset revaluation reserve except to the extent that it reverses a previous revaluation decrement of the same asset class that was previously recognised in the surplus/deficit. Revaluation decrements for a class of assets are recognised directly in the surplus/deficit except to the extent that they reverse a previous revaluation increment for that class. Any accumulated depreciation as at the revaluation date is eliminated against the gross carrying amount of the asset and the asset restated to the revalued amount. Depreciation Depreciable property, plant and equipment assets are written-off to their estimated residual values over their estimated useful lives to the entity using, in all cases, the straight-line method of depreciation. Depreciation rates (useful lives), residual values and methods are reviewed at each reporting date and necessary adjustments are recognised in the current, or current and future reporting periods, as appropriate. Depreciation rates applying to each class of depreciable asset are based on the following useful lives: 2017 Years 2016 Years Buildings and building improvements 1 to 162 1 to 162 Plant and equipment 1 to 50 1 to 48 Exhibitions 1 to 20 2 to 20 AUSTRALIAN WAR MEMORIAL ANNUAL REPORT 2016-2017 119 Impairment All assets were assessed for impairment at 30 June 2017. Where indications of impairment exist, the recoverable amount is less than its carrying amount. The recoverable amount of an asset is the higher of its fair value less costs of disposal and its value in use. Value in use is the present value of the future cash flows expected to be derived from the asset. Where the future economic benefit of an asset generate future cash flows, and the asset would be replaced if the entity were deprived of the asset, its value in use is taken to be its depreciated replacement cost. Derecognition An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised upon disposal or when no further future economic benefits are expected from its use or disposal. Significant accounting judgements and estimates The fair value of land and buildings is considered to be the market value of similar assets, taking into account the heritage aspects of the buildings where appropriate, and using depreciated replacement cost if no active market is identified. Heritage and Cultural (Collection) assets The Memorial's collection of heritage and cultural assets comprises a wide range of objects relating to Australia's military history, including but not limited to: Works of art (various media) Film Large technology objects Audio Military heraldry and technology items Photographs Official and private records Ephemera Pursuant to section 8 of the Australian War Memorial Act 1980, the Memorial has the authority to dispose of heritage and cultural items which are not required as part of the National Collection, or are unfit for inclusion. Section 8 of the Australian War Memorial Act 1980 dictates the appropriate approvals to dispose of National Collection assets. The decision whether or not to acquire or retain an item for the National Collection is based on two criteria: 1. Assessment to establish that the item is of significance to Australian military history. 2. Assessment that the benefit and resource implications of acquiring or retaining the item are acceptable. The evaluation process ensures that the history and provenance of objects is recorded at the time of acquisition and records the significance of the item to the Australian community, provides a systematic assessment of the values of objects against the existing collection and other collecting institutions, and assists in settling priorities for collection management and conservation resources. The Memorial's Collection Development Plan for heritage and cultural assets can be found at: https://www.awm.gov.au/sites/default/files/collection_development_plan.pdf The Memorial's preservation and curatorial policies for heritage and cultural assets can be found at: https://www.awm.gov.au/about/our-work/projects/conservation 120 AUSTRALIAN WAR MEMORIAL ANNUAL REPORT 2016-2017 Revaluations Heritage and Cultural (Collection) Assets are carried at fair value, which is measured at depreciated replacement cost or market selling price (for items where a market exists). Following initial recognition at cost, Heritage and Cultural (Collection) Assets are carried at fair value less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses. Valuations are conducted with sufficient frequency such that the carrying amounts of assets do not differ materially from the assets' fair values at the reporting date. The regularity of independent valuations depends upon the volatility of movements in market values for the relevant assets. Depreciation All Heritage and Cultural (Collection) Assets are written off over their estimated useful life to the Memorial using the straight-line method of depreciation. Depreciation rates (useful lives) have been estimated based on the condition and physical composition of items in each sub-class, and range from 5 to 600 years. Rates and methods are reviewed at each reporting date and necessary adjustments are recognised in the current, or current and future reporting periods, as appropriate. Significant accounting judgements and estimates The fair value of Heritage and Cultural (Collection) Assets is considered to be market selling price (where such a market exists), or depreciated replacement cost, taking into consideration the intrinsic value of historically significant objects. Owing to the size of the National Collection, a representative sample of major categories is selected and valued, and the results are used to determine a total fair value. Intangibles The Memorial's intangibles comprise purchased software, which are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses. Software is amortised on a straight-line basis over its anticipated useful life. The useful lives range from 1 to 11 years (2016: 2 to 10 years). All software assets were assessed for indications of impairment as at 30 June 2017.

From 2010-11 the Government introduced net cash appropriation arrangements where revenue appropriations for the National Collection depreciation expenses ceased. The Memorial now receives a separate capital budget provided through equity appropriations. Accounting Policy The Memorial holds inventory for sale only, and this is reported at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Costs incurred in bringing each item of inventory to its present location and condition are assigned as follows: . stores average purchase cost; and . finished goods and work-in-progress cost of direct materials and labour plus attributable costs that are capable of being allocated on a reasonable basis. Inventories acquired at no cost or at nominal consideration are initially measured at current replacement cost at the date of acquisition. 122 AUSTRALIAN WAR MEMORIAL ANNUAL REPORT 2016-2017 4.1 Employee Provisions 2017 2016 4.1A: Employee Provisions Leave 8,978 8,217 Total employee provisions 8,978 8,217 Accounting policy Liabilities for short-term employee benefits and termination benefits expected within twelve months of the end of reporting period are measured at their nominal amounts. Other long-term employee benefits are measured as the present value of the estimated future cash outflows to be made in respect of services provided by employees up to the reporting date. Leave The liability for employee benefits includes provision for annual leave and long service leave. No provision has been made for sick leave as all sick leave is non-vesting and the average sick leave taken in future years by employees of the Memorial is estimated to be less than the annual entitlement for sick leave. applied at the time the leave is taken, including the Memorial's employer superannuation contribution rates to the extent that the leave is likely to be taken during service rather than paid out on termination. The liability for long service leave is recognised and measured at the net present value of the estimated future cash flows to be made in respect of all employees at reporting date. In determining the present value of the liability, including related on-costs, attrition rates and pay increases through promotion and inflation have been taken into account. Separation and Redundancy Provision is made for separation and redundancy benefit payments. The Memorial recognises a provision for termination when it has developed a detailed formal plan for the terminations and has informed those employees affected that it will carry out the terminations. Superannuation The Memorial's staff are members of the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme (CSS), the Public Sector Superannuation Scheme (PSS), or the PSS accumulation plan (PSSap), or other superannuation funds held outside the Australian Government. The CSS and PSS are defined benefit schemes for the Australian Government. The PSSap is a defined contribution scheme.

The Memorial has determined the key management personnel to be the Director, Chairman, Council Members and Assistant Directors. Key management personnel remuneration is reported in the table below: The total number of key management personnel that are included in the above table is 19. They include the Chairman and members of Council and senior executive personnel. (2016: 19). When senior executives are on extended leave, or act for the Director, their positions are back-filled. The above figures include payments made to staff acting in senior executive positions. 1. The above key management personnel remuneration excludes the remuneration and other benefits of the Portfolio Minister. The Portfolio Minister's remuneration and other benefits are set by the Remuneration Tribunal and are not paid by the Memorial. The Memorial makes employer contributions to the employees' defined benefit superannuation scheme at rates determined by an actuary to be sufficient to meet the current cost to the Government. The Memorial accounts for the contributions as if they were contributions to defined contribution plans. The liability for superannuation recognised as at 30 June represents outstanding contributions for the final fortnight of the quarter. In line with the government's 'Stronger Super' reforms, the Memorial has completed a software upgrade to meet compliance obligations under SuperStream. Accounting judgements and estimates Employee provisions includes an estimation component in respect of long-term employee benefits measured as the present value of estimated future cash outflows. This accounting estimate has been identified to have minimal risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amount of the provision in the next accounting period. 124 AUSTRALIAN WAR MEMORIAL ANNUAL REPORT 2016-2017 Transactions with related parties: 5.1 Contingent Assets and Liabilities Contingent assets and liabilities are not recognised in the statement of financial position but contingent assets are disclosed when settlement is probable but not virtually certain and contingent liabilities are disclosed when settlement is greater than remote.

The Memorial has relied on valuation models provided by these valuers and external actuaries. The Memorial tests the procedures of the valuation model at least once every 12 months. identical or similar items through recorded auction sales, catalogues and known private collections. Significant increases (decreases) in any of those inputs in isolation would result in a significantly higher (lower) fair value measurement. Generally, a change in the assumption used for professional appraisals of similar iconic items is accompanied by a directionally similar change in the assumption used for private sales of similar iconic items. No assets were transferred between Levels 1 and 2 during the reporting period. The highest and best use of all non-financial assets is the same as their current use. 128 AUSTRALIAN WAR MEMORIAL ANNUAL REPORT 2016-2017 6.1 Assets Held in Trust 6.1A: Florance Foundation Trust Fund - monetary asset 2017 2016 Donations and bequests As at 1 July 21 21 Receipts - - Payments - - Total as at 30 June 21 21 Total monetary assets held in trust 21 21 6.1B: Australian War Memorial Krait Fund - monetary asset 2017 2016 Donations and bequests As at 1 July 41 41 Receipts 1 1 Payments (1) (1) Total as at 30 June 41 41 Total monetary assets held in trust 41 41 The following monies are not available for other purposes of the Memorial and are not recognised in the financial statements.
