In Memorium Lawrence Goldman, PhD, Emeritus Professor, Department of Physiology The Department of Physiology regrets the passing of Emeritus Professor, Dr. [Lawrence Goldman](http://medschool.umaryland.edu/facultyresearchprofile/viewprofile.aspx?id=90), on November 28, 2016. Dr. Goldman earned his BS in Chemistry and Physics from Tufts University in 1958. He received his PhD degree in Zoology and Biophysics at UCLA in 1964. From 1964 to 1965, he obtained postdoctoral training in the Department of Neurology, College of Physicians and Surgeons at Columbia University in New York, before accepting a position as Assistant Professor in the Department of Zoology at the University of Maryland, College Park in 1965. In 1967, he joined the University of Maryland School of Medicine as an Assistant Professor in the Department of Biophysics (later incorporated into the Department of Physiology). Dr. Goldman rose through the ranks to become Associate Professor with Tenure in 1970 and Professor in 1977. Dr. Goldman was also a Fulbright Senior Professor at the University of Saarlandes in Homburg, Germany, from 1987 to 1988. Over his 41 year career at UM SOM, Dr. Goldman and his trainees made major contributions to our understanding of the ways in which ion channels open and close, particularly those gated by the voltage across the cell membrane. His research career was focused on the study of the fundamental physical mechanisms underlying generation and conduction of the action potential- the electrical unit of information flow in the nervous system. Among his many scientific contributions, Dr. Goldman provided experimental evidence explaining the proportionality between action potential conduction velocity and the square root of fiber diameter in nerve fibers. He also made significant contributions to our understanding of the biological underpinnings of the mathematical descriptions of ion channel gating made by Alan Hodgkin and Andrew Huxley in their Nobel Prize-winning work. Dr. Goldman's contributions to our understanding of membrane biophysics have been widely recognized by his peers, as demonstrated by the many invited presentations of his work he made around the world. He will be missed by his colleagues in the Department of Physiology and the University of Maryland School of Medicine.

The Glaser Prize was established to honor Dr. Edmund Glaser when he retired from the Department of Physiology. Dr. Glaser and his colleague, Dr. Hendrick Van der Loos, made a seminal contribution in the 1960's by creating the first computer-assisted neuron reconstruction system - Neurolucida. He went on to found a company, MBF Bioscience, to further develop and market software for neuroscience imaging in 1988. The prize is awarded annually for the most visually attractive scientific image submitted by a student working in the laboratory of a faculty member in the Department of Physiology.
